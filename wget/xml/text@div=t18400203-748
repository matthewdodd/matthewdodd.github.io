                  </hi>. I live at Mayland Point, Stratford. I have some work in Francis-street—I had a saw there—I worked with it on the 8th of January, and left it there, at four o'clock in the afternoon, for a quarter of an hour—I went to a public-house, and saw the prisoner there—he left the room directly I came in, and was absent five or ten minutes—next day, when I went to work, I missed my taw, not having wanted it before—I found the prisoner at the Half Moon public-house, West Ham, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am headborough of Stratford. The prisoner was given into my custody on Saturday, the 11th—I told him he was charged with stealing Philip Hibble's saw, and asked what he had done with it; had he pawned it or sold it—he said he had pawned it at Bow, and would take me there—he took me to Cheese's, where I found it—he said he took it from distress—I found seven duplicates on him, three of them for stolen goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I did not tell him where it was pawned; he told me where it was, and what it was pawned for. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He was discharged the same night as the saw was found—the servant who took it in is not here—I got the saw from Cheese in the prisoner's presence, and in the presence of the man who took it in, but on Monday the shopman had left Cheese—I did not find the duplicate of the saw on the prisoner—he said he had buried it in the ground, but he did not know where—the shopman said, in the prisoner's hearing, that he was the man that pawned it, and he made no reply.</p>

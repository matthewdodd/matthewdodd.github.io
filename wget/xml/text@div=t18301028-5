            . I am a clerk in the public drawing office in the Bank of England. On the 8th of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner appeared at the counter of the office, with an East India Court warrant in his hand, and presented it for payment; this is the paper which he brought, (looking at it)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280006"></xptr>- I marked it with my initials, by which I can speak to it - I first requested him, as is usual, to write his name and address on the back; he then left me and went to a side desk, and brought it back to me - I observed that the address on the warrant was wet; the name appeared to have been written before - upon his handing it to me, I asked him how he would receive it? he said, in cash - on my looking at the signatures, I suspected their being genuine, and inquired of him from whom he had brought it; he said he was deputed by Mr. Goodhall, the clerk of the office, to receive it on his behalf - Goodhall is one of the parties to whom it is payable; suspecting the signatures, I thought it my duty to bring it under the notice of the chief officer of our department, Mr. Bryant - he examined it in my presence, and compared the signature of Mr. Mortimer, which we have in a book for comparison, the same as bankers have; Mr. Bryant observed to the prisoner, that the signature of Mr. Mortimer, in particular, rather differed from his usual signature - the prisoner replied that Mr. Mortimer had lately been very unwell; Mr. Bryant then felt it his duty to take the document to the chief cashier of the house - he left for that purpose: I remained in company with the prisoner during his absence - he began to express some impatience at being delayed; it might be twenty minutes or half an hour before Mr. Bryant returned - the prisoner offered to produce a clerk of the house to identify him as coming from the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you infer symptoms of impatience, or did he express any impatience? A. He did; he said it was very unusual to detain him in that manner; he could not conceive the reason, and buttoning up his coat, he said, "I cannot possibly be delayed in this way; you must get the cash ready, and I will call again." When he offered to produce a clerk from the East India-house, I told him the document being in the hands of the principal of the office, I could not give him an answer, and he must wait Mr. Bryant's return - after observing that he should leave and call again, I told him from the circumstance of the document being under investigation, he must not entertain an idea of leaving till he had an answer from the principal - shortly after this Mr. Ormes, who bad gone away by Mr. Bryant's desire, returned with Mr. Goodhall, in whose favour the document is drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Bryant directed Ormes to go and make inquiry, in the prisoner's hearing? A. I cannot say - he brought Mr. Goodhall, and in the prisoner's presence Mr. Ormes told Mr. Goodhall the prisoner was the person who had presented the warrant in his name; Mr. Goodhall looked very gravely at him, and said he did not know him - he shook his head, and said he scarcely knew him; the prisoner then addressing himself to Mr. Goodhall, begged to be allowed to depart, and said to Mr. Goodhall, "If you proceed against me, you will ruin me." I then left them, and went to the chief cashier's office, and found Mr. Bryant there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. I have no recollection of having ever seen him - I disputed all the signatures to the warrant; I knew the hand-writing of Mr. Astell and the other gentlemen purporting to sign it - the signatures are very close resemblances.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the drawing-office; I am the deputy principal in the office - Mr. Bryant is principal. On the 8th of October I remember the prisoner coming there - I did not hear the conversation between him and Evans in the first instance; I remember the paper being referred to Mr. Bryant, and then overheard Mr. Bryant question the prisoner as to the rectitude of the signatures; I suggested to Mr. Bryant, privately, the propriety of my going to the East India Company's warehouse, to know if Mr. Goodhall had authorised any body to receive that sum of money; the prisoner could not hear this suggestion - I went to the East India-house, and brought Mr. Goodhall back, and on confronting the prisoner with him, I said, "This is the person, Mr. Witham, who has presented the document," and asked if he knew him - Mr. Goodhall immediately disclaimed having seen him before, or having any knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to call him Mr. Witham? A. That name had been written on the back of the document; the prisoner then confessed that it was a forgery - his words were "I confess it is a forgery - I am ruined, and if the document can be destroyed, I would leave by the mail tonight, leave London, and never be seen again;" I then introduced Mr. Goodhall to the chief cashier - the prisoner remained in front of the office: I returned to him, and begged him to take a seat in the office, and there he remained till he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he give you any account of the state in which he was? A. No.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. As far as you can form a judgment, do you believe all the signatures purporting to authenticate the document, to be forged? A. I do believe them all to be forged; my own name is not my writing, certainly - I authorised nobody to write my name; I never authorised any body to sign my name, as treasurer, in any case.</p>

            . I am a superior clerk in the East India House; I know the prisoner, and am acquainted with his hand-writing - I should take the filling up of this document to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What character has he borne during the time he has been in the East India-house? A. As far as regards my connexion with him, I always found him very respectful in his behaviour, and very willing to engage in his duty - he was in the habit of making out warrants coutinually from week to week.</p>

            . I am a porter in the accountant's office. I remember seeing the prisoner on the morning of the day this took place, at half-past seven o'clock; he was in the accountant's office - he has a desk there; I saw him go into the compound which encloses this desk - he unlocked a drawer, and locked it again, as I suppose from the sound; I could not see him take any thing out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he appear the worse for liquor, or as if he had not had his proper night's rest? A. He saluted me not in an ordinary way; he said, "How are you, Smith," and as he left the office he said he was devilishly bad.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been asked how he came to the office that morning, would your answer be, "I thought him rather tipsy, as if he had been drinking?" A. Not at the time, I should not.(The warrant was here read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Overwhelmed as I am at the awful situation in which I am now placed, it would be unbecoming and unjust in me to deny the truth of the statement made by the respectable persons who have been obliged to come forward against me on this occasion; but, my Lord and Gentlemen, if in the merciful administration of justice, a crime committed under the influence of a disordered and distempered mind can receive a more favourable consideration than when committed by means of art and premeditation, I trust I am not asking too much in begging mercy at your hands. By an infatuation, which I now blush to confess, I had for some time past been addicted to drink, the effects of which rendered me at times completely insensible; it happened that on the Wednesday previous to my apprehension I had been induced to join some friends, and in their company became exceedingly intoxicated, by which means I was prevented attending my accustomed duty at the India-house - at night I went to my lodgings, and on the following morning, when the hour for going to business arrived I found myself completely unfit and unable to go out; on the afternoon of that day I began to reflect on the consequences of my absence from my business - I was aware I had no excuse to offer which ought to be accepted as an apology for my conduct, and I was satisfied my dismissal must take place; the contemplation of the disgrace of being discharged distracted me, and for relief, I again flew to drink, and to drown my distress, drank to such excess, that without knowing how or when I got there, I was found in a watch-house in Leadenhall-street, from which place, full of the liquor which I had taken, a heated and excited brain, and without rest, I went to the India-house; the fatal paper tempted me at the moment, and I used it in the manner proved - I am aware now (it is too late) of my fatal error, but in proof, my Lord and Gentlemen, of the truth of my assertion, that I acted from momentary impulse, and not from any preconceived or arranged plan, it will be evident that had I given a moment's consideration to that which I was about to do, I should not have presented a paper for payment which bore the signatures of persons totally dissimilar in their character from the genuine writings of those persons, and with whose genuine signatures I (from the situation I held) was aware the person to whom the document was presented for payment was well acquainted, from the fact of thousands of documents with the same names being presented to him; I, too, was no stranger at the Bank, and might, had I reflected, have known that by presenting the order myself, detection was certain, probably from the Bank clerks themselves, but unavoidably so when any persons from the India-house should he sent for: these circumstances, my Lord and Gentlemen, I humbly take leave to lay before you, in the hope that the justice which you are bound in the discharge of your duty to administer, may be tempered with the mercy which a wretched being now asks of you.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280008"></xptr>WILLIAM PLAISTOWE. I am constable of the night, at the watch-house in Leadenhall-street. On the night of the 7th of October, I remember the prisoner being in the watch-house - I did not see him brought there; he was asleep when I first saw him; he left the watch-house before seven o'clock - there was no charge against him; I saw him go away - he had slept on the guard-bed where the watchmen were; he appeared to me quite drunk.</p>
               <p>MR. ALDERSON. Q. In what state was he in when he left? A. Quite stupid and incapable of writing, I presume.</p>
               <p>- PEMBERTON. I am clerk in the accountant-general's office, in the East India-house. I have known the prisoner three years; he has lately been given to drink, but bore the character of an honest man.</p>

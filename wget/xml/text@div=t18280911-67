            . I am superintendent of St. Bride's watch-house. On the 9th of September, about one o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner at the top of Stonecutter's-street, Shoe-lane, carrying a basket; I asked him what it was - he said "Apples" and he was going to take them to Plumtree-court - that he had brought or bought them from

            , in Fleet-market; I detained him, and found Mr. Storey, about four o'clock in the morning - he claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did Killick make his appearance? A. I was not at the watch-house then: the prisoner said nothing about Killick - he was at the Mansion-house, and both were sent to the Compter; I did not hear Killick say, he had given it to him - he was afterwards discharged, and the prisoner was committed; Rogers and Street said at the Mansion-house, they saw Killick put it on his shoulder.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner said they had been brought or bought of Jacobs, did that basket ever belong to Jacobs? A. It did, but not the apples: Killick knew I dealt with Jacobs; I saw him that night, when I put the fruit by. The prisoner told the Alderman, that Killick put the basket on his head, to carry to his lodging in Plumtree-court - I know Killick lodges there; I do not believe the prisoner stole it at all.</p>

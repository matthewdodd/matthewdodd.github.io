                  </hi>. I live at 102, Ossulston Street, Somers Town, and am a confectioner—on Saturday night, 4th December, about 11 o'clock, I was at a public-house at the corner of Euston Road, and the street where I live—I had some ale there, and took out my purse to pay for it—I did not see the prisoners in the house—I went outside, and the prisoner Williams placed her hand in the left pocket of my trowsers—I turned round and pushed her arm—I said, "You vagabond, you want to rob me of my money"—I had no sooner said that than I received a violent blow across the eyes from Barr—I feel the effects of the blow now—I became insensible for a short time, and when I came to myself I saw the prisoners in custody—I am positive that Barr struck me, and that Williams had her hand in my pocket—I saw Bennett there with them.</p>

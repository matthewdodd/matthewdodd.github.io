            . I am a servant to Mr. Cliff; I saw a man go into the ground where the fence is broken down; he went to the linen and unpinned the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was the man at the bar. - A. I am. I asked the servant whether she had sent any body to take them down; she said no. I made the best of my way to the ground, he was coming out; I asked him what he had been doing, he said nothing; I told him it was of no use of him saying nothing, I had seen what he had been doing as well as himself; I laid hold of him and shoved him against the paling till I got assistance; then he was secured. My mistress saw what was in the bag and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask him whether he saw the linen in my hand. - A. I saw you with the linen in your hand; when you came nigh me you threw it away.</p>

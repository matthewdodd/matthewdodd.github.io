                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jeffrey Chatters—he is a porter, and keeps a chandler's shop in Featherstone-street. I recollect Thursday, the 8th of March, the prisoner came to my shop about tins o'clock—she had a few small articles, bread, tea, and sugar—they came to about—she gave me a shilling—I gave her the change, and she went away—I put the shilling into the till—there were two more in, this made the third—she came about four o'clock the same day—she then had some bread, tea, sugar, and butter, which came to about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she offered a shilling in payment—I put it into the same till—I recollect her coming again about five o'clock—she then bought some bread, tea, sugar, and become which came to about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she offered a shilling, which I added to the others and gave her change—that would make about five shillings in the till, not more—she came a fourth time that day, about half-past five o'clock—she then had a pound of bread, which was 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she offered a crown-piece, which I placed in another till, on the other side of the shop, and gave her change—my husband came home about seven or eight o'clock, which was about two</p>

               <p>hours after, she came the last time—I went out after that, and when I came back, he said he had taken two bad shillings from the till, where I put the shillings—I had not taken a shilling from any other person from the time the prisoner first came—I recollect the morning subsequent to that—I went to the till where I placed the crown, took it out to examine it, and found it a bad one—I examined the till where the shillings were kept, and found a third bad shilling there.</p>

I returned home on the 8th of March—my wife rent out after I came home—no one went to the till before me—I went soon after my wife went out—there were four or five shillings in the till—I found two bad ones—I took them out, looked at them, and put them in again, separate from the other money—I left the whole of the shillings in the till—there were two or three besides the two I picked out—I believe there was one more bad one, which my wife found the next morning—I did not get a bad crown from my wife then, but I did on the Saturday—I put it into my pocket, and showed it to the policeman—I gave him the shillings and the crown piece, on the 10th of March—I had had some communication with Mr. Fobbester.</p>

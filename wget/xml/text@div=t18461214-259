                  </hi> On the 1st of Dec. I had fifty-one firkins of butter—I sold them all but ten—they were marked with a diamond on the top and S. K. on the bottom—one of them was No. 40—I lost that one—it had S. K. on the bottom of it—I believe this to be the bottom of that cask.</p>

I saw the prisoner going under a lamp from Harrow-court with a firkin of butter on his shoulder—some man who was following him behind me called out, "Drop it, drop it"—the prisoner threw it down and ran—I sprang my rattle and ran—he fell and I took him—he said, "Pray don't take me, I am innocent"—a metropolitan policeman came up—I said to the prisoner, "What did you drop off your shoulder?"—he said, "I don't know anything about the butter, the butter did not belong to me"—I had not said anything about butter before that—I came back and found this bottom of the cask covered with butter a</p>

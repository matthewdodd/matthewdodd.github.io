             had?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes, my Lord. I went into the Prisoner's House on Monday, I think about three Weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Day, or the Night?</p>
               <p>Wilson. About 12 o'Clock in the Day, and she was at Dinner. I brought her some Cloaths to wash of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you wash your own Cloaths?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, my Lord; when I came in, she desired me to dine with her, but I refused, but she desired I would; so I sat down, so in comes a Woman that she called Mrs Stiff; it was that Woman that gave her these Things to pawn. I do not know that these are they, but Mrs Stiff desired her to pawn half a Dozen of Spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, my Lord, I did not see them, she pulled them out of her Bosom; she said they were Salt-Shovels. I was for going away, but she desired I might stay till she returned; when she came back, she said the Things were stopp'd, she carried them she said to one Mrs Stringer. The Prisoner desired she would go along with her to Mrs Stringer, and let her know how she came by them. Mrs Stiff was very angry that they should stop the Things, and asked Mrs Burn if she knew any Ill of her; Mrs Burn said, no; with that she went out and said, she would fetch the Person she had them of, and would come back again and fetch them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mrs Stiff?</p>
               <p>Wilson. That I cannot tell, my Lord; I staid almost an Hour, and the Woman did not return.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you so to remember this Woman's Name?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Mrs Burn came to me again, and said she had been looking for her; Mrs Stringer told me in her Shop, that she knew Mrs Burn to be an honest Woman, and she would not stop her, but desired she might see and get the Person that gave her the Shovels. I returned and told Mrs Burn what she said; that is all I know of the Matter.</p>

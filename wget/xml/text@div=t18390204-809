                  </hi>. I am a brewer, and live at Islington. The prisoner was engaged by me as a collecting clerk, at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each new customer he brought—these terms were afterwards changed to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was to receive the money for the ale and beer delivered to the customers, and to pay me that money on the same night, when he returned, and was to enter in a book what he had received in the day—I have that book here, in his own hand-writing—on the 15th of November here is no sum entered by him as received of Mr. Leach, of Broad-street; nor did he on that day pay me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as so received; nor has he at any time paid it me—he entered other sums as received that day, and paid them to me, but not that—it was his duty to take out, for the purpose of giving receipts to the customers, a little book, containing blank forms of receipts—he ought not to receive money without giving one of these forms, or a bill with a printed head—he is not my partner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in Broad-street. On the 15th of November I paid the prisoner five shillings on account of his master, Mr. Griffiths—I have his receipt here—I saw him write it—I knew it was the custom to give printed receipts—I looked at this receipt when he gave it me—I forget the words I made use of, but I know the prisoner said, "I have given you this on a blank piece of paper, as I have not any printed receipts with me," and he said, "I am a partner with Mr. Griffiths."</p>

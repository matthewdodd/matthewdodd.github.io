                  </hi>. I keep the Lord High Admiral public-house, in the Vauxhall-road. The prisoner was about five weeks in my service—I kept my till in my bar, and missed money from time to time, and I marked two half-crowns, three shillings, and three sixpences—I put them into the till on the night of the 21st of January, about twelve o'clock at night—I locked the till, and took the key up stairs to my bed-room—next morning my daughter came to my bed-room for the key of the till—she took it off the mantel-piece in my bed-room, and I gave her some silver not marked, to give change, without using the money in the till—tills was about half-past seven o'clock—about half-past nine o'clock I examined the till, and missed one shilling which was marked—I sent for a police officer, and charged the prisoner with having it—she denied having a shilling about her—she was searched in my presence, and the marked shilling found in her pocket—this is the shilling—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it has a cross under the head—I am quite sure it is one of the shillings I marked.</p>

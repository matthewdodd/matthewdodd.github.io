I lived in the Alpha-road, and had two of the prisoner's daughters in my employ - one as a servant, and the other as a needle woman; she slept at home - I had a horse and mare, which I intended to send to the strawyard, about the 20th of November: I had sent them as far as the half-way house at Harrow, on their way to Arlesden, but in consequence of what the prisoner's daughter said, I was induced to allow him to have them to forage for me, instead of their going there - he was to fetch them, and to charge me with their keep, and to bring me in a bill for the forage; I did not see him for a fortnight after - he was then in my kitchen, and gave me this bill, charging 36s.; I asked him how my horses were - he said they looked quite well, and were quite well, and asked if I would settle that little bill; I said certainly; he then said, "Ma'am, if you can advance me a little money, I can buy the things much cheaper and better; "I asked what he thought their keep would come to per week - he said, "Why, this is what Mr. Coates has charged me, but I think I could keep them much cheaper"- I asked how much cheaper; he said he did not know, but whatever it came to he would charge me, and no more, and he should leave it to me to pay him for his own trouble; I never sold the horses to him - I gave my servant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140025"></xptr>2l. to take to him, to pay the bill; he had the horses at his own stable: a few days after he had them, in consequence of what his daughter said, I told my servant to give the key of the stable to her - I did not miss the property from the stable till the Monday before Christmas-day, when I found he had absconded - the key of the stable was also gone; I knew he had the horses - the other articles in the indictment were taken from the stable; he lived in Portland-town, near Primrose-hill - I gave information to the Police, and saw my horse, mare, and other things at High-street; the daughter who worked for me left the house on the Saturday before the Monday on which I missed the property, and his other daughter pretended to be ill with spasms in her stomach - she might have been ill; they both left on Saturday - I have not seen them since, except at the door of this Court; I never consented to his parting with the horses in any way - he had them to forage, and nothing else.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.If the girl might have been ill, why do you say it was pretence? A. I think it was pretence, as she was seen running about at play in the street; I sent the horses to be foraged - that was my only intention in sending them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent any thing else out? A. The people I wash for had my linen, I believe, and I may have sent things from my wardrobe to be repaired, but nothing else; I sent nothing out but my wearing-apparel - I may have let a few of my things go, but it was nothing but wearing-apparel; I sent the prisoner's daughter some silk gowns to repair - there was an execution in the house about, or at the time, at the suit of Mr. Wilson, I believe; the prisoner made the bill for the horses up to the 3rd of December - he had had them a fortnight then; my husband had bought the horses of Mr. Osborne, and given one hundred guineas for them - I have said they did not belong to me, because I had sold them to my cousin; he had given me 50l. in part payment - Mr. O'Brien was in difficulties, and I said so; it was a fact, but my cousin had left them with me for my use and pleasure - I said so to several persons; I was to place them at the cheapest place I could, when I could not ride them - I never offered them to the prisoner for 30l., nor tell his daughters I had called them in to witness their being his in case of an execution - I never said any such thing; the clothes I sent out I should think at the utmost were not worth more than 15l. - I sent them out to be protected; I did not know the prisoner at the time he first had the horses.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you send the clothes to? A. The prisoner's daughter said, "Oh, let me take the things home to my father, and he will take care of them; we have often had executions in our house, and I know they will take every thing;" I think it was his youngest daughter - Watkins, my servant, took some, and his daughters the rest; the execution was subsequently withdrawn; the landlord was paid - there was not enough for the Sheriff.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Your servants knew of your misfortune - did you authorize the prisoner or his daughters to clear your stable out? A.Never; I never saw the prisoner but when he produced the bill of 36s.</p>

            . I live in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove - I am a parish constable, and a furniture broker; the prisoner lived in High-street, Portland-town, about three quarters of a mile from me. On the 19th of December he asked me to come to his place to buy some furniture, as he was about to remove to Prague-street, Paddington - I bought some furniture of him, and on the Monday some fixtures; he told me to bring my cart and take them away - he afterwards said, "Bring a van and take my goods at the same time," as my house is in the direction he was going; I noticed a press-bedstead among other things, being heavy - I went after the prisoner on the 24th of December, and in a barge at Windsor, belonging to Clark and Robinson, I found the same press-bedstead which I had helped to put into the van; it laid on its back, with the two folding doors upwards, and two plates screwed down into the doors - I unscrewed it, and found the saddles and horse-cloths in it; the prosecutrix identified them in the prisoner's presence, at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him? A. Not till he came about the furniture.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DICKENSON. I am a serjeant of the Police. On the 21st of December I was going my rounds, and the prosecutrix called me in, and gave me information, in consequence of which I went in search of the prisoner and horses to Cheltenham, then to Chippenham, and went with Denman to Shenstone, in Wills, and at the Rattlebone public-house Denman brought the prisoner in; Conway, the prosecutrix's gardener, was with me, to identify him - he shook hands with him; I asked if that was Lidyard -Conway said Yes; I told him I had come from London, and that he was my prisoner - that he had escaped with some horses; he was very obstreperous, and wanted to know the particulars - after handcuffing him I told him he was charged with stealing a quantity of bridles, saddles, horse-cloths, and two horses; he said he had never stolen them, that he bought them, and gave 30l. for them; I said if that was the case, if he would go before some country Magistrate, no doubt they would discharge him; the place was quite in a disturbance, for all the inhabitants were on his side - he said he would not go: I said he had better go to the nearest Magistrate we could find, and he should chose one himself, but he said he would not go out of the village; as we went along he said he would give the horses up if Mrs. O'Brien would pay the expences; I had before that asked him where they were, and he would not tell me - he repeatedly said he had bought them for 30l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you state to the Magistrate one word about his not telling you where they were? A. I believe so, I am sure of it in fact; what I said was taken down and read over to me; he said he would go before Mr. Oldfield, the Magistrate at Shenstone, and I took him; he would not interfere, and I brought him to town.</p>

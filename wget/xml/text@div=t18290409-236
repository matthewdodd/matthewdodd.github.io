            . I am the wife of James Steel. On the morning of the 13th of January I went out at eleven o'clock, and at half-past twelve I went up stairs, saw a hole in the ceiling, and the tiles taken off; the mattress was drawn from under the bed, and this money taken out of it; I had felt it there at nine that morning - there were thirty-four sovereigns, a 50l. and 10l. Bank note, which we received, as a compensation for a house, from the Dock Company; I do not know the number of the notes, nor the dates - the mattress was ripped open; I missed nothing else: the male prisoner lived next door, with Jones; I saw Quinly the same day, about two hours after the robbery; he came to his door; I did not speak to him - I was only absent half an hour; the prisoners have been married since the robbery; the man said he worked in a rope-ground - he lived at his mother's house, where I saw him; I have not seen him with any money since.</p>

I know the prisoner Jones; I saw her after Christmas - I do not know the month; it was six or seven weeks before I heard of this robbery: she called at my mother's house, where I was, and wanted to know if my mother knew where her father lived, and asked if she bought a few things, if she might leave them there; she gave her permission - I went out with her, and bought a little box and a Britannia metal tea-pot; we came home, and she left us - I saw her again about a week afterwards: she then asked my mother if she might bring her young man in - my mother gave her leave, and she brought the prisoner in- they drank tea at our house; they both called again next morning, and said they wished my mother was well enough to go out and purchase a few things for them; my mother was too ill, and I went: they bought a bedstead, mattress, chairs, wash-hand stand, and several small things, which came to about 4l. 16s.; they took a room next door to my mother's, and the things were sent home: I heard them order them to be sent there. I saw Quinly with four or five sovereigns, and I saw him hold up two notes - he told me they were sailor's notes; my mother said she thought notes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090112"></xptr>would not go; he said, "Oh, yes, I can get rid of them" -I looked over his shoulder, and saw one with "10" marked on it, and the other with "50;" he took two or three sovereigns out of a small bag - I believe it was all gold; I could not tell how much was in it: they went to another shop, and bought a bed and bedding.</p>

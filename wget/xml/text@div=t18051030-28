               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. Yes, his parents lodge at my house, and he lived with them. On the 2d of October, I lost my watch out of the drawer in my bed room, I had put it there about two months before, in consequence of breaking some part of the spring; I had seen it in the drawer about a fortnight or three weeks before the 2d of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer locked? - A. It was not, my wife had put by two seven-shilling pieces, and from my wife's information, I missed the watch on the 2d of October.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time, was the prisoner, and his father and mother living in the house with you? - A. Yes, they are still living with me, they are honest good kind of people; I believe the boy eloped from his father and mother about a fortnight or three weeks before I missed my watch, on the 8th of October; I saw the watch in the officers hands, after I had taken the boy on suspicion of stealing it; the boy was brought home by a waggoner; I had him apprehended while he was at dinner in his father's roome he said, he found the watch in the bottom of the clock-case that was standing at the bottom of the stairs in my house; he had told his father before he found it fifteen miles out of town.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Worship-street; on Tuesday the 8th of October, I was sent for by the last witness, I went up stairs, I saw the boy and his mother; the prosecutor gave me charge of him, I asked him where the watch was, he denied it at first, but his mother very honestly said, that is the watch you told me you found when you came home. The father of the boy had taken it from him for fear he should make away with it. The father was sent for, and when he came, he produced it in the presence of the boy, he said, he look it out to work with him, for fear his son should make away with it before he found the right owner. The father asked the boy how he could tell him such a story, that he had found the watch in the country; he said he did find it, but not in the country as he first said, but he found it on the stairs; as I was going to take him to the office, he shewed me the bottom of an old clock case, and he pointed out that as the place where he found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said about the string of the watch? - A. Yes, Mr. Taylor described it having a purple string, I asked the boy where was the string which was on the watch when he found it, he said it broke, and he put this piece of black ribbon on it himself. I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>(The watch identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Taylor said in the drawer where the watch was, there was a 5 l. bill and eight bank notes along with the watch, is it likely I should take the watch, and leave all that money.</p>
               <p>

            (To Prosecutor.) Did you say that? - A. Yes, there was a 5 l. note, and eight others laying by the watch, I said, it was a wonder he should take the watch, and leave that.</p>

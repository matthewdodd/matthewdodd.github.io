            , I am headborough of the parish of St. Giles's, on May the 15th the prisoner was upon a dray sitting on the sharps on the near side with another young man behind him. Going along St. Giles's towards the church, the beadle of St. George's Bloomsbury, the deceased, was on the other side of the way, he was going to carry a silver mace home he had borrowed to attend at the Foundling-hospital; he crost the way, and I belive he bid the prisoner get down, but I could not here that. He did not get down, so the beadle took hold of the horse's head (there was out one horse) and turned him back again towards Holbourn, about twenty yards. The prisoner and the other person were then both upon the dray: then there was a little mob, and I heard it said, knock him down, knock him down; that I supposed to be, knock the <rs id="t17500530-32-viclabel148" type="occupation">beadle</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17500530-32-victim226 t17500530-32-viclabel148"></join> down, then the prisoner jumped from the dray, and whether he hit the deceased, or shoved him I do not know, but down he fell on his back, I rather think he pushed him: then the prisoner took hold of the horse's head and turned him short round, and the near wheel went over the deceased's leg. When the deceased was on his back he lay about a yard from the dray, had it gone streight on, the wheel would not have touched him. Then the prisoner was making the best of his way with the dray, I followed him and took him before a magistrate. I heard no words pass between them.</p>

I did not see the prisoner upon the dray, the beadle let his staff fall in the struggle, the dray was as it were rather standing, the drayman disengaged himself from the deceased, and gave him a push, he lay about a yard or two from the dray on his back. Then the drayman turned the horse's head short round, and drove the wheel over his leg which he might have prevented, had he gone streight on he would have avoided it. I was then within seven or eight yards of them at this time, he lay above a yard from the streight course of the dray sideways.</p>

               <p>Buckingham. On the south-side.</p>
               <p>[On his cross examination, he said it was done in a short trice, there was no great multitude of people; he did not see any blows pass, only that push, neither did he see they had hold of each others collar.]</p>

            . I was in my own shop within seventy yards where this thing happened: hearing a noice I went to the door, and there I saw the deceased fall, but what occasioned it I cannot tell; the people interrupted my sight of them, but I thought I saw the dray run over his legs.

            . I was standing at the end of Bowl-yard, Broad St. Giles's; there I saw the prisoner at the bar and the beadle of St. George's parish a tusling together, they both had hold of each other, the prisoner pushed the other on the left side, then he drove on, and the near wheel went over the deceased's leg. He drove the horse streight on, he did not pull him, the horse's head was towards St. Giles's church when I first saw them. I was within twenty five yards of them, when the wheel run over him, I was within five or six yards of the deceased, I stopped the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined before the coroner?</p>
               <p>Watkins. Yes, I was, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sa y the same there you do now?</p>
               <p>Watkins. I said if he had let the horse go on according to his own way, doubtless the wheel might have escaped the old gentleman's leg, had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175005300016"></xptr> he flung the halter over the horse's head when he hit him, it might have escaped him.</p>
               <p>Darby Morris. I was within fifteen or sixteen yards, I did not see the beginning of it, I saw the prisoner shove the beadle down, and went on with the dray, there were a great many people about, the horse stood still when the deceased was pushed down, and to the best of my knowledge the prisoner might have avoided running over the deceased.</p>
               <p>Jos. Windsor. I am an Apothecary, the deceased leg was broke in two, close by the ancle, both the bones, he was an elderly man; I attended him to the Saturday night when he died. The wound began to mortify on the Tuesday morning before I went to the prisoner in Bridewel. On the Sunday morning after I went and told him Mr. Burgess was dead, he said he was very sorry for it, and wished he had taken his advice and got off the dray.</p>

            . On the fifteenth of May I was in the shop at the sign of the parrot, I saw the beadle strike the prisoner once with his staff as they were scufling, the drayman's back was towards the horse, I saw the beadle lift up his hand to strike the drayman again; then the drayman pushed him down, and instantly the dray went on. The drayman perceiving the danger, he clap'd his right hand to the dray, to push it back if he could, I did not see he had hold of the halter, I was above twenty yards off.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Dixon. I was in the shop with the last witness, I saw a mob, and they said the beadle was beating the drayman. I don't know when the dray went on, or whether the drayman had a halter in his hand or not. I saw him striving to push the dray off.</p>
               <p>Fra. Winter. On the fifteenth of May I was looking out of my own window about twelve yards from the dray. I heard a noise, I saw the deceased having the prisoner by the collar, insisting he should go along with him, the prisoner would not go, the deceased up with his stick and hit him two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a stick or his staff?</p>
               <p>Winter. It was a stick or a cane, he had a staff in his hand besides, the prisoner strove to twist the stick out of his hand; he gave him a shove and he fell down in the kennel, then the dray turned round short and went over one of his legs.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. The prisoner worked with me a year and a half, I always looked upon him to be a quiet inoffensive man as ever I had in my house.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Allen. The time the prisoner was servant with Mr. Jackson, I lodg'd there about fifteen months, he had a general good character, I imploy'd him to do little matters for me, I always found him faithful and of a quiet disposition, and I was very much surprized when I heard he was under such circumstances.</p>

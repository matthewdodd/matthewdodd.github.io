About three weeks before that time, I changed a 10l. bank-note and received ten 1l. bank-notes for it. I kept them in my pocket-book, with three other 1l. notes, that I had before. On the 7th of February, I had eleven 1l. notes in my pocket-book, which I kept at the bottom of my chest, in my bed-room-it was locked. A little after nine o'clock in the morning, I went out. I had taken 1s. 6d. out of my pocket-book that morning, and saw my notes safe then. I put my book at the bottom of my chest, and locked it. There was also a pension ticket in the book, some papers, four 3s. tokens, and 1s. I did not return till half-past nine o'clock at night. The prisoner lodged in the same room with me. He did not sleep in the same bed. He knew I had the money. He went down stairs before I went to my box in the morning. When I came home, I found the lid of my chest had been forced from the asp of the lock, it was still locked, but the lid broken from it. My pocket-book, with its contents were gone, and a black silk handkerchief. I went out to look for the prisoner, but could not find him. I returned home, and found him there, and asked him if he knew any thing about it; he said, he did not. I had him taken to the watch-house, where he was kept all night. I went there at six o'clock in the morning, they told me he was gone. I found him at a coffee-stall. I was on the opposite side of the way, and saw him give the woman who kept the stall, a shilling. I kept on the other side of the way, she scrupled to take it, and gave it to her little girl to go over the way for change. As the girl came over the road, I asked her to let me look at it, which she did, and I knew it to be the same shilling that was taken out of my box, by a large T on one side, and a stroke on the other side, which I observed when I took it. It had been it refused because it was French. I saw the woman give it to the girl, and heard what she said. I gave it to the girl again, and told her, to take it to her mother, and tell her not to part with it, and I would speak to her as soon as the prisoner was gone. I saw her put the shilling on the table, and her mother take it up. I went over and told her not to part with it. I followed the prisoner into the Star public-house, in Well-street-he did not see me. I heard him ask the potboy, how long it would be, before his master got up, when the master got up, the prisoner was in the tap-room, but did not know that I was in the house. I got an officer and had him searched, the landlord handed out three notes from the bar, and a black silk handkerchief. I can swear to one of the notes.</p>

            . I am a widow. The prosecutor and prisoner both lodged in my house, which is in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. There were two more men who lodged in the same room. The prisoner went out about twenty minutes before M'Ginnis, he returned between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, and staid in the lower part of the house till between one and two o'clock. He then went up stairs, and staid there not quite a quarter of an hour. I asked him what he went up stairs for, he said, to mend his shoes. He came down and went out. Nobody was up stairs, from the time that M'Ginnis went out till he returned, but the prisoner. They lived in the one pair of stairs room. I heard no noise. The prisoner returned again, about ten o'clock at night. I had seen M'Ginnis with money. He once gave me his pocket-book to take care of. His money was all in 1l. notes.</p>

            . I keep a coffee stall opposite Wapping watch-house, in Dock-street, East Smithfield. The prisoner came to my stall, on the 8th of February, in the morning, and had some coffee. I am sure it was the prisoner. He gave a shilling, I did not like it, and gave it to my little girl to get it changed. I observed M' Ginnis. The girl came back, and told me not to part with it. She had not got above ten yards before she came back. She gave me the shilling directly into my hand. I am sure it was the same shilling I had given her. There was a T on it, which I had observed, it was marked round the edge. The man came and told me not to part with it. I kept it separate from my other money, and I am sure, I gave the same shilling to the officer.</p>

            . I keep the Star public-house, in Well-street. On Friday evening, the 7th of February, about five o'clock, the prisoner came to my house and had some gin, he gave me three 1l. bank-notes to take care of for him till the morning, saying, that he was going into bad company, and was afraid he should lose them. I put them in a drawer by themselves, and locked the drawer and took the key. When I came down the next morning, my boy told me, in the prisoner's presence, that a person had been robbed, and was gone for an officer, and that I was not to deliver the money till he came back. The prisoner said. I was to give him the money, and if the officer wanted it he would give it to him. I told him that I must keep it till he came. The officer came directly and I gave him the same notes that the prisoner delivered to me the night before. I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 24, Etham Place—the prisoner has lived with me as my wife for about ten months—on Monday, 16th August, about 5 o'clock, as I came home from work I passed the Castle and saw her and her sister there—I joined them and we had a pint of ale between the three of us—we had no conversation—I went and sat down—they then went out and I followed them 30 or 40 yards behind—they went home and I followed them upstairs about a" minute afterwards' and sat on the side of the bed—the prisoner began swearing and threw something at me; I bobbed my head down and got up to go out without speaking to her, but her sister laid hold of my shoulders and held me while the prisoner rushed at me with a knife and I felt it sticking in my ribs—I had on my coat and waistcoat—I pulled the knife out, threw it on the floor and ran downstairs, walked about 10 yards across the road, felt faint, and fell against a wall—a man who I knew named Charley put me on a barrow and took me to Guy's Hospital—while I was on the way there I saw the prisoner and her sister coming behind—the prisoner was holloaing out "I did it"—I was in the hospital till the 27th—I have known the prisoner by the name of Sarah Malyon—I was not in drink when I left the public-house—it was a large table knife ground to a point, such as you eat your dinner with.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital on 16th August, at 5 o'clock, when Andrews was brought in—he had a punctured wound on his left side, just below the fifth rib, which has passed upwards into the chest wall, apparently to about three quarters of an inch—it had bled a good deal, but had ceased when he got there—I did not know then whether it had penetrated the lungs, but it turned out that it had not—it was just over the region of the heart, and if it had gone straight, instead of glancing upwards, it would have entered the heart—he was faint from loss of blood when he was brought in, and air had got in all round his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200144"></xptr>
               <p>chest—I considered him in much danger; a table knife would inflict the wound, but it would need some strength to do it—it did not do him any serious harm, and he went out quite well on the 27th—I think he had been drinking when he came in, but it was difficult to tell, because he was rather faint.</p>

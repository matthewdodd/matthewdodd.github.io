                  </hi> I am a linen-draper, at Uxbridge—the prisoner was my housekeeper. On 24th March I received information from Foster, my ser<lb></lb>vant; and in presence of Roadnight, accused her of entering my shop be<lb></lb>tween seven and eight o'clock on the previous Sunday evening; she denied it, but subsequently acknowledged it—I had not told her it would be better to state the truth—I held out no inducement to her, nor did Roadnight—she said she had been in the shop, that she smelt fire, and got into the shop by a key she had found—I asked what she had done with the key—she said she place it where she found it—I told my foreman to go with her and let her produce the key—he went—I then asked her what goods she had taken from the shop—she denied taking any—I mentioned a table-cloth, table-cover, six cambric handkerchiefs, and some calico and flannel—she denied taking them—I then asked her what she had done with those things that were seen—she said, "I confess I have taken them unknown to you"—I asked what she had done with the tickets of the goods—she said, "I have burnt them"—the officer searched and found these articles—this silver caddy<lb></lb>spoon is mine—these cambric handkerchiefs bear my private shop-mark.</p>

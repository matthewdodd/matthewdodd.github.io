                  </hi>. I at present reside at Bexley-heath—I was formerly a grocer—when I first became acquainted with the defendant I was residing at Clifton-place, something like fifteen or sixteen months ago—I considered I was entitled to a sum of money—I had a letter from the country, and showed it to Mr. Rattenbury when the prisoner was in his shop—he keeps the shop I used to keep—the prisoner saw the letter, and said, "If this suit is in money, I can get it"—he said he was a solicitor; he always told me so—then it was proposed by the prisoner that I, Mr. Rattenbury, and himself, should go to Chancery-lane, and find out the suit—he gave me this copy of reports (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is the prisoner's name at the bottom—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and something, for the stamp which it is on—up to the time of his speaking to me about Mr. Joyce, he got from me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the latter end of May he told me it would be necessary for me to make an affidavit—before that be had shown me these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). (<hi rend="italic">read, endorsed</hi> F. Wenham and another, in Chancery, Freeman <hi rend="italic">v</hi> Parsley)—before we had the affidavit he read something out, which he told me was Mr. Joyce's opinion—he read it because, he said, barrister's writing was not to be read—I am not soholar</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186601290067"></xptr>
               <p>enough to read it—he put the papers of Mr. Joyce in his pocket—he had the papers of the suit with him—he wished to have some certificate from the country, which he and I went and got from Gloucestershire—he told me that he had actually been to Mr. Joyce's house, that when he could not catch him at his office, he had been to the West end—we never knew that he lived at Blackheath till we found he was duping—he told me that Mr. Joyce's opinion was, that I was head and chief, and nobody was entitled, if I was not—he said, "Do not tell Mr. Rattenbury about it, because he married my sister's daughter"—then after that he said it would be necessary to get two certificates, which you see on the top of his report, Mr. and Mrs Harris's—on 28th March he said, "I should like to go into the country"—I proposed that Mr. Rattenbury should go—he said, "No, I must go; Mr. Rattenbury cannot do it," and that I could not—it was determined that the prisoner should go—Mr. Rattenbury gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that very same night, at a tea-meeting—he came to mo and said, "MR. Rattenbury has given me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I am going down to get the certificates—I thought everything was right—after he took me to Chancery-lane, he said, "The Courts are on at Westminster, and Mr. Joyce is not at his office; he is at Westminster"—we went to Westminster—he took me into two or three Courts—he left me in one, and said, "I will go in to Mr. Joyce"—he came back and said, "I have seen Mr. Joyce, and he tells me he will go on with the case—about seven or eight days after, he came to me and said, "Mr. Joyce wants 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has presented a petition and the affidavit—I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because he said Mr. Joyce wanted it to carry on the case, and the case was to come off the very next term—I had no other reason for giving him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than a belief that what he wanted was right—I believed he was a solicitor, he always told me he was—he told me he had just taken out his certificate again, and that he had paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—that belief was the means of my parting with my money—Mr. Rattenbury found out that he was not a solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you hear first that he was not a solicitor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a couple of months ago—it was some time in October, I believe—I have lived at New-cross sixteen years—I know the parish church, and knew that the prisoner was clerk there—it did not surprise me that an attorney should hold that office—it did not occur to me that it was singular he being an attorney—I did not tell Mr. Rattenbury what the prisoner had said to me—I told him some of the story I have told here to-day—I am not allowed to charge the prisoner with obtaining more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of the money he laid out in obtaining legal documents—I know that he obtained those various reports—it cost all about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I understand the indictment is only for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">Certificates of the births and deaths of the wit<lb></lb>ness's mother and father were here read</hi>.)—these were all the papers—MR. Rattenbury wrote this letter by my instructions—(<hi rend="italic">This was from the witness to the prisoner, and requested him to hand to Mr. Rattenbury, on or before</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">o'clock, the following papers, a copy of Mr. Rattenbury's will, with a certificate of Little's and his sister's birth, and of Mr. Freeman's death, and a receipt of amounts paid, also that he would return to Mr. Rattenbury what he got from the witness by false pretences, to present a petition in his favour</hi>)—I only claim what he had for Mr. Joyce in this letter—the Magistrate would only allow us to claim for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if the law of false pretences is not so, it is wrong—he told me he had lodged the petition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Reading from the depositions</hi>)—In a few day safterwards he came to my house, and he told me he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for lodging the petition; is that correct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he told me a hundred times that he was</p>

               <p>an attorney, on my oath—he did not tell me more than three or four times that he had a certificate—the first time was in the summer—I had seen that Mr. Moss's name was on the brass plate at the prisoner's office—that was the reason I spoke to the prisoner about it—that was after he had had that money for me—I paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the latter end of May or the beginning of June—I had been to the prisoner's office perhaps a week before that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—I saw Mr. Moss there—I do not know whether at the time I called, Mr. Moss's name was on a brass plate—I cannot read—I do not know when it was put on—I will not swear that I did not see it when I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see it before I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell the day when I first saw it, I cannot say how long before I made the charge—he said he was an attorney—he has been at my house—you may take it that I was at his office thirty times during the year 1865, if you think proper—he married my niece—they have been married about four or five years—I did not apply to any one about this money before I saw the prisoner—I did not apply to a gentleman named Derozen, because the prisoner said he would do it—Derozen told me that he wanted 50 per cent, for getting it—I had a talk with the prisoner about the terms for obtaining this money—I did not say to him, "I do not want to employ an attorney till I can ascertain that there is a fund in Court"—I know Michael Denny—he lives in a cottage belonging to me—I did not recollect the prisoner saying in his presence, "I can get the lease prepared; of course you know I am not a solicitor, but I dare say I can get it done," it is wrong: not to my knowledge—it did not take place in my hearing—I did not tell the prisoner it did not matter whether he was a solicitor—I was with Denny when I signed it—Denny came to me and said the prisoner had been to him, and saw the agreement, and said, "This is no good to you, you must have a lease"—the prisoner attested the lease in my presence, when he had the money for it—I knew that at the time he signed his name as parish clerk, that he was an attorney—if Denny swears that the prisoner said, "I can get the lease prepared; I dare say you know I am not a solicitor, but I dare say I can do it," it will be untrue—I did not then say, "It does not matter to me whether you are a solicitor or not, but I want it all right—I signed the lease—I have seen him at church, opening the pews—he told me that he was going to be parish-clerk altogether, and that if he was not a solicitor, he could not do the parish business—he told me who Mr. Joyce was, and said that he had been frequently to see him, and had drunk wine and taken dinner with him, and that he lived at the West-end—the prisoner signed these two docu<lb></lb>ments, "F. Wenham, solicitor" after this letter requesting him to return the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he got from me by false pretences.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186601290069"></xptr>
               <p>—he took a paper out of his pocket, opened it, and said, "I will read it to you, because, perhaps, you will not be able to make it out; barristers do not write very plain"—he read it to me, and said, "There is Mr. Joyce's name at the bottom"—I saw the name of Joyce—Mr. Joyce's Christian name was not mentioned that time—he told me that Mr. Joyce had not charged him because he was so well acquainted with him—I asked him which Mr. Joyce it was who had given the opinion—I said, "I see there are three Mr. Joyces in the Directory"—he said, "There are three"—I said, "But there are only two Equity barristers; was it the Common-law barrister?"—he said, "It was the Equity barrister, Mr. William Joyce"—he told me he had been in practice as an attorney, and that he had taken an American bond for 3, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and had lost it—these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's handwriting—I found out that he was not an attorney by looking on the rolls.</p>

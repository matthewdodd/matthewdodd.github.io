                  </hi>. I live at 1, Queen's Place, Whitechapel—the prisoners have lived in a house immediately opposite for the past three years—their child Alice was about 8 years old, and I have frequently spoken to the female prisoner about the condition of the child, and wished her, to have medical advice for her—the first time was some months ago—she used to pay her rent regularly, and usually brought the child with her—on the 23rd July I went to her room and found both the prisoners there—the child was on the bed naked in a very filthy dirty state; it had vermin upon it and sores on its head, in consequence of which I went to Dr. Stirling and afterwards gave information to the officer of health, and the child was taken to the infirmary—I do not think the female prisoner was a drunken woman—I never saw her drunk, but she was very dirty, and she never did any sort of work to support herself and family—her husband was out of a night, I believe, as a messenger, and at home in the day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Queen's Place, High Street, Whitechapel, opposite the prisoner's door—I have often seen the prisoners and their child during the past three or four months; it was always very dirty and pale, looking ill and delicate—on 21st July I first saw the child since she had been ill; she wanted some water, and I gave her some wine; she was naked and dirty, and had a few old clothes to cover her; her head was one mass of sores—I advised the female prisoner to clean the child, and I have many times offered to clean it myself—I told her to get medical advice, and said, "If you don't take the child somewhere, she will not live another three weeks"—she took her to the infirmary.</p>

I am Sanitary Inspector of the Whitechapel district—from information conveyed to me I went to the prisoners' house on 28th July—I saw both prisoners there, and the child was on the bed, which was nothing more than a heap of rags—it was naked, and seemed very ill; its head was covered with sores, and the hair was cut short—as far as I could see it was in a dirty, emaciated state, but the light was not very good—the woman said that she was going to put some clothes on the child, and take it to a friend at Haggerston—I told them I should report the case to the workhouse, which I did later in the day, and the child was removed there the same day.</p>

I am surgeon of the infirmary, Whitechapel Work-house—I saw this child on her admission on the 23rd; she was in a very dirty, neglected state, and suffering from diarrhœa and exhaustion; she soon became unconscious, and was unable to swallow, and died next day at 4 o'clock—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found the body thin and emaciated—it weighed 30lb. 10oz.—a child eight years old ought to weigh 40lb. or 50lb.—the stomach and intestines were empty, and the liver was enlarged; the lungs were in a state of long-standing inflammation, and both pleural cavities contained fluid—she died from diarrhoea, exhaustion, neglect, and the want of the common necessaries of life—the neglect had been going on, I think, for two or three months at least.</p>

There were no signs of scurvy, but there were sores on the head; there were no signs of skin affection of the body—it was not a healthy child; it had scrofulous enlargement of the liver—the sores on the head proceeded from natural causes, and they were not caused by neglect, but were aggravated by it—they might have been cured, but the child would never have been well, because it was suffering from scrofulous disease—it was more difficult for poor people to keep the child well, from its natural tendencies.</p>

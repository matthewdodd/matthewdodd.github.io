               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160081"></xptr>
               <p>12 o'clock as near as possible, I was at the Spread-Eagle public-house and came out with a woman—I bade her good-night and left her, and coming along, at the comer of Edward-street four men pounced out upon me, two of whom are the prisoners; they caught bold of me and dragged me down Edward-street about twenty yards, Hisley having tight hold of my neckerchief with his left hand and pressing his knuckles into my throat which almost caused strangulation—I was unable to resist in any way whatever, as I have got a broken knee-cap and am very lame; I can scarcely walk with a stick by myself—two of the men caught hold of me and tore my trowsers open, and my waistcoat likewise, and wrenched my watch from my pocket—two had hold of me and two picked my pockets—I was not on the ground then, they had hold of me in their arms—I can't say which it was that rifled my pockets—Houghton had hold of my legs; the other two rifled my pockets—after they had got my pockets inside out, Hisley said, "Gouge the <hi rend="italic">sod,"</hi> and he gave me a violent blow on the cheek and let go, and I fell to the ground, and they all ran away directly—as soon as they let go I was able to halloo "Police," and at that moment, Smith, <hi rend="italic">N</hi> 99, arrived—I saw the two prisoners running towards Kingsland-road, and I pointed that way for the constable to go—my watch was worth two guineas—I also lost a watch-guard, three small seals, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I have not seen any of them since—I am quite sure that all this property was in my pocket—my watch was buttoned up close in my trowsers pocket—it had been in my waistcoat pocket in the early part of the evening, and I took it out, as I make a practice of doing if I go into Shoreditch, and put it into my trowsers pocket and buttoned it up closely, and my money was in my other pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where had you been this evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had been up in town on business—I was detained where I had been till 9 o'clock—some part of the time between 9 and 12 I had been in a public-house—I was in two public-houses, one is at the corner of Bateman's-row, and the other was Mr. Orme's, the fighting man's—this happened as I came out of the Spread Eagle—that is a third public-house—it was about 11 when 1 went in there; I might have been in there about an hour—I met a female just before I came to the first public-house in Bateman's-row, and I went in there to have a pint of ale between us, I had nothing else—I left the female there, and came on about my business—I do not know whether she stopped there or not—I was looking after two males who had come up to London with me and promised to meet me at the corner of Church-street—I was waiting to see them—I did not know whether they might be in any public-house, and I thought I would go in and see—I did not take another young lady afterwards—there were two in the Spread Eagle, one that I knew nothing at all of, and the other was the same that I had seen previously—I had not seen her after leaving the first public-house till I went into the Spread Eagle—I called for a pint of ale for them and I had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cold gin-and-water for myself—I had had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin-and-water at Orme's—before I saw the men I was not lying on the ground at all; I was not on the ground at all until they attacked me—I was not drunk and lying on the ground when I came out of the public-house, nor were the women trying to pick me up—one of the women came out of the public-house with me, and I bade her good-night and left her and walked along by myself; she did not follow me—the policeman came up to me against the Spread Eagle—he did not caution me against the women; he said, "Mind what company you are in; "and I said, "All right,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160082"></xptr>
               <p>I am waiting for an omnibus," that was what I was waiting for—it was after that, that I bade the young lady good night—I believe the other one remained in the public-house, I did not see anything more of her—my watch was quite safe then; I felt for it, I could feel it from the outside—I should say it was 3, 4, or 5 minutes after I left the policeman that the men came up to me—I walked on very slowly, I am not able to walk fast—they came from the corner of Edward-street; that may be 80 or 100 yards from the Spread Eagle—they bounced out, and one struck me a violent blow behind the ear which took me off my feet—I could not say which it was that did that—I had never seen either of the prisoners before to my knowledge—they were brought back to me afterwards by the policeman, and I said they were the men, I could swear to them—I said so directly—they were brought back in 3 or 4 minutes.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any pretence for saying that you were at all the worse for what you had taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the least—when the policeman came up I pointed out to him the way the two prisoners ran; I had my eye on them at the time; they had hardly turned the corner at the policeman came up; I believe he saw them, and they were brought back in 3 or 4 minutes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 99). On 29th July I was on duty in the Kingsland-road, and saw Mr. Brown in company with two females at the corner of the Kingsland-road—I went and spoke to him, and cautioned him as to the parties he was with, knowing them to be prostitutes—he said, "All right, policeman, I am waiting for a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>" and with that he got up to go away to meet the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—this was just against the Spread Eagle public-house—he was sitting down on a step at the corner as he is lame—from what I was told afterwards I was induced to hasten round my beat, and as I had got about half-way down Edward-street, which is a very dark street, I saw a kind of a scuffle at the further end; that could not have Keen more than 3 or 4 minutes after I had seen him—I then heard a kind of a <hi rend="italic">skreak</hi> or halloo, a faint noise, and I directly ran towards the spot—as I ran into the Kingsland-road Mr. Brown was on the ground, pointing with a stick which he had in his hand towards the Kingsland-road—I ran in that direction, and saw the two prisoners on a kind of run or dog-trot—they were together—I went and caught hold of the pair of them by the cuff of the coat and said, "I want you;" one of them, I do not know which, said, "What for?" I said, "For that assault round the corner;" I did not know what was the matter at the time—as soon as I had said that I was kicked off my legs by both of them, but I had got secure hold of them, and in the scuffle I got on my feet again—I then let Houghton go, as he was in my right hand, and I knocked Hisley down with my fist—I found they were too much for me, and I was afraid of losing both—I then fell upon Hisley, and sprang my rattle and called out, and shortly afterwards Houghton was brought back by another constable; it might have been five minutes—I was struggling with Hisley very violently on the ground—I have not the least doubt that Houghton is the one that escaped from me—they were both under a lamp when I took hold of them—they were taken to the station—about that time I saw Mr. Brown with another constable; he was sober, he might have had a glass of ale, but there was nothing visible in him—I looked at his throat, it was inflamed all underneath as if it had been recently done—I did not see the bruises on his face till the morning—his neckerchief was undone and his clothes were very dirty and dusty.</p>

               <p>had been drinking, and was it not for that reason that you cautioned him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I cautioned him, knowing the females to be prostitutes—we do that when we see them together in the suspicious manner they were—one was leaning over him and the other one had got hold of him round the waist as he sat there—when I went up and cautioned him, one of them went away; I do not know what became of the other—I left him to go round my beat—I am quite sure they were not endeavouring to raise him up—I did not think he was in liquor—when I saw the prisoners they were neither running or walking, it was a sort of trot; I know they can run, but they were going then at something between a sharp walk and a run.</p>

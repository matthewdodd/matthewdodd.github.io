                  </hi>. I belong to France, and have been servant to Monsieur Laland, I suppose three years, or three years and a half. When we came to this country we lived at Mrs. Kerley's—I and Monsieur Laland slept in the same room—there was one room with two beds—I cooked for him, in Mrs. Kerley's kitchen—I remember once, when my master was not at home, Mrs. Kerley and I were sitting in the kitchen—I do not know what month it was in—it was this year—Mrs. Kerley asked me several times whether Monsieur Laland had any money in his boxes, and I replied, "Yes"—Mrs. Kerley asked me if Monsieur Laland was gone to the Post<lb></lb>office—I said, "Yes"—(it was on a Friday)—she asked me again whether I was quite sure Monsieur Laland's money was in his box—I said, "Yes"—she went into her apartments for some pin, and gave me a glass, and made me sit down by the fire—she said Monsieur Laland had plenty of money in his box, and if I liked to take it she had keys that would open</p>

               <p>it—she got up from her chair, and locked the kitchen door—she gave me two glasses of gin and water before she locked the door—they were good-sized glasses—not very large—the gin stupified me—Mrs. Kerley locked the kitchen door—she made me drink another glass, making three glasses, and then I went to sleep—when I awoke I heard a noise—I went into my master's room, and saw Mrs. Kerley, with Monsieur Laland's money in her hand, and the key, and at the same time she pushed the box under the bed with her feet—he kept his money in a girdle in a box—when I went in, I said to Mrs. Kerley, "You have taken Monsieur Laland's money, and have not left him any"—she said, yes, there was a good deal left; she had not taken all—she said, "Oh, Marie, don't tell Monsieur Laland of my robbing the sovereigns, and ten for you"—she gave me ten—I was not altogether recovered from the effects of the gin—my head was still affected—she gave me the money, and some paper, and told me to put the money into the paper, and the following day we should go to the Borough market and buy a purse—on the evening of the next day we went to buy a purse—it was at a woman's, who sells things in the market—when we arrived there, she said she came to buy a purse to put file money is—I was going to buy one for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but she recommended me to buy one for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which would have two pockets in it, to divide my money—I was going to pay with a sovereign, but she recommended me not; she would give me shilling to pay, which she did—I got home at night, and had some more gin, and oranges, which we bought on the road home—we drank half a pint of gin—I changed a sovereign on Sunday, to buy gin and apples, in he same street—Mrs. Kerley recommended me not to change the sove<lb></lb>reign where I went for the gin, because my master might go there, and hear of my changing it—she said the next week we would go and buy clothes, and for me to quit my master to go to Jersey—I bought some calico, some flannel, a pair of gloves, and stockings—on Sunday Monsieur Laland spoke to a policeman, who said he would find, as a constable, to come and inquire into it—when I heard of the constable coming I spoke to Mrs. Kerley about it, and said Monsieur Laland had lost a great deal of money, and recom<lb></lb>mended her to put it back—she said, "You must not tell Monsieur Laland I have taken his money, or we may both be transported"—I cried, and she said, "Don't cry, Marie; never mind"—she did not say any thing else—when Monsieur Laland and the constable were both gone out, Mrs. Kerley old me to put the eight sovereigns which I had, between the sheet and the feather-bed—two sovereigns had been spent—she told me at the same time to put the purse down the privy, as the constable might search her—I gave this account to my master—two weeks passed before I told him, because we had agreed together to divide the money, and go to Jersey.</p>

Laland came home, and found me in bed, the ten sovereigns were in my pocket wrapped up in paper—I was asleep when he came in—he said, Where is Marie?"—Mrs. Kerley said, "Marie no good; gone to bed"—I</p>

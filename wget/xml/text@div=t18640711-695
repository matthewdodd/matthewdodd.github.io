                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at 48, Cloudesley-terrace, Islington—on 28th June, about a quarter to 1 o'clock at night, I was in Hatton-garden—I crossed from the west to the east side, and heard some one coming behind me—I turned round instantly, and received a kick on the heel from the prisoner—there was a lamp there—he then seized me, and pinned me by the soft part of my arms most painfully, and ray hand was seized till the bones <hi rend="italic">scranched</hi>—I was then thrown on my back, and robbed of my gold watch, worth twenty guineas, from my waistcoat-pocket—they broke the chain off the swivel—there were two other men with the prisoner—the prisoner is the man who held me—he was in front of me, because I wheeled round—I was kicked, and have a very severe and painful wound on the left knee-cap—they tried. to take my ring, but I bent my finger—my arm was very much lacerated—a gentleman came up and assisted me, and</p>

               <p>hearing his footsteps they started off with my watch—the prisoner attempted to take my gold studs, and one of them was bent—he tore the breast of my shirt, but could not disengage them—on 2d July I was sent for to the police-station, and selected the prisoner from eight or nine men, as the man who robbed me—I had given a description of him and his confederates the same night.</p>

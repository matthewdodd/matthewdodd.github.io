                  </hi> I am carman to David Wheatcroft, who is in partnership with his son—they are carries. On the 22nd Nov. I stopped with my van in Stoney-lane, Tooley-street—I went into a public-house—I was called out in five minutes, and missed a rope—I went with Woods to Bermondsey-street—the male prisoners were standing in a shop at the counter, and Baker was behind the counter, with a handful of halfpence, as if she was going to pay them—she said something, but I had hold of them, and did not hear what it was—I did not see any rope then—I asked the boys if they had stolen the rope from my van—they said, "No"—I asked Baker what she was going to do with the halfpence—she said she was going to pay the boys for a little bit of old iron which they brought her—Woods said to the boys, "I can swear to you, I saw you take it"—Sullivan said, "You can't"—I said if they would give the rope up to me, I would let them go, and would not send for a police<lb></lb>man—I told Baker so a dozen times, and begged and prayed of them to give it up, but they would not, nor would Baker—I went for a policeman, who searched the place, and brought down this piece of rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it be<lb></lb>longs to David Wheatcroft—Sullivan said, "I wish we had told you the truth; we did steal the rope, but the woman has not bought it yet"—Baker said that was the first time she had seen it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; we were married the day before Christmas-day, 1843. On the 15th of Jan., I was at breakfast with my sister, Margaret Haynes—nobody else was in the room, but my children—I poured out a cup of coffee and put milk to it, and then some sugar—I found the milk curdled—I did not notice that till I put the sugar to it—I drank that cup of coffee—I poured out another cup, and put rather more sugar to it, and it curdled a great deal more than the first—it was as if the milk turned into curds almost directly I put the sugar in—I had put no milk to the second cup, but it curdled so that I could not drink it—I did not drink any of it—I then poured some coffee into a bason—I tasted it without any sugar, and that was very good—there was a peculiar taste to the first cup like acid—I tasted the sugar, and that was very acid indeed—I took the sugar to Mrs. Peddle, who we lodge ith, and asked her to taste the sugar—my sister took the sugar to Mr. Chave—about five minutes after I had taken the coffee I felt very sick, and pains in my stomach—I got advice, and took an emetic in about two hours—that relieved me from pain—my husband had come home between nine and ten o'clock the night before, and got up about eight in the morning—I got up soon after—he left the room before me—some of the sugar had been purchased on the Saturday night before by my sister—this was on Wednesday—my husband had brought some sugar in on Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, and both portions were put together, and it was that I used on Wed<lb></lb>nesday—we had used it for breakfast and tea every day—soon after my husband had gone from the bed-room to the sitting-room, I heard a rat<lb></lb>tling of crockery, as if it was thesugar-basin—this is the basin—the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On what terms have you been living with your husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not very good terms—we were in the habit of quarrelling—he frequently said he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for me and the child, and then go for a soldier—he said so the week before—I had been out of the house on the Monday before this happened, but not on Tuesday at all—no one but my sister had access to the rooms—we lived with my mother—we had the bed and sitting-rooms to ourselves—my sister was with us, and always breakfasted with us—my husband did not breakfast there that morning—he was gone when I came out of the bed-room—my sister came into the room after I had poured the first cup of coffee out—she had not been in the room since the night before—I went to a surgeon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you learn that on Wednesday morning he had gone with Mary Milton to Hanworth-park? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never heard so—I went to Mrs. Bevis with the policeman, and she said he was gone for a soldier—he came home on Tuesday night after I was in bed—I was awake—the sugar was put in the same place on Tuesday as Wednesday—the sitting-room door was closed in the morning after he got up—it was open the night before—the bed is close to the door—there is only a wainscot between the two rooms—I opened the bed-room door when I heard the noise, and saw the prisoner coming away from the shelf—I was not asked that before the Magistrate—the shelf is opposite the door—he was coming more towards my bed-room door—I said nothing to him—I merely opened the door—I did not open it for any thing particular—he never told me he had been driven into this marriage—he did not wish to get out of it that I know of—he has said he wished he had not married till he was out of his time—he wished he could get work—my sister slept in the room with us that evening, and the prisoner would go into the next room to dress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's sister, and live in the same house with her. On the Saturday evening before the accident I brought in a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, and put it into the sugar-basin—from that time till Wednesday I took breakfast and tea with my sister, and used this sugar—I perceived no ill effects from it—on Wednes<lb></lb>day morning when I came into the room my sister was sitting at breakfast—she had just poured out a cup of coffee when I came in, and she thought the milk had turned—she drank it, and said what a peculiar taste it had—I observed it was as if the milk had turned—the milk had been put in—the coffee was boiled in milk and water—she poured out another cup, and I suppose must have put rather more sugar into that, for it turned a great deal more than the first—she had put no milk to that, but it was boiled in milk and water—I did not notice any curdling before the sugar was put in—I did not drink any of it—she poured some coffee into a basin, and it was very good till she put the sugar to it—we then had suspicion that it must be the sugar—I took the sugar and coffee in the basin to Mrs. Peddle, and afterwards to Mr. Chave the chemist—I tasted a few of the curds out of the second cup—it made my mouth feel very rough—I have heard the prisoner say he would poison his wife—he often said he would kill her—he said he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for her and the child, and then go for a soldier—I heard him say so I believe the week before this occurred—I thought he was in fun, and said, "Would you give me a dose too?"—he said no, he would spare my life—I felt nothing more from what I took—I once saw him sharpen a razor, and next morning my sister told me he had put it under the pillow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five weeks before—we were laughing when he spoke of going for a soldierv—he gave me the money to get the sugar on Saturday, and on Sunday he said he was sorry he had given me the money for sugar on Saturday, as his mother had got some, and he had mixed them together—my sister was present—there was no more sugar got after that—I slept in my sister's room on Tuesday—the prisoner got up about eight o'clock—I was in bed then, and remained till he got up—we lodge there with Mrs. Peddle, who has a husband and two children at home—my mother lived with us—it is my mother's lodg<lb></lb>ings—we have lived together since the prisoner has been out of work—I do not remember my mother threatening to send him to prison if he did not marry my sister—I was not at the wedding—I did see my sister strike him with a poker—he left her once, and she sent him to prison for refusing to support her when she was ill—he was then in a situation—his mother lives nearly opposite us—they were married in Dec., and I think in April he went to a situation at Mr. Anderson's—he is twenty years old next month.</p>

               <p>which has been produced, and a small portion of sugar in it—I took the sugar out, and gave the greater portion to Mr. Rayner, the surgeon, to analyse—I saw the prosecutrix—she seemed very poorly, looked very ill indeed—she was sitting down at the station—I went to the prisoner's mother's, but did not find him—I found him in custody in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. On Wednesday, the 17th of Jan., Margaret Haynes brought some sugar to me in a basin, I analysed it, and found it contained oxalic acid, I part in 20—a tea-spoonful or two of such a minute quantity taken by a grown person would have no immediate dele<lb></lb>terious effect—a tea-spoonful would contain three or four grains—I can<lb></lb>not say whether it would produce any ultimate danger, that is more the province of a medical man—it might produce pain and sickness—some coffee was brought in a basin, but I did not examine that—the milk was curdled, which might be produced by oxalic acid or any other acid—I believe there was acid in the coffee.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sheerness Dockyard—in 1866 I was living there with my sister-in-law, Miss Janet Gray—about April, 1866, she showed me an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> newspaper, relating to an advance of money, purporting to come from Mr. Wood, of 15, Dover Place, Kent Road—it was similar to this advertisement produced: "Money to lend, in town or country, to gentlemen, farmers, tradesmen, and others, from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards, upon personal security. Interest five per cent. per annum. One to seven years. No commission or charge made. Also sums on mortgage at three and a half per cent. on freehold and leasehold property, for any term not exceeding 21 years. T. Wood, Esq., Solicitor, 15, Dover Place, S. E. Established 1829."—My sister-in-law was in want of a loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I answered the advertisement for her—I received by post a reply, dated April 3rd, 1866, on a letter with a printed heading: "15, Dover Place, and 178, New Kent Road, London, S. E., late 7, Cook's Court, Lincoln's Inn. T. G. Wood." (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the lady wishing to barrow must make application herself and give par<lb></lb>ticulars of amount and term, and would have to insure her life in an office named by him</hi>.) I wrote and gave the name of a reference. On the 14th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270076"></xptr>
               <p>April I received this letter, addressed to my sister (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing a form of insurance proposal for the Albion, and directing the applicant to go to Dr. Ward, of Sheerness</hi>). My sister went to the doctor, filed up the form, and re<lb></lb>turned it, but I do not know where to. On April 18th I received a letter signed "George Thompson."(<hi rend="italic">This was headed "Albion Life Assurance Society, "and stated that the proposal of insurance for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was accepted, and the premium was</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) On April 19th, I received a letter signed T.G. Wood. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that if a cheque or post-office order were sent to him he would get the policy</hi>.) Upon that I got a post-office order for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sent it to Wood. I afterwards received this receipt, dated 20th April, for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. The 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the doctor's fee. I afterwards received this policy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated 25th April. On 1st May I received a letter from Wood, addressed "Dear Madam."(<hi rend="italic">This asked for the policy and</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to defray the law charges incidental to the loan</hi>.) On the receipt of that letter I went with Miss Gray to 15, Dover Place—we saw Mr. Wood—we introduced ourselves to him, and spoke about the advance—we asked him if there would be any difficulty in securing the advance; he said, "None whatever," upon which we paid him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which he gave us this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Dated 2nd May</hi>, 1866)—the policy was left with him—I afterwards received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Dated 3rd May, forwarding draft securities for approval</hi>)—the drafts were a personal bond, an assign<lb></lb>ment of the policy, a statutory declaration to be made before a Magistrate, something to be signed by two sureties, and a bill of sale—I recommended my sister not to entertain it for a moment, and wrote to Wood on the subject—I afterwards received this letter, signed "T.G. Wood," dated 5th May. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that all the drafts were in accordance with the written authority, and unless they were complied with the matter could not proceed</hi>.) Several other letters were received, and I think we saw Wood a second time—we received this letter, dated May 7th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the bill of sale must he registered</hi>.) On 9th May we received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the names of securities had not been sent</hi>), and on 11th May this letter (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the securities could not be dispensed with</hi>)—Miss Gray is not here; she is ill—this is a copy of a letter written by my wife—all the letters are my dictation, and signed by Miss Gray, who is nearly blind—I wrote the fair copy of this letter; Miss Gray signed it, and I posted it. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Mr. Wood, returning the papers received, stating that Mr. Harris would become her security, and requesting the agent to call on Monday to conclude the business</hi>.) We afterwards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated May</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd, signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">T.G. Wood," stating that, having seen his client again, he declined to dispense with two sureties, and therefore returned the life policy</hi>.) I then sent this letter to the same address. (<hi rend="italic">This expressed surprise at the return of the policy, and requested arrangements to be made for the agent's visit</hi>.) On 28th May I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Mr. A, Mayall had consented to become the second security for Miss Gray</hi>.) To that we received this answer. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated May 29th, signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">T.G.

On 1st June I got this letter on the same letter paper (<hi rend="italic">Signed "T. G.

On 4th June I received this acknowledgment, addressed to Mr. James <hi rend="italic">Hanley</hi>—I think I saw Mr. Wood twice, but this is twelve years ago—on 6th June I received this letter from 15, Dover Place: "Yours received. Mr. Wood will, on his return from Scotland next week, attend to this matter "—on 14th June Miss Gray received this letter: "Dear Madam,—Your proposed security, Mr. Mayall, has refused to become security for you, and I have received an extraordinary letter from Mr. Horsey"—I sup<lb></lb>pose I had upbraided him for raising the question of sureties—this is a copy of a letter of 15th June written by my wife, but indited by me; the rough was written first, and then I made the fair copy from my wife's writing, and Miss Gray signed it—it was signed unquestionably, but I have no recollection of posting it—I put it into an envelope, and addressed it myself to Wood at 15, Dover Street—I put it in a letter-box in the lobby at my official residence, which is cleared twice a day by a letter<lb></lb>carrier—it is impossible for me to say that Miss Gray never posted a letter or directed the envelope herself. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the writer had expended nearly</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and called upon Wood to complete the loan. Another letter from the same to the same, was put in, stating that Mr. A. Mayall was perfectly willing to become security, and requesting an immediate reply</hi>.) I then wrote this letter without date: "I have just received a note from my friend Mr. Mayall, in which he informs me that you have thrown suspicion upon my circumstances. My official salary is equal to 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."<hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">and threatening to hand over the whole correspondence to Mr. H. Chamber<lb></lb>lain, solicitor, of Chancery Lane</hi>)—on 3rd July Miss Gray received this letter from Wood, stating that his client would require a bill of sale, so much demur having been occasioned—I refused to give a bill of sale—I do not think I wrote to that effect, but the matter dropped, and the policy was not renewed at the end of the year—this is the printed pro<lb></lb>posal; it is filled up by Mr. Horsey and signed by Miss Gray—it is my impression that the heading had the name and address written on it when it came—I read the advertisement, and believed the terms stated in it—in 1871 I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> similar to this: "Money to lend," &amp;c. (<hi rend="italic">as before</hi>), apply to R.F. Preston, Esq., 120, Southampton Row, London, W. C.—I was in want of a small loan, and an<lb></lb>swered it, and received by post this letter, dated 17th June. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Contended that this was not evidence, as there was no proof of Preston's signa<lb></lb>ture or of who he was</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>

This is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed" Reginald F. Preston, dated</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1871, <hi rend="italic">in reply to the witness's application for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l., offering to lend that sum on deposit of a life policy for</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in an office to be selected by him</hi>.) I had applied for the loan for three years at 5 per cent., and sent the names of references—I then received a letter signed "R.F. Preston," enclosing form of agreement and consent to borrow—I did not keep copies of them, and am speaking from memory—I wrote to Mr. Preston at the same address on 22nd June, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270078"></xptr>
               <p>sent the documents signed, and on the 23rd I received this letter: "You will have to give your bond, and assign the policy to me, R. F. Preston.") I afterwards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "R.F. Preston, June</hi>. 26," <hi rend="italic">and enclosed an insurance proposal, with directions to apply to a medical referee</hi>.) This form of the Albion was enclosed, and my impression is that my name and address were upon it when I received it—I filled it up for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated it "27th June, 1871," and sent it back either to the office or to Mr. Preston—I afterwards paid the premium, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at the Albion Office, Chancery Lane. (<hi rend="italic">The receipt was here put in, and a certificate that the witness's life was insured, and that a policy should be prepared</hi>.) I got that at the office—I will not be certain whether the policy was sent to me or not—I then received this letter: "18th July. Dear Sir,—What are you doing about the insurance? Yours truly, R.F. Preston"—I called at 120, Southampton Row, which is a private house, and inquired for Mr. Preston—I think there was a lower office; but a clerk handed me upstairs, where I saw William Shaw to the best of my belief—I said who I was, and that I had called about the advance—he said that there would be no difficulty; I should have to insure my life and deposit the policy with him, and the advance would be made: no other conditions were imposed—my impression was that I was addressing Mr. Preston—I do not remember whether the policy was sent to me from the office; but I afterwards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th August, asking for a post-office order for</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s. to defray legal and inci<lb></lb>dental charges</hi>.) I then wrote this letter: "5th August. Will you give me a written assurance that nothing in the shape of a bill of sale is in<lb></lb>tended, and on the receipt of your reply I will at once remit you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for legal charges"—on 7th June I received the reply from R.F. Preston, stating that a bill of sale would not be required—I then dent a post-office order for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Preston, and received this acknowledgment, and on August 10th this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing five draft securities for perusal and approval</hi>.) The securities were precisely the same as I had received from Wood, a statutory declaration, a bill of sale, and documents to be signed by two sureties, a bond, and an assignment of the policy—I think I sent them back, and said that I would have nothing to do with them—I then received this letter of 15th August from Preston. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that his solicitor advised him not to dispense with the securities, and asked for the names of two substantial securities before proceeding further</hi>.) I had, I think, called on the previous day at 120, Southampton Row, and saw the fourth prisoner, Mr. Preston (William Shaw)—I do not remember whether I took the documents with me; but I objected to sign them, and he said that they could not be dispensed with, or something of that kind—I then got the letter just read, and on 16th August I wrote a letter, of which this is a copy. (<hi rend="italic">This expressed astonishment at Mr. Preston's letter of yes<lb></lb>terday, and called upon him to proceed with the loan</hi>.) On the 17th I received this answer: "Dear Sir,—My solicitor states that you must give two sureties if you desire the matter to proceed"—the heading of that letter and the address is printed, but the "Dear Sir" is not—I called two or three times, but could not see him—I then sent this letter to Mr. Preston. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had made several attempts to see him at his office, and calling upon him to refund the</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s. which had been obtained by positive misrepre<lb></lb>sentation, in default of which the correspondence would be placed in the hands of Mr. Bristow, the solicitor to the Admiralty</hi>.) On 9th September I received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270079"></xptr>
               <p>this letter: "Sir,—Herewith by this post I return policy of insurance. You had better instruct your solicitor to communicate with me"—I re<lb></lb>ceived the policy by book post—I then communicated with Mr. Copeland, a solicitor of Sheerness, and this is a letter sent to him: "September 15. Sir,—What I have done in this matter is in strict accordance with your client's written authority, dated 22nd June"—I produce a letter of 18th October from Preston to Mr. Copeland: "I can only refer you to my last. and am quite prepared to meet any proposal you may advise your client to adopt"—I did not renew my policy; it was only effected for the loan—at the time I paid my premium and sent the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believed the statements contained in Preston's advertisement. Some time after<lb></lb>wards I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the insurance office to Mr. North<lb></lb>cott.

I had no knowledge that Mr. Preston, or anybody representing him, had any connection with the Albion, or how the premium was disposed of—about 1874 I saw this ad<lb></lb>vertisement. (<hi rend="italic">This was an advertisement</hi> (<hi rend="italic">No</hi>,4) <hi rend="italic">from Henry Howard</hi>, 11. <hi rend="italic">Euston Square</hi>.) When I read that I went to 11, Euston Square—I believe it was a private house—the name of Howard or Holland was on the door—I knocked, and I believe the door was opened by Slinker—I inquired for Mr. Howard—he desired me to wait a few minutes—he went upstairs—I was shown upstairs, and in about 10 minutes Wood came in—I inquired whether there was any difficulty in obtaining an advance of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked "Where is Mr. Howard who advertises?" he said "You can't expect to see him, he is engaged in the City, "or words to that effect—nothing more passed, I was not with him more than two or three minutes—I recognised him as the person I had seen at 15, Dover Place, he seemed confused, I thought he recognised me unmistakably—I did not want a loan—I said "Good morning," and left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I cannot recollect very well whether the name was Holland or Howard, I think it was Howard, it is about four years ago—to the best of my belief Slinker is the man I saw on that occasion—Miss Gray is my sister-in-law—she is in a feeble state of health, and nearly blind—she has been ailing for years—I wrote the letters for her, being more accustomed to official matters—the money that was to be raised on her bond was not to be used to pay off loans I had made to her; there was an account between us—she resided with me as a member of the family for some years—she had a claim against me—she acted as a sort of nursery governess—she came from America about 1860, and has been living with me since—the money was to pay me a claim I had against her—the loan was not exactly for my benefit, I was to have had part of the money—her father, mother and brothers, and a sister were dead—I did not attend before Mr. Ward, the doctor who signed the paper—I think it was a Dr. Jack, of Sheerness—the loan was to be repaid in five years—we should have jointly provided the money for the repayment—Miss Gray has a small Government annuity, and the interest in some houses at Portsmouth; neither of those were to be se<lb></lb>cured for the repayment of the loan—I may have had small advances before, but whatever I have had I have always repaid—I did not pay anything like 40 or 50 per cent.—the loan of 1866 my sister required for repairing houses principally—I decline to answer whether I went else-</p>

               <p>where for the money when I failed to get this loan—I don't see that it has any bearing on the question—I had no loan transactions with other persons before 1866, I may perhaps have had one—I acted for Miss Gray in this matter—if I said that the name of Wood appeared in the Law List, I suppose I had referred to the Law List to see, before commencing the correspondence, I have no recollection, it is 12 years ago—I never commenced any proceedings at law against Wood, I had expended quite enough.</p>

When I went to 120, Southampton Row, I saw William Shaw, perhaps two or three times—I don't hint he opened the door to me, when I saw him he was in the room upstairs—I don't think I saw anybody else there besides a clerk—I am not aware whether there was any name on the door—I asked for Mr. Preston, I stated what my business was—I did not know of my own knowledge that there was a warrant out for Preston—I believed that the letters I received were signed by him, by the man I saw upstairs.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was the one to apply to T. G. Wood, Esq</hi>., 15, <hi rend="italic">Dover Place, S. E</hi>.) In consequence of seeing that, I wrote a letter to that address, applying for a loan of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in reply I received these documents, purporting to come from that address—I believe there are one or two missing—I have looked up all that were in my possession—the loan was to be made on condition that I insured my life in an office named the Albion, for double the amount of the proposal—I offered to insure for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was agreed to—I ultimately received this form of proposal—I can't say whether there was any writing on it when it first came into my possession—I filled it up and forwarded it, I can't say whether to Wood or to the office; no doubt it was to Wood—I was examined by a medical man in my own locality—I believe his fee was deducted from the premium—I remitted the premium for the half-year to Wood—he wrote back saying it must be paid yearly—I received a letter of 22nd March, asking me to send the policy, and the matter would be completed within four days—I received from him receipts for the two sums I sent—the policy came to me—I afterwards sent it back to the Albion, with a few remarks written on it—I received these five drafts. (<hi rend="italic">These were a personal bond for</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">an assignment of the policy, a statutory declaration, a bill of sale, and a guarantee of two sureties</hi>.) On 1st May I received a letter on the same printed heading "Be good enough to forward the drafts to me with any remarks upon them. Yours truly, T. G. Wood." I think I retained these drafts, I don't think I ever parted with them—on 10th May I received another letter, "You must send me the names of your proposed sureties, they must not be relatives"—when I threw up the negotiation I required the policy to be returned to me, and it was sent to me by him—it appears by this letter of 7th June that I did part with the draft securities, I sent them to him and he returned them to me—at the time I sent the two portions of the premium, and the money for expenses, I believed the statements contained in the letters and in the advertisement—not a word was said in reference to these five securities until after I had paid my money—I did not renew my premiums.</p>

I am now living at 17, All Saints Street, Hull—I am a grocer—in March, 1873, I was living at Sunderland; in that month I saw an advertisement in a local paper similar to this (No. 4): "Money to be lent in town or country, &amp;c., apply to Henry Howard, 11, Euston Square"—in consequence of that advertisement I applied for a ban of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by letter to that address, and in reply I received this letter, dated on a printed heading 3rd March, 11, Euston Square, London.

(<hi rend="italic">These were identical with those already produced</hi>)—when I saw Seymour in London nothing was arranged as to what security I was to give—I had not signed anything—he offered to lend me the money according to the advertise<lb></lb>ment, by my insuring my life and letting him have the policy, that was all—I say positively that no other security was suggested up to the time when I left London—I came to London again and went to 9, Greet Russell Street and saw Alfred Shaw, and a rather severe altercation took place—I called him William Seymour, of course—I told him it was very unmanly to act towards me as he had, and to put me to such trouble and expense—I told him it was not according to the advertisement—he said he would have the documents filled up before he would advance the money—I then went home—I came to town again and called at Greet Russell Street—I could not see him the first day—I saw a man who opened the door—I have seen that man in London since I have been here—I can't say his name—I ultimately saw Alfred Shaw again—in paying my money for the premium and legal expenses I believed the statements in the advertisement and in the letters I had from Seymour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman, of Thurbiton Rectory, Norwich—I was the plaintiff in the action of "Blake <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. The Albion Assurance Society"—in November, 1874, I saw the advertisement of Henry Howard (No. 4) offering to lend money—I answered it and applied for a loan of 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was for the purpose of buying a living—some correspondence passed between Mr. Howard and myself and I came up to London somewhere about 28th November, and during that week I called at 11, Euston Square—Slinker opened the door to me—I asked if Mr. Howard was at home—I believe he asked me whether it was by appointment—I said it was, that I had written—I gave my name and was shown upstairs—there was no one in the room at first, but Wood came in—I asked him if he was Mr. Howard; he said no, he acted for him in his absence; it was a foggy morning and Mr. Howard never came to town in a fog—I said I wished to see Mr. Howard particularly—he said "I will write to him by to<lb></lb>night's post and you can make an appointment later on in the week," which I did for the following Thursday—he said Mr. Howard was somewhere in the country, I think he said in Sussex—he did not give me any address—I went again on the Thursday, the 2nd or 3rd December, and saw Wood alone—I expressed my astonishment at not seeing Mr. Howard—he said he had received letters from Mr. Howard that morning stating that he was detained</p>

               <p>by business in the country, and he was authorised to take any instructions from me—previous to this, in answer to my first application, he had written to say that if I insured my life in an office to be named by him (Howard) I could have the money—he did not name the office then, he did on this Thursday, the Albion, in Chancery Lane—I believe before I left he gave me this form of proposal to fill up—the mauve writing on it is mine—the writing at the top is not mine—I can't say whether it was there when he gave me the proposal—it was not filled up by meor anybody else while it was in my possession—I kept it under look and key till I returned it—I believe it was already filled in—I brought the proposal to town with me about 30th December, and took it to 11, Euston Square, where I again saw Wood—Slinker opened the door to me—I asked for Mr. Howard, he said be was at home—I was shown into the office and waited there, and was offered the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to read—I was then shown upstairs—I supposed I was about to see Mr. Howard, but I found Wood, I think he followed me up<lb></lb>stairs—I again expressed my surprise at not seeing Mr. Howard—Wood said that he was authorised to take any instructions I gave him, and that he could manage the matter, it was the same as if I was going through the matter with Howard—I said I had called to-day to have a clear understanding as to what security would be required, that I wanted the money to go towards purchasing a small living; as the one I was holding for a relative I was about to give up in his favour—he said "No further security will be required," most distinctly—he gave me a book of tables of the Albion—I said "Won't you allow me to insure in the Clergy Mutual instead?"—he said "Mr. Howard only does business in the Albion"—before leaving he gave me the address of the Albion, and said "Go to the Albion and see the Secretary"—alter leaving him I went there, and asked for Mr. Northcott; I did not see him, I was told he was engaged all day—I was examined by Dr. Hooper, and finally sent a cheque for 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for the first year's premium, by post to the Albion, somewhere about 10th or 12th January, after deducting a guinea for the medical fee—I addressed the letter to Mr. Northcott, Secretary and Manager of the Albion, and I received from him this receipt, which I sent by post to Howard—I then received from Howard this letter of 25th January: "By book post you will receive draft securities as prepared by my solicitor for perusal and approval, which please return at your convenience with any comments thereon"—these five documents came with that letter, a bill of sale, a statutory declaration, a bond, two securi<lb></lb>ties, and an assignment of the policy—up to the time I sent the receipt for my premium I had heard nothing about the necessity of signing such documents—I came to town that same afternoon, and wrote making an appointment for the next morning—I then called at Euston Square and saw Slinker—I asked for Mr. Howard, he said he was at home, as usual, and I had an interview with Wood again—I told him I had come to make my comments in person—he opened the bundle which I had brought with me, and said certain things were mere forms—I hardly recol<lb></lb>lect which paper he alluded to, he alluded to one of them; he made an erasure, and threw one paper on one side and said "Oh, this is mere matter of form"—I said "They appear to me not matter of form, but realities which I do not understand"—I said I would consider the matter, and took away the documents—next day I wrote saying I would have nothing to do with it, and returned the documents—I afterwards put</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 96, Ledbury Road, Bays<lb></lb>water—in the early part of 1875 I was living near Oswestry—I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>: "Money to lend in town or country upon personal security, apply to Henry Howard, Esq., C.

Northcott, Manager and Secretary—I called at the office and saw Northcott in reference to these conditions—I told him who I was, and my objections to the terms on the back of the memorandum—he said he would see the medical adviser of the Company, and if he reported my life was good, they would accept me on the usual terms—I went to see Dr. Hoopor, in London, and he passed me as an ordinary life—I had been supposed to be suffering from valvular disease of the heart—on the 9th</p>

               <p>March I received this letter from Howard: "Dear Sir, Write to the Insurance Company to reconsider the case"—I afterwards received a printed form from the Albion, accepting my life without the conditions, and on the 10th March I sent to the Albion two post-office orders amounting to 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the premium, deducting the guinea for the doctor's fee—about the same time I received the letter of the 11th March, and went to 11, Euston Square—there was a plate on the door with "Henry Howard" on it—I do not recollect whether there was "C. E." after it; the front door was open; I walked into the outer office; Slinker was there; I asked if Mr. Howard was in; he said he was out, but I could make an appointment if I liked—after that I received this letter of the 13th March: "Dear Sir,—Be kind enough to send me a post-office order for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for legal charges. H. Howard"—I wrote inquiring what it was for, and I received the reply of the 15th: "The 4 guineas is to pay legal and incidental expenses.

Miller and Game, and there the trans<lb></lb>action ended—I never received the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time I parted with my money for the premium and the 4 guineas for expenses I believed the statements in the advertisement and in the letters—my solicitors ulti<lb></lb>mately brought an action for me against Howard, and judgment went by default—I never got back the money I spent—about July, 1875, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">standard</hi>, of William Holland, 11, Euston Square—I observed that that was the same address as Howard, and I wrote to Holland under the name of Poole—I received the letter of the 6th July, and in what I did with Holland afterwards in the way of correspondence I had in my mind what had taken place with Howard—I received the letter of the 8th July from Holland, inclosing a form of consent</p>

               <p>similar in terms to the one in Howard's case, also these letters of 10th and 14th July, the last one signed "William Holland, late Howard"—on the 16th I wrote approving of the form of bond, and stating that I should be glad to know when I could attend to receive the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this reply of the 17th July: "Dear Sir,—I am waiting for you to return the consent"—I had mislaid it—I received another, which I filled up and forwarded, stating "I will give the necessary security according to the form of bond agreed upon, when can I call and get the money?"—I received this letter of the 27th July: "I never allow borrowers to dictate their own terms, and if you desire me to make this advance you must return me the paper I sent for your signature"—I replied, "According to your wishes I return you consent signed as required"—on the 30th I received this: "Be kind enough to send me post-office order for 4 guineas for legal chargos and other expenses inci<lb></lb>dental to your loan, on receipt whereof I will at once arrange for com<lb></lb>pletion. The 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be paid to you in full.

E.—I had noticed little while before a change of name in the advertisements from Howard to Holland—Slinker opened the door—I asked to see Mr. Holland—he said that be was not in, and asked what I wanted—I said I wanted to see Mr. Holland on private business—he said that I had better write to him or something of that kind, as he was down in the county somewhere sur<lb></lb>veying—I walked straight from there to the Albion Office, Chancery Lane, and asked for Mr. Northcott—I did not see him then but called next day and saw him for the first time—I did not give him my name—I said that I had been to Mr. Holland, 11, Euston Square, about a loan, and asked him if he knew the party, and if they were trustworthy and so on—he said that they had done some business with Mr. Holland which was satisfactory—I cannot remember the exact words—I said What has become of Mr. Howard?"—he said "He is dead, and Holland has taken his business"—he also said that he had had a great many transactions with Howard, and that they were perfectly satis<lb></lb>factory, and that they were money-lenders, I think.</p>

I have seen the solicitor to-day, and he has promised that no delay shall occur"—I then received this letter; "By this post you will receive drafts, which please return to me with any comments you may have to make.

By this post I send you your policy. The Mr. Holland you flame is not connected with this society"—the policy was in Northcott's hands because it had not been forwarded to me, and I must have written a letter to him complaining of the transaction, and asking for the policy—when I paid the premium and legal expenses I believed the statements in the advertisements and in the letters.</p>

               <p>there was a brass plate on the door with "William Holland" on it—I knocked at the door, Slinker opened it—I asked if Mr. Holland was in—he said "No"—I had a general conversation, explaining what I had called about—I told him I wanted to borrow 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the security of a policy for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Church of England office—I also told him that I could give security upon some commissions that were due to me—he said he would speak to Mr. Holland about it, and I should hear from him—he asked me at the same time if I would be willing to take out another policy in an insurance office to be named by them—I said I would, but I should like it to be another in the Church of England—he said it must be in an office of their own choosing—that was the substance of what passed; this conversation took place in the first room on the right going in—be took a note on a scrap of paper of what I required—I gave him my card and left—I afterwards received this letter of 27th November, signed "William Holland": "I can entertain your application. You will have to insure your life in an office selected by me for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., together with the one for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which you have already effected, as col<lb></lb>lateral security, the policies to be returned to you on repayment of the loan"—on receiving that letter I called again at 11, Euston Square, on the 29th—Slinker opened the door—I inquired for Mr. Holland—Slinker said he was in the City, he had a great deal of business in the City, and said either then or at one visit that he was sur<lb></lb>veying some property in Southwark—I told him that I had received the letter of the 27th, and agreed to take the money on the terms named—I said they were extraordinary easy terms, I could not understand hot they managed to do business that way, that it was very low interest for just the security of the policies—he said that was their business, and not any one else's, that they knew best—his words were "That is our busi<lb></lb>ness, we know best"—on the following day I received this letter dated 29th November, signed William Holland, enclosing this form of consent, also this insurance proposal—I signed the consent and returned it-my name and address was written on the top of the proposal when it came—I was examined by a medical man—in the meantime I received this letter of 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> December, ackowledging the receipt of the consent, also the letter of 2nd December: "If the Insurance Company have accepted your proposal, send them the premium and request them to get the policy completed"—on 2nd December I went again to 11, Euston Square—Slinker opened the door—I told him I was nearly certain that the life would be accepted—I called at the Life Office next day and found it had been accepted—I then called again at Euston Square and saw Slinker and told him to get everything in readiness so that there might be no delay—on 8th December I went to the Albion Office and paid the premium, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and got this receipt—I went and showed it to Slinker—he asked me to leave it, but I declined to do so until I got my policy—I inquired for Mr. Holland on that occasion—Slinker said he was out—I received this letter from W. Holland: "Be good enough to send me Insurance Company's receipt for premium"—I did not do so—I then received this letter of 9th December, signed Wm. Holland: "Be kind enough to send me post-office order for 3 guineas to defray the legal charges"—on the following day I went to Euston Square—I saw Slinker and said it was a preposterous thing to ask me to pay 3 guineas for deeds that were not drawn up—he said it was their usual way of business-as</p>

               <p>to the 3 guineas I said they could either deduct it, or else when the money was handed over to me I would return the 3 guineas to them—he said be would speak to Mr. Holland about it—the deeds I referred to were the transfer from the Church of England and the other: they were mentioned at nearly every visit—I understood that I should have to assign the two policies—that was mentioned by Slinker at my very first visit—as I was leaving on this last occasion William Shaw came in at the door; I think he opened the door himself—Slinker said, "Here is Mr. Holland," and he mentioned my name, "This is Mr. Clay"—William Shaw went up stairs—I waited down stairs for a few minutes and was then desired to walk up to the first-door room, where I saw William Shaw—there was a large table in the centre of the room, with catalogues of machinery and of property for sale—I said I could not be expected to pay the 3 guineas before I got the loan, that I showed my good faith by taking out the policy in the Insurance Office, and I thought that was quite sufficient to let him know that I intended to act straightforwardly to my bargain—he said he would consult hid solicitor, and see if it could be managed to let me pay it after—I then left—next day I got this letter, signed Wm. Holland: "Dear Sir,—As I never make any deductions, but hand over the amount of loan in full, you must remit the amount required to defray expenses, on receipt of which I will at once arrange for you to receive the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—on the 15th I called at the office in Euston Square—I saw Slinker and said I would pay him the 3 guineas under the distinct understanding that nothing more was required of me than the transfer of the policies—be said the loan would be carried out under the arrangement already made—I then paid the 3 guineas to Slinker in cash, and he went to the table and wrote, but it was too far off for me to see what he wrote—after writing at the table he handed me this receipt: "Received 15th December, 1876, of Mr. Thomas Clay, the sum of 3 guineas to defray the legal charges connected with the above advance. Wm. Holland"—that was all that passed on that occasion—I afterwards received this letter of 17th December by book-post, with these 5 documents (<hi rend="italic">as before</hi>)—there was no name at the bottom—on receiving those I went again to Euston Square with my wife on 18th December, taking the five documents with me—Slinker opened the door to me, as before—I asked for Mr. Holland—he said he was in and would see me in a few minutes if we would walk up stairs—we went up and sat down, and in about five minutes William Shaw came in—I introduced him to my wife as Mr. Holland—I put the drafts on the table and said they were quite contrary to everything that had been arranged before—I said that I did not object to the bill of sale so much, but I objected to the statutory declaration being in public before Magis<lb></lb>trates—he said that he could get over that by having it before a Commis<lb></lb>sioner—I objected to the sureties; I said it was impossible for me to get sureties, that they were more difficult to get than money, that many friends would advance me a small sum of money, but they would not become surety for me—he said that he would see the solicitors and try to see if they would recommend him to do away with the sureties—my wife then asked him when he was going to carry out his promise of advancing the loan—William Shaw replied: "I never do business with ladies"—she thereupon turned round to me and said "Just ask this man when he is going to carry out his promise"—he then got up, put</p>

Holland": "I have seen my solicitor, who states be cannot recommend me to dispense with any of the securities drawn by him; I must therefore request you to enter into the same accordingly and forward the names of two sureties as required by the draft guarantee"—I then wrote for the return of my money, and then got this letter of 23rd December from Holland: "What I have done in this matter is in strict accordance with your written autho<lb></lb>rity of 23rd November last. I am quite ready to complete, upon your complying with the required sureties"—I never got the loan or got back the 3 guineas—I did not renew my policy—I only insured in the Albion for the purpose of this loan—I received the policy direct from the office—I think I have it at home—at the time I paid the premium and the 3 guineas I believed the statements in the advertisement and the letters, that Holland was a surveyor, carrying on business at this place in the way stated—I bad no idea at all of any connection between Holland and the insurance office—I refused to pay the premium till they assured me at the office that no commission was paid on the premium—I saw two clerks there; they told me Mr. Northcott was out—I told them who I was in communication with, and they said no commission was paid—they looked in a book and said they had no agents, and that no commission would be paid on my policy.</p>

I live at Falmouth, and am a wine and spirit merchant—about May, 1876, I saw an advertisement of Holland, of 11, Euston Square, proposing to make advances on personal security and on freehold and leasehold property—on that I communicated with Holland—I wanted an advance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for five years at 5 per cent.—the whole transaction was carried on by this correspondence, extending from 19th May, 1876, to 4th July, 1877—I never called—it was suggested that I should insure in the Albion—I paid 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> July for the premium, less the doctor's fee, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the transfer of the policy to Holland—this is the cheque, crossed Union Bank of London, Chancery Lane, and payable to Holland or order, and it is endorsed "William Holland"—this is the proposal form; the writing at the top was there when I received it—about 15th July I received an application for 5 guineas for legal expenses—I sent this cheque for 5 guineas that day;</p>

Shaw and the clerk Slinker—Slinker told me that Mr. Holland was away, but that his manager would do as well—I had a conversation with William Shaw about the loan, and about not accepting the quarter's premium—I did not see Northcott in the course of the negotiations; I saw him afterwards, in May, 1877—I called at his office and asked him to show me their tables of premium—I said that a man of my age ought to be charged 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cent.; I was charged 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; altogether I was charged 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than I ought to have been charged—I pointed him out the mistake, and he said I was charged more because I was a foreigner—I said that on the receipt it particularly said if I was to go to India they would charge me extra, and I asked how could he charge me extra already—he said he would refer it to the committee—I wrote to him once again, but got no answer—I never got back my 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

White—ultimately I let the house to Mrs. Wood, who Wood said was his mother, to be let as offices on the ground floor—the rent was generally paid by Wood's cheque on the London and County Bank—I had several letters from Wood, four of which I pro<lb></lb>duce—the house was given up on March 29th—I called several times at Euston Square, and saw William Shaw, Alfred Shaw, and Slinker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Union Bank of London, Chancery Lane branch—in October, 1871, I took a position as junior clerk in the Albion Life Insurance Society, and remained there nearly four years, until August, 1875—soon after I went there a man named Williams used so call—I saw him at Bow Street under the name of Alfred Shaw—he called two or three times a month, sometimes a little oftener and some-times not so often—he sometimes brought proposals for insurances—there was an agency account in the name of Williams, and I believe he was paid 40 or 50 per cent, commission—his commissions were entered to his account—sometimes he saw Mr. Northcott and sometimes he just came in and left his proposal—Northcott occasionally left messages or notes for him—Northcott occupied a separate room, and Williams used to see him there—commissions were always paid to Williams by cheque—I have seen a number of receipts for commissions signed by him but I did not have anything to do with keeping the books, therefore they did not come under my notice in a regular way, but after the receipts have been signed I have seen them—the prisoner Wood used also to call once a week and sometimes wait for a considerable time—I never knew him by the name of Gard, nor had we an agent of that name to my knowledge—there was no one named Rogers there while I was there, but there was an account in the name of Rogers—I never saw a Mr. Ager—I do not remember an agent named Brown—I do not remember Wood bringing proposals for insurance, not so frequently as to strike me—proposals used to be brought into the office from him and they were carried to the account of Rogers—I do not think I saw Mr. Seymour or Hawkins—I have heard Preston alluded to in letters to the society, but never saw him, Girdleston, Barclay, Howard, or Holland—I have heard of Mr. Howard—I am not quite sure whether Wood brought proposals or not, but there were proposals from him, and when they came they were carried to Rogers' account—I think I have heard both Preston's and Howard's names mentioned by persons in the office, and I directed such persons to Mr. Northcott, the manager, in his room.</p>

Bennett, a solicitor, was also a director when I went—I do not recollect whether he was there when I left—Mr. Thompson was a director the whole time, and Mr. Arrowsmith, a merchant in Botolph Lane, and Mr. Pinkerton—I think that is all—when moneys or cheques were paid, receipts were taken in every case—the Board days were every Wednesday—cheques were only drawn on Board days—when a cheque was drawn for a commission and the person to whom it was due did not call for it, it would in some cases remain in the book for some considerable time—at other times it would he sent to him—they were in the habit of drawing the cheques by a</p>

Crockett, F. Crockett, H.T. Clegold and Mr. Copplestone—I find from the cash-book that those in gentlemen paid in 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between them by individual payments of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and think it states in the Articles of Association that these six gentlemen were the first six directors, but there are more names here—I find, on 23rd January, 1864, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Shire for building and furniture: that left a capital on 1st of February, 1864, of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 8th of April I find a loan of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. made to the society by Phelps and Co., solicitors, and on the 11th of April 1, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced to the society by Mr. Ray, who ultimately became a director, but I do not think he was a director at that time—it is impossible to tell what amount was paid up on the shares when the society started—6, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. appears here, out I know that is not correct—there is in the books an account of Mr. George Thomp<lb></lb>son, but you are going into Mr. Mollett's evidence—I shall be wasting time by attempting to do it—I took possession of all the letters I found belonging to the society, and this letter produced among them.

(<hi rend="italic">This was signed by Northcott, stating that the person mentioned had no connection with the society</hi>.)—here is a letter, dated 26th January, 1867, from T.K.

Mr. Heath's policy was introduced by Thomas Gard—the entry is among others, "Thomas Gard, L.W. Heath, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that is the amount of the premium—50 per cent, was paid to him on the whole of those premiums—the total amount of premiums introduced by him that month was 297<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., by Thomas Gard, the 50 per cent, commission being 297<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I find in letter-book 15 a letter, dated November 21, 1870, addressed to Griffiths by Northcott on August 15, 1849: "Dear Sir,—You have not sent me full particulars in Mr. Nicolady's case as promised; when writing again give me the names and addresses of the parties you refer to as acting as agents for this society"</p>

               <p>—here is also a letter from Griffiths of December 7: "The agents were Girdlestone and Barclay. I must have a definite reply of your cheque to-morrow."—I find in the letter-book this letter, of December 7, singed by Mr. Northcott: "I have not been able to see the advertisement referred to by you; let me know which paper it appeared in, and the date. The gentlemen named in yours of the 29th ultimo are not con<lb></lb>nected with this society, neither authorised to make use of the society's name in any way, therefore I do not see how you can ask us to surrender the policy. The rule is five years. If you think we should consider Mr. Nicolady's a special case I will lay it before the Board."—The letter of the 29th there referred to is this: "The parties are Messrs. Girlestone and Barclay, 11, Euston Square, who advertise in country papers more particularly."—I have found the letter of Mr. Griffiths, of 7th December, 1870 (<hi rend="italic">This called attention to the case of Mr. Nicolady, and stated that unless the money was refunded, proceedings would be taken against the directors, whose addresses were requested</hi>)—I find the letter-book, at page 950, a reply to that, signed by Mr. Northcott: "Before furnishing the information required I must asked you for what purpose you ask for a summons against the gentlemen you refer to; so far as I know, there is nothing in Mr. Nicolady's case but what could be dealt with by the directors if properly represented to them"—there is also a letter of 16th December, from Mr. Griffiths, asking for the addresses of the directors, auditors, and Mr. Northcott's own address, in order to take out summonses—at page 953 there is this reply of December 19th: "Sir—I am in receipt of yours of the 17th, and bet go state that this society has nothing whatever to do with the loan matter you refer to. I will bring the matter before our directors at their meeting, and communicate their decision to you. I think it would have been as well if your application had been made without any intimidation; your threat will out influence that directors of the Board in this case." In the 20th there is a letter from Mr. Griffiths to be placed before the Board, and the page 965 this reply from Mr. Northcott, of 22nd December, 1870: "I brought the matter before the Board yesterday, and am instructed to say that the usual rule of the society as to the surrender of policies can<lb></lb>not be departed from, the gentlemen named in your letter are not in any way connected with the society, and we cannot be answerable for their mis-statements. As an act of charity the directors would be willing to allow Mr. Nicolady 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a gratuity"—I find this minute on 21st December, "Mr. Nicolady's application for a surrender value of his policy was refused on account of the policy not having been long enough in existence to entitle him to a surrender value, accord<lb></lb>ing to the rules of the society. Present Messrs Arrowsmith (in the chair), Bennett, Thompson, and Pinkerton."—The minutes were after<lb></lb>wards read and confirmed on 4th January—on 3rd November, 1871, I find a letter relating to the case of Mr. Barnes, at page 425 of the letter-book No. 17: "Sir—I am not acquainted with the gentlemen named in yours of the 30th ultimo. Yours J.T. Northcott, Manger and Sec<lb></lb>retary."—That was in reply to letter from Mr. Barnes inquiring, "Do you know a Mr. H. Howard, of 11 Euston Square?"—At the premises of the Albion this blue paper was found with this advertisement attached, headed, "Miller Street, Manchester, November 3rd, 1871.

At page 471 of the letter-book there is a letter of 11th November, stating that Howard was not connected with the society—in the letter-book of 1875 I find this letter of August 7th, to Mr. Rogers: "Complaints have been made to me by some of the policy-holders introduced by you of the manner in which they have been treated by Mr. Howard of Euston Square, I of course know nothing of Mr. Howard's mode of transacting business beyond what I have heard from these policy-holders, but they have made such extraordinary statements that I feel I must decline to take any assurance business from you in future except such as is not connected with applications for loans. J.T. Northcott, Manager and Secretary."—There is a similar letter on the same date to Mr. J. Williams—there are no addresses to either Rogers or Williams—I have prepared a summary of the policies issued during the existence of the society, from April, 1864, to October, 1877—it is entirely taken from the books, and is correct—there are 6, 531 policies represent<lb></lb>ing an amount assured of 1, 766, 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 116 claims under policies through death; 34, 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid, and 504 were still in force at the time the company was wound up, leaving a liability on them of 126, 625<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I treat all the policies issued in 1877 as being in force—I cannot state at the moment how many of the policies were in existence for more than 12 months, I can do so by the morning—I have traced through the books through whose instrumentality these policies were introduced to the office—I find that Gard introduced 1432, representing assurances of 491, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Rogers, 2, 193, representing 534, 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Williams, 558, repre<lb></lb>senting 121, 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Brown, 391, representing 92, 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and Agar, 491, representing 149, 610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not find in the books the addresses of any of these agents, nor do I find the names of Wood, Howard, Holland Seymour, or Girdlestone and Barclay as agents—in the 14 years I find that 65, 233<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid in respect of premiums, exclusive of re<lb></lb>newals—the total amount of commission paid to Gard, by the books, is 8,084<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to Rogers, 8, 228<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for renewals; Brown, 1, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., renewals, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Williams, 1, 659<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., renewals, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Ager, 2, 296<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., re<lb></lb>newals 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making a total of commissions on policies 22, 429<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and renewals 638<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have here a number of receipts purporting to be by Gard, Williams, Rogers, and Ager for commissions received by them, and the cheques by which those commissions were paid—they are draws to a number.

Crockett—there is a letter of Mr. Pilkington's of 22nd June, 1864, applying to be appointed secretary at a salary of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and a commission of 20 per cent. on business introduced by him, and a memorandum of the directors appoint<lb></lb>ing him on the terms proposed—the first payment to Gard appears to be on 27th April, 1864, 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at that time he received the premiums, consequently he is debited with the amount and credited with his com<lb></lb>mission—I also find a memorandum in May, 1864, of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Pil<lb></lb>kington; that seems to be the earliest—it might be a payment for some<lb></lb>thing done in February, March, or April; it merely says "To cash 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and on the other side it begins "March, 1865, by transfer of salary account"—I may say that these books are not to be relied on in 1864 and 1865—there is nothing to show what that payment was for—there is another account of Pilkington's; it is merely a half-yearly premium paid in 1865—the total amount paid to Mr. Thompson is 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., commencing in April, 1864, down to the end of February, 1878—I cannot state what he was entitled to, or why that was paid to him; I have not gone into the 2 per cent, commission—he did not receive any money by way of interest on his shares; I don't think any of the directors did—there seems to have been no dividend paid, but they got credit for it in the books—the sum of 126, 605<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not represent actual liabilities—it would be an actuary's duty to value those; I am not an actuary, but I shall have to do it in a great measure in the course of the liquidation—at the time Mr. Thompson resigned his post of managing director in December, 1869, the amount, of the premiums on renewed policies was 3, 381<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the renewed premiums for 1877 were 3,083<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so they had decreased by about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in some years they had increased; one was 3, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another 3, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another 3, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have Mr. Thompson's share account here; he had 60 shares to start with, then 20, and then 50—they all appear to be fully paid up—l, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to him on his resignation as managing director; that was carried to the credit of his share account—he held 270 shares when he went out, when the winding-up order was made—they are all fully paid up, to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is an unlimited company—there is an interest account, but you cannot tell what interest is due unless it is analysed; 1, 740<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the presumed interest due to Mr. Thompson, but the Board of Trade would not pass the accounts with this interest in them—I have a letter from Mr. Knox Holmes, dated January, 1867, enclosing Mr. Heath's letter to Thompson—I know that Mr. Holmes resigned his directorship—from the time Mr. Thompson resigned, Mr. Northcott acted as manager and secretary.</p>

I have examined the writing in these cheques, and also on this memorandum signed William Shaw—hat enables me to form an opinion of his writing—I have carefully gone through all the documents on this list—I have to make one correction—this 26 ought to be 22—I have looked at the letters signed R.

F. Preston, of 21st April, 1st May, and a portion of a letter dated 19th March, 1873; also a letter signed J.P. Hudson, and the wrapper enclosing draft securities referring to Mr. Viney, found at 11, Euston Square, are a large portion of them in the same writings—if I remember rightly there is more of William Shaw's writing than anybody else's—here are two lists of country newspapers, one in William Shaw's writing and another in George Shaw's writing—this authority of William shaw to Thomas haw found at Thomas Shaw's lodgings, is also George Shaw's writing—I have also examined a number of commission receipts, shown me by Mr. Smart, and signed T. Rogers, G. Williams, and William Brown—some of them are in William Shaw's writing, but many are not—this copy of a letter to Blagden is in William Shaw's writing, but it is not signed—here are some commission receipts in Woodman's case, signed T. Rogers, and some in Clay's case, and R.E. Thomas's case, signed William Brown, and two signed W. Brown in Shroff's case, and one signed William Brown in Hamilton's case; are all William Shaws writing—this affidavit, signed Wm. Shaw, is William Shaw's writing (<hi rend="italic">This was in the cause of Hislop</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Holland, sworn</hi> 27 <hi rend="italic">November</hi>, 1877)—I have examined the writing of this letter and envelope produced, also the blotting paper which has been produced by the police, and the writing "Samuel Bilton"—I had formed an opinion about it before I was told of it, and I have subsequently learned that it was proved to be George Shaw's writing—I have carefully examined the blotting paper, and there is the blotting of this very letter to Mrs. Ellison upon it, and the address, "111, Ball's Pond Road"—I also find on the blotting paper the impression of some names clearly in George Shaw's writing—I am quite sure he has used this blotting paper to blot his writing—here is the name of William on one sheet, which is marked "A"on both sides, another sheet is marked B2, and on the sheet marked C1 is "truly Seymour,"and on A2 there are several figures—I should require a looking-glass to find it all out—por<lb></lb>tions of these draft securities in Drew's case are in George Shaw's writing—these letters from Howard to Murray of 8th March, and 3rd, 5th. and 10th April, 1873, are in George Shaw's writing, and so is the heading to the proposal of 13th March, 1873—these letters of Howard to John Shaw and Sons, dated 28th July, this draft bond, the heading to this proposal, this letter of Howard to Brown, this proposal in Knight's case, dated 22nd September, 1874, this letter from Seymour to Lubin, and from Sey<lb></lb>mour to Sunday, dated 9th April, and these letters from W.

Five cases were mentioned on the first day I was examined, Holmes, Benner, Heath, Nicolady, and Barnes of Manchester—I have looked into them, and find that Holmes was introduced by Gard, and the commission paid to Gard was 50 per cent.—Benner was introduced by Gard in November, 1866, and L. W. Heath in October, 1866, and 50 per cent, commission paid to Gard—Nicolady and T. Barnes of Manchester were introduced by Rogers, and 50 per cent. commission paid to him—I have had all the papers looked out in Callaghan's case—he was introduced by Brown in March, 1876—I have examined them, and find that this list is substantially correct, and so are the details of the different years. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed</hi> "Specimen of death claims paid upon policies")—there are a considerable number of them from 1872 to 1877, amounting altogether to 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the policies generally were not renewed, or if they were, it was not for more that a year—Mr. Phelps, of the firm of Phelps, Bennett, and Woodward, became a holder of five shares in February, 1865; but in July, 1867, he took ten more—he is only a holder of ten now—his liability is unlimited—Phelps, Bennett, and Co. were solicitors to the association when the shares were taken; they continued so, I think, up to 1876—their office is 14, Red Lion Square.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS</hi>.<hi rend="italic">In my opinion Mr. Gorst is entitled to a general Reply. The right of Reply is in my judgment vested in the Attorney-General by reason of his representing the Crown in all cases which are really prosecuted at the suit of the Crown, by which I mean, not ordinary prosecutions which are not prosecuted at the suit of the Crown, although the Queen's name appears nomi<lb></lb>nally as the prosecutor, but prosecutions on behalf of the country at the instigation and direction of the law officers of the Crown, and which may for this purpose be termed State prosecutions. Wherever a ease is really prosecuted in that sense, I think the Crown has the prerogative right of Reply, and if the Attorney-General, whose duty it is to conduct such a prosecution appears in person to conduct it, he has that prerogative right, not because of a mere personal privi<lb></lb>lege attached to himself, but because he is the representative of the Crown, exercising the prerogative of the Crown. For this reason it is that the Solicitors</hi>-<hi rend="italic">General, in the absence of the Attorney-General, and representing him, has always been allowed the same right, and not because of a personal privilege attached to his office, and for the same reason I am of opinion that any Queen's Counsel or ordinary barrister appearing as the representative of the Attorney-General in such prosecutions as I have referred to, is entitled, on behalf of the Crown, to the same privilege of Reply</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Hannah Page, who keeps an oil and tallow warehouse in Crawford-street. On the 17th of October, the prisoner went into the shop—(I think I have seen him before as a customer)—I was in the cart at the door—there were four people in the shop at the counter—I went in and saw the prisoner cover down the lid of his basket—I saw there was more than one brush in it—he went out—I went out and saw him at the end of Seymour-street—he went on to Dorset-street—I still pursued, and he ran off—I gained on him and he threw the brushes down—I pursued him to Shouldham-street and there collared him—he said it was not him—I said it was—he made an excuse to go into a public-house—I said he should not—he got from me and went into a public-house, and a man, who I thought was outside our door when he went in, put his hand to my chest and prevented me going in—I looked through and saw the prisoner going out at the other door—I got away, pursued him and took him—I was then in Seymour-place—the policeman came up and took him.</p>

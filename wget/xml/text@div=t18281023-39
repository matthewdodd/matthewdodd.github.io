On Friday, the 12th of September, the prisoner came into one of the boxes, to redeem these articles, which he had pawned; he had given the duplicate of it the night before - I brought the bundle to the counter, and took the ticket off; while I turned to my uncle, to ask what the interest was (my eye was fixed on my uncle), the prisoner took the things off the counter, and ran out of the box with them - they were pawned for 9s. 6d., on the 13th of October, 1827; my uncle went out to follow him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I found the prisoner in custody on another charge; he had got the trousers and waistcoat on, and in his fob I found the duplicate of a coat, pawned for 1s. 6d., which being produced belonged to the suit; I questioned him - he said he had done it from distress, as he had no clothes to wear; I told him it could not be distress, as he had the money to redeem them - he said No, he only had 1s. and a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence pleading distress, and he received a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I should like to know how he knows the cheese. Witness. By the private-mark on it - we sell them with this mark, but we had not sold a whole cheese that day, and I do not recollect when we had; we had five or six others about the same size; this has not been in our possession since - the mark was not put on in going to Queen-square; here has been a mark put on, which was wrong - that has been erased, and another put on.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the night of the 27th of February I was on duty at Ebury-terrace; there is a grove of trees in front of it - I saw the prisoner going along about half-past ten o'clock, with this cheese on his head; I hailed him to stand; he took no notice, and I ran after him - he was then about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's; I asked where he brought it from; he said it was no business of mine, and it was very odd that men could not go about their lawful business without such busy fellows interfering with them - I then asked where he was taking it to; he said, "Home," but I could get no account that was satisfactory; he mentioned a street, but he was going in quite a contrary direction - I said he should tell me where it came from; he would not, and I took him to the watch-house - he swore, and said, "You may have the cheese, that will be of some use, but I am of no use;" I said I would not part with the cheese nor him; he then said he would not carry it, and I was not aware it was so heavy as it is - he then threw it towards me, struck at me, and broke from me; I parried off the blow, and took hold of him; we had a hard struggle before I could draw my rattle; when I sprang it, two of my brother officers came, and we took him; he then said he had found the cheese in that grove - I made enquiries, and found the prosecutor, and the shopman swore to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not ask where the other two men in the white apron, and the basket were, and say if I could tell you where they were, you would let me go? Witness. No, I did not say I would let you go; I asked where the other two men were - there were three together at first, and I disturbed them; I then saw them again in a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner had the cheese - I found the basket afterwards, but nothing in it.</p>

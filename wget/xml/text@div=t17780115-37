               <p>On the 25th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was accosted by the prisoner Davis, near King-street, Westminster; I had just come out of a public house; I cannot say that I was perfectly sober, for I was elevated in liquor, but not so bad as to be insensible of what passed; she asked me to go with her; I went with her to her lodgings in <placeName id="t17780115-37-crimeloc192">Pye-street, Westminster</placeName>

I got up, and missed the other things mentioned in the indictment. I went down stairs, and called to a watchman who was going his rounds, but he would not come; I called another watchman, and told him how I had been served; he gave me a light to find my shoes, and I went to another house till morning.</p>
               <p>Did you go to another bawdy-house? - No, to a public-house. I went to Justice Durden in the morning for a warrant, and went in search of the prisoners. We took them together; the officer found my buckles on Davis, and my watch on the other prisoner. I was present when they were searched.</p>

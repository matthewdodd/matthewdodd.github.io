                  </hi>. I am in the service of the North London Railway Company. On 21st Sept. I was on the line between Highbury and Kings<lb></lb>land—there is a curve in the railway there—a regular passenger train passes there besides the goods train—about 3 o'clock that afternoon I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and another lad on the bank, but the prisoner was alone when he was on the line—there is a brickfield near that part—I saw the prisoner and the other come down the bank, and put bricks and stones on the outside rail of the up line—they went up the bank—a train soon after passed the up line—the prisoner and the other boy then went up the bank, and another train passed—the prisoner and the other then crossed to the down line, and put on it a piece of stick, which appeared about the size of the handle of a shovel—on our calling out they took that off and went up the bank again—I came round to the prisoner, and asked him what he had done that for,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260078"></xptr>
               <p>and took him into custody—I only saw the prisoner put the things on the line—I took him to the station—I then went down to the railway, and saw the bricks and brickdust on the up rail, and the piece of stick on the other rail, which had been run over, and cut through.</p>

I am a plate layer on the North London Railway, I was at work near the same spot with the last witness—I saw the prisoner come down the bank, and lay something on the line—there was another boy with him—after that they went up the bank—they then went down again to see what was done, I suppose—they then went up the bank, and sat down for two or three minutes—they came down again, and crossed on to the down line, and put a piece of wood on that—they went up again, and directly the train came, and then this boy came down and took the piece of wood up.</p>

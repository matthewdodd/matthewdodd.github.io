                  </hi>. I live in Bermondsey, and am a porter. On the 0th of Feb. I was sent to the London Docks by one of the clerks in the office of Messrs. Price and Co.—I went to No. 3 warehouse, and they deli<lb></lb>vered me a bag of granilla, as I understood—the bag was quite full—it was put on my truck—I do not know granilla when I see it, but I saw the stuff that was in the bag, as it was quite full, and ran over—it was like brown grain—I went to another part of the Docks, and received a small bag of something else—I placed it in the truck, which belonged to my employers—a paper was given to me—I was coming home, and stopped at Garrett's, at the end of Rosemary-lane; to have something to drink—I saw the prisoner Price there, he came out with me, and went with me to the corner of Fenchurch-street, asking me all the way to have some gin—at last I went to the George, in Fenchurch-street—he asked what I would have—I said I would only have a Pennyworth of gin—I stood with my back to the door, and drank it—I then turned, and my truck was gone—I said, "Oh, I am robbed, my truck is gone"—Price came to the door, and said, "There it goes"—he pointed to a truck, which I went to, and found was empty—I came back—Price was then at the door, but I looked round, and he was gone instantly, as if he vanished—I told a woman who was there to get an officer—I believe price heard the words I said, and he was gone like a bird—I am sure he is the man—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the truck at the warehouse.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 648.) I found the truck in Bury-court, St. Mary-axe, on the 20th of Feb., as near two o'clock as possi<lb></lb>ble—I saw a man place it there, who to the best of my belief was the pri<lb></lb>soner Price—I took it from there to Price and Co.'s, Mincing-lane—it was there identified—when the man placed the truck there I did not know any<lb></lb>thing of the robbery, but about ten minutes afterwards I saw one of the clerks—I had a slight sight of the man who placed the truck there—I did not take particular notice of the truck till nearly four o'clock—I passed Burry-court many times in course of that afternoon, and the same truck re<lb></lb>mained in the same place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I keep the George, in Fenchurch-street. On Tuesday afternoon, the 20th of Feb., Meageeran came to my house with a man, who to the best of my belief was the prisoner Price—he asked Meageeran if he wound have a pint of porter—he said, "No, a penny-worth of gin," and I served him—a man came in, who I believe was May<lb></lb>nard—he did not say anything, but stood for a second behind Meageeran—he then went out, came in again, and had half a pint of beer—he then went</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dry-salter, and live in Brick-lane, Spi<lb></lb>talfields. On the 27th of May, between two and three o'clock, I was Pass<lb></lb>ing from my dwelling-house to my warehouse—I saw the prisoner in the warehouse—he <hi rend="italic">made off</hi>—I pursued and when he got to Red Lion-court I called "Shop thief"—he was taken, and slipped a blue coat off his back, and ran off again up to top of the court—I pursued him—he was taken by a policeman in Princes-street—I lost sight of the coat, but it was picked up.</p>

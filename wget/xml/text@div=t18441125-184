                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Edwards, a coal-dealer, in Little Manor-lane—at half-past nine o'clock in the evening, on the 22nd of October, I heard a person fall under my window—I looked out and saw Groves on the ground, and the prisoner's hand in his pocket—Groves said, "You have robbed me of my money"—the prisoner said he had not—I think the prisoner staid with him five or ten minutes, and then he dragged him across the road—I did not see any more of him.</p>

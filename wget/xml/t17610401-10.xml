I pulled down many, but nothing would please her; then she said, she would have a thing about half a crown a yard. I took down some from the shelves, she agreed for some, and said, she would send for it, but never did; neither did she pay for it, she then went away. She was after this taken up for robbing other people of goods; and an advertisement was put in the paper for any body that had lost any such things to come to justice Fielding. I had not missed any thing till I came there. Then I saw, amongst other goods, two remnants of printed linnen, one glazed, the other not, with my mark upon them, [produced in court.] These are my property, the constable is here, and can give an account where he found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain this linnen is your property?</p>
               <p>Green. I am; and this is part of what I shewed to her at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humfreys. I am constable, I found these two pieces of linnen in the prisoner's lodgings, at the house of Mr. Blackwell, in John's-street, by Golden-square.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it was there when you lost it?</p>
               <p>Green. There were upwards of 23 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of this largest piece?</p>
               <p>Green. I cannot tell, without a yard to measure it; I believe there is thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after she had been in your shop, before you saw it again?</p>
               <p>Green. It may be a week or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not sell the prisoner goods before?</p>
               <p>Green. I do not know whether I did or not. I think about two months before she came, and I sold her about two yards of lawn, but that I cannot charge my memory with.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a messenger coming to you, to go to her in New-prison.</p>
               <p>Green. I do; the messenger said, she had something to say to me; I told the man I would not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make mention that she was an informer?</p>
               <p>Green. I said, after he described her, d - n the bitch, I believe she is an informer, and I hoped she would be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not prefer an information against you, at the Custom-house?</p>
               <p>Green. No, she never did; nor I believe against none of her prosecutors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the person she had bought a quantity of linnen of you?</p>
               <p>Green. I said, I believed she might have bought a small quantity of me about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this linnen worth?</p>
               <p>Green. This cost me 3 s. and 9 d. a yard, they are chints patterns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I bought that printed cotton for 1 s. 6 d. per yard.</p>
               <p>Green. I never asked but 4 s. per yard for it.</p>

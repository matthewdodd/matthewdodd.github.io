                  </hi>. I am a clothier, and carry on business in Tottenham-court-road and the Edgware-road—Hopkins entered my service about July, 1849, at a salary of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I consented to allow him a commission of 5 per cent, on all orders he brought, when paid for, and gave him to under<lb></lb>stand that I did not allow him to do business on his own account—about four or five months afterwards he called me on one side, and said he had been speaking to a beer-shop-keeper respecting the formation of a clothes' club, if I had no objection—I said I had no objection; it was his business—a few days afterwards he spoke to me again, and said he had spoken to several per<lb></lb>sons who had joined the club, but it was necessary for the club to stand in his name, as they would not support a shopkeeper—I consented to that, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185201050009"></xptr>
               <p>some orders for clothes were executed in Hopkins's name; "but it was not on his account—I received all the money, as far as I know—M'Pherson had previously worked for me, and he came to me in June, 1850, and said he understood I wanted a cutter—I asked him who told him so—he said Hop<lb></lb>kins did—he said he could bring a large trade to my establishment—I spoke to Hopkins about hiring him—he said he was formerly a foreman of his, and he believed him to be a thoroughly honest man, and in great difficulty and distress—I engaged him at 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week wages, and a few days afterwards arranged that he should have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, commission on the business he brought, on its being paid for—the arrangement about Hopkins's commission was altered just before or just after the clothes-club commenced, five or six months before M'Pherson came, when I abolished the commission, and increased his salary to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, as I found two or three customers whom he introduced were previous customers of mine—both went on upon those terms till they left my service—in Oct., 1850, I had bill-heads printed—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told Hopkins that in future he was to make out the bills which he delivered to M'Pherson, on those invoices, instead of on plain paper—mine is a ready-money trade, and I had never had any invoices before—it was Hopkins's duty to receive from M'Pherson an account of the orders he had taken, and enter them in the book; and after M'Pherson had cut out the orders, to take an account of the quantity used, and enter it in the cutting-book; he was then to give the work out to the workpeople, and enter it in the work-book and in the wages-book—it was M'Pherson's place to take the goods home—it was Hopkins's duty to make out the invoice and deliver it to M'Pherson, to deliver with the goods; and if he brought home word that he had not received the money, Hopkins had a small memorandum-book, in which he was to enter it; when the money was brought home, he was to enter it on the other leaf; I gave strict instructions that I would have no goods left on credit—these two bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are in M'Pherson's writing—they are for articles supplied to a person named King—one it, "21st Oct., 1850. Mr. King to Thomas M'Pherson: 1 pair black trowsers, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; ditto blue, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."

Thomas M'Pherson"—this is my order-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is an entry in Hopkins's writing; "Mr. King, London end of the North Kent Railway; 1 pair of black doe trowsers, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—here is another entry of a "blue beaver paletot, with silk collar and cuffs, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" and a blue waistcoat, entered at the same time, with no price named—I made that entry by M'Pherson's direction—here is another entry, in Hopkins's writing; "Mr. King, 1 pair blue beaver trow<lb></lb>sers, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—this is my cutting-book, where the materials for making those things should appear—here is an entry, in Hopkins's writing, of the cutting of the blue doe-skin trowsers for Mr. King—here is also an entry, by Hop<lb></lb>kins, of the cutting of the coat; but there is no entry of the waistcoat—the third entry is also in Hopkins's writing—those entries indicate that the things were made of my materials—this is my wages-book; it contains entries of the employment of men to make these things, in Hopkins's writing—the trowsers at 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were paid for in full; and on account of the trowsers at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., M'Pherson paid me, on 30th Oct., 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that was all he could get from the party at that time—here is an entry on 15th May; "Cash paid, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," leaving 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have received no portion of the rest of the money—shortly before M'Pherson left, I went, one by one, through all the unpaid accounts, from the commencement, and asked him to give me the addresses of the various parties who owed the money—when I came to Mr.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I see here a black mark with the word "private" written under it; why did you scratch that out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no particular object in view in scratching that out; it was done before I suspected either of the prisoners—I looked on it as not being a private account, and I thought the word had no business there—this is not headed as a private debtor and creditor account at this end of the book—this end refers to money owing by M'Pherson to me, which he had had of me, on account of goods which he had had out of my shop—I sold goods to M'Pherson for his children and for his own wear, if he required them—this is my writing, copied from my day-book—it is goods that he has had—the originals are the greater part in Hopkins's writing—I only sell goods to persons in my employ for their own use—Hopkins had</p>

               <p>goods, and I dare say other persons in my establishment have—they always said, "If you please, Sir, I want a pair of trowsers," or "a coat," "and I will pay you so much a week out of my wages"—after the first examination M'Pherson was discharged—Hopkins was not in custody at all; he attended in pursuance of a summons—I believe he was let out on his own recog<lb></lb>nizances twice—the proceedings have never been abandoned; I went on with them before the action commenced, as far as consulting my solicitor went—I did not get out the summons—it was not four months before I took farther steps, it was between three and four months—the summonses were granted by Mr. Long, in September, six weeks before the action commenced—my solicitor did not have them—we got the Magistrate's consent that the summonses should issue, but we did not take them out till after the action commenced—I never had them in my possession—I knew of their being taken out—I cannot tell how long that was before they were served on the prisoners; it might have been a week or a fortnight, I do not think it was a month—I do not know when they were served, I think it was only a few days from their being obtained to their being served—when Hopkins left me, he went into the employment of a person, at Brompton, in the same line as myself—I only saw him there once—after he left there, I heard that he took a situation as foreman in a clothing establishment about twelve or fifteen doors off me—I do not know whether it was before or after I heard that that I commenced these proceedings—it was quite Immaterial to me about his being there—I do not know that he was carrying on a little business for himself near roe, as a tailor—I do not know how he got his living after he left me—I do not think I have seen him above twice since, except before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> M'Pherson gave himself up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; some of the papers were on a file, some under the fireplace, some in a drawer, and some under the bed—none of them were torn out of any book.</p>

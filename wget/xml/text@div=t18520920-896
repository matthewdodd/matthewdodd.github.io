                  </hi>. I am barmaid, at the Griffin, in Newcastle-street, Strand. Some time in Aug. I saw the prisoner at the Griffin—he asked for a pint of porter—I served him—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I tried it in the detector; I broke it in pieces, and in my passion I threw it at him, and told him it was bad—he ran out—he had drank part of the beer, but he did not pay for it—on Wednesday, 8th Sept., between 1 and 2 o'clock, he came again and asked for a glass of gin—I served him—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered a shilling—I tried it in the detector, and broke it in two pieces; I told him it was bad—he stood looking for a little while, and said he had not got another—I said he must pay for it, and then I called the old gentleman—the prisoner put the shilling into his mouth and was going to swallow it, and the old gentleman (Mr. Ashby) caught hold of his throat in my presence—he knocked the money out of his mouth—Mr. Ashby picked it up and gave it to the policeman—these are the pieces that I broke in the detector, and what the prisoner put in his mouth.</p>

I was sitting in front of the bar when the prisoner called for what he required—I saw this young woman disputing with him about the coin—she seemed to be very vexed, and I think she threw the coin on the counter—I went and said to the prisoner, "This is too bad to attempt to pass bad money"—after the shilling had been broken, he attempted to swallow it—I will not swear that I saw him put it into his mouth, but I was told that he was going to swallow it—I took him by the</p>

               <p>Penson &amp; Co., Limited, have stables on the other side of Danes'—Bailey has been my horse-keeper ten or eleven months—it was his duty to super<lb></lb>intend the feed of the horses, and receive the food from the corn-chandler—I found secretly that he was feeding the horses principally on clover, hardly any corn, upon which I put myself in communication with the police, and on Thursday, February 18th, I went with them to Mr. Whitchurch, the corn<lb></lb>chandler, in the Goswell Road, and ordered five quarters of oath in ten sacks—we turned each sack out on the floor, and had a quantity of dyed oats, which we mixed with them and put them into Mr. Whitchurch's sacks, which were afterwards emptied into our sacks, and Bailey fetched them from Whitchurch's—oats should be kept in the loft—I did not know of any communication between my loft and Danes' stable—on the 20th, about 8 a.m., I was sent for by one of my men—I went to the Police Court, and found the three prisoners in custody—I saw a sack of oats there, in which I found a number of the dyed oats—it was not one of my sacks—I afterwards examined the loft on our own side, and found nine sacks of oats instead of ten, and an opening, five feet long and about twelve or thirteen inches wide, into Danes' stable—one board was lying in our loft—the hole was not large enough to pass a sack of oats through in the bulk—I had not given Bailey any authority to lend, or sell, or part with oats to Danes—I had six horses and Danes five—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents the three stables.</p>

On Friday night, 19th February, I went to watch this yard, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I saw the three prisoners, at a little before 8 o'clock, in conversation at the top of the mod, in the Old Bailey—they went down the yard—Bailey went into Mr. Hudson's stable and Danes and Couchman into Danes' stable—when I next saw them they all came out of Danes' stable, but I had not been watching all the while—four men came out—they went to the top of the yard to Mr. Long's public-house, conversing together, and in and out of several public-houses till between 10 and 11 o'clock, when I lost sight of them—I next saw them at a few minutes after 4 o'clock in the morning—the outer gates were then opened by another man, Tongue, and Danes and Tongue walked in—Danes remained about half-an-hour in his stable, and went away—I next saw him about 7.30, in his stable with Couchman—I had not been away, I was with another officer—I walked to a lot of oats in the stable, and said, "Where did you get these oats from?"—Danes said, "I bought them"—I took up a handful and said, "Where did you buy them?"—he said, "Of a cornchandler"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "I do not know that that is any difference"—I said, "What is his name?"—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "Not know?"—he said, "In fact, I did not get them at all, my man got them for me"—I said, "Where is your man?"—he said, "That man," pointing to Couchman—I said, "Where did you buy these oats?"—Couchman said, "Of a corn-chandler "—I said, "What cornchandler?"—he said to Danes, "You know, sir, I did not get them at all"—I then turned to two sacks, one full and one half-full—I put my hand into the full one, and said, "What about this stuff here?"—Danes said, "I bought that"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "Well, my man got that also"—I asked Couchman where he got it? he said, "You know, sir, I did not get it at all?"—I said to Danes, "I shall take you for receiving this, knowing it to be stolen," pointing to the tub of oats—he made no reply—I found a sack full of oats, which were identified by Mr. Hudson; they were afterwards put into one of Mr. Hudson's sacks, which was on the tub—I found a nose-bag there, after Danes was in custody; it had not been filled that morning, but there was a portion in it from the day previous—I examined it, with Payne, it was the same kind of oats as were in the tub—there were beans and cut clover with it—I had Danes and Couchman taken to the station—I went into Mr. Hudson's loft; the board was then in its proper place, but it could be taken down—I saw hand-marks at the corner, which caused me to take hold of it—it was worn by the hands, from constant usage—I took it down and examined the floor on Danes' side, and saw about half a bushel of oats just inside the hole—five sacks were lying on the floor, and two were just inside the hole—two were marked with Mr. Hudson's name and one with Whitchurch's name—Danes' sacks were lying on top of them—I did not see Couchman before the large gates were opened—he could not have gone in without my seeing him—he always slept in Danes' loft—no other person was in Danes' stable that morning—Bailey was not at Mr. Hudson's, I met him about, twenty minutes after<lb></lb>wards, in the Old Bailey, and told him I should take him for stealing a sack</p>

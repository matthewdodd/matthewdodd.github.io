                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 3, Newman-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. On the 5th November, at about half-past 1 o'clock in the day, I was passing along Eudell-street—I had a porte-monnaie in my hand—the prisoner Wright came unexpectedly upon me, and tried to wrench the purse from my hand—I resisted for the space of half a minute, but he at length succeeded in getting it—I called "Police," and ran after him about half-way up Short's-gardens—I then turned and saw I was surrounded by upwards of forty persons, and I thought it prudent to retrace my steps—I met a policeman, and gave him information—several persons were standing by at the time the attack was made upon me—I do not recognise Mitchiff as one of those—Wright is the man who attacked me and took my purse—I saw</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 51). The proseeutrix gave me a description of the man that had robbed her, and in consequence of that description, I apprehended Wright about an hour and a half afterwards in Charles-street, Drury-lane—he was in company with Mitchiff—I had seen them in com<lb></lb>pany together previously about half an hour before the robbery, in the Red Lion and Still public-house, that is about a hundred yards from Endell-street.</p>

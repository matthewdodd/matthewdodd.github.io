I never lost fight of him after; I saw the shoes in his hand, I ran forty or fifty yards more; I fell down on the top of him, I got assistance, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the whole stack out? - A. Yes, almost; a boy took up three pair on the outside of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you never lost sight of him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it his hand you saw, when the window was broke? - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Whether you saw, immediately as you went out of the door, the shoes in the prisoner's hand, before he set off to run away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How far was he off when you first saw him?- A. Not four yards from the window.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HALFPENNY. - Q. How old are you?- A. Not quite fourteen.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you learnt your catechism? - A. Not quite.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it is a bad thing to tell a lie?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know you call God to witness when you take an oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you are liable to be punished if you tell a lie, not only in the next world, but in this, and that very severely? - A. Yes. (He is sworn.) I saw two hands up to the shoulder in the window; my master ran after the man, and I picked up three pair of shoes under the window.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE LUMLEY sworn. - I am a constable: I have a pair of shoes; the prosecutor brought the prisoner to the watch-house; I asked him if there was any mark on the shoes; he said, yes, J. B. there is J. B. on them. (The shoes produced).</p>
               <p>King. I can swear to these shoes, (looks at the three pair); I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.What is the mark you swear to them by? - A. I don't believe there is any mark upon them, I believe them to be my property; I should know them if I were to see them in France, by the work of the shoes; these two pair of shoes are very remarkable shoes, with a long side seam, which is not common now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming along the street, and being in liquor, I fell down, this man came and took me, I know nothing what for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seafaring man. I lodged at Mrs. Bird's, at Poplar, when this happened—I knew the prisoner—I believe he is a shoe<lb></lb>maker—I never knew him before that morning—I gave him a suit of clothes to pawn—he returned and gave me 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was at the Sun and Sawyers, in Poplar, from eight to ten o'clock—I was not sober nor drunk, but sensible—I recollect giving him the bundle—I fell asleep—I put 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—I lent him a half-crown—I put two or three half-crowns into my pocket, besides shillings—I did not count exactly to see what they were—I dozed, I dare say, for an hour—when I awoke my money was gone out of the pocket—I had put it into my right-hand trowsers pocket—that is where I always put my money—I was asleep when he took it—there was only the prisoner and another man—when I awoke I had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in this other pocket, but it did not belong to that money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. I went into this public-house be<lb></lb>tween ten and eleven o'clock, and had half a pint—I saw Camp sitting at the right-hand side of Pitt and a shoemaker—Camp put his hand into the prosecutor's right-hand trowsers pocket, and took out the money—there were two half-crowns and some more silver—then he put his hand into his left-hand pocket and took out a tobacco pouch, and took out a ticket of Pitt's clothes—he threw the pouch down at his feet, and then they asked if I would have some bacon with them, and we did, and some beer—I do not know whether the prisoner paid for it—Pitt remained asleep—the same night I saw them again at the same house—Pitt awoke and picked up his pouch, and said he had lost the ticket of his clothes—I told him that I was there, and stopped till he awoke to see that he was righted.</p>

On the 11th of May I received information, and I marked about every tenth sheet of a ream of paper, which Walton, my warehouseman, placed in a situation from whence I was told the prisoner intended to take it - I did not see him place it - he is not here; I gave it him about six o'clock in the evening; I saw it again at the Office on the 18th.</p>

            . I am journey-boy to Mr. Hullmandel. On the 1st of May the prisoner came to me, and asked if I wanted any money - I Yes, said if he could give me any - on the 11th of May, he said he had been to see if he could sell a ream of paper, but the man would only give 12s., and he wanted 14s.; I told my master, who told me to go on with it; the prisoner then said he could not sell that card paper, but he wished we could get a ream of post, and he could sell it; my master marked one, and gave it to the warehouseman to put in a particular place in the yard - the prisoner then came and placed half of it in his waistcoat and trousers, and told me to do the same; as we were going out the officer stopped us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you thought you was doing right? - A. Yes; I had not agreed to any thing before I told my master - I have been there three years - all the time the prisoner was there he bore a good character - Walton, the warehouseman, is in good health.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the George Tavern, Snow-hill. On Saturday 21st Sept., about eleven o'clock in the morning, Wood came for half-a-pint of beer, and paid me with a half-crown—I gave him his change, and he left—I put the half-crown in a cup in the till—there was no other there—I gave the change out of my pocket—about four that afternoon Wood came again, with Hewson and another man—I knew Wood again directly—Hewson asked for a quartern of gin—I served him; he paid me with a half-sovereign—I gave him change, in three half-crowns, two shillings, and two-pence, and they all three went away—I went in the back-room, and showed Mr. Webb the half-sovereign—he said it was bad, and fetched the prisoner back directly—Mr. Connor was there, and he assisted in detaining the prisoner till the officer came—Mr. Webb gave me the half-sovereign, and I gave it to the officer at the station—I did not find that the half-crown was bad till I returned from the station—I then marked it—I found it in the cup where I had placed it—no one had access to the till—I had locked it and taken the key with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman. On 21st Sept. I saw the two prisoners about a quarter-past eleven o'clock—they came laughing and talking together into the straw-yard, Snow-hill, while I was standing there—Wood went to the wine-merchant's passage, and came out directly, and said, "It is not there, that is not the place"—Hewson made Answer, and said, "Go over there, you fool," nodding to Mrs. Bennett's place—Wood went in and the other stopped outside.</p>

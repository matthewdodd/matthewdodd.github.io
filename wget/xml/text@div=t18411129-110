                  </hi>. On the 5th of November I was in the service of the prisoner John Richard Packard, who is a surgeon and chymist in Drury-lane—some officers came there that morning, and one was left in possession—he sat in the kitchen—it was about five o'clock in the evening as near as possible—about nine o'clock master went into the kitchen, and the deceased asked for a glass of gin—master said, "Very well, you shall have it," and gave him no gin, but some rum and water in a tumbler—I tasted it—the tumbler was about three parts full—the officer was quite sober—he drank the rum and water—master had then returned to the parlour—he came into the kitchen very shortly after, and asked the officer to step into the next room, which is the parlour—the kitchen and parlour are on the same floor—the man went into the parlour—it was about half-past nine or ten o'clock—I went into the room afterwards—I found master, Mr. Joseph Packard, and the officer there, and Jemima the maid<lb></lb>servant—the prisoner Kennett was not there then—there was spirits on the table in tumblers, and wine glasses too—there was no wine on the table then—I cannot say whether there was wine in the wine glasses—they appeared to be drinking—the officer did not seem to have any thing the matter with him then—about half an hour after I was called in again—the same glasses were on the table as I had seen before—there was no wine—there was rum in the officer's tumbler—I believe it was rum—I do not know the colour of port wine—there was some red wine on the table in tumblers, and rum and</p>

               <p>water as well, and there was gin and water—master kept gin in that room in a gallon stone bottle, which was in the cupboard—the spirits had been poured out of the stone bottle into the tumblers—the same persons were still at the table, with the maid<lb></lb>servant, and Kennett was there the second time I went in—he had come about ten o'clock—when I went in the second time master sent me with a note to the Garrick's Head public-house, which I took—it was about ten o'clock—I was to wait for an answer, which I did, but did not get one—a man returned with me to the house—master gave him an order for supper for four, to be brought at half-past twelve o'clock—the glasses were still on the table—the rum and wine were also kept in stone bottles—some of the glasses were empty, and some full—they appeared to be drinking continually—I was in and out of the room from then till half-past twelve o'clock, and the materials for drinking were still on the table, and they appeared to be still drinking—the supper came at half-past twelve o'clock, and two bottles of red wine in decanters—I placed them on the table—all the three prisoners were at that time sitting round the table with the deceased and maid<lb></lb>servant—I waited at supper—the maid<lb></lb>servant supped with them—I saw red wine given to the officer—the maid<lb></lb>servant drank wine as well as themselves—there was no spirits on the table then, I fetched two more bottles of red wine during supper, by master's directions, about one o'clock, making four bottles—it was all drank except a very little at the bottom of the decanter—it was all drank in wine glasses—three pints of porter was sent for—that was not all consumed—there was very little left—I cleared the table after supper—after the table was cleared the maid<lb></lb>servant took something out of the cupboard in stone bottles by master's direction—only one bottle was brought out while I was there—I do not know what it was—I saw her take one bottle out as I went out of the room—I cannot tell whether it was gin or rum—when I went into the room again I saw some spirits in tumblers—it appeared to be rum—what was in the officer's tumbler was red—it was nearly full—they were still round the table, and continued drinking there for about half an hour after I cleared the supper away—that would make it about half-past one o'clock—I went into the room again at the end of that time—the officer was then very tipsy, and did not appear able to help himself—master directed me to go and fetch a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Mr. Rennet joined in that order—the prisoner Joseph Packard was present at the time—after getting the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I went into the room and told master I had got it—my master and Mr. Kennett lifted the officer down stairs into the little room behind the shop, called the surgery—he did not appear at all able to help himself at that time—master put a smelling-bottle to his nose in the surgery, and said, "This will do you good"—the deceased made no answer to that—I do not know whether he was able or not—they then lifted him up stairs again and put him on the sofa—he remained there about a quarter of an hour—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was waiting—I saw some water in a tumbler, and some spirits put into it by Mr. Kennett—my master and Joseph Packard were in the room—they gave the tumbler to the man while he laid on the sofa—they put it to his mouth—he took it—he remained on the sofa about quarter of an hour—Master and Mr. Kennett then carried him down stairs—Joseph Packard followed them down—they lifted him into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and shut the door—master and Kennett went with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Joseph Packard stopped at home.</p>

Foulkes—it was given to me wrapped up—I believe this to be the note—I was to wait for an answer, but Foulkes was not at home, and I left it—(<hi rend="italic">note read</hi>)—" Dear Sir,—How would you advise me to act in this matter?—the man got intoxicated last night, and my brother and Mr. Kennet prevailed on him to take a ride, therefore I thought it best to keep him out.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the forenoon of the 16th of November I saw Kemp in Bow-street, and a man on the step of a door—in consequence of what Kemp said to me, I looked at him, and he appeared to be dead—I took the number of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, got a stretcher, and took him to the station—I then went to Drury-lane to Mr. Packard's house, rung and knocked, but could not get admission—I was there five minutes with Kemp—we made a second attempt to get in, but failed—on return<lb></lb>ing we met the prisoners Kennett and Joseph Packard, and from what Kemp said I took them into custody—they were standing in Bow-street—they wanted to know the reason I took them—I said they would see—the inspector afterwards told them in my presence they were to be de<lb></lb>tained, to know how the man came by his death—they said they did not know any thing about it—Kemp told the inspector that Kennett was the man that helped to put the man in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Kennett said he had nothing to do with it, neither had he been in Drury-lane—about an hour after I saw Kennett again—he told the inspector then that he was there, and told him the name of Mr. Packard, the owner of the house—Ken<lb></lb>nett was drunk when I took him, but must have known what he was about—I afterwards fetched Mr. Snitch, the surgeon, to the station— he saw the deceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Brydges-street, Covent-garden; I am appointed to attend oases at the station at Bow-street. On the 8th of November, I was called there and shown the body of a man—I saw no appearance of external violence whatever—I noticed nothing more than the appearance of ecchymosis round the throat, that would fol<lb></lb>low a pressure, which took place during life, or it might proceed from any thing done immediately after death, but not after the body was cold—I have heard the particulars of the treatment he received—I should think the situation he was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, very likely to conduce to the ecchymosis appearance, I mean falling down in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with his head downward—I no<lb></lb>ticed saliva coming from his mouth, and slime from his nostril—the pupil of the eye was dilated—I made <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination the following day at three o'clock, in the presence of Mr. Brooks, and have a note of that examination—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)"—Externally the body presented no marks of vio<lb></lb>lence. It was intimated by a gentleman present, that he thought he per<lb></lb>ceived a red line round the throat, but upon examination it proved to be nothing more than the usual appearance from ecchymosed blood, probably arising from the position, as I understand the body was crouched down at the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>. On removing the cal varium or scull cap, the following appearance presented itself:—the blood vessels of the dura mater or outer covering of the brain were distended with congested, that is, congealed blood; this membrane adhering very firmly to the scull bone; the blood vessels on the brain were in the same gorged and distended state; on re<lb></lb>moving a portion of the brain, a quantity of water, about two ounces, was seen in the ventricles, the usual quantity being but a very few drops; there was also a slight rupture of some of the minute vessels, and a few drops of blood effused. The chest was next examined; the heart small in size, but perfectly healthy, and somewhat fat; the lungs distended with congested blood. The abdomen was next examined; the external surface of the stomach, the small and large intestines, exhibited the blood-vessels in the same full and distended state as those of the brain, vis., surcharged with congested blood; the liver appeared perfectly healthy, and proved so on being cut into and examined, from which I infer the man could not have been a drinker, at least not a confirmed one; but this is not always the case, as I have seen, the livers of habitual drunkards sometimes quite healthy—the urinary organs full of urine. The stomach was very carefully removed from its situation; in detaching it, a few drops of fluid escaped, which a gentleman present, Mr. Coatee, said had a strong spirituous smell; I did not myself detect any particular odour; the contents were emptied into a bottle. The internal condition of the stomach was next examined, its coats found to be extremely thin, more particularly so in parts, its blood-vessels exhibiting the same full state</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290096"></xptr>
               <p>as in the other organs; its whole complexion indicated some little degree of inflammation. It was next washed, and the water deposited in another bottle; these two bottles I carried to a gentleman of the name of Wondor, but I was not present at his examination of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the result of all this examination as far as you can judge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as my observation goes, there was nothing exhibiting any poi<lb></lb>sonous matter—there was an appearance of spirituous liquors—under such circumstances, I can come to no other conclusion than that the deceased died from a state strongly bordering on apoplexy, but whether caused from the excess of spirits, wine, or malt liquor, or whether the result of his age, I am unable to state—if unaccustomed to drink, the effect would of course be more likely to cause such a termination—I should say the position he was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, was likely to cause suffocation, and such ap<lb></lb>pearances presented themselves—I conceive the ecchymosis about the neck arose from pressure at the throat, but it was very slight—it indicated pressure during life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing him to be in the state described, the vessels congested as you have told us, would pressure on the throat, arising from the position he was found in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, be likely to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would assist in doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long would two ounces of water be collecting in the ventricles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell—I did not re<lb></lb>gard the water of as consequence, as there was sufficient to account for death without the presence of water—it might be some time in collecting, or might collect very quickly, if he was the subject of previous disease—it is hardly probable that it would collect in five or six hours, but I have known children going to bed well, and in the morning a considerable quantity of blood effused into the brain—water will effuse in a very short time—I do not know why that should occur with adults, as well as infants—it does not flow quite so rapidly in adults—it would not go on after death—his liver was perfectly healthy, and altogether I should say he was a healthy subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a predisposition to apoplexy as far as you could judge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was certainly short-necked, but there was nothing beyond that—the adhesion of the dura mater to the scull-bone, must have been the re<lb></lb>sult of some inflammation existing for a considerable period from some chronic disease of some length of time—it is frequently met with at that time of life, but not to that excessive degree—I found animal matter, and vinous and fermented liquor in the stomach, about a pint in all—it was fowl, ham and porter, but Mr. Brooks more particularly examined the contents of the stomach—apoplexy may be produced by an over<lb></lb>loaded stomach with solid food, particularly where there has been stimulating liquor, but I should not say so of the present case, because after having a large quantity of spirits, wine and beer, as I understand, he was put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and driven about for one, two, or perhaps more hours, in the streets of London—I attribute it to solid food, stimulating liquor, and exercise in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—solid food taken by a person unaccustomed to live well, has a powerful effect if taken to excess—the term excess depends on the habits of a person—what is one man's meat, is another man's poison—but his stomach was not distended—there was barely a pint, liquor and all—the solid contents were partly undigested, and partly digested—I am forty six years old—I very rarely attend dinner-parties—drinking largely after dinner may lead to imme<lb></lb>diate</p>

               <p>death—all the world are in the habit of eating and drinking too much—there are more individuals starved to death (if I may use the expres<lb></lb>sion) by over<lb></lb>eating than under<lb></lb>eating.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The presence of water on the brain indicated an unhealthy state, did it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, generally speaking it must indicate some fore<lb></lb>gone disease, but I do not pay much attention to the water, seeing so much that was sufficient to account for death, inde<lb></lb>pendent of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Throwing aside all the other appearances, might not the water alone be sufficient to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I fear not, having opened the heads of persons free from disease, and found water, when in life there was no in<lb></lb>dication of water—it is an acknowledged fact that persons go about in good health with a large quantity of water—I cannot impute the death to the water in this case, seeing what I did besides—if I had found the body perfectly free from all disease, and two ounces of water on the ventricles of the brain, I should say that had something to do with the death, and probably it would have caused death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARNOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not a person with that quantity of water on the brain more likely to die of apoplexy than one who had none? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the water found there was thrown off by the blood<lb></lb>vessels, and when you find apoplexy, there is generally a rupture of blood<lb></lb>vessels—the coats of the stomach, being thin would indicate there was a little disease—I do not think the fat of the heart would at all tend to produce apoplexy—the water on the brain, fatness of the heart, and thinness of the coats of the stomach, altogether would combine to pro<lb></lb>duce apoplexy—the ecchymosis was only on one side of the neck, and exceedingly slight.</p>

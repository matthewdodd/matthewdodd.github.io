I was at work in Verulam-buildings; I saw the porter come there, and leave the cart - I directed him to go to the Talbot for change; I saw the prisoner close to the shaft of the cart, and another man on the shaft; be took the parcels out and gave them to the prisoner, who ran away with them; I pursued and stopped him with them, in the gateway, leading to Gray's Inn - I had not lost sight of him: I took him back to the cart, and gave the parcels to the carman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it a covered cart? A. Yes; the man on the shaft delivered the parcels to the prisoner. I cannot say whether they came together; the prisoner went away at a swift walk, at a brisk pace; he said he was employed by the man who belonged to the cart - he came back without resistance: he carried them in his arms uncovered.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness states that I was at the side of the cart, which I was not - the man in the cart dropped one parcel, and I took it up; he said "Will you have the goodness to take these parcels to the lodge in Gray's Inn." I took them, and he went on before me; he ran on, and then I went quicker, till the witnesses came; I said "If you ran through the lodge, you will see the man;" and they took me back to the cart.</p>

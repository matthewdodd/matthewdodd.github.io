On Tuesday night, the 16th of July, at eleven o'clock, I was on duty near the prosecutor's premises, and heard a noise in the warehouse—I saw the prisoner come from it with a sack of something on his shoulder—there was a wagon laden with straw—he went up a ladder, which was placed at the side of the wagon, and when he was nearly at the top I crossed over to him, and said, "Who is there?"—he said, "It is me, Timms"—he immediately dropped the sack, and some of the beans came out—he said it was the first time, it was a bad job, he should not have taken them unless he had found the door open—he wished me to let him take them back—I took him to Mr. Tillier, who got up; we went to the warehouse, and found the door open and the key in the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you have been twice asked what conversation passed—you said he looked at the certificate and said it was out of the district; then you said he would know from the certificate that it was out of the district? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do not recollect whether I did say, I do not believe I did say that it was out of the district myself, or where it came from—I do not know that I told him it came from Stockwell<lb></lb>grove.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sexton of Brixton Church. I was so in the year 1854—in the month of Sept. in that year there were a good many deaths from cholera in that district—there were a good many funerals taking place at that time in the churchyard at Brixton—I do not know how many there were in the month of Sept, there were a great number, I cannot say exactly—the late Mr. Thorogood was churchwarden at the time, and he wished for none to be taken out of the district, as the deaths were go numerous—he gave that direction as the deaths were so numerous—in the month of Sept. I remember seeing Mr. Frederick Haydon with regard to the funeral of a person of the name of Raven—Mr. Haydon came to me on the night before the funeral—I do not remember the day of the week, it was the latter end of the week, I do not remember exactly—he came about the interment of Mr. Raven, of Stockwell-grove—I had not known Mr. Raven particularly in his life time—I knew him personally, and knew where he lived—I refused to take the intermept without the Doctor's consent, and 1 went up to the Doctor the next morning and mentioned to the Doctor that Mr. Haydon, the undertaker, had got a man of the name of Raven that wished to be buried at Brixton Church—in a very short time Mr. Haydon came up himself, and the Doctor refused to take it—the Doctor was in his study at his residence at the time Haydon came up—I was in the study at the same time—I was very often at the house—I sometimes assisted there as waiter—I was not waiting there that morning—I acted as waiter when they had dinners there, and this morning I was with the Doctor in his study—at the time Haydon came the Doctor was in his study—I let Haydon in—the house door was closed—I went to open the door, because we saw Mr. Haydon coming up the hill—the conversation took place outside, on the front door steps of the Doctor's residence—the Doctor came to the front door—Mr. Haydon said he wanted the interment to take place at Brixton Church of a man of the name of Raven, in the Kennington district—the Doctor made answer, and said he could not take it at single fees, but he would take it at double fees—then Mr. Haydon paid the Doctor, and the Doctor made answer, and said, "If any one should ask where the funeral came from, or what fees were paid, tell a lie, and say Robert-street"—that was all that passed—I was at the funeral as sexton, Mr. Eastman performed the service.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was all that passed, was it, between the Doctor and Mr. Haydon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the whole—it all took place at the front door—the Doctor stood at the front door all the while, there was not any one in the study besides—I went up there first that morning—I was examined twice before Mr. Elliott about this matter of Raven's—in the first place before granting the summons or warrant, and afterwards upon the hearing, when the Doctor was given into custody—I stated in the first instance that I went up with Haydon to the Doctor's—I think Mr. Haydon was examined on the first occasion—when Dr. Vaughan was charged before Mr. Elliott, Haydon was examined first, and then me—I did not hear Haydon examined, I was not in the court—when I went first before Mr. Elliott, I stated that I and Haydon went up to Dr.</p>

               <p>Vaughan's together, and rang at the bell, and were let in by the servant—the second time I went before Mr. Elliott, I said that I went up first and let Haydon in—my going first to the Doctor's was correct—when I said that I had gone with Haydon, I did not recollect at the time—I did not say before Mr. Elliott the first time, that I met Haydon by arrangement, and went with him to the Doctor's—I think I did not—I stated that I and Haydon went together, and either rang, or knocked at the door, and the servant let us in—and on the second occasion, I stated that I had gone up first, and that I let Haydon in—I did go up first—I do not recollect who let me in that morning, when I got to the Doctor's—I know the servant Smith, very well—I do not recollect who let me in—I think I stated so at Lambeth—Haydon and I did not go up there together, I am quite sure—I was let in to the Doctor in his study—the study opens into the hall almost close to the street door—it is a small room—any body in that room could hear very well what was taking place in the passage—except in the winter time, the study door is kept open by a weight, the room being small—the Doctor came out of the study and stood at the front door talking to Haydon, in my presence, and never moved from the door until he returned to the library again, not till the whole thing was over, and then he went back to the library as far as I can remember, I think he did not come out again—I did not expect Haydon there that morning—we bad made no arrangement, but from the library window you can see any one coming—I did not expect him to come—I cannot say what I went up to see the Doctor about that morning—it might be about some funerals—I do not recollect particularly what it was—I did not know that Haydon was coming there that morning—we had made no arrangement whatever—I do not recollect at all whether he was coming there, that morning—I do not recollect whether I knew that he was coining—Haydon and I have not talked about this matter fre<lb></lb>quently since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that before Haydon was examined as a witness, you and he had had no conversation on this subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the police court only, we met coming up from Brixton—we did not come to the police court together, part of the way we did—we did not converse about anything particular on this subject—of course it was a very serious case, that was all that passed—I will swear that there was no conversation about the details.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There was one question I wanted to ask you, as to the usual practice of the Doctor and you, in all cases in which receipts were given, was it not you, the sexton, who gave the receipts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The receipts for the inter<lb></lb>ments? yes, I did so, except in vault funerals—in all other cases, it is notified at the bottom of the paper which is given to the undertaker that the burial fees are to be paid to the sexton, and the sexton gives the receipt for them—I remember the funeral of Raven taking place—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect that I was present when the entry was made in the rough book about Raven's funeral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you whether you did not, yourself, give Dr. Vaughan the name of Robert-street, as the last place of abode of the deceased man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect any thing of it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not you, in the presence of Mr. Joseph Vaughan, give the Doctor the place of abode of the deceased, Raven, to be entered in the rough book as of Robert-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir—not to my knowledge, I did not—I can swear I did not—I will swear it—I do swear it—I did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What enables you to recollect now, when two minutes ago you said you could not recollect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect anything of it at all, I mean respecting the certificate—as the Doctor took the funeral, therefore I am quite sure nothing passed—I have no recollection of the entry being made at all—I did not give him the name of Robert-street, because the certificate was given to the Doctor—I do not know anything about whether the certi<lb></lb>cate contained the name of Robert-street—part of Robert-street is in our district, and part of it is out of it—the certificate would not show the name of Robert-street at all—it is Kennington district—I will undertake to swear that I did not give the Doctor the name of Robert-street—I have no recollection on the subject of the entry being made at all—it was sometimes the habit of the Doctor to make the entries twice a week, on the two days that he performed divine service at the Church—he used to go into the vestry, and then make these entries—when we had burials with certificates that did not describe the last place of abode of the deceased, I furnished the Doctor with the information—on the day I was at the Doctor's with Haydon, I did not, to my recollection, see the servant—I do not remember seeing any—I will swear she was not in the hall when I and Haydon were talking to the Doctor, not in my sight—I did not see her—I did not see either of the daughters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been at Dr. Vaughan's on the morning when Haydon came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five or ten minutes, I think, as near as I could judge—there is a window in the room in which I was with the Doctor, from which you can see any person coming towards the house—you can only see to the gate—that is about the length of this Court from the house—I let Haydon in—in the first instance, when I was before Mr. Elliott, I stated that I went with Haydon—I think I came away alone—that was after Haydon left—he left first from the Doctor's—I did not see the money paid—I heard it paid—I did not see it paid—it was paid—I heard it paid into the Doctor's hand—the Doctor took the money at the front door—I heard it ring—I cannot tell what he did with it—he brought it into the study—I do not know what he did when he took it into the study—I do not recollect anything that passed when he brought it into the study—the interment was taken—my memory is a blank about that—I do not recollect anything further that occurred—I have only a distinct recol<lb></lb>lection of what I have stated—I had no occasion to apply to Dr. Vaughan at all when it was an ordinary funeral—if a person comes to me about a funeral of a parishioner in the ordinary way, I take the whole business upon myself—I have referred to the Doctor on many other occasions about funerals out of the district—it was a general thing, out of the district, but not in the district—I generally referred to the Doctor if a funeral was out of the district—sometimes the undertaker, generally myself, went to the Doctor—I generally consulted the Doctor myself—sometimes the under<lb></lb>taker used to go to him—that was seldom.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law book auctioneer, of Fleet-street, and live at Brixton-hill, in the district of St. Matthew. In 1844 and 1845 I was senior churchwarden of the district Church, churchwarden of the incumbent—I know of no interference on the part of the churchwardens with the funerals or interments that took place; there were three applications to me, sent by the request, I suppose, of the incumbent—I said, "I do not know why this is put to me"—there are more letters, I do not know whether they refer to this point or not—I find in the rough book of Sept, 1854, this entry of the funeral of Raven, "William Raven, Robert-street, 33, 3 G.

               <p>—I have seen Dr. Vaughan's writing frequently, and had letters of his in my possession; but I do not know whether this is his writing, but I believe it is—I was staying at Dover, with my family, the whole of the month of Sept, 1854, but I had occasion to come up to town sometimes—in the course of that time I received complaints on the subject of these out district funerals—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of my letter to Dr. Vaughan, in conse<lb></lb>quence of those complaints, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the answer I received from him—certain portions of the burial fees for those out of the district, as well as those who are in, are paid to the churchwardens—it was the habit of the Doctor to settle every two or three months with me and my brother churchwarden—such portions as came to us, together with pew rents, which came into our hands, were appropriated to any repairs—we did not get them—we had no control over the vestry books, but had access to see them if it became necessary—we had nothing to do with the conduct of the funerals in the churchyard—I have no recollection of any application being made to me on the subject of the funeral of Mr. Raven, in 1854—in this rough book, which I believe to be the writing of Dr. Vaughan, the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is the single fee—Dr. Vaughan accounted with me in respect, among other items of other burials, for this fee of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the case of Raven, and only for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

Dr. Ray ordered him this morning to go home and go to bed instantly. Strange to say, Mr. Thorogood commanded him not to toll the bell, and not to take any cholera cases. This day I refused to take five funerals from the borders of the district, and I wish you had been present to witness the heartrending scene of the applicants in not being allowed to fulfil the wish of the deceased, by being buried with their relations in Brixton churchyard The sixth case I could not refuse: the fact is, if you will refer to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, you will find in seven weeks, Brixton had only twenty-one cases of cholera; and what are these in a population of upwards of 14,000?

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was your attention first directed to Malby and the undertaker coming to your master about the funeral? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard it read at the meet<lb></lb>ing in Oct.—I do not recollect any other names that I heard read besides Raven—there were other cases read—I should say that there are nine or ten steps to go up to the front door of my master's house—Malby was on the top step when he stood talking to Dr. Vaughan—it is not pavement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say that the pavement did not come into the house, and that Malby was on the pavement with the Doctor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not pavement; I have never said so—it was not usual for a sexton and undertaker to come to my master's house on such occasions—I never knew such an occasion before—when I went to that meeting, I did not see some men who had been to my master's house earlier in the evening—I remember five men coming to my</p>

               <p>master's house one evening; that was the day of the meeting which I at<lb></lb>tended—I did not see those men at the meeting, but I had seen them at the house—I had never seen them before, and knew none of them—they went into the dining room—one had a glass of wine, and the others had beer—I cannot say whether Dr. Vaughan was in the dining room part of the time that they were there—I did not stay in the room all the time—I did not see them go into any other room—I cannot say whether in that interval Dr. Vaughan was in the dining room—I believe the young ladies were there—Mrs. Vaughan was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the young ladies walk before breakfast, or after? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After breakfast—the family breakfasted at half past 8 o'clock—this was between 11 and 12 o'clock, as near as I can tell—I never saw Haydon before—I have seen him since, and know him.—I am sure he is the man that came with Malby—I know of no other instance of an undertaker and sexton coming to the Doctor—it being an unusual thing for a sexton, and undertaker to come to the Doctor and hearing the name of Raven mentioned at the meeting, I knew that it was the same—when I heard that story talked of at the meeting, and Raven's name mentioned, I remembered the circumstance—I knew that the meeting was about my master—I sup<lb></lb>pose that it was curiosity that took me there, knowing that it was some<lb></lb>thing concerning the Doctor—I went to hear what they all had to say about it—there were many other females in the meeting, but not that I knew—when I got back I named what I had heard to the young ladies—a boy did not come with a basket of poultry any time that day that I know of—It was my business to open the door, it was part of my duty—there was no man servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a daughter of the Rev. Dr. Vaughan. I recollect Sept., 1844; I was at home at that time—I recollect an applica<lb></lb>tion being made at my father's house about a funeral; I was at that time in the library with my father—by the library I mean the study—my sister, Decima, was also there, and my brother Joseph, besides my father—I heard an application made by Malby—he had not been at the house that morning before that time—it was about the middle of the day, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I think—I believe the study door was open—the servant, Mary Smith, brought in the message, and Malby remained on the door step—I heard what she said, and heard my father's answer—she said that Malby had come with an undertaker, about a funeral, and my father said, "He must go to the churchwardens"—after my father had said that, he rose up, and went to the door—I was going out at the time, and saw Malby and nother man, Haydon, whom I had seen before, and knew by name—when my father got to the door, he told Malby himself that he must go to the churchwardens—nothing further was said—my father did not receive any money from Haydon, or from Malby, or any piece of paper from either of them, nor did he give any piece of paper to either of them—he did not go into his study till they had left—I was there when they left—my father did not say to Malby or Hay<lb></lb>don, "Mind, if anybody asks you where the funeral comes from, you must tell a lie, and say, Robert-street;" nor did he say anything of the kind—I believe the name of the person who was to be buried was mentioned; it was "Raven"—that is a name with which I was acquainted, it was the name of a neighbouring clergyman, a friend of ours—I saw Haydon at the police court, he is the same man of whom I am speaking.</p>

               <p>have breakfast between 8 and 9 o'clock, and had adopted our usual rule on that morning—I cannot tell you on what day it was—I cannot name the day of the week—I had seen Haydon before that morning, and knew him by sight very well—I have known him by sight several years in Brixton—he is the brother of our butcher, whose name is Haydon also—I have a brother who is a clergyman, he does not live with us—he had not visited us that morning—I was going to his house, my sister in law was ill—I have not known a visit from Haydon and Malby before on such an occasion—when the servant came into the room, she said that Malby had come about a funeral, with an undertaker—she did not say, nor did Malby say, that it was the funeral of a person out of the district—he did not assign any reason at all why he came to consult my father about it—he did not speak to my father, my father merely answered him—he had sent the message in—Malby may have said "Good morning," as he left, to my father, but he did not speak to him about the funeral—all that I can say is, that my father came out and said, "I cannot be troubled with it, go to the church<lb></lb>wardens"—I believe Malby said, "Very well"—that was all that passed—it was the servant that mentioned the name of Raven—I think I can swear that—I will swear it.</p>

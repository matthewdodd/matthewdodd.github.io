                  </hi>. I am assistant to William Quelch, who lives in South—wark. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to his shop to sell artificial—flowers—he came there on the 27th of Aug.—I was serving a lady with some ribbons—I pushed the box on one side; but previous to doing so, I counted the ribbons—there were twenty pieces of them—the customer left the shop—the prisoner came and offered to sell me flowers—I said we did not want any—he put his box on a chair in the shop, and the box lid partly over the box of ribbons on the counter—I said we did not want any—I went into the midd<lb></lb>le opf the shope and then towards the parlour—in three minutes after I came I to the shop again—he had then left—I counted the ribbons, and found there was one piece gone—I am sure no one else had been in the shop—I went after him—I overtook him, and said I wanted him—he came back—I told him—I overtook him, and said I wanted him—he came back—I told him to open his box, Which he did, and I found this ribbon in the box—it is William Quelch's—I said, "I have found you out at last, having missed goods before, I suspected you"—he said it fell into his box—from the situation in which the ribbon was, it is impossible it could fall into his box without his knowledge—it had been in a box, and could not roll out without being pulled out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 60). On 27th May, just after midnight, I saw the prisoner and two men in East Street, Walworth Road—the pri<lb></lb>soner went into the garden of No. 186, and down the area; that is Mr. Trigg's house—the other two walked backwards and forwards, one one way, and one the other—I was concealed nearly opposite—I heard a window lifted, and about 2.50 I saw the prisoner coming from the garden—he had been there about twenty-five minutes—I asked him what he had been doing—he said "I have been asleep; I have just recovered from drunken<lb></lb>ness "—the other two ran away—the prisoner asked me what I should charge him with—I said I thought it would be burglary—he said "Well, I must put up with it"—I found at the station this table-knife in his pocket, and a bottle contaning brandy, I think, and two or three matches and a purse.</p>

I live at 86, East Street, Walworth Road, and am a boot-finisher—on 27th May Hollis called me, and I found the area window a little open—this property is mine—one bundle was just outside the kituben door, and the other in the kitchen on the floor—the clothes were on a peg in the passage when I went to bed—I had looked at the area window that night; it was always kept closed—I left my sister up that night—there was a piece of candle there which was not there before; we never use candles; there was also a screw-driver on the table.</p>

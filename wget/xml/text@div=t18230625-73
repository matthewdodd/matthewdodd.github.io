            . I am coachman to Mr. Portman of Bryanston-square. About May, 1822, I bought this watch of Marks, who I knew before - he travels with a box. I gave him six guineas, and another watch, worth about two pound ten shillings for it, and seeing Baggs's name on it, I took it there to be repaired.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lived in Sugar-baker-court - A. About fifteen months; before that I lived two years in Three Tun-alley, Middlesex Hospital. I believe it to be the watch, but do not positively swear it - perhaps fifty may pass through my hands in a month.</p>

            . I deal in watches, and live in Cutler-street, Houndsditch. I sold Marks a watch twelve or fifteen months ago, which I bought of Samuels - it was one of this description, but was only an hour in my possession. It had Baggs's name on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are a pretty large dealer in watches - A. I sell some thousands in a year. I recollect selling it at a good profit without putting it into my pocket, at our exchange. I do not book goods which I buy there.</p>

            . I live in Ratcliff-highway, and sell watches and clothes. I sold two watches to Cashmore for 5 l., which Mr. Baggs afterwards claimed. I cannot read, and should not know either of them again - they were hunting watches. I changed them with the prisoner Thomas, last April twelve months. I gave him a silver hunter, and 3 l. for them, at Chelsea - I had seen him there the quarter before, on Pension day, and tried then to deal with him for one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A great many pass through your hands - A. Yes. The pension day is generally the first Wednesday after quarter day. I cannot swear that this is either of the watches.</p>

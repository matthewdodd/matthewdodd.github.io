                  </hi>. I live at Rye, but have bee staying with my uncle, James Starnes, who lives at Sipson's, five miles from Uxbridge. Last Saturday night, at my uncle's request, I was watching a building which contained about eighty sacks of potatoes, from half-past 8 or 9 o'clock till nearly 12—at nearly 12 I saw the prisoner come with an empty seek on his arm, and unlock this padlock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was on the door of the building, but there was no key in it—I was ten or twelve yards off—he went into the building, was there about five minutes, and then brought out about a bushel of potatoes in the sack—I did not see the potatoes, but there was nothing there but potatoes and some ladders and baskets—he stood the sack by his side, fastened the door, put the sack on his shoulder, and went towards the gate, which is at the road, thirty or forty yards from the building—he threw the sack over the gate, got over himself, and there was another man there, who put the sack on his shoulder—I then got over, and followed them to the prisoner's house, which is about 100 yards off—I went in, and found the prisoner and his wife there—I had not lost sight of him—I have not the least doubt the prisoner is the man I saw unlock the door—I went to the building about 10 next morning; I unlocked it with this key, and found a hole in the potatoes where some had been taken from.</p>

On Saturday night, about 20 minutes past 12 o'clock, the prisoner was given into my custody, charged with stealing a bushel of potatoes—he said he knew nothing about it, but if he had stolen them, there was plenty of time to have put them away—he refused to walk to the station, and I asked him to walk to Sipson's, where we could get a horse and cart—he was not drunk.</p>

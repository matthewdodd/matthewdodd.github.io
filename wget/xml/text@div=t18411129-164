                  </hi>. I am book-keeper to Mr. Kirkwall, the official As<lb></lb>signee, and live at Wapping-wall. On the afternoon of the 21st of Novem<lb></lb>ber, between five and six o'clock, I was coming up Mansel-passage, Haydon-square—there are some posts at the end of Mansel-street—I had got near them, and saw a person who I believe to be the prisoner—he passed me through the posts—in passing he snatched at my watch, chain, and seals, drew my watch from my fob, and ran away—I followed him, crying, "Stop thief," into Haydon square—I lost sight of him for two or three seconds, not more, as he turned the corner of the rail-work in the square—I went on in that direction, and found him in custody of the con<lb></lb>stable—I observed him more by his dress than his face it was rather dusk at the time—I did not see any one but him in the direction he ran.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About half-past five o'clock on the evening of the 21st of November I was at the corner of Church-street, Haydon square—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning in a direction from Mansel-passage round the square—there was no person running with him or near him, nor any person in the square at the time—I seized him and asked him what was the matter—he said "Nothing"—I asked him what he was running for—he made no reply—I took him back in the direction he had run from, and met the prosecutor when we had got about twenty yards—I asked him if he was the person that was calling out "Stop thief"—he said he was, and they had stolen his gold watch, chain, seal, and key—I asked if the prisoner was the person—he said he had every reason to believe he was—the prisoner said he thought he was wrong—the prosecutor asked him where he was going—he said, to Rosemary-lane—he asked where he came from—he made no answer to that—I took the prisoner to the station, and afterwards went back to Haydon-square, looked for the watch there, and found it down Shippy-yard, about ten or twelve yards from where I had stopped the prisoner, and over a brick wall—it was not broken, nor had it stopped—it went on right afterwards—it was rather dark where I stopped the prisoner.</p>

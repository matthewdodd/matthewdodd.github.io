                  </hi>, Esq. I live at Ealing. About half-past six o'clock on the evening of the 17th of December, I was coming to town in my phaeton, and saw the prisoner at Acton Bottom, between the fourth and fifth mile stone—something induced me to pay particular attention to him—when I got up to him he was on the off-side of the road—he crossed to the near-side, and attempted to take hold of my horse's head, but was prevented doing so by my galloping—he then came to the near side of the chaise, and eventually to the back of the chaise, but I galloped, as I thought away from him—I then pulled up, and looked behind me and he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701020101"></xptr>
               <p>was close behind—I tried to gallop away from him again—he then jumped up on the back seat of the phaeton—it was a turn-over head—he took hold of me by the coat—I said, "What do you want there? get down"—he then swore at me with a bad expression, and said, "I will cut your b——throat"—I then presented a pistol at him, and said, "You ragabond, get down, or I will fire at you"—I struck him in the face with the birrel of the pistol, which marked him down the face—I believe I struck him again, and he fell from the back of the chaise on his head in the mud, and there I left him, apparently insensible—when I proceeded further, I met a party of policemen—I told them, and described his parson, that he was an Irishman, that he had fallen on his head in the mud, and they would find his head covered with mud—a policeman returned with me in my phaeton, and in a very short distance we came up to the prisoner—he was covered with mud, and there was the mark of the blow from the pistol down his face—the policeman laid hold of him, and said, "You are my prisoner"—he then said, "I did not mean to hurt the gen<lb></lb>tlemen—he shammed intoxication, and, perhaps, he might be a little so—he was decidedly not intoxicated—he had been drinking, but I should say he was decidedly not drunk—I have not a doubt of his person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information from the protestor, and took the prisoner into custody—he appeared; to me to have been drinking a little, but was not drunk—I think he made it a great deal more to than it was—when I took him, I said he was my prisoner—he said, "I did not mean to hurt the gentleman".—when I got bin to the station-house, he appeared a great deal better than before.</p>

When I went back with the policeman, the prisoner had got up, and was coming towards London—I did not, strike him at all, nor strike at him—I only struck the horse—I hit him with the pistol when he was on the choose—I returned with the policeman in about three minutes.</p>
               <p>(Several witnesses deposed to the prisoner's good character.)</p>

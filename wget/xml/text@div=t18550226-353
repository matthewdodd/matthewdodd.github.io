                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 459). On 8th Feb. I was at the Jerusalem Coffee House—I went there just before 10, and was there till 1 o'clock, in private clothes—it is a luncheon and dining room—I was employed by the proprietor, in consequence of something which had happened there before—the prisoner came there about 1 o'clock—I did not notice his coming in—I first saw him about 1 o'clock—he went to a partition about three yards from where I was sitting, in one of the boxes—he took this great coat from the partition, threw it across his arm, and went out—the partition is about twelve or fourteen yards from the entrance door—I followed him out, and took him in charge—I told him I was a police officer, and I should take him in charge for stealing this coat from the Jerusalem Coffee House—he said, "I beg of you to let me go; it is all a mistake"—he had an over coat on at the time, and an umbrella; it was snowing very fast—he had an under coat on at the time—I believe the overcoat was the one he has on now.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260047"></xptr>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Hooper, of the Jerusalem Coffee House. This coat is mine—I placed it that morning on a partition, in one of the boxes in the coffee room—I had lost several coats there—this coat was shown to me by the policeman, when the prisoner was taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have been several years there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is a subscription room, and is frequented by captains in the East India, and general trade—persons come there to visit captains—it might have been that in a busy time a captain might be seen in the room where the witness was, but not in general—there is a plate on the door, that no person is to be admitted—he has to inquire for any captain he may want—stewards and other persons come there, not into the room, but they come there to inquire.</p>

I am servant to the prisoner—he lives at No. 8, West<lb></lb>terrace, Upper Grove-road, Bermondsey—I have lived with him ten years—I remember when my master was taken into custody—he left home, at 11 o'clock in the morning of that day—he had two over coats on—I had brushed the great coat, the outermost coat, that morning, before master went to town—it was a very dark blue, nearly a black—it was very much like this coat, which my master is charged with stealing—I have not seen that coat since that day, when he went out in the morning—I saw my master at the police court—he had not the coat, which I have described on at that time—the coat he has on now, is not the coat—that is the coat he had underneath it.</p>

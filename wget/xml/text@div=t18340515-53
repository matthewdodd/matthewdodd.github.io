               <p>HANNAH ANDERSON. The prisoner had an unfurnished room in my house for nine months with her husband - I missed two candlesticks three weeks before the 10th of April, and saw them next at the station-house on the 10th of April - she had left about three weeks then.</p>

             (policeman N 154). I received information from the prosecutrix, and went to the prisoner's lodging in King's-arms-yard, Whitecross-street - I found her there - Mrs. Anderson's maid-servant was with me - I told the prisoner I had come to take her on suspicion of stealing things from Mrs. Anderson - I saw this candlestick on the mantel-shelf - I asked her if she knew any thing of it - she said she had bought an old box of Mrs. Anderson, and the candlestick was in it - I asked her if she had any other candlestick - she said, "No" - on searching her bed-room I found another on the table - they are odd ones - she then said that was in the box also - her husband was not present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. She was flurried, I suppose, when you came to take her? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might she have understood you to ask if she had the fellow one? A. No - I said, "Have you any other candlestick, or any other article of the prosecutrix's?" - she said, "No."</p>
               <p>MRS. ANDERSON re-examined. I sold her a box the night she went away - it stood on my landing-place - her husband asked if I would part with it - I said I did not mind, and he had it - I did not examine it - it was taken away as it stood - I cannot say what was in it at the time - the prisoner was present when her husband bought it, I believe - I cannot say whether the candlesticks had been in the box or not.</p>

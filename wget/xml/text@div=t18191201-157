               <p>Q. Had all the copies the portrait - A. Three of them had it - one was deficient. I sold two. I have the one that wants the portrait, and produce it now - it was in quires, I sent it to be bound.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you bought it of him had it the portrait - A. I cannot say - I only examined one.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the day the bill became due you could not take it up - A. No. While it laid unpaid, a person called, whom I believe to be Harrison, but cannot be positive - he called the evening it was due; I paid it afterwards. I gave the bill to Brooks - (bill read).</p>

            . I am clerk to Saul and Saddington, who are wine and brandy merchants - Broom dealt at our house. I took the bill produced, in payment, of him. When he offered it I looked at the endorsement of Brooks, and asked who he was? he said Brooks had nothing to do in point of payment, that he had nothing to do with the bill, and was only employed to sell the goods for it. He said he had employed Brooks to sell the goods, and he had nothing to do with the payment, and if we took it we must look to him (Broom) or the drawer for payment, and not to Brooks. The money has been received for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it honoured when due - A. Not exactly on the day. I went to Broom about it, and told him I was sorry the bill I had received of him was not paid. He said it would be paid he had no doubt, for the house was respectable, and I had better go and inquire about it.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Sheriff of Middlesex - I know Brooks and Broom; I have known Broom many years, and have been in the habit of seeing him at the Three Tuns, in Brook-street, Holborn. I have frequently seen him with a bundle. I have seen Brooks go out with the bundles, leaving Broom there, and then return to Broom without any thing. I did not observe who brought the bundles in. I have seen Brooks bring silver, and pay it to Broom, and have seen Broom return part to him again. I think it was about the month of August.</p>

            . I lived at the Three Tuns, public-house, Brook-street, Holborn, last summer, and have seen Brooks and Broom there several times - they brought in their parcels and sat there. I think Brooks went out, and came back to Broom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person who went out take any thing with him - A. He took the parcels out. I once saw one of them open on the table - they appeared to be the sheets of a book; I observed it was a very good type. My first husband was a bookseller. I saw them several times at the house. I think it was in July and August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. It is a public-house - A. Yes. I am related to the person who keeps it, and am sometimes there for a month together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Lants's-fields on Wednesday morning, the 25th of August, about half-past five o'clock—I went under the railway-arch, and saw these things lying there—I saw what there was—I went out again, thinking some one had placed them there, to see if I could find another constable, to help me take them to the station-house—I went through several other arches, when I came back, I found the prisoner—he had undone the things, and was unpacking these taps and dies—I said, "Halloo, what are you up to?"—he said, "I only came in to ease myself"—he said he was going to work at the West India Docks—I let him go as he gave a pretty good account of himself, but I took notice of him—I afterwards took from him a flannel jacket in the prison—this is it—he had it on at the time I first saw him.</p>

I live at Stratford, and work for Mr. John Ridge—this flannel jacket is mine—I know the other things, they belong to Mr. John Ridge—they were missed on the 26th—I had left my jacket in the engine-house—they were all taken together—the engine-house was locked up—we found the side-door open—they were safe at twelve o'clock the day before—at half-past four o'clock they were gone.</p>

On the 25th of August I left the premises at nine o'clock, the engine-house was locked up—the articles produced were then safe—I saw them at seven o'clock—I saw the prisoner lying about that field a fortnight or ten days before—he worked about a day and a half, I think, on that spot, the latter part of that time, along with a man named Hill, for Mr. Ridge.</p>

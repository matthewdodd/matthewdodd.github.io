                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Nightingale Lane, Woolwich. The prisoner came into my employment about a year and a half ago, and continued to within the last three months—I always pay my washing bills weekly, and gave the money to the prisoner to pay the washing woman, Mrs. Gray, who has washed for me for five years—I make entries of the money I pay, sometimes in the evening, sometimes early next day; I make up my accounts daily—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my book—on 12th April, I paid the prisoner 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the 19th, 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the 26th, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to pay to Mrs. Gray.</p>

               <p>did not give me receipts, she merely sent a little ticket, which used to lay about—my son is with me every day, but he lodges away—he had nothing to do with this book or the entries—my income is not derived from him, but from a pension—Mrs. Miller is my landlady, I believe she is here—Mrs. Gray sent me a bill by the prisoner, bnt the prisoner never gave it to me, and at last Mrs. Gray applied for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to her, and took the prisoner with me—I did not tell her that Mrs. Gray had applied for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I said, "What have you done with my clothes?" (which had been detained for three weeks)—she said, "My little sister must have taken them somewhere else"—this is the first time I have said that—I did not go on to say to the little girl, "Mrs. Gray has made a charge against me of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which has not been paid"—I said that I should go down to her house, in the hope of seeing her mother there; she said, "Do not go to the house, stay till my father comes home"—this is the first time I have stated that to any person but the Magistrate, but I am so confused—the prisoner said to me, "Why, ma'am, you have never given me that money"—I saw the prisoner's mother next day, and the prisoner and I went up to Mrs. Gray's—I cannot charge my memory with what was said: our memories all fail as we advance in life—the prisoner on that left me, but she did not go home to her father, she was in the shrubbery; she went towards her father's—she left me that day; I told her not to enter my house again—her mother came to me next day to know what it was, not to insist that the matter should be fully investigated—it was several days afterwards that the girl was given into custody—I should have been satisfied if she had come and acknowledged her guilt, even if the amount had been double—I did not tell her mother or her so; I did not see her—on the following Friday or Saturday she was given into custody, and I went before the Magistrate with my son, Captain Cragg; I could not go alone—he was examined as a witness—I did not hear him say there to the prisoner, "If you will only plead guilty to it, you will get only a month, but if you go to the Old Bailey you will get two years"—I did not hear her say, "If I get five years, I will be tried"—I heard her say to the Magistrate that she wished to be tried by a Jury—she was asked if she would plead guilty, and she refused—a deficiency of memory is what we are all liable to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a laundress, and live at Johnson's Court, Woolwich. I have washed for Mrs. Craig five years—during the last two years I was paid every week regularly, until within the last four or five months, when the servant came with a message from Mrs. Craig to me, asking if it made any difference to me if the bill went on for a few weeks; I said that it made no difference; and from the time of bringing that message I received no money, and for three weeks before; it was four or five months altogether that I received nothing—I continued to have clothes brought to me to wash till within three weeks of the girl being given in custody—I sent a message to Mrs. Craig, to ask her if she would let me have my money, because 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was owing at that time, and the girl said that Mrs. Craig was coming to pay me—during the three weeks that I had not the clothes, the girl did not come to me or bring any message—I was ill, and not able to do any washing, but I did not send word to that effect by the girl; she did not come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

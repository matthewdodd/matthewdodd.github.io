On the evening of the 5th of March I was at the Green Man, public-house, in Bond-street; the prisoner, who is an acquaintance of mine, came in; we went home together to my lodging in <placeName id="t18280410-219-crimeloc1173">Oxford-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you not both servants out of place? A. Yes; I got into a squabble with some girls, and went to the watch-house; the prisoner said he had advanced 2s. for me. After the seals were found he said he took them merely out of a frolic; I have known him five or six months - he has been an honest good lad.</p>

The prisoner had bought goods at our house two or three times, and always paid for them. She came in about six o'clock in the evening; a piece of Valentia was on the counter, but not near where she stood; we never sell less than a piece. She came to pay for some scarfs which she had looked out the night before, and delivered me the pattern of a cheque to match. I had occasion to go round the counter, some distance from where she stood, to match it. She had the scarfs in her hand; there was no other person in the warehouse. While I was endeavouring to match the pattern, I saw her snatch the Valentia off a pile, and put it under her gown; she could not have taken it by mistake for the scarfs, as it was much larger than them, and a good distance off. I went to her, and said she had taken what she ought not; she denied taking anything. I laid hold of her; a scuffle ensued; she then took it from under her gown, and threw it round behind the counter. I rang the bell for Mr. Merrick, and sent for a constable; she was detained. The Valentia cost 5 l. 15 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. She intimated her intention of buying cotton goods - A. Yes. Our goods are not exposed as in a retail shop; the Valentia is bulky; she had the whole of it under her gown.</p>

            . I live in Lascelles-court, St. Giles's. The prisoner is a <rs id="t18181028-43-deflabel253" type="occupation">widow</rs>

The deceased, Johanna Duggan, was my sister, and was five or six years old. On the 28th of September she was in a very good state of health. On Sunday, the 27th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my mother's house with three baskets-(she attends the markets). She said she was locked out of her lodgings, and had no where to go to. My father said she might go to bed with the children - She said she did not wish to disturb them; she laid on the floor till the morning - She was sober. Between five and six o'clock she got up. My father dressed the child-it was playing about the room. The prisoner fetched a quartern and a half of gin, and gave my father and mother a glass - They went to Covent Garden-market; the prisoner fetched another quartern of gin, and offered my wife a glass, she refused it; I also refused it, and she threw it over me in bed. The child said she was going to Covent Garden, and asked the prisoner if she was going? she said Yes; I will take you to your father and mother-they went out together, between six and seven o'clock; between eight and nine she brought the child home intoxicated-it did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280020"></xptr>appear much so then. She got sick afterwards, vomited, and was very ill. She was put to bed, but got up again in a few minutes; the vomiting and purging returned - She went to sleep again, and awoke in about an hour. We sent for the doctor-it died about twenty minutes after eight o'clock that night. The prisoner left the house about an hour after she brought it home; she did not appear very sober. She said the child had taken two glasses of gin, one of rum, and two-pennyworth of peppermint, part of two pots of porter, and a small drop of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say where she had it - A. She mentioned the Rose and Crown, as one public-house. She always appeared very kind to the child.</p>
               <p>ELLEN DUGGAN. I am the wife of the last witness, the prisoner went out with the child, and returned about half-past eight o'clock; the child was quite intoxicated-it had a fit in the bed. The prisoner said she gave it two glasses of gin, one of rum, and two-penny worth of peppermint, and some wine. I confirm the statement of my husband.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE DUGGAN. The deceased was my sister; the prisoner returned with her between eight and nine o'clock-she was drunk, and very ill, I went out and returned about six o'clock; I told the prisoner, she ought to be ashamed, to give the child so much liquor. She said, she would give it more by and by, when she got better of this.</p>
               <p>-WOOD. I keep the Rose and Crown, in Broad-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner came to my house, with the child, about a quarter after eight o'clock, and called for a glass of gin, which she gave to the child-the child asked if she was to drink it off? The prisoner said Yes. I said it would take her breath away-the child however drank it off. She gave it nothing more.</p>

            . I attend St. George's Hospital. On the 30th of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I examined the body of the deceased-the stomach and the intestines were inflamed. I could discover no appearance of poison having been given to the child. She appeared healthy.</p>
               <p>Q. From the inflammation, if she had taken the quantity of liquor it would be likely to produce death - A. The stomach would exhibit the appearances I found; it would cause vomiting and purging before death. One glass of gin taken by such a child, at one draught, would produce these appearances.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were in the habit of giving the child liquor. I gave it a glass, and did not think it would hurt.</p>

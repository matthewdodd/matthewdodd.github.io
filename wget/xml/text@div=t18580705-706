                  </hi>. I am the messenger in the coal department of the railway. I live at a cottage next to the coal office—the premises are entered by large folding gates, from St. Pancras Road—I have a lodge, in which I am night and day—the large folding gates are closed at night, about 9 o'clock—if any one came after that, the policeman at the lodge would answer—the policeman is not at my lodge; he has a box to himself; he is there all night—there is not a small gate; persons come in at the great gates—I remember the night of this robbery, 24th May—I was in my lodge that night—I was in bed when this took place; I went to bed about half past 9 o'clock—the name of the policeman on duty is Allistone; he had not come; the other policeman, Cox, who is relieved by Allistone, had not left when I went to bed—they usually change at 6 o'clock, but there was an excursion that day—on the monring of the 25th, I was called by Sergeant Edwards, about 3 o'clock; I saw Alli<lb></lb>stone there—I procured the key of the coal office from Allistone's box; that is where it is usually kept—it was the habit of the prisoner, when he left, to hang up that key in that box—having obtained it, I went to the door of the coal office, and opened it with the key; it opened the lock readily in the usual way—I went up stairs with the policeman, and found the safe open, and robbed—I went and called the prisoner; he lodged with me; he was in bed—I told him what had occurred, and he came down to try hit key.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of the Great Northern Railway Company. On the morning of the 25th, between 9 and 10 o'clock, the prisoner made a statement, before the general manager, of where he had been on the night of the robbery—I made some rongh notes of what passed—he said that he left that night about half-past 9 o'clock, rather earlier than usual, and placed the cash in the safe—this bag was shown him, and he said that it was the bag in which the money was put—he said that he left the premises about 10 o'clock or a few minutes before 10 o'clock, and went to see his doctor, Mr. Taylor, in the New Road; he could not tell the number, but it was between Mabledon Place and St. Pancras Church; that he was at home, and he saw him at a quarter past 10 o'clock; that he afterwards went to Burton Crescent to see some friends, whom he named, at a public house, not by appointment, he usually went there—he said that, on leaving the coal station, he went down Wharf Road, Brewer Street, and Skinner Street, into the New Road; that he was last in the office, and placed the last cash in the safe at half-past 9 o'clock, and then turned the gas off; that he carried the cash up himself from his drawers, and locked the safe; that the cash was in the leather bag produced—he produced the key of the leather bag and unlocked it; he said "This key is always attached to this bunch," which he produced—he said he always carried the keys with him as they were important he said he was positive he locked the safe, because there are two distinct operations in locking it—and that he had tried the door afterwards, and that he could not account for the door being unlocked—he said, "It looks very serious against me."</p>

On 25th May, about 11 o'clock, I searched the prisoner's apartment at Coal Office Cottage—he was present, and it was done by his permission—I found this great coat behind the door in the bedroom—I said, "Is this the coat you wore last night;" he said "Yes"—the coat was wet, and there was wet mud on one of the arms—I found a trunk there; the prisoner said "You will find gold in that trunk;" I said "How much;" he said he did not know—I said "I would rather you would name the amount"—he took</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Herbert Street, Hoxton; I am foreman to Messrs. Chubbs, locksmiths. On 26th May, I examined a safe, on the first floor of the office of the coal department of the Great Northern Railway—I took the lock off the safe—it was a lock of our firm's—there was not the least appearance of there having been any tampering with it—this is the key of the lock; I tried the lock with this key before taking it off; it went per<lb></lb>fectly easy—I then took the lock off; there was dust in it, and nothing but the mark of the radiation of the key; there was no other scratch or mark of any kind—if that lock had been opened, it must have been by one of the real keys, or by a fac simile key.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might one be made from an impression of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I defy the best workmen in London to make a key from that impression—I recollect the circumstance of the South Eastern gold dust robbery, but those locks were only what we call tumbler locks; this is a detector lock—those were common working locks, made to stand all sorts of work—in that case, the key that opened the lock was made from an impression, but they were different locks to this—I do not think a key of this lock could be made from an impression—go to the best workman, and give him the best impression that you can possibly take, and I do not think he could make a key that would open it—I do not say that it is absolutely impossible—the cuts in the tumblers of the lock are made so minute, that the impression in wax would not do; if one tumbler is risen up, there is not room for a sheet of writing paper; a gentle<lb></lb>man tried it by tying a hair round it, and the key would not pass the lock—we have very frequently to make keys, but we never undertake to make a key that will pass; if it does not pass, we say we will do it again; sometimes</p>

               <p>we are obliged to have the lock sent to us—we have tried to make keys from impressions; we frequently have impressions sent by post from different parts of the country; we have tried to make them, and they have almost invariably failed—we have succeeded—I do not say it is impossible to make one—I could not quote a single instance in which we have succeeded, but I believe we have done so—I have been foreman about ten years—I cannot form any idea of the number of times, because it is so rare.</p>

I have not given him an I O U—I requested him in writing, to pay a certain sum out of his receipts, and he retained that till I paid him again—I paid him in cash, when I got a cheque from the Company cashed—he has never borrowed of me—I paid him after an interval of two or three days, or it might be five days, two days, generally.

It is a circuitous road, it is the practice of the office—if he had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay in, he could not pay in that order of mine to the company, they would not keep that as my order, they must have cash—I sometimes have borrowed of him every week, and sometimes not for a month—this has been done ever since the office has been open, it was known to the officials of the Company—I cannot say that it was known to the directors, it is not my business to make those inquiries—I imagine the persons under whom I act, know it; the person who was in the berth before me, did the same thing—I do not get a cheque from the Company for the exact amount I paid him—I send in an account for petty cash—I should send in an account of what I had expended; as soon as I had received the cheque, I should have to pay 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner, but, the account would not contain a statement of my being indebted to the prisoner, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only my own disbursement.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this borrowing system done in secret? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. I never borrowed except by directions in writing, and these directions would be in the prisoner's possession till he settled with me the next time. It is possible that he may have been unable to balance his account, by reason of his lending me these sums, if the carmen had not arrived in sufficient time—I would not take that written statement as money, I should have the money—he kept the written statements in his possession till I paid him the money—he would then return them to me and I tear them up.</p>

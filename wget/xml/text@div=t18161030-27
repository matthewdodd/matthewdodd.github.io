            . On the morning in question I was in our back shop, which looks into the front shop. I went into the shop, and there was a man dressed in a sailor's jacket, whom I since understand was 
               <persName id="t18161030-27-person286">
                  Daniel

            . He came forward putting out a one pound note, and asked me if I would suit him with a pair of small clothes. Suspecting his character, I told him I could not. After he went out I missed the cloth, and I went after him, I went as far as Charles-street, Drury-lane, and could see nothing of him. In about a quarter of an hour after that I thought I would not give it up, but I went again, and I saw 
               <persName id="t18161030-27-person287">
                  Daniel

             and the two prisoners after him coming up Charles-street. Kelley, the prisoner at the bar, had a bundle tied up in a handkerchief. I turned round in order to follow him, and Daniel turned under Short's Gardens gateway. I was running, and I was perceived by the prisoner, 
               <persName id="t18161030-27-person288">
                  Richard

            , who looked round, and immediately turned out of my sight. I waited, and soon after saw all three. I pursued them as close as I could, and Richard Kelley appeared to have something under his coat, and was running very fast down Short's Gardens. I pursued him, crying stop thief, and he was stopped. In Short's Gardens I afterwards found the bundle which contained the cloth in question. Daniel Kelley, who had been in the shop, got clear off. Prescott was afterwards apprehended. I did not see the two prisoners about the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hine, of No. 9, Crown Street, Soho, a pianoforte maker; he also deals in second-hand clothes. On Friday morning, 16th Oct, about a quarter past 7 o'clock, the prisoner came there and brought some coffee, lump sugar, three coats, some gold scales, a mantle, and a brush—I said, "Good morning, you are out early"—he said, "Yes, I have been at the Coal Hole all night"—he asked my husband to buy this coat, but refused to ask a price for it—he asked half a sovereign for this other coat, but my husband would not buy it—I said, "What are you going to do with these scales?"—he said, "I am going to have new ones like them, as I am going to Australia next week"—I said, "What are you going to do with the coffee and sugar?"—he said, "You can buy it if you like, but do not buy it unless you like, in case it should be stolen"—I said, "If I buy it, I shall give you the full price"—he said that he got them from his lawyer, who had a brother who let him have things instead of money which was-coming to him—I bought nothing, but he made me a present of this small book, which I gave to the constable—while he was there, I went two or three times to Mr. Harris, the publican, and he called a policeman, and spoke to him, but he refused to interfere—I followed the prisoner into George Street, No. 3, I believe, and sent a little boy for a policeman—Ball came, and we both went into the kitchen.</p>

On Thursday evening, 3rd Oct., I heard my fellow servant close the door of the house at a quarter past 11 o'clock, and chain and bar it—the back door leading to the yard was shut, but on the latch—I went to bed, leaving no one up—I sleep down stairs—I was awoke by a policeman, next morning, about a quarter to 7 o'clock, went into the kitchen, and found Floret there—I missed a black silk mantle, and three pairs of stockings Of mine, also fourteen pounds of sugar, and some coffee in separate parcels, which were sup<lb></lb>plied by the firm for the young ladies.</p>

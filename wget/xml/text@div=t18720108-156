                  </hi>. I am eight years old, and live with my mother at 41, Flask Street, Hampstead—on a Wednesday, some time ago, my mother came into the bedroom, my sister Mary was there—my mother took off my frock and got a razor from the clock, and cut my arm across three times, once up here, and once down here, and one across here—it bled—she did not say anything—we had our dinner—we dine at 12 o'clock—she then did the same thing to my sister, but she did not take off her frock, because her sleeves were short—mine were long—she said nothing when she cut my sister's arm—I said "Mother, are you sorry for what you have done?"—she said "Yes," and kissed us both, and said "Now I am going to see Mr. Winter, and tell him"—he is a doctor—she then went out, and I did not see anything more of her till she came back with a policeman—my sister and I were taken to the hospital that afternoon—when my mother had gone out I stopped the bleeding because I <hi rend="italic">bounded</hi> my arm up with mother's apron, and my sister with mother's handkerchief, and directly I took the apron off my arm it begun bleeding directly—my mother has always been very kind indeed—she saw me in the hospital, and I said "Mother, when I come home you promise me you will never do it again"—and she said she did not think she had done it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been ill some weeks before this with an ulcerated throat and fever, and my mother always sat up with me and nursed me by night as well as by day—she had sat up with me the night before—I have only one sister, and no brother—my father works at a railway station, I for<lb></lb>get the name—I had been a very good girl that day, and my mother had not said anything cross to me, nor yet to my sister.</p>

About 4 o'clock in the afternoon of 27th September the prisoner came to me in James's Street, which is two miles from her residence, and said that she had done something wrong—I asked her what she had done—she said she had cut her two children—I asked her where she lived—she said "Flask Wharf, Hampstead"—I found that was the correct address—I took a cab, and took her home in it, and her husband also—she told me where he worked—we went into the front kitchen underground, and found the two children there, one in one bed, and the other in the other, bleeding very much, and the floor was saturated</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Middlesex Hospital—the girl Sarah Harris was brought there on 27th September with three incised wounds round the lower part of her left arm, one of them penetrating to the bone—they were each about three inches long, and she had evidently lost a great deal of blood—it was necessary to ligature one, and to secure the other by torsion—the principal wound was very near the principal artery running down the arm—if it had touched that it would have been fatal without medical assistance, and amputation would have been rendered necessary—she was in the hospital about six weeks, and left on 13th November—she has not recovered yet—the lower wound divided a muscle which causes paralysis of the fore-arm—she will not lose the use of her wrist permanently, but it will take many months before she regains it, and it must permanently interfere with the muscles of the fore-arm, which have been divided, and their power is impaired, but she will regain perfect use of her fore-arm—the wounds on the other child were of the same nature, and nearly in the same places.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 58, High Street, Hampstead—I had attended the prisoner for six years before this happened, and had been in pretty constant attendance on the eldest girl for about two months before this occurrence—she had gastric fever, which required constant watching night and day for two months—the mother alone did the nursing; there was no servant, and no other person there—she must have been up pretty con<lb></lb>stantly night and day—I know that she had a miscarriage the Saturday before—I attended her, and saw her every day between that Saturday and the Wednesday, and I had seen her on the Wednesday at 1 o'clock, and noticed irritability and weakness from the miscarriage, but I noticed nothing particular about her mind—I attribute the miscarriage to the anxiety and want of sleep in the watching of the eldest girl—I have never noticed any<lb></lb>thing peculiar in the prisoner's state of mind.</p>

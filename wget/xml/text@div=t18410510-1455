                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop in Wardour-street. On the 4th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and asked for a cup of coffee, and two slices of bread and butter—I served him—about five minutes after, he called for two more slices—he was served—it came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him for payment—he did not say he would or would not pay, but he did not pay me—he would not give me any answer—he got up, and was going out without paying—I went and stopped him at the door—he talked to me in French, which I did not under<lb></lb>stand—I asked him to speak to my wife, who understood French—she spoke to him in French, and said he owed 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for what he had had—he did not say he would or would not pay—he took some money out of his pocket, but did not offer to pay—he turned round, and was going away—he had a stick in his hand, and he struck me on the head with it—the knob came off—I had never attempted to strike him—I then took hold of his stick—we struggled, and he put his hand into his breast-pocket, drew out a thing, and stabbed me on the head, momentarily—it was not with the stick, but with some sharp instrument—the blood followed imme<lb></lb>diately, and I was blinded—a surgeon attended me—my wife called in the police, and the prisoner was taken into custody—no instrument was found—he was not searched till he got to the station-house—I never struck him at all.</p>

I was called in, and found the pri<lb></lb>soner—the prosecutor was completely covered with blood—he informed me what bad occurred, and said he had been wounded by the prisoner—I brought the prisoner out of the house—he kept his hand on the tail of his coat—I did not search him then, because the <hi rend="italic">mob</hi> was so great about—if it had not been for me and another policeman he would have been torn limb from limb; besides, I could scarcely hold him—he appeared to have something in his coat-pocket, which he was guarding—he resisted so much that we were obliged at last to bind him, and carry him on a stretcher—I searched the place directly I returned from the station, but could find no instrument—I have not the slightest doubt that it dropped during the struggle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutor came to my house a little after twelve o'clock in the morning of the 4th of May, with his bead bleeding—he had a wound on his head, which appeared to have been inflicted not with a sharp instrument, but with a stick—I signed these depositions—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

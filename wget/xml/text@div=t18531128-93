                  </hi>. I am a timber merchant, carrying on business at Stratford, in the parish of West Ham. On 26th Oct., a little after 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was brought in charge to my house by our timber hewer—he brought two window sills with him; they were mine—I had seen them about 6 o'clock that evening—they were worth half a crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am timber hewer to Mr. Martin, and live at Dagenham. I met the prisoner coming out of my master's yard, about 20 minutes past 8 o'clock, with these two window sills under his arm—I stopped him; I told him to walk on his way, and take his load with him—he said they did not belong to him—I took him up to the counting house door to my master, and a policeman was sent for.</p>

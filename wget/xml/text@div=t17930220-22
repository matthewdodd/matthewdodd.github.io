               <p>Q. Did you know before he went away that the gun was missing? - I did not, it was three weeks after he was gone I knew it was missing, and the man came and told me that there was a gun to be sold; after the gun was missing there was a little bit of an oration in the part about our neighbourhood, that the gun was to be disposed of; I did not go, but the man went.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw your gun again? - The man was taken the 7th of February, he was brought to Bow-street the 8th of February, and there I saw my gun at the publick office; when the gun was found on this man I was not present.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Bowlan; please you my lord, my master put the gun into my possession, and I lost it out of the barn.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowlan. I thought you put it in the possession of the prisoner? - No, it was in this man's care.</p>
               <p>Court to Allen. When was it put into your care? - It may be six weeks ago or more, I cannot justly say to the day; I repeatedly used it, it was kept in the barn; I missed it about a couple of days before the prisoner went away; I looked after the gun to carry it in the house; I missed it and I said to him that I missed it; I saw it again in his barn, where he was at work for another master; I saw it this day fortnight, at a place called Kingsborough, Mr. Golden is the master's name that he at present works for. I found the gun when I went behind some straw; I did not interrupt it then; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200042"></xptr>was not there then; I went back to my master again; my master sent me over again to fetch it, this was the same day; when I went over again I went to his lodgings in the evening, his lodgings are at Kingsborough-green; he told us he lodged there, I saw him there; I went in and asked if Mr. Sturges was at home; I said to him, I hear you have got a gun to sell, and I should be glad to see it if you please. He said, he had no such thing, and he knew nothing at all about any such thing of the kind. The constable delivered the gun up to me at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how this gun found its way into Mr. Golden's barn, you cannot tell? - No, I cannot.</p>

             is my sister. - She married my own brother.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 14th of December, about half after seven, as near as I can recollect, we had been to Warner-street, to which place my sister had been to dispose of the counterpane. Warner-street is somewhere on Clerkenwell-green. We were returning from Warner-street to my house, Brackley-street, Golden-lane. - The first thing was, that my sister stopped to tie up her garter. - On which there were two bad women and a young man with them passed, that made a very bad expression. - I did not notice them, any otherwise than that, I observed a man with them. I came to the corner of Sutton-street, which turns about the post. I perceived the young fellow to pass me very swiftly by, going in the same direction with me, I noticed him to have a blue jacket and a round-hat. - Then I was saying to my sister, that I knew Mr. Cannon, that kept the Bunch of Grapes; and while I was speaking to my sister, he passed quickly between me and the window, and looked in my face. I believe it is the same man that passed me twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have turned? - I did not observe that, but I observed that he was the same person, as I believe, but I am not certain it is the prisoner who passed me. There was a person passing while my sister was tying up her garters; and another while I was speaking to my sister at the Bunch of Grapes window, that person, I believe to have been the prisoner; but the person that passed me afterwards I am sure was the prisoner. He was dressed in a blue jacket, round hat, and a striped waistcoat. After he had passed me, he struck cross-wise, and came and catched hold of my bundle. I had just got across to the Charter-house-wall then. I did not observe him at me, till he seized my bundle. I was following my sister. I had crost, going to the place where I lodged. This was at the corner of <placeName id="t17921215-67-crimeloc382">Wilderness-row</placeName>

               <p>Jury. Which end of Wilderness-row? - In Goswell-street. - There was nothing passed; but he gave me a sudden twitch: and there came behind a lad of fourteen or fifteen years of age, and he also catched hold of my bundle. - Then the prisoner aimed to hit me, and he missed my head and hit my shoulder with a stick. - From that he raised his hand again; and I looked at him, and said, will you strike me, you villain? At which the blow hit me on the bonnet, just over my eye, and knocked me to the ground. It was a violent blow - it stunned me. I was certain it was the prisoner as soon as I saw him. The first thing that I observed, after I was sensible, was that I was dragged along by this person and another, on the ground, by my bundle. - I was dragged very near from the corner of Wilderness-row, to the Bar at the end of Wilderness-row. I called out, by name, Mr. Cannon, for God's sake, come out; I am murdered! When I called out, the prisoner ran away, and took the bundle with him, and tore sadly the inside of my hands. On my calling for assistance, they were pursued. I saw him again in the course of the evening. - As soon as I did, I jumped up, (though hardly recovered) and was going to seize him as the person. I was taken into Mr. Cannon's, and they brought him into Mr. Cannon's to me. He was in the room when I came to myself. I jumped up, and said, that was the villain that robbed me and used me so. I had not been informed that any body was taken at all. - I was hardly sensible. - There was a number of strangers in the room. I have no doubt about him at all. As he held up his arm to strike me, I noticed him; and his dress was the same; but not the dress he has on now. - He had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150101"></xptr>blue jacket, a round hat, and a striped waistcoat, cross-wise. I could not see the colour of the stripes by the lamplight.</p>
               <p>Court. You describe, three different times, persons passed you; and the prisoner was the person that passed you the last time. - He was, and directly as he had passed, he came and snatched at my bundle.</p>

               <p>Between the hours of seven and eight, I was going up Wilderness row, and I heard a cry of murder! and stop thief! I was got about three parts down; and I saw the prisoner ren by me, with a bundle. - And on account of the alarm, I took him just at the bottom. I never quitted sight of him, after he ran by me, till I got him; but he dropped the bundle before I took him: but when he ran by, I saw him have the bundle under his arm. I know it is the man, for he never was out of my sight after I had seen him with the bundle under his arm. The patrole came up, and took him while he was in my custody. I saw the bundle again directly, as soon as possible, the man that picked it up could come up. - Williams brought up the bundle.</p>

On this cry I returned, running pretty swiftly. Just as I got to the pavement, I met a man, full-plump. Directly he saw me, he threw from him a bundle, which he had in his hand, down into Cross street. Mr. Thorpe had passed me about a yard, and got up to him, and struck him on the neck, against the iron rails. I took the bundle up, and brought it to him. After we had secured him, we took him to the public house to the prosecutrix; and directly she saw him, she was just recovered from a fainting-fit; she said, that is the villain that robbed me. Then Mr. Thorpe and I followed him to the watch-house. We went down Wilderness-row; and I wanted to see whether there was any bludgeon, or any thing else. - He had taken nothing else of her. While we were going to the watch-house, and looking about, the prisoner said he had taken nothing else. I suppose it was what he spoke accidentally. I told the patrole what I was looking for; and he knew I was looking for the bludgeon.</p>

               <p>I was constable of the night. I took charge of the prisoner, and took him to New Prison: and then I went to look for the woman to get her address; and she was very nigh an hour before she came to herself, to speak. (The counterpane and handkerchief deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. When Mr Cannon came out, was you sensible he came to you? - I was sensible he took me up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Steadman. Did you observe what sort of a waistcoat he had on? - It was a waistcoat, striped a-cross; and a blue jacket. (This was also corroborated by Thorpe and Fidler.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six Witnesses to his character.</p>

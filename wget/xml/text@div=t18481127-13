I missed the money as soon as Huxford left, a little after five on 28th Oct.—I have seen Goodson in my place when we lived next door, but not in this house—he is a picture-frame maker—I had told Huxford on Friday that Mr. Reeve had got his rent money, and was going to pay it next morning, but we had not enough by 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to do so—the box in which the money was kept was not locked.</p>

Goodson was my waiter for nearly three months—he left me of his own accord, on 23rd Oct.—he came back on 28th, and saw my wife—I was not present—he came on Sunday the 29th, about ten o'clock, and said he had met with a friend who had lent him a few pounds, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he owed me about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him an I O U for it—the officer came and apprehended him that same night, about a quarter to twelve—I went to the door to see what was the matter—Goodson put out his hand, and some money dropped from it which the officer picked up—Huxford had come to the house with him, but had gone out at the time the officer came—they had been up stairs in the club-room—a number of other persons were there—during the time Goodson lived with me I had seen Huxford there several times, but I did not know that there was any particular intimacy between them.</p>

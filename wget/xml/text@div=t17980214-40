               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to you on the 30th of January? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140044"></xptr>Q. Did he purchase any goods? - A. He bought a pair of boots, and two pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they amount to? - A. One pound eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any man with him when he came? - A.There was an elderly person, I imagined him to be the mate.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he offer to pay you? - A. By tendering me down a 20l. note, as it appeared to me to be, (the note produced); I believe this to be the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the note that he tendered you in payment? - A. I took it and looked at it; I did not like the appearance of the colour of the paper, and I did not like to change it, but sent it over to a neighbour opposite me.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom did you send it? - A. By my son, and he brought it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the note your son brought back was the same note? - A. It looked like the same; then I inspected more closely into it, and sent it to a Mr. Allybone by my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son bring it back unchanged? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. After your son had tried there, what did you do with it? - A. I took it to a Mr. Culland, in Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get change for it? - A. I sent it by a servant maid to Mr. Culland, only to inspect into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring you back the note? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. After she returned you the note what did you do with it? - A. I took it to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to there? - A. It was a holiday; I delivered it to a clerk, and he delivered it to a Mr. Blifs, the inspector.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it delivered to Mr. Blifs in your presence? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to? - A. I don't know the gentleman's name.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mr. Blifs? - A. I saw him about three minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the note in Mr. Blifs's possession? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether Mr. Blifs put a mark upon it? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note you saw in Mr. Blifs's possession the same note you sent in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is the mark of W. A. upon the back of the note? - A. That is my mark.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you make those letters? - A. I signed them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had shewn this to Mr. Blifs what did you do? - A. Mr. Blifs returned with the note, and we went to Mr. Winter, the Solicitor of the Bank; two officers attended Mr. Blifs, and then I went with them to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to your own house, did you find the prisoner there? - A. The prisoner at the bar was there, and this gentleman, the mate.</p>
               <p>Q. When the officers came to him did you hear him say any thing about the note? - A. When the officers came in rather hot upon him and searched him, he stood with a great deal of fortitude.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you hear him, while the officers were searching him, say any thing about this note? - A. I heard him say, he took it Chichester.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. I see you have put your initials upon it, you have no doubt but it is the same? - A. I know it to be the same, I think I could pick it out of a hundred, I observed the word, pounds, wrote with a pen, and not a copperplate; I don't recollect I ever saw one wrote with a pen, but the grand reason is the colour of the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the Bank, you gave it to a clerk, whose name you do not know? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. He took it from you, and went away for about three minutes? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course, except from your supposing it to be the same, it having been out of your possession three minutes, you have no other way of knowing it? - A. No other way than by believing it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. The next time you saw it, it was in Mr. Blifs's hands? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that the prisoner said something, do you mean that he spoke any words in English? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by words in English, he made use of the name of a town, or the name of a man? - A.Several words in English.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he talked of the town of Chichester? - A.He did say Chichester.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean, upon your oath, to say that he spoke the English language fluently? - A. No, by no means fluently; "no good" is an English word, and he said, "why?" when it was told him by the mate, that I did not like to change the note, he came and asked me in this manner, "why?" I told him, I did not like the colour of the note, I thought it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the only thing you can remember? - A. I think it was very properly answered.</p>
               <p>Q. The conversation between him and the mate was in their own language? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe, when they were talking their own language, that many of the words were like our own English? - A. I cannot say that, I did not pay any attention.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent the note out three times? - A. No; twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Those different times of offering the note, took up some space of time? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140045"></xptr>Q.Each of the times that this note was returned, he continued still in your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he entertain an idea of your suspicions? - A.There was not a doubt of his understanding my suspicions, because he was told of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have been gone to the Bank? - A. It took some time; I might be gone very near an hour and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding this suspicion, and knowing where you were gone, you found him, on your return, still waiting for you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You described that he behaved with a great deal of fortitude? - A. With a great deal of fortitude.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you told him of your objection to the 20l. did he say, he could pay you in any other way? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make your objection to the 20l. note before you went to make enquiries about it? - A. Yes, I did, before I took it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made those objections before you sent your son to get change for it? - A.Not to the prisoner at the bar, I had made those objections to my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that loud enough for the prisoner and the mate to hear? - A. I don't think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the prisoner to pay you in any other way? - A. When he tendered me down the 20l. note, I did not like the colour of the paper, and I asked him, if he could accommodate me with a smaller note; I was made to understand, by the mate, that the prisoner had no smaller; the prisoner had his pocket-book in his hand, and he shewed me a note, which he said, was a 50l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked for a smaller note, and he said, he had not a smaller note, did you mention any thing about cash? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You understood by the mate and the prisoner, that he had not a smaller note than the 20l.? - A. Yes; when I asked him, if he had a smaller note, he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. You first suggested your objection to your son, and sent him out to get change? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On his return, you told the prisoner and the mate, you had some suspicions about it? - A. I did; and the mate gave him to understand, I did not like to change it, and he said, why?</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it before you went to Mr. Culland's, that you intimated your suspicions that the note was not a good one? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been to Mr. Culland's, you did not see the prisoner again till you returned with the officer? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he understood you when you asked him whether he had a smaller note? - A. I am sure he did, he said, no, and shewed me another note, which he said, was a 50l. note, I did not see it open.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he shew you any 10l. notes, or make mention of any? - A. He did not; I saw no 10l. note.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q.You are the son of the last witness? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you in the shop on the 30th of January, when the prisoner at the bar and his mate came in? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you come in? - A.Between the hours of eleven and twelve, those two men were then in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.What were they doing? - A.They were bargaining with my father for a pair of boots and two pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them spoke to you father? - A. The mate was rather the interpreter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other speak any English or not? - A. I did not observe that he said any words of English that I could distinctly understand; they agreed to pay one pound eighteen shillings for one pair of boots and two pair of shoes; the prisoner at the bar gave my father a 20l. note for the payment of those boots and thoes, he took it out of a pocket-book; my father said, he would be obliged to him if he would accommodate him with a smaller note, as he had not change enough to change it.</p>
               <p>Q. What said the prisoner? - A. I did not understand the prisoner said any thing, but shewed a 50l. note; he shewed a note in his pocket-book, which he said, was a 50l. he did not take it quite out of his pocket-book; my father gave me the 20l. note, and desired me to go over to Mrs. Glegg, who keeps a public-house, to get it changed; I took the note from my father, and gave it into Mrs. Glegg's hand; it never passed out of my sight till I returned it to my father; he then sent me to a Mr. Allybone, in order to have his opinion whether it was a good note; I did not go there to change it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take the note back? - A. Mr. Allybone was not at home, I gave it to his wife, and she carried it back into a back room, to give it to her son, and there it passed out of my sight for a few minutes; she brought me back a note, which I believe to be the same that I gave to her, I took it back again to my father; my father and I went behind the counter to examine the note, and my father held it up to the light, and he perceived the water mark was very dull, and he saw the word, pounds, was wrote with a pen instead of the copperplate; my father said, gentlemen, if you will stop a minute, I will go up stairs and compare this note with some notes I have got; my father went up stairs, and when my father came down, he said, he had not change enough in the house, but he would go out and get it changed; my father put on his hat and went out, and took the note with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was gone, had you any conversa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140046"></xptr>tion with the prisoner? - A. I had with the mate, but not with the prisoner; I could not understand what the prisoner said.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was your father absent? - A. I believe about an hour or an hour and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at any time learn where your father was gone? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. When your father returned, what passed between you and the prisoner? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came with your father? - A. I believe two officers, and Mr. Blifs, belonging to the Bank, came with my father; the officers immediately searched the captain. (The note produced).</p>
               <p>Q.Is that the same note you took, have you any means of judging? - A. By every appearance of the note, I believe it to be the same, but I cannot swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any questions put to him respecting where he got the notes? - A. I believe the inspector asked him where he took the notes, and the mate said, Chichester, and the captain said, Chichester.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That was after the mate had said something to the prisoner, which you did not understand? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the captain say, Chichester? - A. I did, repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing more passed? - A. I don't remember that there was, I believe I have told you the whole of what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they found upon the captain? - A.There was a 50l. and a 10l. note; the 50l. note, they said, was a bad one, and the 10l. note was good.</p>
               <p>Q.Any money? - A. Two guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Before you parted with the note to Mrs. Allybone, you had put no mark upon the note? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was Mrs. Allybone absent with the note? - A. I believe, about a minute or two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.She went completely out of your sight? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. The mate was the person who was the spokesman upon this business? - A. He was, the whole time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by the spokesman? - A. He was the person who interpreted what the captain said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did the mate speak bad English himself? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you might understand in general what he said, he might speak some words you did not understand? - A. In general, I understood what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that the mate could understand every thing that you said? - A. I believe he did by the answers he made.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time your father and you were holding the note up to the light, where was the prisoner and mate? - A. They were in the shop at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they, while your father and your were behind the counter, holding up the note to the light, see that you were doing so? - A.They could.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time your father said, gentlemen, if you will stay a little, I will go up stairs and compare the note with some I have got there, did they hear what your father said? - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it appeared to you, that the prisoner at the bar perfectly well knew what your father said? - A. If the prisoner did not, the mate perfectly did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the mate in general communicate the conversation held between your father and him to the prisoner? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge; the two Bank-notes found in my possession; I received from Mr. Van-Haberbach, on the quay, at Dunkirk, the day I failed from that place; I have been acquainted with him for many years; in the course of my acquaintance with him, I had lent him 20 guineas, which I asked him to pay me, he told me he had got no money, but said, here are two Bank-notes, they will be as good in England as guineas; you may pay yourself, and bring me some goods; he mentioned some hats, razors, great buttons, and small buttons, and some cloth; I put them in my pocket, and when I was at Messrs. Van-Dyke and Co.'s office, I observed that a pilot, to whom one of the clerks paid a Bank-note, wrote something on the back of it, it occurred to me that the notes I received of Mr. Van-Haberbach had not any thing written upon them; I shewed one of them to Mr. Vint, and asked him if it was a good one, as Mr. Van-Haberbach had not written upon it, and Mr. Vint said it was, and shewed it to one of his clerks, who said the same; I could not tell whether it was a good one or not, never having seen a Bank-note before, excepting five, which I received from Mr. Hobbs, of Chichester, the last voyage before the present one, and the only time I was ever in England before.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of Dunkirk? - A. I cannot exactly say where.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where you saw him last? - A. About an hour before we failed from thence.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. The prisoner came to the door with a sort of a half sieve of fruit; a man took them from her head: she came in and said, she wanted a pair of shoes to do her service; I brought four pair, none of them were wide enough; she has a remarkable wide foot. Our boy said, take care of that woman, she has been at our shop before; I believe she wants to steal a pair of shoes. She ordered a pair to be made by the Saturday, and went out; I saw a bulk by her side, and as she stooped to put her head to the half sieve, I did not see it as she arose up. The boy went and brought her back, and I saw the shoes under her cloaths; they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030012"></xptr> taken out; she said she had bought them at another shop; I know them to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had two baskets; I set them down, and tried two or three pair; none fitted; he said he would do me a pair against Saturday; I was very contented. A fellow came by; I had a pair of shoes in my hand; I went out with them in my hand to save my fruit; they brought me in, and charged me with stealing them.</p>

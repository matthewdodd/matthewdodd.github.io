A Man belonging to her (as I suppose) came up to us. I was Sadly frighted, and gave her 2 Holland Doits and 18 Pence; and then seeing a Man coming along with a Lanthorn, I called out for help! The Woman was brought to the Watch-House, and the 2 Holland Pieces were found upon her, but she denied the 18 Pence.</p>

             thus depos'd. The Boy calling the Watch, I went up to him, and found him with a Man and a Woman; he said the Man had rob'd him. I carried the Man to the Watch-House, and then the Boy told me I should have brought the Woman too, for he knew not which of 'em it was that had got his Money. Soon after he had spoken, the Prisoner came in of her own accord, and said, Are not you a wicked young Rogue, to say that I rob'd you, when you gave me these two Copper Pieces to go down an Alley with you. The Man was cleared before the Justice, and the Jury <rs id="t17261012-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

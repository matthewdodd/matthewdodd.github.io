I found a dead body in the kitchen - I could not see it. I called for a light, and the first thing I saw was one of the heels of her shoes, just above the water; when I moved it, it smelt dreadfully; I pulled the body up against the foot of the stairs - it was the body of a woman, she had a straw bonnet on her head. Brown's brother helped me. I could not tell by the features whose body it was, as I never knew her. The surgeon saw the body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When was the body found - A. On the 7th of June; I found it by raking in the water with a clothes prop - the end of it was not pointed. I used it sideways.</p>

            . I am surgeon of the Marylebone Infirmary. I examined the body of the deceased on Thursday or Friday - I believe it was the day it was found. I went to the house when it was found; it was very putrid. I cannot say how long it had been dead, a long time, undoubtedly. I observed the face, the features were nearly removed, it could not be known by the features. I observed a great loss of substance all round the neck on each side, a great part of the flesh was removed by vermin. I saw no marks that I can swear were marks of violence - it appeared to me that rats had been feeding on it; the wounds were so extensive that a person must bleed to death immediately, but they were caused by vermin.</p>

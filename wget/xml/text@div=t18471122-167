                  </hi> I am a brush maker, at Lyall-place, Pim<lb></lb>lico—the prisoner was in my employ on 3rd July, and had been for a month or two—he gave me an order that day from a person named Gill—he said he was a grocer at Brixton, and had given him an order for half a dozen seven-inch dusters, four dozen stock brushes, and four dozen common tools—he said Mr. Gill had promised to pay for them at the end of them months, from the time of delivery—the prisoner was employed to make the brushes, and they were sent—I afterwards went to Brixton; I could find no such person as</p>

               <p>Mr. Gill—I have been since, with the same success—the prisoner remained with me till Sept.—I have never been paid for the brushes—on 28th Aug. I told the prisoner I had every reason to believe Gill was a false name and address, and said I wished him to state whether it was so, and likewise some others—he said it was a false name and address—he had asked for the goods in Mr. Gill's name, as an order for Mr. Gill—I should not have let him have the goods except in some one's name.</p>

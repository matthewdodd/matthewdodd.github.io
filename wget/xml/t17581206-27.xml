               <p>Q. When did you loose it?</p>
               <p>S. Rush. I did not miss it 'till Saturday night last. </p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at your house that day?</p>
               <p>S. Rush. He was. I have known him from a child.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>S. Rush. He served his time to a Peruke-maker, at Rotherhith. His mother is a very honest woman, and lives at Newport-Pagnel.</p>
               <p>Mark David. Last Monday evening the young man at the bar came to my house with a silver pint mug to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>David. I am a Taylor by trade, and deal in gentlemens left off cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to go to a Taylor's house to sell a silver mug?</p>
               <p>David. He had met one of our Jews, that carried a box about with silver, and that man recommended him with it to me, because I am constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he ask you for it?</p>
               <p>David. He ask'd me five shillings an ounce. I stopp'd it. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mrs Rush. This is my property, here is W. R. S. on the bottom of it; our people sometimes leave them in the yard.</p>
               <p>David. I brought the prisoner to Guildhall, before an Alderman, and he was committed to Newgate; he own'd, as we were going along, that he took it out of Mrs Rush's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the Alderman?</p>
               <p>David. He cried very much, and said, he was very poor, and was asham'd to borrow money of Mrs Rush, and he took it out of want.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs Rush. Was you with the prisoner at Guildhall?</p>
               <p>Mrs Rush. I was: I cannot say that he said three words there; had he ask'd me for twice the value of it, on his mother's account, I would have let him have it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found it lying in the yard. I implore the mercy of the court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, of Holloway. The pri<lb></lb>soner has been in my employ six or seven weeks, as an improver—he boarded in the house, but was to receive no salary for the first six months—before Sept. 30th I had given him notice to quit—that notice would expire on 12th Oct.—on 26th Sept. I went out of town—I marked about eighteen lozenge bottles with ink, at the point to which they reached—I returned on 29th, and found the lozenges considerably below the mark—I asked him if he could account for the sales—he said nothing—I had not been half an hour in the house before he said he must leave—I said, "You have taken me by surprise; I am weary, I will speak to you in the morning;" that would be Sunday—he went to bed—next morning, at breakfast, he said he must go to Lambeth work-house,</p>

               <p>"No, you shall not go home." I went to clean myself, and he went and got his clothes on, and slipped out at the side door - I have not seen him since, till he was in custody - my other apprentice has likewise run away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did Mr. Harmer come to you on Thursday, the 18th of February, after the officer had been in pursuit of the prisoner, and could not find him - A. Yes; Mr. Harmer said whenever I filed a bill of indictment against him he would come forward - this was when I went to Bow-street; before I had been there previous to that - I saw Mr. Harmer there a second time, and then he told me the same thing, and said he surrender him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you file your bill against him - A. Not till last Sessions, on account of the absence of a material witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your material witness here to-day - A. No - I had a premium of 40 l. with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a trial at Guildhall - A. Yes; he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, do you not know that he expended his money in paying the expences of the witnesses - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you did not know from Mr. Cartridge that he paid part of his expences - A. The witnesses were at England's eating-house - I paid when I was there, and I paid him what he told me he laid out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay him - A. I can tell by my book - the first day he was there was on the 5th of January, and I asked him if he had money enough to pay for his dinner - he said he had. On the Tuesday I paid 5 s. 10 d., and 11 d. on Wednesday - and Thursday he said he had laid out a half-a-crown - on the 10th I paid him 4 s. - I had sometimes five witnesses there - I paid the dinners when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Sir, on your solemn oath, when he told you he had taken the 1 l. 5 s., did he not tell you he had paid the expences with it - A. No - I knew nothing at all about his paying the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact did you not have the 1 l. 5 s. from his mother - A. No, never - I have never received it.</p>

             was shutting up the shop, he brought in a paper parcel which a man gave him to give me, and he opened the paper in part, and I saw it was the paper that had been in my window - and I said,</p>
               <p>"Put it away, seal it up, and put it in the box." When we went down to the Magistrate he would not go into the case, and Perry either took away or lost the key. I cannot open the box; it is here - I do not know what is in it; I cannot open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you, at the time Perry received it, and brought it into the shop, if he did not tell you that Wild's mother had sent the money - A. No; I have not to the present moment the least notion of what is in the box.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Perry put the paper into the box - A. Yes; but I do not know what was in it - I cannot open it - Perry took the key, and I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. When did the prisoner tell you he had taken the property - A. On the 10th of January; and the paper was sent on the Monday - he had stated that he had given part to his father and part to his mother, and disposed of the rest himself - I did not, upon my solemn oath, give him leave to take my money to pay the witnesses - when I attended at Bow-street to make a complaint, Mr. Harmer undertook to produce him, but he did not bring him till to-day, to my knowledge - he never went before a Magistrate; and finding I could not get Perry, I put it off to this Sessions, in hopes to find him, which I have taken pains to do, but have not succeeded - he ran away on the 1st of April - I did not go to the prisoner's mother and say he should not come back into my service; I do not recollect any thing more than saying I would not have him on the trial any more - I sent a person to his mother, and to call on Mr. Farebrother to say he should not come again on the trial; but I never directly, or indirectly, sent to any of his relations to say I would not take him back into my service.</p>

            . I attended on the trial of Messrs. Hulme and Cross - there were seven witnesses on that trial; I attended ten days. We dined at England's eating-house; Wild paid the expences; he had to pay 8 d. or 1 s. a piece, according to what they had. He paid about five or six days when I was there, and on the other six days I paid for myself, except one day Mr. Hulme was there, and paid for my dinner.</p>

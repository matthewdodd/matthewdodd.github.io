                  </hi>. On the morning of 21st September I saw the prisoner and another man lying on their backs in the middle of the road in Wapping—the prisoner had his arms round the other man's neck, who was apparently asleep—I said, "It is very dangerous for you to lie here; get up and go away"—the prisoner looked up and said, "Who the b—y hell are you? "—I told him he might see who I was—he drew this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from this sheath at his side, and said, "I will put this knife into your b—y guts," flourishing it about—he followed me, and I caught hold of him to defend myself—he then caught hold of me, and we struggled and fell—while we were down he said, "I will rip you up," and made a stab which went through my great coat and trousers into my thigh—I called out, "You have stabbed me;" he said nothing—we struggled for a minute, when John Irons came up and took away the knife—the prisoner was the worse for liquor, but was not drunk—he repeatedly said, "I will rip you up"—my thigh bled a great deal—I was taken to a surgeon's, and was laid up for three weeks before I could do anything—I am not fit for all kinds of duty now—the prisoner is a sailor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the London Docks. About a quarter to 1 on the morning of 21st September I saw the prisoner and some other men go to Shadwell-bridge and make some disturbance; they were sent away by some policemen—a little afterwards I saw the prisoner and Fry on the ground near Wapping-wall—Fry called out, "He has stabbed me"—the prisoner was holding this knife, and swearing that he would rip Fry's b—y guts out—I got on him, and got it from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of High-street, Shadwell—I attended Fry, and found an incised wound on the front part of his thigh, in a slanting direction, commencing on the outside and extending towards the inside; the first part was only under the skin for half an inch and then it went to the great depth of two inches; it went deeper inwards—it was a dangerous wound; he lost much blood, and I told him that he must leave off duty—for three weeks he did no duty at all—it came near the femoral artery, and if that had been wounded it might have been fatal, if no one had rendered him assistance—this knife might have done it; it is smothered with blood—a great deal of force must have been used to cut through his coat and trousers and then make such a wound—he is a healthy man or he would not have gone on so well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here reads as follows:</hi>—"I must have been very drunk and stupified at the time.

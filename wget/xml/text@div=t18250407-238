            . I am a constable, and employed a person of the name of Rose. I met him on the 21st of February, at the Bell, in Falcon-court; I gave him six good shillings which had been in circulation; I searched him before I gave them to him - he had no other money about him; he returned to me on the same evening while Myers with me; he then gave me fifteen counterfeit shillings, which I marked and put in a paper - he has kept it ever since.</p>

            . On the 21st of February I saw Goff and Myers. I received from Goff 6 s. in shillings, and went from them about five o'clock. I went with Elizabeth Williams to Petticoat lane; I left her at the top while I went down to the King of Prussia public-house; I had seen the prisoner before (on the 19th,) and he told me I might find him there; I found him with a pot of porter in his hand; he took it into the tap-room and came out with me - we walked up the lane, and as we were going along I asked him what he sold the bobs a score; he said 5 s.: we came to the top of the lane and Williams was there: he asked what we would take; we said a score each: he then said the price would be 6 s.: we then walked down a lane and he left us and returned to us and gave us a little paper parcel which contained only fifteen. I was counting them and he said I need not count them, they were all right: I then put them into my pocket and Williams took a paper of them likewise. I went to the Bell, in Falcon-court, and found Myers and Goff there: I gave the parcel to Goff, and the pieces were marked in my presence.</p>

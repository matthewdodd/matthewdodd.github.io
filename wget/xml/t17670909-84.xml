            . I am wife to the prosecutor; the prisoner came into our shop, and asked for a pair of all silver buttons, on the 1st of September, between five and six in the afternoon; I reached him out three pair; he took no notice of any of them, but reached and put his hand into a great heap of them, and took some out with three fingers, and put them under his coat, and from thence took an opportunity to put them into his right-hand pocket; I asked him, if none of them that I had shewed him would do; he said he wanted an oval pair; I said there were no oval solid silver ones; he said I might take which pair I would, and weigh them; then he reached his hand into the drawer again while I was weighing them, and took some out in all his four fingers, and put them into his right hand, as before, till he had an opportunity of putting them into his pocket; said he, what do these buttons come to; said I, half a crown; he said 2 s. I said 2 s. 6 d. if I sell them; he bid me 2 s. 2 d. and walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090073"></xptr> out of the shop; I had no body but myself in the shop; I ran out at the door, and brought him back again, and held him with his breast against the counter, and said, you rogue, you have robbed me, turn your pockets; there came in a neighbour from across the way; he called our servants out of the work shop; in the mean time the prisoner discharged all the buttons out of his right-hand pocket as I held him; there was one button found upon searching him, in his pocket, and a cluster ring, and 1 s. 8 1/2 d. in money upon him; that ring was not our property; the other buttons and studs were found by the side of the counter, where I held him upon the ground.</p>

               <p>E. Salmon. Two pair of buttons, four studs, and one stone button, and I think two loose silver buttons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lead-merchant. On the 1st of October I was at the Angel inn, Lewisham, with my horse and cart—the horse-cloth was in the cart—I staid at the inn about ten minutes—I saw the prisoner near the side of the horse—when I came out the horse-cloth was gone—I took very little notice about it, thinking it might have been taken into the house, and drove on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lewisham. I saw the prisoner standing by the side of the cart while the prosecutor was inside the house—he had hold of the reins—MR. Deacon, the landlord, said, "What do you do standing aside of the horses' head?—leave go of those reins"—the prisoner laughed, called him a bad name, and turned away—I went into the parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner lurking about the horse and cart, leaning over the pales looking into the yard—I knew him to be a stranger, and had suspicion, and in a quarter of an hour I saw him coming up the hill, about two hundred yards from the house, with something under his arm—I concealed myself underneath the palings, and then asked what he had got—he said he did not know whether it was a horse-cloth or a great-coat—I told him if I had got it in my possession I should know what it was—he then opened it, and said it was a horse-cloth—I asked him how he came by it—he said he had picked it up—I took it back to the Angel, found it had been lost, and took him to the station-house.</p>

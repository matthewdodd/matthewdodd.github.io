             . I was standing by Ludgate Prison Door, where I keep a Stall; I saw a Stop in the Postern, and saw the Prosecutor take a Handkerchief out of the Prisoner's Hand. I went for a Constable , but he made his Escape; and Mr Ogilby, one of my Lord Mayor's Officers, caught him again; and I went with him before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the Gentleman turned round, there were two more Men by him, and the Handkerchief was hanging out of his Pocket. I had not the Handkerchief in my Hand at all; he knows between God and his Conscience, I did not do it; he said to another Man, You have picked my Pocket .</p>
               <p>Southerton . He was not a Quarter of a Yard off me: I took it in his Hand before he got from me. <rs id="t17421208-21-verdict119" type="verdictDescription">

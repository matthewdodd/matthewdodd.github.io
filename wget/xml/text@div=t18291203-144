I had a brandy piece out at my door, which contained 141 gallons; there was about eight gallons of brandy-wash in it, which is of use in the trade - I saw the piece at my door on the morning of the 15th of October, and in the evening it was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the prisoner taken up? A. Yes, and brought to my house; but I was not at home, and he was let go - he came afterwards to get a glass of brandy or rum and water; he had a new jacket and smock-frock on - a witness came in and said, "This is the man who took the cask;" and I had him taken directly - I went to his lodgings, where his children were, with a search-warrant; I believe there was a fustian jacket mentioned to the children - he had not desired me to go for a jacket, but when I saw his new jacket I asked where his jacket was; I believe the children said they had not seen his jacket for some time, and they did not know what he had done with it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He came to your house, was not that a fortnight afterwards? A. Yes; I went up to him and said, "How dare you take that cask from my door? and what did you do with the brandy-wash in it?" "Me!" said he, and turned as pale as death - a witness came in and said, "That is the man I saw rolling the cask along, and no doubt he thought it was brandy:" we made search for a jacket and a frock - no one else has been taken up on suspicion.</p>

            . I am a pork-butcher, and live in Lumber-court. I remember a cask being at Mr. Spicer's door on the 15th of October - I saw the prisoner take it; I am certain of his person - he had a short smock-frock on and a jacket under it, which looked like a fustian jacket; he turned it about as if he had bought it, or was going to buy it - this was about four o'clock in the afternoon; he did not take it from the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see him take it from the door? A. No; I do not know whether people are in the habit of looking at casks, when they are put out.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BURTON. I am a fishmonger, and live in Lumber-court. I saw the prisoner roll the cask down the court, about ten minutes or a quarter after four o'clock - he rolled it by the dead wall; I did not see it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was he dressed? A. He had a short smock-frock on, and a dark waistcoat - I saw no jacket; I did not hear Mrs. Spicer say he was not the man - I was before the Magistrate when serjeant Riley brought the prisoner there; he was discharged because there was another fishmonger who said he did not think he was the man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At the time he was brought there was Mrs. Spicer at home? A. Yes; Mr. Spicer was not- Mrs. Spicer said she knew nothing about it.</p>

               <p>WALTER POWEL. I saw the prisoner, on the 15th, take the cask from the door, roll it down the passage, and down St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. No - I had not seen him for a long time before, but swear he is the man.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the children that their father had sent you for the fustian jacket? A. I asked where their father's jacket was, and said perhaps he would want it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, declaring his innocence.</p>
               <p>MRS. SPICER. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner was brought to our house by Riley, about a fortnight before he was taken; I did not say the prisoner was not the person who took the brandy cask, for I did not see it - he was let go.</p>

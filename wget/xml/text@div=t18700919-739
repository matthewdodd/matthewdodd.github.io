I am a compositor, and reside at Bridgewater—I am at present staying at the Cathedral Hotel, Six Paul's Churchyard—about 1.30 in the morning of 16th August, I met the prisoner in St. Paul's Churchyard—I had my pocket-book containing some letters, and a purse containing 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. in silver—the prisoner pressed her company upon me, and wanted to enter into conversation—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. to get rid of her—I was with her five Or six minutes—she saw me put my purse in my pocket, but I don't know how she abstracted it—when she left me, a police-officer came up and asked if I had lost anything—I said "No"—he said "The woman that has left you is a bad character, and I advise you to search your pockets"—I felt for my purse, and found it was gone—we ran towards the woman, and I took my pocket-book out of her hand—the policeman seized her hands, and did not let them go until she reached the police-station—at the station she took the purse from her bosom and gave it up—this is my pocket book and purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was not the same amount in the purse as there had been previously.</p>

On the morning of 16th August, I saw the last witness and the prisoner in Old 'Change—the prosecutor was sober—I saw the prisoner come from a doorway—I stopped her, and asked the prosecutor whether he had lost anything—he said "No"—I asked him to examine his pockets; he did so, and said "I have lost my purse"—I caught hold of the prisoner's hands, and conveyed her to the station, where she produced the purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lee-bridge, and am bailiff to Mr. Charles Burrell, a farmer—Chittock was in his service. On the 16th of April, I directed him to take a wagon to London—he told me the evening before that the horses had been in the stable, and had eaten up all the hay in the course of the day—I ordered him to take some chaff and com with him to London in the nose-bags, instead of bay—he started at eleven o'clock at night—I have seen some hay since—I believe it to be Mr. Bur<lb></lb>rell's—it corresponds with his hay—Chittock had no business with it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 276.) I was on duty at half-past five o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of April—I saw the wagon loaded with hay coming down Hackney-road, and apparently a truss of hay on the fore ladder—Chittock drew the wagon over to a court called Baxter's Court—it stopped opposite a cow-keeper's yard, where Cashford lives ser<lb></lb>vant—I watched the hay for half an hour, and then saw it taken from the ladder, and carried in the direction of the stable—the prisoners were then both together, and which of them took the hay I am unable to tell—I went round to the fore part of the wagon, and asked Chittock what had become of the truss of hay that was lying on the ladder—he said, "I had no truss"—I said, "You had a truss, and it will be no hard job for me to find it; you both come with me to the stable"—I took them both</p>

               <p>to the stable and found it—Chittock begged me to let him have it, and he would take it home to his master—I took it to the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I took up the prisoner on the 22d of January, in Piccadilly; I told him it was for an affair of Mr. Palmer's that I wanted him; I took a watch from him, and these seals were attached to it; he said, "Will you take my word till next morning? if you will let me go, I'll tip you a crown;" I got the key of his box, and found a hand vice, which was identified by Captain Jones.</p>

On the 17th of January I discharged the prisoner; something was then found in his box, but I did not think it sufficient to proceed against him; in consequence of something I heard afterwards, I employed Buckeridge to apprehend him; a key was found upon him, which opened the cupboard where I kept the key of my cellar; I do not know that I ever left the cupboard open in my life; this vice is mine, and I have had it a number of years; I inquired for it repeatedly after I lost it; it was kept in my study.</p>

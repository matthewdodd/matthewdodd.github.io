             came into the room, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you undress yourself, or get into bed? - A. No; when he first came in, I was sitting; I got up, having some suspicion of him, and he knocked me down; when I got up, he was gone; I missed my watch; I then ran down stairs to call the watchman; I did not miss any thing else at that time, it was a silver watch; the watchman came up, and took the woman to the watch-house; the watchman went in search of the man, and brought him to the watch-house within an hour afterwards, I knew him to be the man; his hat was drawn over his face more than people generally have; I am sure the prisoner is the same man, I have no doubt of it; I did not miss the other things till they were produced before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you your watch while you was in the room? - A. Yes, sometimes in my hand, sometimes in my fob, and sometimes in my waistcoat pocket, and I observed it once in the woman's hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200043"></xptr>Q. You gave it her to look at? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you sober enough to know whether she gave it you back again, or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the other things? - A. In my breeches pocket; they were produced the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You admit very fairly that you was drunk? - A.Very.</p>
               <p>Q. So drunk, that you hardly recollected what you were about? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.The woman and you had been sometime together before you saw the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there a bed in the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You put the watch into the girl's hand to look at? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How long do you think you might have been amusing yourself with the woman before the man came in? - A.Four hours, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give her any money? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not give her the watch, I dare say? - A.Hardly.</p>
               <p>Q.But you don't know what you did give her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you drink with her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you drink? - A.Rum.</p>
               <p>Q.How many glasses do you think you and your inamorata drank together? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Five or six? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you drank any rum before you came there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How much? - A. It is impossible for a man to say what he drinks.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to swear to the person of the man, drunk as you were? - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen your watch since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The man's hat was pulled over his face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That gave you a better opportunity of observing him? - A.He had a down look, and I looked the more at him for that, because I had a suspicion of him.</p>

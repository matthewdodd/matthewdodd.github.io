               <p>Q. When had you last seen these mantles. - A. About a quarter of an hour before I missed them they were laying on the counter. On the 23d of December the prisoner, in company with another woman, came into the shop and enquired the price of a mantle hanging at the door. The other woman fixed upon having a coat, and paid me a shilling in part; she was to call on Saturday, and pay me the remainder; and while the woman was giving me the shilling, the prisoner went out. On the other woman going away, I returned to the counter, and examined the things. I missed a child's mantle; I immediately went after the prisoner, and overtook her. I charged her with taking the mantle; she put a mantle in my hand, and was going to run away; I followed her into Bedford-court. We had not walked above five minutes before another mantle dropped; it was taken up, and given to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the mantle drop. - A. No. I gave her in charge of Creswell, the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not the prisoner tell you that the other woman had given her the bundle, and she was gone into the garden to buy things. - A. There was something of that sort. I did not go and look for the other woman. These are the mantles, they are my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was a servant. I went down into the country for three months to see my friends. On this day I met Mrs. Robinson; she gave me a glass of peppermint; she said she wanted to buy something for her children; she took me into this shop with her, I saw her bargaining for something, I took no notice, and went out; she came to me, and gave me the bundle, and told me to go on, she was going into the market to buy potatoes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

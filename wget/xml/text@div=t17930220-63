               <p>I live in Drury-lane, I am a pawnbroker, I have got a pair of half boots, they were brought some time in November, but the prisoner came to sell them out on the 31st of December, and they would not suit the person, and he had a fresh duplicate on them, what time in November, I really don't know.</p>
               <p>Court to Baldwin. Did you find the original duplicate on the prisoner for these half boots? - Yes, the constable has it. (The boots produced and deposed to, not one pair in five hundred being cut out like them.)</p>
               <p>Baldwin. The prisoner was making them when I left him on the 13th of November.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Kendall. Have not you swore wrongfully in saying that is Mr. Baldwin's property? - I saw you at work on them, I took them up while they were on his seat, and I looked at them, and I know the man they was made for, I know them they are so small; I have no doubt about it but they are my master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These half boots I manufactured them up myself, for a man that bespoke a pair of them; and the man came and told me that he had not money to pay me for them, and I being a poor man was obliged to pawn them; this Mr. Baldwin is not a shoe-maker he never served a legal time to the business, and I think he is no judge; there was a poor man did attend here three days last week to speak for me, and he could not afford to spend his time any longer.</p>

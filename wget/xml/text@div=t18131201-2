The lower room we call the parlour; it opens into the passage, and the street door is generally upon the latch; we have lodgers in the house, in the two pair. On the 23rd of November, my father went out in the morning to work, and my mother went out just before one; my mother says, she double locked the door. The lodger was out at work. I went out about four o'clock in the afternoon; I did not try the parlour door, it was shut; I opened the latch of the street door, and shut it again. I returned near seven, it was quite dark then; I had no light with me; the street door was open. I went up stairs, and when I was up stairs I heard a noise; I thought it was my mother come home from work. I came down for a light; I observed the parlour door open, and no light in the room; I went over the way to get a light; I was not a minute hardly in getting a light; I returned with a light; I went to go in the parlour, the woman pushed the door, and would not not let me go in; when I found the woman in the room I held the door that she should not come out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the woman, did you - A. I did not; I only heard her voice. I called for assistance. I went out at the street door, and several people came to my assistance; I begged them to hold the street door while I went to my mother. I fetched my mother, and when I returned with my mother, the prisoner was in the passage. My mother went for an officer; two officers came. She said, pray let me out, she wanted to go home, she had a long way to go, as far as Chick-lane, Smithfield; she said, she had come for a peck of coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your mother sell coals - A. No, sir, nothing at all. And she said, she wanted a person of the name of Phillips, a bead-blower.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room where she was - A. I did, before she was taken away from the house. I observed the parlour-door lock had been forced off with an iron crow; I saw the iron crow; it laid between the sacking and the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your mother such an instrument as that - A. No, sir. The prisoner was secured; she had moved a caravan box that stood upon a deal box; she had moved it off the deal box and put it on the bed. The caravan box contained linen, and wearing apparel. The officer took her in custody.</p>

            . I am the mother of the last witness. I go out to work; I left the house at near one o'clock, and before I went out to work I double locked the door, and pushed the door with my knees; the door was made fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what time it was your daughter fetched you - A. About ten minutes after seven. I was at work when she fetched me, and when I returned I saw a crowd at my door; I went into the house, and saw the prisoner there; the prisoner was in the passage. I found the parlour door had been broken open; the lock had been forced off the door; it was on the ground, and there was an iron crow between the bed and the sacking.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any such instrument as that in your house - A. No. My caravan box was turned topsy-turvy upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing - A. She said, she came from Smithfield for a peck of coals; she enquired for a Mr. Phillips, a bead-blower, at No. 3; my house is No. 9. There is no such name of that trade in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23rd of November, I was sent for; I went to the house immediately, and another officer got to the house about seven o'clock. I saw the prisoner in the passage, near the door; the door was then open. I took her into the parlour to search her; I found nothing particular on her, only some halfpence, and the key of her own door. I saw the lock of the parlour laying on the floor, it had been forced off. On searching the bed, this iron crow was found;

               <p>Wood. I have no doubt, in my own mind that the door was forced with that instrument. I asked the prisoner if that instrument was hers; she denied it, and said she was going for some coals. She said she lived in West-street, Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is West-street from Martha's-buildings - A. At least half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she anything with her with which she could bring the coals - A. Yes, there was a bag. I told her it was a long way to come for coals; she then said she wanted a Mr. Phillips, a bead-blower; she was informed he lived at No. 3, in that place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband is abroad. I have four children. I had been out at work; I came home; my daughter said there were no coals; I went out to get some; as I went down stairs a woman asked me if I knew Mr. Phillips, a bead-blower; I said yes, but I did not know where he lived; she said in Old-street-road, and she would shew me. I went with her to this court in Old-street; she told me it was No. 3. I counted the doors; I went in at the third door from the road; I saw the young woman; I thought it might be Mr. Phillips's daughter going up stairs. I knocked at the door; the young woman came down stairs; she said, there is somebody there. I went up stairs; they fastened me in. I came down stairs again. I never went in my room whatever there. They laughed; I thought they were joking: she said I should stay in until she fetched somebody for me. If I had been a thief I could have run away, and not have staid in that manner. It is far from my disposition to go a thieving. I depend upon my honest labour for my support. I was never in the parlour until the officer put me in.</p>

I am a clerk, and live at 25, Milton-crescent, Euston-square—at half-past 1, on the morning of 29th July, I was going home along Tottenham-court-road—O'Brien came up to me and made some remark—I told her to get away, as I wanted to get home, or something to that effect—she came up again, and tried to force a conversation on me, and tried to stop me—I pushed her away then, and told her I did not want to have anything to say to her—she then called out something, I cannot say what, and the male prisoner came up—the female was on my right, and had put her left arm round my waist—Cotter directly struck at me with his fist, and knocked my hat off—O'Brien pushed or struck me in the breast, I am</p>

On the morning of, 29th July, I was on duty in Tottenham-court-road, and heard a cry of "Police"—I im<lb></lb>mediately went down to the corner of Tottenham-place, and when about twelve or sixteen yards from there I saw the two prisoners holding the pro<lb></lb>secutor—the female was on his right, with one hand across, and in the direction of his watch; the other was apparently behind him—Cotter was on his left—when I got to the corner O'Brien had struck the prosecutor, and he staggered up against the shutters—Cotter struck him on the head, and his hat fell off—the moment they saw me they both ran away together—I followed them into Fitzroy-market, and apprehended O'Brien in Old-brook-walk there—I brought her back to the prosecutor, and he directly said, "That is the woman"—I gave information to policeman, E 132, of Cotter, and took the woman to the station.</p>

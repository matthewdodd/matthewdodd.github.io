                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD JAMES</hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Victoria-road, Pim<lb></lb>lico; it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. I have known the prisoner five or six years; he was in my employ about three years ago—he has since then visited at my house—I knew him to be in difficulties, and have lent him money, and he borrowed money for his mother—I recollect his calling at my house on Thursday, 16th Aug., I was then counting my money in my back parlour—he came into the parlour to me, and asked what I was going to do with that gold—there were 363 sovereigns, and I had 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my cash-box—I told him that would be sufficient to buy 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Consols, which I was going to do, as I did not want it in the business—he asked me to take a glass of ale with him—I put the money into the cash-box, which I locked up in the cupboard in my parlour—I put the key of the cupboard into my pocket, and went to the public-house—I looked at a newspaper to see what Consols were—he said they were very high, and he would not advise me to buy in, as they would be lower—I parted with him then, and returned to my own house—I took the cash-box out of the parlour cupboard, and went up to my bedroom with it—I had a small bag, which just contained 200 sovereigns—I counted 200 sovereigns, and put them into that bag, in a corner—I then put the other money, 160 sovereigns, on shelves in the corner of the cupboard, in piles of twenty sovereigns each—I saw the prisoner again on 17th Aug., about ten o'clock in the morning—he came, and said he would finish the kitchen (he had given it one coat of paint, and whitewashed the ceiling, about six weeks before, and I had applied to him to finish it—he had promised to do it, but did not); he walked through the shop into the hall—it was a voluntary act of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290007"></xptr>
               <p>his to do it—when he had been there a little time, I went down to see bow the work was going on, and he was not there—I went to the water-closet, and he was not there—I went into the shop, and asked my young men what had become of Somers—they said they did not know—in about ten minutes he returned through the shop again—this was about half-past ten o'clock—he came again about six, or half-past six—he passed through the shop, and said, I will go and finish the kitchen"—he did not return through the shop—I had been all the afternoon busy in the shop, I was not away from it—when the money was in my cash-box, I was in the habit of taking it up-stairs at night and locking it up, bringing it down in the morning, and putting it into the cupboard in my back parlour; but when I had taken these sovereigns out, I left the cash-box down stairs, except on Saturday night—on 20th Aug. a traveller called for an account—I went up to my cash-box, and found two loose sovereigns on it—I put them into the cash-box, and brought it down—I had had 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it before—I did not know where these two sovereigns came from—I meant to count the money, but did not—on the following Saturday I took up my cash-box, and on Monday, the 27th, I missed my cash, 163 sovereigns—I saw the prisoner in the afternoon of that day—I told him I had had a <hi rend="italic">slice of luck</hi> that day, that I had lost 163 sovereigns—he asked me to come out, and we went to a public-house together—I there told him what I had lost, and he asked me how it was—I said that only he and my two shopmen knew that I had the money—he said, "Well, I should advise you to say nothing about it; it may go forth to your tradespeople's ears, and they will be afraid to send you in goods; and you cannot swear to the money if you were to find it anywhere, as it is all gold"—I told him I was quite independent of any tradesmen—he then said perhaps my lodger might think I suspected her, and she would leave, and that would soon amount to more than that sum out of my pocket—he then asked to go and look at the lock on the cupboard—we went up-stairs, and he pointed out to me some marks, where he thought the lock had been forced back—I was not aware that he had any money in his possession at that time—I continued to go about with him—I met him on 31st Aug.—we went into a public-house, and called for a pint of ale, and he pulled out of his pocket two sovereigns—he cast his eye on me to see whether I saw it, and when he saw I did, he said, "I have just received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some meat, of Miss Webb, at Davis's coffee-shop"—on 6th Sept. the prisoner called on me, about ten or eleven o'clock, and I asked him for a sovereign that he had promised to give me on the previous Monday—he said, "I cannot give you a sovereign, I will give you half a sovereign in half an hour"—he returned in half an hour, and tendered me a half-sovereign—on receiving it, I identified it as part of the money I had lost—when 1 was counting the money I saw that it was very dull, and I bit it with my teeth, and broke my tooth in biting it—I bit in more than one place, and I particu<lb></lb>larly remarked the marks I made on it—the half-sovereign the prisoner gave me was the identical half-sovereign that I had marked; I have no doubt in my mind on the subject—I did not make any remark to the prisoner, but I gave the half-sovereign to the policeman the next day—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I marked it exactly opposite the letter D, and I observed there was some dirt on the next letter—I have no doubt that this is my half-sovereign—I bit this piece out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witnesses for the Defence</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE COWDEROY</hi>. I live in Gillingham-street, Pimlico, with my father, who is a grocer and cheesemonger. I know both the prisoner and the prosecutor, but I know the prisoner better than I do the prosecutor—I have been in the habit of meeting the prisoner—on 17th Aug. I was at home all the morning—I left home soon after two o'clock in the afternoon, for an appointment I had to take a walk with the prisoner—we went to Battersea; the prosecutor went with us—I remember it was on 17th Aug., because I had been very poorly some time, and it was the first day I had been out—it was on a Friday—I went to the prosecutor's about three o'clock—the prosecutor was at home, dressing—I went into the shop and waited till he came down—the prisoner was directed by the young man in the shop to go to the prosecutor—the prisoner and the prosecutor came down together—in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour we left there, went to the water-side, and took the boat at Pimlico Pier, to go to Battersea—we got to Battersea at a quarter or half-past four—we went to a skittle-ground; the prisoner and the prosecutor played, I think for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a game—I did not play—they played three or four games—we did not leave Battersea till past seven—we all left together, and returned home by the boat from Battersea to Pimlico Pier—we all three got out about a quarter or twenty minutes past seven—I parted with the prisoner and the prosecutor at the corner of Gillingham-street—I saw the prosecutor at his door the next morning as I was passing the shop; he told me he took the prisoner home to have tea with him—he told me he had picked up a woman the night before, he did not say the exact spot, but he said he went home with her, and stopped there all night—I do not remember that I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together after that.</p>

I went out of town—I returned on Thursday, 6th Sept., by the late train—during the time I was away the prisoner managed the business—the receipts during the day were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., early in the week about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day, and on Saturday more—when I left the prisoner, it was his duty to receive such sums—I arrived by the late train on 6th Sept—he had not accounted to me for any money—he appointed to look over the books on the next morning, but Mr. James came and took him out—that prevented his reckoning on the Friday afternoon, and on the Saturday he was taken into custody—he is twenty-five years old—he has always been a good son and an honest young man—he never gave me a moment's trouble in my life—my husband is in very bad health.</p>

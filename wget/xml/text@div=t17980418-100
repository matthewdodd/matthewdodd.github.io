               <p>Q.Had you been drinking in the course of that night? - A. Yes, I had; as we were going away, Wilson missed my chain, and said, where is your watch; I put my hand down, and missed it; stenson was gone then; I really thought he had taken it to carry it home; the landlord and I went after him, and about noon we found him at a public-house, but I cannot recollect what house it was, not what street it was in, it was about an hundred yards from where I lost it; I have never seen the watch since.</p>

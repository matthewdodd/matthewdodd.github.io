                  </hi> I am a shoemaker, and live with my cousin, Ste<lb></lb>phen Pudney, in Lower King-street, Old Kent-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington—he is a shoemaker. I went out on Saturday, the 18th of January—he went out first—I and his wife went out about half-past nine o'clock—the premises were made quite secure—the door was locked, and the window fastened—we returned about half-past ten o'clock, all three together—found the door fastened, but the shutters open, and the window also—a man could get in at the window—I occupy the parlour of the house, and on going in I found my box broken open, and a coat, trowsers, and waist-coat gone—I had not unlocked the box for two or three days before—they were safe then—it was broken open with a hammer.</p>

The prisoner pawned these articles at my shop on Saturday, the 18th of January, about a quarter before ten o'clock—I am sure he is the man—he pawned the trowsers and waistcoat for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the coat for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he brought them for J. Brown—I asked him his name—he said, "Henry Birkin"—he said Brown lodged in the same house as himself—I did not know him before—I am quite positive he is the man—I have had the property ever since, and produce them—he was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop in Walworth. On Saturday, the 18th of January, I was out with my beer, and saw the prisoner about twenty or thirty yards from the prosecutor's house, standing at the corner of the street, looking towards the prosecutor's house—on my going up he stood there, and did not move—he was about forty yards from the house—when I came up, he walked round the corner towards the house—I could not see how far he went—I knew him before—he lived three or four doors from the prosecutor's, at least his brother-in-law did—I believe he did not live there at the time of the robbery.</p>

I was to have 9s. a week; I paid for my lodging, and 4d. for a shirt - the first week I worked one day, and he gave me 1s. 6d.; the second week he gave me a half-crown, I gave 1s. 6d. for a second hand shirt, to carry me through Sunday; on the Monday, I asked his wife to give me some money - she said, "Go to your drunken master, and let him give you some;" on the Saturday following, I went to reckon with him, and he left me 3s. in debt - I could never get it, and kept this money.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 27th of January, at a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was shutting up my shop, and let the prisoner in at the door - he went up to the front-garret to go up to a lodger of mine, named Couchman: he asked me to let him go up to Couchman on business - he went up, and I immediately fastened my street-door, bolted and chained it; I was the last person up, and the first who came down in the morning, which was at a quarter before seven o'clock - I found the streetdoor unbolted and unchained, but it was then shut - the passage-door leading from the staircase, into the shop was broken open: I had locked it, and had the key in my own room; I have a wife, but no child - I have another lodger, named Walker - they were gone to bed before me, and had not come down in the morning: I missed 3l. 10s. in silver and copper from the till in my shop, also 3lbs. of cheese, and 1 lb. of sugar; I am sure the prisoner is the person I let in at night: I thought he was going to remain there all night with Couchman; I had known him for a few weeks - I had only lived there myself a few weeks; I have not found my property.</p>

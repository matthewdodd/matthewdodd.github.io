The prisoner was in my service at Tottenham—he came on the Thursday before Christmas-day—on the 4th of February the policeman came to my shop in company with Mr. Brook, and the prisoner was taken on Mr. Brook's charge—they afterwards returned, and searched a box which the prisoner used, and in it was found this silk handkerchief and lace, which are mine—I have the pieces here from which they were cut—I have compared them, and find where they were joined on—they must have been taken after the Saturday, previous to the day on which he was taken—I had taken stock that day—the lace was then measured, and my stock was deficient by the quantity found in the prisoner's box—a pair of gentlemen's half-hose were found, which I believe to be mine—there were two handkerchiefs found, one I can swear to—I had not missed it—the prisoner had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and his board.</p>

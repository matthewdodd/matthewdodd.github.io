            . I am servant to the prosecutor - he called me out of the kitchen; I saw the prisoner searched - he said he took one bottle after the assistant went away but he put that back, and took this one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found the bottle rolled in paper, when I was cleaning the counter; there was no mark on it.</p>
               <p>MR. WATKINS. I am certain it had the mark on it, on paper - it might have rubbed off in his pocket.</p>

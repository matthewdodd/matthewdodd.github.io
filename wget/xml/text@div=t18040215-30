I was in the yard at the accompting-house door, and saw a man at my cart in the Inn yard taking wool out of the bag, and putting it in his breeches; I went and caught hold of him, and asked him to give me the wool back again; he said he would not; I called out to the book-keeper to help take it away from him; the book-keeper came, and we took it out of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity? - A. A pound and three quarters; I have it here; we took him to Giltspur-street Compter.</p>

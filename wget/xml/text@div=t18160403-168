               <p>ELIZABETH GAEE. On the 20th of February, I had occasion to go up stairs in the dusk of the evening, and one of the room doors was open, and all the bed clothes were taken off, and the bed was in confusion. The prisoner had lived servant with me a twelve month previous. I ran down stairs, and she was found in the house, and dropped the things immediately. She was running out, when she was stopped by a servant. She had taken ever so many of my lodger's things besides.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM STEPHENS. I was a lodger in Mr. Gabb's house. I saw the prisoner at the bar on the stairs with a bundle, and as the landlady was coming up stairs, she dropped the bundle, and ran down stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a plumber's-shop, in John-street. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th of April, I heard the bell ring, I ran down, and found the prisoner inside my shop, and Mr. Shelton outside, preventing him getting over—I collared him—he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out something, and threw it away—it appeared to be two keys—a boy picked them up, and gave them to me—the prisoner then threw himself down and would not rise—I gave him in charge—these are my brushes—I found them at the entrance of my shop—they ought to have been at the back.</p>

I was at my door, and saw the prisoner nearly opposite the prosecutor's house—I watched, and saw him get over the gate—I passed the door, and saw no one—I came back, and saw him coming along the shop with a bundle under his arm, containing this jacket and these three brushes—as soon as he saw me he sat down—I prevented his coming out, and he was taken.</p>

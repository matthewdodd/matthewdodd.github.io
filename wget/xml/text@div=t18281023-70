            . I live in Houndsditch; I saw the basket in care of an old man, who sells cakes - the prisoner came up to me, and asked where the man was who belonged to it; I said I believed he was gone with some bread - he said it was his brother's; and while I was serving ginger-beer at my stall, he took the basket, and went down Liverpool-street with it on his back.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner two days after this at the Turk's Head public-house, Aldgate; the landlord gave me a green baize, which he said, in the prisoner's presence, he had given to him - the prisoner did not deny it; there is a little dough on it.</p>

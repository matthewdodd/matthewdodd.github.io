                  </hi>. I am Messrs. Baxendale and Co.'s cashier, at the Camden station. On 20th April I asked the prisoner how it was these two sums were not paid in—he said Mr. Wright's man had not got the money with him, but no doubt it would be paid next time; and he gave me to understand that he paid once a week—on the following Thursday I was in the office, and my attention was called to the sums not having been paid—I ordered a letter to be written to Mr. Wright about it—the prisoner left that day at his usual time, and did not come back—he had given no notice of his going.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were not the hands diminished? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—his week finished the day he left—our men do not always give us notice—Parry was present when the conversation took place, and remarked, "No, they are not paid"—I do not know where he is now—means have been taken to take him into custody on a charge of embezzling some other accounts—Parry was at the head of the department, and would receive money if Stout was absent—if Stout received money and paid it over to Parry, it would not be sufficient—it was Parry's duty to make out the carmen's delivery-books—I was present when Mr. Baxendale hired Stout, but his duty was different then—I cannot say when he was first told his duty was to receive money—I did not bear him instructed—Mr. Baxendale is in the country, and it would be exceedingly inconvenient for him to come here.</p>

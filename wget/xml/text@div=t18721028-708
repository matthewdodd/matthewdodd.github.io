                  </hi>. I am assistant house-surgeon at St. George's—the prosecutrix was brought there—I examined her head—on the upper part of the left side of the forehead there were two cuts about an inch long extending down to the bone; in one of the cuts the bone itself was fissured, or dented; a branch of the temporal artery was divided, which I had to secure—she also had a wound over the outer side of the left eye, which did not lead down to the bone—there was a great swelling over the eye, simply due to the blood which was underneath the skin—it was such a wound as a soldier's belt and buckle would produce, it was a serious wound, but she went on very well without a bad symptom.</p>

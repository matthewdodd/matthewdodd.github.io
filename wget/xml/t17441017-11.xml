I told him I would not give it him, unless he was a better man than I; he said if I did not he would blow my brains out. I took hold of the gun, and shook the gun in his hand in great hopes it would have gone off. After I had disputed a great while with him, he bid me go about my business, or he would blow my brains out. Then I watched him, in hopes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170016"></xptr> some body would come up, and I got a watchman afterwards and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a gun with him then?</p>
               <p>Norman. He had not a gun then, but I bid the watchmen look into the quarters as far as they supposed a person could throw a gun, and I believed they would find it; they looked for it there, and there they found it. - I am sure he is the man, for we were under a lamp, and he was hardly out of my sight till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I desire you would enquire into the character of the Prosecutor, for he bears a very good character in Newgate, he has been in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been confined in Newgate?</p>
               <p>Norman. I was, but it was only for a quarrel, in a publick house, for assaulting Mr. Hunt, a Beadle, in one of the hospitals; I was removed from the Poultry Counter there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask you what time a night it was that I stopped you?</p>
               <p>Norman. It was between ten and eleven.</p>

I went to the walk that goes from Old Bethlehem, and asked for our watchmen. I stood there a little while, and the Prisoner (as I think by his voice) called hollo! and I said, hollo! the Prisoner came running without hat or wig. I asked the Prosecutor, and the watchmen if they had seen any body, they said no. I said there was a little man run by, and run up Fore-street. I asked the Prosecutor how he was served, his name, and where he lived, and he told me. I said, you seem to be an honest sort of a man, I'll go out again and see for him; and as I was going from the watch-house, the Prisoner came back again from that place where he had passed me; said I, There's the man; I went to the corner of Little Moorfields, and called after him, and said, I want to speak a word with you ; said I, What business are you; he said, I am a shaggreen-case-maker, I live in Fell street , in Wood-street; said I, This is an odd time of night to be out . I said to Mr. Norman, is this the man, Mr. Norman said, That is the man; the Prisoner asked him what he charged him with, he said he would tell him when he came before a justice, but the Prisoner insisted upon knowing what he charged him with; he said, with assaulting him with an intent to rob him; I said, if Mr. Norman charged me with him, he must go to the Counter; Mr. Norman said, If you will let the watchman go, I believe they will find the gun pretty near the rails; they went out and found it pretty near the rails, and came with it to the watch-house, in about eight minutes and when it was brought in, I said, Now, Mr. Harris, what do you think of that; but I thought it odd that he should rob with such a long gun.</p>

After the Prisoner was brought to the watchouse I went to search for the gun, and found it standing up against one of the posts of the quarters in the middle walk in Moorfields, on the out side of the post - The farthest post of the right hand quarter, it was found little after two o'clock, this is the gun.</p>

               <p>Negus. I don't know, it is just as it was then, the barrel is stopped, there was no slint in it.</p>

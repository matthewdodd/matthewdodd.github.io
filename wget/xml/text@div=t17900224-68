I knew both their voices very well; he said, in the cellar; that passed on, and I could hear the blowing of the fire; some time after, I heard her say to her son, Ben, go get the pig ready, the water is hot; my husband at this time was in bed; on this, I went and waked him; I went to Justice Smith's office, and asked advice there directly; Justice Smith said he could not grant a search warrant, but he would grant a warrant for

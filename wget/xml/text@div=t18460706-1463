                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Cox and Co., army agents, Craig't-court; I live in Ebury-street, Pimlico. Last Monday night, about eleven o'clock, I was going home from a friend's house, where I had been dining—the prisoner came behind me near the Westminster hospital—she came past me and spoke to me—nobody was with her at the time—she asked me to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with her more than once—she kept on speaking to me—she accompanied me perhaps 200 or 300 yards—I said I was going home—I said nothing else to her—I observed that she felt my left-hand trowsers' pocket—I suspected that her intent was to rob me, and transferred a small bag, containing gold, to my coat pocket for security—she still kept by my side, and at last made a thrust at the same pocket—I was 200 or 300 yards from the hospital then, in the direction of Pimlico—at that instant two men suddenly came up, caught hold of the tail of my coat, and ripped it up behind with great force, from the skirt to the collar—I had not seen those men before—I do not know where they came from—the woman had said nothing before they appeared—she repeated the thrust at my trowsers' pocket after I had transferred the money to my coat-pocket—she seemed still trying my pocket—while the men were tearing my coat her hands were on my trowsers' pocket—they seemed confined to that—that seemed her object—she was in front of me—I called "Police!" loudly—two policemen came up immediately—the prisoner and the men instantly fin away, both in the same direction—I believe the prisoner was apprehended within three or four minutes—after the policemen came up I found my trowsers were unbuttoned one or two buttons—I saw this bunch of keys on the ground—the prisoner was standing by—they had been in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> coat-pocket—they are my property—I thought I had lost the bag and gold, but found it in my coat pocket where I had placed it—this penknife is mine—there were some coppers in my coat pocket—I was not aware that I had any there before they were found by the policeman—I very often carry copper in my coat pocket.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been with her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps ten minutes—I am sure it was not half a hour—I cannot swear whether it was a quarter—I am quite sore I have told the whole story—when I gave her into custody I thought I had lost my money—she was walking by my side to and fro—I went down two or three lanes—she still followed me—I went down the lane because she still kept on following me—I did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> down for her to follow me—it was in my way home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She never attempted to get at your coat pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was from that pocket that I lost the keys—I did not hear the keys fall out when they ripped my coat up—they were in a little bag—I imagine I put them in that—I presume they tumbled out of the bag—that might have been in the jerking up <hi rend="italic">of</hi> my coat—I thought they tore my coat up to get my property—I lost nothing but my keys—I did not feel anybody's hand in my pocket—it is very possible the prisoner might have seen me transfer something to my coat pocket, but she still fumbled in front <hi rend="italic">of</hi> me.</p>

The Prosecutor depos'd, That he having been abroad, when he came home he found a Closet in the Back-Shop broken open, and the Money taken away, which was found in the Prisoner's Lodging. That the Prisoner was a Relation to a Jew Family that lodg'd in his House, and had liv'd there before for about seven Months, but did not lodge there at the Time when the Fact was committed, but he had dined there the Day the Money was missing, therefore suspecting him they went to his Lodging, and ask'd him about it, but at first he deny'd that he knew any Thing of it; but being inform'd by another that the Prisoner had got Money, he went and fetch'd it where he had hid it between the Tiles, but there wanted three Pound of the Sum, and he pretended that going to the Prosecutor's House, he found the Door open, and seeing an Englishman there, he ask'd him, What he did there? whereupon he threw the Bag of Money down, and he took it up, and carried it Home.

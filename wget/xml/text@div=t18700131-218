                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mark Green—on the night of 2nd January I was going through Red Lion Passage, and four young women knocked me down, pulled my chignon off, and kicked me—McGrath and Hunt are two of them—when I came to myself my pocket was turned inside out, and three separate shillings were gone—I am almost sure it was Hunt who did that—I called, "Police!" "Stop thief!" "Murder!" and a policeman ran up and caught McGrath—I am certain the money was in my pocket when I was knocked down—I was quite sober—there was a light in the passage—I could see quite well.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 48). On 2nd January I was on duty in Red Lion Street, Holborn, and heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!"—I hastened to the spot, and saw four or five women scrambling together—about twenty yards from them I met the prosecutrix, who told me some-thing, and I took McGrath and Moody, and saw four other women running away—Hunt came outside the station door, and I took her, as the prosecu<lb></lb>trix identified her—the prosecutrix was quite sober, but was smothered with dirt; her hair was all round her face, and she had no bonnet—her bonnet was brought afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the day that your house was broke open on the night, was he there all the day? - A. No; he was at work in the day; he was at my house in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he leave your house that night? - A. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the last person in your house? - A. He was the last stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure the house? - A. Yes; I was the last person up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed? - A. I secured the house about a quarter of an hour after he left it, and then went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you find you had been robbed? - A. A little after seven in the morning, I was told by my servant, Ann Gibson, that my house was broke open; I was up when she told me; it was getting light; then I went and looked; I saw the door-post of the back door was cut through, leading into the private place at the back door of the house, leading to a privy, and the bolt broke; it is a dark place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does that dark place lead to that you have thus described? - A. It leads into a privy.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is the wash-house? - A. Adjoining the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Inside of that back door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any body get at the outside of that back door? - A. There was a wall about nine feet high they might go over; there was a brick out for a foot, near a yard and a half; and there was a paling eight feet high, and they might go over the paling, and then there is a water-buit and ladder inside, by which they got into this hole that leads into the privy, and so to the door of the wash-house; I observed in the wash-house the lid of the pickling-tub was taken off, and two legs and a loin were taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them there the day before? - A. I saw the pork the very evening before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that what did you do? - A. I sent for Creedland, the officer; I suspected the prisoner because he was the last man in the house, and had helped to put the pork there; and no man besides knew where it was but my own family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the officer? - A. No; I was very much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of your pork afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the pork again, did you know it to be your pork? - A. I will swear to one leg.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A. After we had found the pork, the officer and I went and searched, and found him, about 200 yards off, supplying a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him? - A. He wanted to know what was the matter; he said he had done nothing amiss.</p>

               <p>- CREEDLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer belonging to Queen-square? - A. Yes; I went to No. 11, in Gardner's-lane, York-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him there? - A. No, he lodged there, but he was not at home; the servant maid went, and shewed me where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was it? - A. Adjoining to Price's, the right-hand door; the door was locked; I put my hand against the door, and found it was very loose; I pushed the door, and went in, and looked round the room; I saw the bed folded up, and turned it down, and between the sacking and the bed I found the legs and the loin of pork; I then took the pork into my possession, and I have kept it ever since; as soon as I found the pork, I said to Mr. Till, shew me where the man is; I went after him, and as soon as I saw him, I took him; I said to him, my friend, what have you done with the pork; he trembled, and seemed much frightened; nor did he know that I had got it in my custody until I got him before the Magistrate, and there he denied it openly. - (The pork produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Till.) Look at that pork? - A. That is the leg, I'll swear to it; I cut that black mark out myself; there is a part of it in now, it was a bruise; I cannot swear to the other leg; I only know it was put in salt a week before the other; I believe the loin is mine.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gibson.) Look at the pork? - A. I know no more than I remarked that notch in the leg; my mistress said, take it out, and make a ham of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made that notch in it? - A. There was a notch in it when my mistress had it out, and hung it up for a ham.</p>

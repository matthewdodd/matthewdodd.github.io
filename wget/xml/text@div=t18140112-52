            . I keep a grocer's shop in Drury-lane. On the 10th of December the prisoner came to my shop; she asked for an ounce of tea and a pound of lump sugar; it came to 2 s. 8 d. she offered a pound note to pay for it. I looked at the note and asked her name; she said her name was Stevens or Stevenson; she resided No. 10, Charles-street, Long-Acre. I looked at the note again; I said I believed it was a bad one. She repeated over and over again, if you do not like it give it me back again; that gave me suspicion. I called to my niece to give me my hat to go along with her to Charles-street; she then said, I do not live there. We both went out of the shop together; she made a sudden stop, and said she did not live there herself. I offered to go there with her; she then said she was an unfortunate girl, a gentleman gave it her in a coach. We went back to my shop; I asked her where she did live; she said she did not live any where. I then sent for an officer. I marked the note.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WESTBROOK. I am one of the patrols of Bow-street office. On the 10th of November I took the prisoner in custody at Mr. Greenham's shop. I saw a 1 l. note lie on the counter. I searched the prisoner; I found nothing upon her, except a farthing in her pockets and a small key. She told me a gentleman gave her the note in a coach; she was an unfortunate girl; the gentleman picked her up in the Strand. She told me she lived no where, she was a country girl. I took her before the magistrate. I found that her mother lived at No. 4, Phoenix-alley, Covent-Garden.</p>

               <p>MR. DANIEL. I am a cheesemonger in Drury-lane. On the 2d of December the prisoner came into my shop; she asked me for half a pound of fresh butter and a quarter of a pound of salt butter, and half a pound of cheese. She offered me a one pound bank note. I looked at the note; I told her I did not like it. She said she knew where she took it, she would go back and change it; she desired me to put the things by, she would call for them presently; she never returned.</p>

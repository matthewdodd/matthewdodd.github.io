                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, F</hi> 11). On 26th Oct.

I never saw the boy before in my life"—I told him to look at him again, and see if he was perfectly satisfied he was the man—he again said he was, and Gardner made the same remark again—he could see Clinton, they stood opposite each other—I asked Gardner his name and address, he gave several evasive answers, and said he was a traveller, and lived anywhere, it was somewhere in the Kent-road, but he did not know the number—I searched him, and found 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and this key on him; it opens the outer<lb></lb>door of 25, Temple-street, Southwark—Charoneau gave her address, 25, Garden-row, London-road—I went away, leaving West with them—between seven and eight that morning, I went to 82, Pearl-row, Borough, and found the Buncher's—I had seen them before; her brother, Daniel Evans, was there, and a police-sergeant—I told Buncher to consider himself in my custody for stealing a quantity of rings, brooches, and other articles from the Strand—he said he knew nothing about it—I saw the woman feeling her pocket, and asked her to turn it out—she gave me a piece of paper and a duplicate, and was crumbling this other piece of paper; I said, "Let me see what you have got there?"—she attempted to put it in her mouth; I prevented her, and took it from her, there was writing on it in pencil—she said, "It is only a letter about a loan, I did not want him to know anything about it"—(<hi rend="italic">This was half of a letter torn down the middle of the sheet, half of each line only being left; it appeared to be from the Soho Loan Office, and was addressed to Mr. Daniel Evans, on the other side was a list of the following articles, in pencil, partially rubbed out: "I watch, 1 bracelet, 1 brooch, 1 bottle, 1 locket, 1 pin, 1 stone, 3 pencils. 1 boot," &amp;c.</hi>) I took them to the station, and asked Clinton, "Is that the man you have spoken to about the robbery?" meaning, "Is that the man you have been talking to about the robbery, he said, "Yes"—Buncher said, "Lord Jesus Christ!"—I asked Clinton again if he was the man, and he said he was—Buncher was then charged.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the York Hotel, at the corner of York-road and Waterloo-road—I know Gardner—I saw him at my place about a month or five weeks before the examination before the Magistrate—he was in front of the bar, and to the best of my belief Clinton was with him—I could not swear to him—Gardner had a dog with him which was playing antics—it was a little rough dog, like a Scotch terrier—Gardner made it stand up in the corner on his hind legs, and obey him and no one else, it would not get down from his posture till he gave him permission—that drew my attention to the parties—I talked with him about the dog.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the principal clerk at Bow-street. I took the examination of the prisoners on this charge—the proper form of caution was read over to them by Mr. Henry—Badcock said, "Clinton said to me, when the robbery came off he would make me a present of something handsome; I did not know when it was to be, or where it was."</p>

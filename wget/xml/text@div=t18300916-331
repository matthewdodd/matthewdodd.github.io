               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober? A. I had been with two friends, three of us had drank two bottles of port wine - I was not tipsy; I had taken nothing else; I am sixty one years of age - I had this wine at the Blossom's Inn; I had dined two hours before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard the prosecutor cry Watch! the prisoner ran from him - I stopped him with this hat on his head; I wished him to return with me, but he refused - he took the hat from his head, and said, "This is the hat I have taken from the gentleman; it is my first offence, pray have mercy upon me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that he said it was his first offence? A. He asked for mercy;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160143"></xptr>I will not swear I did not say that he owned it was his first offence, but to the best of my knowledge I did not - it had slipped my memory; the prisoner had no other hat- the gentleman was not sober.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. This is my hat</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you sober? A. Pretty well; I was sober enough to know I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor with a young man, who asked me to go with him; I got on to Milbank, and he was so very obstinate I was forced to leave him - I went on and found the hat; I took off my cap, and put it on; I met the officer, who said he must detain me - the gentleman then came up without his hat, and said he had no knowledge of me, and I had not robbed him.</p>

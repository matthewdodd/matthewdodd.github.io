                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case against Cox; that the pro<lb></lb>missory note not being produced made it very doubtful whether the forgery could be established as against either prisoner, and that no uttering was proved.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that there was evidence for the Jury of forgery by James Rickaby, and against the elder prisoner as an accessory before the fact, which verdict the Jury were enabled to find under Lord Campbell's Act; although he was not so charged by the indictment. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered the ease as against Cox very slight, but as to the others there was evidence for the Jury.</hi>)</p>

I was recommended to him by Dr. Thompson, and my son could prove it.</p>

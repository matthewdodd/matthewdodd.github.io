Q.</hi> I believe it is the duty of all the clerks to honour cheques over the counter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than two—there are two cashiers, and when one was away it was the duty either of Mr. Holl or myself, before the discovery of the fraud, to take the cashier's place—generally speaking, there were only two clerks who honoured cheques: but if one was out of the way, another clerk might assist—a clerk honouring a cheque over the counter, has the means of referring to the calendars or the ledger, to see whether the account is over<lb></lb>drawn; he would there see whether the person who had drawn a cheque, had a balance to his credit, unless it was not cleared; but if the amount had been paid in bank notes or gold, the cheque would be paid at once—each clerk as he pays a cheque makes an entry, in the paying-book, of the details—he enters the name, the amount, and how he paid it—it would not invariably happen that the same person who paid the cheque made the entry, because on Saturday, when the bank is very full, another person might assist; but the usual course is for the same hand which pays the money to make the entry—accounts are occasionally overdrawn by the authority of the manager—I know of instances of clerks paying cheques for which there are no effects in the bank—the usual course in that instance is to write to the party to rectify the error as soon as possible—I do not remember any instance where the error has been unable to be rectified.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go thoroughly through Holcroft's accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; they presented to my professional eye the ordinary accounts of a man carrying on business—there were the usual hooks employed, ledgers, bill-books, and other books—I ascertained in the course of my investigation, that he had, at various times, made bad debts—I had to prepare a statement of bad debts to be submitted to the Secretary of the London Joint Stock Bank, before I could get their consent to the composition—he has lost several thousand pounds—my investigation of the hooks extended over about ten years—the debits and credits amounted to several thousand pounds in the whole—I cannot give you the amount per annum—a person named Gardner was the principal creditor—his account alone, as far as my memory serves me, was 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, irrespective of the other persons with whom he traded—the trading with Gardner extended over several years—the amount of bad debts was about 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he seem to be doing a good trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—all the hooks bear evidence that he did a large trade—I did not prepare a profit and loss account; but the principal losses were the bad debts—I discovered them by going through the ledger, and I referred to Holcroft himself—the average amount of bad debts was about 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Looking at a memorandum</hi>)—he owed 4,147<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and his deficiency was 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the result of that would be, that he must have lost and paid 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of profits and out of assets—if his bad debts were 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and his deficiencies 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. supposing he had started with nothing and had got nothing left, he must, in that case, have made 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of profits in the interim, or had 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent him, or something of that kind—I do not know how that was, as I did not prepare a profit and loss account showing the profits on the sales.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The evidence of this witness, given on the former trial, was read over, to which he assented, and added</hi>)—The first item of cash paid and exclusive of transfers from Durdin's account, and bills discounted, was on 20th May, 1852, the account being opened on 2d December, 1851, with 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Currie's—after that time, on 27th December, the next cash was Durdin's cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the next a short bill of Durdin's on 12th April—on 15th April here is a transfer from Holcroft put down as cash for that short bill which had been in the first instance returned on 5th May; cash from Currie's to Durdin's account 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that is the first money paid to the account—allthese items on the right hand margin are the sums; mo. means money—without going through all the accounts, I find that from time to time Durdin's account is credited for cheques, from Holcroft, and Holcroft for cheques by Durdin—here are no fictitious entries; not what are called so—I show that entries are fictitious by their passing through his cash-book, in<lb></lb>stead of their paying them as they would if they had been money—there are many fictitious entries about this period—I have a list of them for each year from 1851—in 1851 the false credits were 1,316<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he has abstracted sums to the extent of 4,730<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as for cheques drawn by Joel, Richards, and others—in the year 1852, 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether was the amount of frauds; in 1853, 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1854, 5,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1855, 5,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1856, 2,350; in 1857, 8,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1858, 12,243<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1859, 10,109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1860, 9,951<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1861, 1,047<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—from the closing of Durdin's ac<lb></lb>count these amounts were carried through Holcroft's account—all this was done by means of Holcroft's account from the closing of Durdin's account in 1853—I have also traced from time to time cheques by Holcroft placed at the Deposit Bank to Durdin's account—we have only the pass-books for a short time, so that I cannot say to what extent; but in a number of instances, some hundreds in the year 1860, and there are some cases of Holcroft's account credited by cheques drawn by Durdin on his own account at the Deposit Bank—during 1860 there are 185 items of return cheques of Holcroft's for bills entered in this book, amounting to 11,030<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186107080034"></xptr>
               <p>during the same period, amounting to upwards of 150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the extent of 153,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the entries in the ledger are. founded upon the cash-book; how many of those were mere exchanges, and how many were bona fide money, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But if there was nothing worse than that, the bank would have lost nothing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing—I mean that these amounts purport to pass through the cash-book.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DYSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Must not an entry in the cash-book, made by any of the clerks, represent the cash as coming in over the counter, and received by the person who makes the entry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It ought to be so—the entries in the cash-book are made by the cashier who receives the cash—I am one of those, Mr. Little is the other, and in our absence some other clerk, occasionally Durdin himself in former years, but not of late years—we always ascertain at night that our cash is correct as regards the cash-book—it is the custom in all banking-houses to balance to a penny before the clerks leave—it was the custom at the Commercial Bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But that balancing, I apprehend, does not consist of counting the money actually in the drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the balancing of the money is quite a separate thing altogether—the balancing the money is the balancing of the cashier's money which is carried into the balance quite in a separate manner—the notes and gold we balance every night to a penny—we do that by comparing what we have paid out with what we have received—that is the result we arrive at by comparison of certain figures in certain books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose you began business in the morning with 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, gold, and silver in your till, and suppose in the course of the day the payments in exceeded the payments out by 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., ought you not at the close of the day to have 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, and we should look to see if we had got that 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But where would you look? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We should cast the books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you not count your notes and gold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly we should; but if any of the books are wrongly cast to correspond with any fraudulent entries, then of course the balance agrees to a penny, just the same; so that if the 66,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. vas not in the calendar, we should not expect to find it in the till—if a cheque was paid in to Holcroft's account it would appear in the cash-book; whether it was an exchanged cheque or not we could not tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather-seller of 23, Redcross-street, Barbican, late of the firm of Gray and Napper—I have known Holcroft from fifteen to twenty years—I have from time to time given him exchanged cheques—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are cheques for the year 1860, which I gave him in return for cheques of his to the same amount; altogether to the amount of between 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are all here except the first, which we lost—the counterfoils are here—the first date is 4th January, and the last 20th December, they amount to 768<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were both your cheques dated the same day. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he would give me a cheque not dated the same day, or if it was, there was an understanding that it was to be renewed—it was a temporary loan of from three days to a week—sometimes he gave me a cheque upon his banker, and sometimes they were not his; sometimes they were upon the Deposit Bank—they were not sometimes Durdin's cheques—I never knew the name of Durdin—the cheques produced represent nothing more than a loan for a day or two or a week.</p>

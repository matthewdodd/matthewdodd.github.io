I was with Inspector Fox and Sergeant Walsh in the Old Kent Road on February 18th, about 6.30 p.m., and I saw the prisoner hail a cab On the rank—he got into it and drove off—in consequence of what Inspector Walsh said to me I followed the cab about half a mile to a railway arch in Old Kent Road, where it pulled up in front of a public-house—I kept watch, and when the prisoner left the cab I followed him—Fox and Walsh then came up, and we walked down the road until we lost sight of the prisoner—I went about a mile farther on, and saw him outside the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, at New Cross—I continued to follow him—he then went back up the Old Kent Road as far as the first railway arch and turned down a turning, where I lost sight of him—I went back to Walsh—I saw him next about 9.30, standing at the corner of Shanton Street—Inspector Fox was behind me coming up—the prisoner then turned up Shanton Street—Walsh went after him and I followed Walsh—when I got up Walsh and Fox had him in custody, and I assisted in taking him to the police-station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant M</hi>). I was with Fox and Harvey on Feb. 18th, and saw the prisoner in a cab about 6.30 p.m.—I knew him by sight, and continued following him till 9.30, when I saw him at the corner of Shenton Street, where he stood and looked at me, and then ran up the street—I was the first to follow him up, and saw him run to a van about 30 yards up the street and throw something into it—he then turned back, and I caught him about 6 or 7 yards from the van—Inspector Fox came up at the moment—I fetched a lamp and searched as I thought I heard something fall—after searching the road I went to the van and found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, then wrapped up in a piece of paper—I was at the station when he was searched, and saw the paper compared with this other piece.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the police-court—the other two officers heard me give my evidence—Mr. Bonman defended the prisoner, and asked that the witnesses should leave the Court, and the Magistrate said, "No, I order the witnesses to stay in Court"—I do not think I said before the Magistrate that I saw the prisoner look towards me and run up the street—I cannot remember—there is a corn chandler's shop at the corner of Shenton Street, which is a blind street, and the van was about 30 yards from the corner—I did not inquire who the van belonged to—I found this in the van—it is a hammer and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I recovered about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property at Colchester by a similar thing—it could be used for ordinary purposes—there were no horses to the van—I was opposite him about 15 yards away at the corner opposite the shop when he went to the van—I crossed the street and ran after him—he put something in the van—I might be 10 yards or more from him then—he was coming back again when I caught him about 6 or 7 yards from the van—it was an ordinary night—I could see by the gas lamp at the corner near the shop—the gas is 30 yards away and would not enable me to see to the van—I put him against the wall and held him—Sergeant Harvey came up, and I handed the prisoner over to him—we got a lamp from the cornchandler's shop, and Inspector Fox and I went to the van, and I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> rolled up in a bit of paper about three or four feet in the van from behind—the tail of the van was down—I could not swear which part of the paper was on the jemmy—before searching the van I searched near the shop and along the gutter—the prisoner wanted us to take him away to the station at once—while searching the road I said, "I thought I heard some keys thrown away"—I went to look for them first—I did not search the van first; it did not strike me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have had much experience in these cages, and have seen many burglarious instruments, and have known premises broken into by similar instruments to this—I stopped him, and Fox came up and we searched—the whole thing took two or three minutes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector M</hi>). On the night of 18th February I was with Harvey and Fox* at the south end of Old Kent Road—in consequence of information I gave directions to Harvey—I have known the prisoner some time—about 9.30 p.m. I saw the prisoner at the corner, of Shenton Street—he stood for a second and then darted quickly round</p>

               <p>up the street—I ran to the corner of the street and met him coming back, walking quickly down Shenton Street to the Old Kent Road—I got there at the same moment as Walsh—Walsh caught him by the shoulder at the same moment as I did—I said "Harry, what do you do here at this time?"—he said "What is that to do with you?"—I began to feel his clothing—he said "If you want to search me take me to the station"—he said repeatedly "Take me to the station"—Walsh got a lantern and searched—Harvey was there—I saw Walsh take this instrument out from the van rolled up in paper, he handed it to me and we went to the station and the prisoner was searched there—he took a silk handkerchief from his pocket and spread it on the floor, and amongst the things taken from his pocket was this part of a <hi rend="italic">Western Morning News</hi>—I compared it with the piece wrapped round the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and it fits word for word and letter for letter—I asked his name—he said "William Wilson, I am a sailor, but I refuse to give you any address"—there was also found upon him four keys, a watch, and a ring—this instrument can be bought in the shops, but it is used by burglars—in the last case I was engaged in a similar instrument was used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The instrument was wrapped in the centre, but hardly covered—I caught him about 10 yards from the shop—Walsh got a lantern and searched in the road—I first heard him say at the police station that he saw something put into the van—Walsh looked in the van and said, "Here it is"—the van belonged to a timber yard adjoining—I did not think it necessary to see the owner of the van—if I found it belonged to him I should not have considered it an instrument of burglary, but if I found a man loitering about I should—I was present when the paper was taken out of the prisoner's pocket—he took it out himself—he spread this hand<lb></lb>kerchief on the floor and threw everything into it—these are the latch<lb></lb>keys—they are not burglarious instruments—they might be used as such.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Crabtree, he is baker.</p>
               <p>On the 23rd of March the prisoner came to our shop and asked for a two pound loaf—she altered her mind, and said she would have a four pound loaf, and she laid a sixpence on the counter—I said it was not enough—she took up the sixpence and put down a shilling, which I put into the bowl, in the till—there were four or five sixpences there, but no other shilling—I afterwards went to the till to get a sixpence out and saw the shilling was bad—I put it on a shelf in the parlour—I saw the prisoner the next day, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, as I was sitting in the parlour—she asked for a two pound loaf—my niece was in the shop, and I let her serve her, to see what she would give her—I saw her give my niece a shilling, which she brought to me—I saw it was bad—I went into the shop and took the other shilling with me which I had taken of her the day before—I held the one between my finger and thumb, and the other in my hand—I said to her, "My good woman, you brought a bad shilling here yesterday, and now you have brought another—how many more have you got?" she said, "I never was in the shop before"—I said, "How can you say so, when you have frequented the shop for this fortnight?"—she said, "Give me two penny worth of bread, and let me go"—I said I would not—I sent my niece for a policeman—the prisoner ran out of the house, and my niece run after her and gave her to the officer.</p>

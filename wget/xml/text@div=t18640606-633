I reside in the Stowage, Deptford, and am super<lb></lb>intendent of the General Steam Navigation Company's works in the creek—James Wilkins is chairman of the Company—on 17th May my attention was called to footmarks in my garden, which adjoins the factory—I went round the garden and missed a large copper steam-pipe, weighing a hundred<lb></lb>weight and a half or three-quarters, which had been lying in the yard close to the coppersmiths' shop—on looking about I found marks of the flange of a pipe, and sent for the police—I afterwards missed three pipes, which I saw at the police-station on the following Monday week—they were worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as old copper—I have frequently seen Hill about my premises, and warned him off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 237). On Sunday morning, 15th May, I went to Mr. Beardmore's premises, and traced footmarks from the factory road, across the kitchen garden, to a field adjoining—I saw the marks of the flange of a pipe, and traced them over a hedge to a lane, where I lost all traces of footmarks; but I traced the wheels apparently of a truck to Pope's-buildings</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186406060060"></xptr>
               <p>—on 16th May, between 2 and 3 in the morning, I concealed my<lb></lb>self with other constables at Copperas-lane, and between 3 and 4 o'clock the shutters of 13, Copperas-lane, were opened, and somebody, who is not here, came out and walked up and down, where I could see him, till 5 o'clock, when O'Connor came from the railway arch and joined him—they walked on in conversation, occasionally going into Fish-street—about a quarter past 5 Hill joined them, and then the stranger went away, leaving the other two; and at a quarter to 6 the stranger came back with a van, which was dragged to the end of Fish-street, backed up to some posts, the tail-board was let down, and shortly afterwards the stranger and O'Connor came out with one of the large pipes on their shoulders, and placed it in the van, while Hill walked to and fro between the van and where I was concealed with the other two constables—O'Connor and the stranger went and fetched a second and a third pipe, and placed them in the van, which drove away with the three still talking together—we then made our appearance, and as soon as they saw us they made off—I passed Hill to take one of the others, but did not succeed—the van was stopped by a constable—I knew the prisoners well before, and the other man also—they all passed by where I was before the van came—I almost touched them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hil.</hi> I was going round the corner of the lane and met Mr. Turner. I stopped at my sister's door to get a clean slop and some money. One of the policemen said, "I shall have you." I said, "What for?" He said, "You know; come along," and then he accused me of stealing three copper pipes; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">O'Connor.</hi> I got to the Oxford Arms about a quarter to 6, and met this stranger; Limerick they call him; the constable made a rush at us, and I ran away; that is how I got connected with the job.</p>

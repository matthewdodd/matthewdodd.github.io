At 3.50 on the morning of 4th August I was on duty in High Street, Southwark—I heard a kind of single knock at No. 39—I listened at the door for about fifteen minutes, and I heard a noise as if some wood and brickwork was being torn away—I rang. the bell, and Mrs. Willey, the housekeeper, looked out of the top window—I told her something was wrong, but she did not come and let me in—at the same time I saw the prisoners run out of King's Head Yard, which is about 6 or 7 yards from 39; there is one house between—the prisoners were in their shirt sleeves, with their coats on their arms—Sergeant Moon came up, and I told him what had occurred, and he followed the prisoners towards Stoney Street, and I went down York Street—they crossed the Green Market and the Borough Market by St. Saviour's Church—I saw them cross the Green Market—when I got to the archway, they saw me and turned off to the left towards West Kent Wharf; one turned down Winchester Street, and one down West Kent Wharf—I lost sight of them for about a minute, and then I saw Butler in the Green Market with Giles, the beadle—I said to Giles "That is the man I want"—Butler said nothing—I took him back to 39, High Street, and handed him over to two constables, who took him to the station—I afterwards went into the house—I saw McSweeney again on the 28th August at the Stone's End police-station—he was among twelve or fourteen others, and I picked him out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Green Street, Southwark Bridge Road, and am a widow—McSweeney and his wife have lived in my house a year and ten months—he was living there in August last—he has one son who is married and away from him—they occupied the back room on the first floor—I know he was employed at Horton &amp; Sons for years before he came to live with me—he had been to sea before he came to my place, and then he worked for Hortons—he was sent into the country sometimes for them—I remember the 3rd and 4th August quite well—McSweeney slept at home on the night of the 3rd—I am sure he did—he went out about 6 o'clock on the morning of the 4th—he was the first that came downstairs—I asked the time, and McSweeney answered me and said it was just gone 6 o'clock—I am quite sure it was the 4th August because he came back at 11 o'clock for Borne clean things to go to the country—he went into the country that day—his wife did not go with him—he came in in a hurry about 11 o'clock, went upstairs and had a word or two with his wife about his clean things, came downstairs with a parcel, and went out in a hurry, and I did not see him again till he came from the country—I heard him say to his wife that the master was sending him to a job in the country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My daughter, Mary Short, lives with me, and a man who works in a tan yard—I have another daughter but she is not at home with me—she has been in a little trouble through making acquaintance with some persons who were not fit company for her—nothing was traced to my house—I am quite sure about that—she is in trouble now, but that has nothing to do with me—I sleep in the front parlour close to the front door—I go to bed about 9 o'clock and sometimes 10 o'clock—my little grandchild sleeps with me and ray daughter—I did not hear anybody go out—I always shut my door—a lodger can open it and go out by taking the bolt from the top and bottom, but no one can come in—I remember the 3rd August because McSweeney went to the country the next day—he often went to the country and aboard his ship to do a little job, and his <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> goes and draws his money from the office when he is away—I don't know Butler at all—I never saw him at my place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Short, a carman, who works at West Kent Wharf—we live in the back room downstairs of my mother's house—we were living there in August—McSweeney and his wife also lived there, and his sister, Mrs. Lucas, had the front room, but she has left about three weeks—all I know is that since McSweeney has been at our house, a year and ten months, he has always gone out at six o'clock in the morning—I don't remember the 3rd August at all—I remember when he went out on one job on a Wednesday, when he went out in the morning about 6.10 and came back about 11 o'clock, for his clean clothes, and I went and pledged a shirt for his wife—I can't tell whether it was in the Bank Holiday week or not—it was in the summer time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married—I am McSweeney's sister—I was living at Mrs. Riley's, but I left the Wednesday before the 1st August—I know that my brother was employed at Messrs. Horton's, and has been for sixteen or seventeen years—a gentleman from there was here yesterday, and told me he could not attend to-day.</p>

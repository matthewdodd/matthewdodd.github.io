Last Wednesday evening the prisoner came into my shop to purchase some ferrit; she purchased some and paid for it; I was in conversation with a gentleman; I observed her to be in a flurry, she seemed to be agitated, she had a pocket handkerchief in her hand; as she walked out of the shop I started after her, and I expressed a wish to see the pocket handkerchief that was in her hand. She gave it to me; I found in it these pieces of silk galloon, they are worth thirteen shillings; I had seen them in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>MR. KERNEY. I was in the shop transacting some business with Mr. Kenyon. I saw the woman come in and purchase some ferrit; I saw Mr. Kenyon call her back, and take the handkerchief from her. He shook it, and the goods fell out.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodged at the Crown and Anchor, king's Head-court, Shoe-lane—I am a compositor. On the night of 31st Dec. I re<lb></lb>ceived a sorvereign, 3 half-crowns, and a few coppers, at the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> office, for my wages—I went to the Green Dragon, in Fleet-streer, with a friend—the prisoner came in, and I said, "Poor girl, I will give you something to drink, and I should like to give you something to eat"—she said, "I will have a drop of gin"—I said, "No; you shall have some brandy"—she put her hand to me to thank me—I took out a shilling to pay for it, and took out the sovereign, and placed it on the top of the other money, so as to have it next my breast in my pocket—she put her hand in, and took out the money—I clasped her hand, and saw a sovereign in her hand—she stooped down on her knees, and struggled—I sank down too, and lost my hold of her—she put her hand under her petticoats—I told the inspector she must have a pocket at the bottom of her dress—he allowed me to search—I did not find the sovereign.</p>

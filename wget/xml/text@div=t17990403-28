            : On the 14th of March, in consequence of a suspicion, we went into the cellar, and found concealed in the cieling a bag filled with flour; we waited till the prisoner came in; he went down stairs, as it was his custom to do for some time past.</p>

No; when he came up again, I went down and found the flour was gone; I followed him to the door, he was just going from the door; Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Forshaw came over and stopped him, just as he had got to the top of St. Dunstan's-hill, brought him back, searched him, and found the flour upon him; he sald, he hoped his master would consider his wife and family, and have mercy upon him.</p>

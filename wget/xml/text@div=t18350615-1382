                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, and live in Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road.

               <p>early in the morning, I was robbed of the money—he told me on Saturday that he was going to have the shop altered on the Monday, and then I knew be would miss the things sold—if he had paid me my wages, and the poundage which I had for selling things, I should have been able to pay him—I starved myself on bread and water to pay him, but could not save the money up—I have since sent to say my mother would pay it at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; but he said he would make an example of me.</p>

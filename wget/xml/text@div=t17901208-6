               <p>I am clerk to Sir Sampson Wright; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080014"></xptr>was present when the prisoner was brought there; the examination of the prisoner was taken in writing by me, during which the prisoner whispered to me, that he wanted to go to the door; I told Mr. Bond his wishes, and he desired him to go into the back-room, instead of the door; whilst he was in the room, Mr. Bond desired I would search him; upon the prisoner hearing what he had ordered, he pulled out his handkerchief and gloves, and threw them into the window, and from the handkerchief or the gloves, I am not certain which, this paper dropped; I immediately picked up the paper and saw what it was, and then recollected that the prisoner had frequently told Mr. Bond he could not write; I laid hold of him by the right hand, and on the middle finger was the mark of ink very fresh, and the writing was very fresh: the examination was not signed by him. (The paper read.)</p>
               <p>"Nov. 4th, 1790. Messrs. Bidulph and Co. Pay Barrer on demand the sum of eighty pounds, and you will oblige you humble servant, J. or W. Buller." in the same way as it is in the draft; at the bottom,</p>
               <p>"Messrs. Biddulph and Co. Please to pay Barrer on demand eighty pounds, and you will oblige your humble servant, W. Buller;" on the back</p>
               <p>"Messrs. Biddulph and Co. Charing-Cross." The prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What time was the prisoner committed? - About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you know that any person was sent to the Park? - I believe there was not.</p>

               <p>A man gave it me at the Horse Guards.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

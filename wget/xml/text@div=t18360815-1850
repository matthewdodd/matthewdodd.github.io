                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at the Temple Coffee-house, New Walk, White-friars. On the 2nd of August, I was walking in Drury-lane, between one and two o'clock in the morning, before day-break, and met the prisoner—a few words passed between us—I cannot recollect what they were—I believe it was either, "Where are you going?" or, "Will you go with me?"—no sooner had she spoken the words than she drew the breast-pin from my shirt—I turned round directly, and saw a policeman within few yards, and gave her in charge—it was not above two minutes from the pin being taken, and my giving her to the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said you had no money—you gave me the pin, and we went up the court together, and were there above ten minutes. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is entirely false, not a word of the kind was uttered by me—I was not in any court with her—I was sober—I had been to my brother's, and staid out later than usual—I had a pint and a half of ale, but was not at all in<lb></lb>toxicated.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">WHITE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 88.) I was on duty about two o'clock in the morning on the 2nd of August, in Drury-lane—the prisoner was given into my custody by the prosecutor—as we were going to the station-house. I observed her doing something to the lower part of her gown—I immediately put my hand there, and found the gold pin sticking into the lower part of her gown—she had been charged with stealing it, but said she had not got it, and had not taken it—she then said the prosecutor gave it to her, and afterwards told me that she had taken it from his breast.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He gave me the pin—I would not allow him what he wished, and he swore he would give me in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Read, who is occasionally the master of a vessel—he is not so at present. On the 18th of August last year, my husband was at sea—I had known the prisoner before that, by his calling to see Mary Ann Barton, a young person who lodged with me—on the evening of the 18th of August, I was standing at my door—my daughter and Ann Dye, my niece, were with we—the prisoner came up and asked for Mary Ann Barton, and asked where she was living—I told him in Sydney-street—he then wished to come in and have some wine to drink—I consented, as he was not a stranger, and we went into the kitchen—a bottle of port wine was sent for—the prisoner gave Ann Dye the money, and she went for it—I think he gave her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not observe whether he took it out of a purse—we drank that bottle, and the prisoner proposed having a second—he gave some money for a second, and Ann Dye went for it—he took that money from his pocket—I did not see his purse at that time—after she was gone for the wine, the prisoner sat at the opposite table and was looking at his purse, counting his money over—he had a purse, and I saw some money in it, but I do not know what amount—it appeared to be sovereigns—I thought he looked very serious,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250066"></xptr>
               <p>and asked what was the matter—he said he had missed half-a-sovereign—he put the money in his purse again, and said he knew where he had been previous to coming to my place, that it was a very short distance, and he would go and ascertain whether he had given it for a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he said he had called for a glass of half-and-half, that he did not approve of it, and had 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin-and-water—he then left the house—he came back in about ten minutes or rather better—Ann Dye came back about the same time—I was still in the kitchen with my daughter and Ann Dye—the second bottle of wine was not touched at all—the prisoner said he should like to have a pint of half-and-half and a smoke of a pipe—Ann Dye fetched it, and we all sat down—I got up to snuff the candle, and he pulled me on his knee—I got off immediately, and took my seat again—he afterwards put his hand on Ann Dye's bosom, and she boxed his ears—my daughter was in the room the whole of the time—the prisoner said he thought he should stop and lodge there that night—I said I had no convenience for any thing of the sort—he then attempted to go—he got off his seat and missed his purse directly, and said he had lost his purse in the house—I was quite surprised to think he should accuse us of such a thing—he said he had lost it in my house, and he insisted on knowing the particulars—he immediately went up into the street, called in two policemen, said he had lost his money in my premises, and gave us in charge—he said he had lost his purse at the time he pulled me on his knee—I refused to go to the station, and one of the policemen behaved very ill indeed to me, and wanted to take me without a bonnet or shawl—the prisoner did not say any thing about what I bad better do, or about letting me go, nor about giving him back his money—he said we should go to the station—he would insist on saying the money was lost in the house, and the house was searched at the very instant—he did not say any thing about how I might turn the policemen out—very few words passed at the time—the policeman searched him, to see whether he had got a purse, and did not find it.</p>

                  </hi>. Mrs. Read was at our office—she was put back into the cell—her daughter and Ann Dye were discharged—I had no ac<lb></lb>quaintance with the prisoner previous to the charge—I had seen him before—I was present when he accused the prosecutrix of robbing him of thir-teen or fourteen sovereigns—when she was put back into the cell I went to her—I had not seen the prisoner between the time of his preferring the charge and my going into the cell—I went to her house with a policeman and searched it at her request—I did not find thirteen sovereigns there,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250067"></xptr>
               <p>nor any money—I saw a receipt or voucher for some money there, but I did not bring it with me—I then went back to her.</p>

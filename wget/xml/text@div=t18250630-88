            . I am watchman to Mr. Coil. On the 18th of April I saw three men loading two iron pipes into a cart, from his premises, at ten o'clock at night - they had come through the gate: I followed them down the road about thirty poles; they then stopped, and fastened the pipes in the cart; two of them then returned: I followed the third man, who was the prisoner, with the cart - when I came up to him I said,</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with those pipes? you have stolen them;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, they are for Mr. Bracefield, the brewer." I said it was an odd time of night to fetch them; he then said,</p>
               <p>"Is not your name Taylor?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Let me take them back;" I said,</p>
               <p>"No, you shall not;" he then said,</p>
               <p>"Well, let them be, and you and I will talk together;" he then wanted me to shoot him - when we got some distance he said he would go to the Red Lion public-house; he then turned round suddenly, and whipped his horse, and got off too fast for me to follow him.</p>

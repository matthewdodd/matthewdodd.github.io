                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Smith, of Pitfield-street, a pawnbroker. On the 18th of April, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop, and as he was going out he attempted to take down a piece of cotton—he then went on the other side of the street—he returned again to the shop, and attempted to take down a pair of trowsers—he did not succeed—he crossed the road, then returned and took them down, and walked away with them in his apron—I pursued and gave him into custody—these are the trowsers I found in his apron—they are my master's, and had been inside the door.</p>

I was on duty, and saw the prisoner at the shop-door—he then went away—two more who had been with him went down a street—I was looking after them, and in the mean time the prisoner went and took the trowsers—I saw Mr. Walter go to him—I took him, and took the trowsers from him.</p>

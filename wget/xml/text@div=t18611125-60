                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 194). I had known the two prisoners some years—on the evening of the 17th October, about half-past 5 o'clock, I was in Shoreditch, and saw them there walking in company together—I followed them for something like half an hour, through various streets into the Minories—when they got there they met a van laden with corn and tea, belonging to the Midland Railway Company—directly they met it they turned and followed it through Hounsditch, through Wormwood-street to the corner of London Wall, when Nicholls went up and lifted the tea off the front part of the van, and was coming back towards me—I went to take him in custody, and he threw the tea at me—the driver was sitting on the box, above the tea; the tea was at the back of him—both prisoners made their escape—Waldren was close by his side when he took the tea—they both turned together, and came back towards me together, and I went to take them in custody—they both ram in the same direction, close together—I have known Nicholls for some years by the nickname of Brewer.</p>

I received information about this robbery, and looked after the prisoners—on 19th October, I was on duty in Hare-street, Bethnal-green, and saw Waldren go into the Red Cross public-house—I went in, tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Brown, I want you for stealing half a chest of tea in the City the other night—he said, "Me! I am not the man at all—I said, "Very well, you will have to come with me to the station"—he did so, and while waiting for Kenwood to come he said that he was in company with the other man, but did not know he meant to steal the tea—I asked him what other man—he said, "Brewer"—I had seen Nicholls before—I knew him by the name of Brewer, and Waldren by the name of Brown.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. The prosecutor accused this woman of robbing him of three sovereigns and a half - he was not sober, but appeared to know what he was about; I pursued the prisoner - she had just turned round Cannon-street; I called her, and she turned back - I took her in front of the prosecutor, and found on her 1s. 6 1/2d.; there was another woman with the prosecutor- I saw them all three standing together near the watering-house; I went up to Bluegate-fields, dispersed some girls, and when I returned the prosecutor stated the case to me - I took the prisoner; the prosecutor was reeling about, but was able to answer questions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the man with a woman holding his arm - the woman said, "Come," and I went with them to the night-house; he called for a quartern of gin; he said, "I will go inside" - I bade him good night, crossed the road, and went down Cannon-street, when the officer took me.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of that morning had the prisoner said any thing to you about rent. - A. I was in the kitchen in the morning about eleven o'clock, she came into the kitchen to me and said she was behind, with her rent.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the fact, she was. - A. Yes; she said Daniel would bring home a two pound note, she would pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was she behind. - A. Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that morning, while you were in the bar, did you observe her in the bar or near it. - A. I was in the kitchen, the bar was left in care of my niece.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the day did you observe any thing about her dress. - A. I did; she had about a week or ten days before that borrowed my servant's shawl; on that day I saw her with her own shawl on; her shawl she told me was in pledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe in the morning whether she staid in or went out. - A. I cannot say. I was in the kitchen; when my husband came home between five and six o'clock in the evening I caused her to be taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Holton also apprehended that evening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.So that there was nobody left in their room. - A. Nobody; the next morning I went to her room, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170049"></xptr>observed an old gown hanging on the back of the chair, that she had worn that Saturday; the same day she was apprehended I took it in my hand, I observed a small key tied withinside of the waist of the gown, with a string only; the key and gown are both here, this gown she took off while the officer waited for her; this is the gown, and the key is hanging to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of the money that you lost wrapped up in pieces of old newspaper. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Now we know ladies do not wear pockets, and the key is tied to the gown in the modern fashion. It is a common key, it is not a picklock key. - A. To be sure it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your drawer locked. - A. My own key was left in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband keeps the house that the property belongs to. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sorry for your loss. How many lodgers did you keep. - A. Two, when the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all come in at one common door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have some servants perhaps. - A. Yes, two; a boy and a female servant.</p>
               <p>Q.This woman was a lodger in the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the upper part of it, not on the same floor. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made the bed. - A. Myself; I never entrust the servant with the key; I always make the bed myself and keep the key, because I never trust the servant to go into it; it is where I keep my property.</p>

               <p>Q. I only wish to know whether you did not let your servant occasionally go into this little bed room to do little purposes. - A. I never do, because we keep loose halfpence about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the exact accompt of your money. - A. No; there were above ninety pounds; I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sure so if you say so; you do not know the number of the notes. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if I ask you the number of one pound, two pound or twenty pound, you cannot tell me. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q How long did this woman lodge with you. - A. About eight weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of pieces of paper were they. - A.pieces of old newspaper.</p>
               <p>Q. After she had done this did she lock the trunk again. - A. She locked it up again and gave it to me; I locked it up in my box as before.</p>
               <p>Q. And during this time Mrs. Golding was present. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep her box in your possession. - A. On the Sunday night following, I acquainted my master with it, and gave it to my master; I heard Holton was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. What day did she give you the money and the box. - A. On the Saturday morning between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

He worked in the house; I had not seen him since dinner, I never heard that he was taken in custody till Sunday afternoon, then one of the apprentices had been to see him; I heard this in the afternoon, and I gave the box to my master.</p>

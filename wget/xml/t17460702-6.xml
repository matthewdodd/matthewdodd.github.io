               <p>Q. When was it she came to you?</p>
               <p>Pollen. The 23d of April .</p>
               <p>Q. Madam , did you lose any thing?</p>
               <p>Pollen. I lost many Things; a black Coat of my Husband's, a

             which was mine, a Linnen Apron, two Handkerchiefs, two Holland Shifts , six pair of Cotton Stockings, two Pair of Shirt Sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost all these Things; do you know who took them?</p>
               <p>Pollen. I tax'd every other Servant; I thought I had great Reason to suspect the Cook: About a Months afterwards I discharg'd two Servants upon her Account. The Way we first miss'd them was this; Mr. Pollen wanted his black Coat; the Person that went up to the Press for it could not find it, and upon Search, my Joseph , that was in the same Place , was not there; we sent out to Monmouth-street to the Taylor; he made Enquiry n the same Street , and traced the Matter out: When the Person that bought the Coat of her saw her, he knew her again; she then told me the Person she had pawn'd the Joseph to; we found several Things in her Box, and this Handkerchief I found upon her Neck, which I am positive of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a Mark upon it?</p>
               <p>Pollen. No, my Lord; but 'tis my own Work, and I know it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I won't plead 'till I have my Clothes deliver'd.</p>
               <p>Pollen. The Prisoner gave me an Order to deliver them to her Sister at Justice Smith's, but Mr. Smith did not care to take them.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether you are guilty or acquitted, you will be intitled to your Clothes again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were two Pair of Holland Sleeves that she said was her's , and two Pair of Sleeves, they are mine; as to the two colour'd Handkerchiefs , they never were her's.</p>

               <p>Bradock .

I went to the Man, and he said he bought it of those that bought it of the Thief.</p>

            . I am the mate. On the 6th of October a friend came on board the ship - the prisoner came with him, and appeared as an acquaintance; I showed them the vessel, but did not go into the state-room with them - I stood outside; the witness told me he had lost his watch, and we all stripped - the prisoner said there was no occasion for him to strip, he had not got it; we then went on shore, and had some beer at a public-house - as we were coming away the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and drew it out again - I saw the two seals, and said they were the steward's seals; I asked him for the watch, but he would not give it to me; I said I would call the watchman - the prisoner dropped the watch in the passage, and the landlord took it up.</p>

               <p>E. Anson. Not above an hour in the morning. I let her in about seven o'clock, and she did business in cleaning the parlour and kitchen.</p>

               <p>E. Anson. I did. I never saw any thing about her when she went away. I know all these things here produced to be Mrs. Nicholson's property. I found the prisoner in St. Giles's after my mistress sent for me, and asked her if she knew any thing of the things missing. She owned she had taken them, and they were in pawn; and said she had not money to fetch them out. She went with us when they were taken out; at a pawnbroker's in Hanover-yard we had two table-cloths; at another in St. Giles's we had two napkins, a cap, and a few odd things; at another in Smart's Buildings we found a shift.

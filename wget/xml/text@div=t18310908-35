               <p>RICHARD STANTON. I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 8th of July I saw Welch walking down from the hall-door, with two coats on his arm - Pulling was outside the premises, twenty or thirty yards from the door, and could not see the coats hanging in the hall from where he stood; I went out at the gate, and saw the coats in the possession of Pulling, but I did not see Welch give them to him - there was a third person with them; I followed directly, and inquired what they had done with the coats -I had lost sight of them for about a minute and a half: I then saw Pulling with the coats, and the third man, who is not here; they ran, and I secured the two prisoners, and gave charge of them - I left the coats where they dropped them, outside the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How far were you from Welch when you first saw him? A.Between twenty and thirty yards; I was gathering some peas in the garden, and saw Welch coming from the hall door - there was a shrub between us, four or five feet high; when I saw Welch again the other man had the coats.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you a view of the person carrying the coats, before the shrubs intercepted your sight? A. Yes, and then he passed nearer to me; it was Welch who was in the garden - I have no doubt about it: the man who got away was different in appearance.</p>

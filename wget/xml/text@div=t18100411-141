On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110068"></xptr>27th of January he came to me and produced the half of a ten pound note; he said he came from my brother in Lamb's buildings, Chiswell street. My brother lives in Lamb's-buildings, he was ill at home; I keep the shop in Redcross-street; when he produced the half of a ten pound note he said that would be a sufficient order for me to pay him four pound; I gave him two one pound notes, ten shillings in silver, and one pound ten shillings in copper. I believed that he came from my brother, and had liberty of taking this money. On the Sunday I saw my brother I shewed him the half of the ten pound note, he said he had not ordered him, nor sent him. I did not see the prisoner again till he was apprehended.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler and soap-boiler.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 27th of January last did you send the prisoner with a half ten-pound note to your sister - A. I did not, nor did I desire him on that day, or at any time to call upon my sister for four pounds in money. I did not know that he was in possession of a half ten pound note; I had not seen him for some time before. This four pound was obtained from my sister without any authority or knowledge of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Slaymaker. Did you take this half of a ten pound note for security of the money - A. I thought my brother had sent him; I believed he had authority from my brother to receive the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him to leave it, or did he leave it of his own accord - A. He gave it me before ever I gave him any money.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EKELSOE. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 13th of March; the prisoner said he had taken the half ten pound note of a Mr. Spring, a builder; I went to Mr. Spring; he told me the ten pound note he paid the prisoner, he wrote the day of the month along with the ten; this half ten pound note is not marked in that way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of working for Mr. Slaymaker, and during that period nothing has been missed, nor has he doubted my honesty.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not in business—I now live at No. 55, Burton-street, Burton-crescent. On the 22nd of Jan., 1846, I was passing from my residence into the city—I met a man in Little Britain, who accosted me—I had never seen him before nor since, to my knowledge—he said, "Sir, I should be very much obliged to you if you would render me a little assist<lb></lb>ance"—I said, "I know nothing of you, and I don't know that you know me"—he induced me to stop, and he told me he had purchased a horse of a man standing on the other side—he induced me to pass from where I was to the place where the prisoner was holding a horse—as soon as I got there the other man said, "This is the man of whom I agreed to purchase this horse, he agreed to let me have it for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I knew a person who wanted a horse; I went to see if I could get him for a purchaser; I returned to this man, and now he refuses to let me have it, saying, 'It is worth 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.' "—I said to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140024"></xptr>
               <p>prisoner, "How is it you don't let him have the horse? it appears to be a fair agreement; he says he has found a purchaser who will take it of him"—the prisoner said, "The horse is worth more, I can't let him have it under 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "This is hardly fair, that you should want to raise him after the agreement," and I was about taking leave of the party and walking off, when the other man said, "Do pray stop, and I will remunerate you for your trouble," and he offered to give me a sovereign—I said, "I have nothing to do with such matters"—I was leaving them, and the prisoner said, "He shall have it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there he stuck for some time—I was about going away again, and the prisoner said, "He shall have it for the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then was about leaving, and the other man said, "For God's sake don't leave me, he will be off from his bargain; do see the money paid"—we went into the back par<lb></lb>lour of a public-house, and there the other man pulled out of his pocket what appeared to be a double handful of sovereigns—I supposed there was more than sufficient to pay for the horse twice over—I supposed there was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he began to count them, and counted about seventeen or eighteen, when the prisoner broke out short and said, "No, he shan't have it, he shan't have it"—I said, "That is very singular," and I was about leav<lb></lb>ing the room, when the prisoner said to me, "I will sell you the horse"—I felt indignant, and said, "I don't want the horse—I have no place for the horse"—the prisoner said, "Indeed, to tell you the truth, this horse is not mine, it belongs to my uncle, a clergyman, living at Barnet, and my uncle and this man have had some falling out, and he would be very angry if he knew I had any dealings with him"—the other man said to me, "If you will advance the money"—I will pay you; there can be no doubt about it; there is the money"—I thought there could be little risk about it, but I said I had not the money about me—he said, "You can obtain the money"—I said, "I have more than the money at home, but I am a considerable distance from home"—he said, "We will take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and go and get it; you can run no risk, I will pay you"—he put the sovereigns into his pocket, and we took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and all three went to my residence, which was then at No. 14, King's-row—we went into my drawing-room, and I was about paying them the money—I left the drawing-room, and brought a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I laid them on the table, and the other man said, "Don't pay the money now, let us return back to Little Britain, to see if the horse is safe there"—I thought that was a very good suggestion, as there were fifty or sixty persons about there—I took up my notes and we all went back in the same <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when we got back to Little Britain, we went into another public-house, not the one we had been in before—we went into a back parlour, and there I gave the prisoner the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—he gathered them up, and kept possession of them—the other man gave me a sovereign—the pri<lb></lb>soner said to me, "If you will follow me, I will give you the horse"—I said to the other man, "If you will follow me, we will see that the thing is complete"—we went though the passage which led into the street—the pri<lb></lb>soner went first, I followed, and the other man, I supposed had followed me, but he had fled, I saw no more of him—the prisoner said, "I deliver the horse into your hand," and the halter was put into my hand—I looked round, supposing the other man was at my side, but could see nothing of him—I then found I had been swindled—the prisoner went away, or ran away, and I was surrounded by persons who said they were City officers—I was obliged to go away with the horse—I afterwards sold it for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

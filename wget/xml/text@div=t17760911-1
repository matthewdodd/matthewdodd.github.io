When I came home on Wednesday the 14th of August I found the stable-doors broke open, and a window which led into the clerk's office, and which had been fastened with an iron bar, had been broke open with great violence. In the clerk's office I had a bureau, which appeared to have been broke open with some instrument; and all the drawers were broke open in my parlour. There was a mahogany cloaths-press, which contained several suits of cloaths, linen, silk stockings, handkerchiefs, and other matters which I cannot perfectly recollect; the contents were all taken away, except one pair of silk stockings, a white handkerchief, and an old suit of mourning. I was on my return from Norfolk the day after my house had been broke open; my clerk was sent to Mr. Hornby's, near Hounslow, to give me information of it, but I did not get to Mr. Hornby's till about nine or ten o'clock that evening, to the best of my remembrance; I returned to town the next day, and then I found my rooms in the situation I have described: I likewise lost some plate, as I was informed by my servants; three table-spoons, three tea-spoons, and a tea-strainer.

               <p>Were all these things left in your house when you went out of town? - Yes: they produced to me likewise a slip of paper, which I conceive to contain a list of houses intended to be broke open, and of some which had been broke open; amongst which my house, I believe, is described, it is, Holborn-row, No 2. straight on from the public; meaning, I suppose, two doors from the public house; my house answers the description, for my stable door, which is the back part of the Row, is No 2. and is the second from the public house; the house having been robbed, as it appears, they have taken a pen and struck through it; that is all I know about it.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Fell: on the 12th of August I remained in the office till about half after seven o'clock; it being then duskish I fastened the window; the next morning I found it broke open: I sleep in the house, but was not again in the office after I had fastened the window, but the maid was: I came down in the morning at half after five o'clock; the first thing I observed was, that my buckles were gone out of my shoes, which I had left on the landing-place of the stairs: I went into the office, and found a bureau that stands there broke open, and all the drawers were pulled out; they had been rummaging among the papers. I observed the sash of the window, which I had fastened over-night, was put up; I examined it, and found they had wrenched off the bar: the pin that fastened it hung in the bar. Mr. Horsefall likewise lay in the house; I called him up, and told him the house was broke open, and then I went backwards, and found both the door that goes into the yard and the stable-door were open; I went into the stable, and found they had broke the outer stable-door open; they had made use of a great deal of force, for the lock was bent entirely back out of the staple, and the door shattered almost to pieces: the lock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110005"></xptr> scarcely hung to the door, it fell off afterwards; they had taken the lock off the inner stable-door, and the door off the hinges, to get it open; I went into the parlour and found every thing broke open that they could get open; there were some locks they could not break open; they had taken a great many of Mr. Fell's cloaths; what they did not take they had thrown about the floor; there were two swords and a hanger belonging to Mr. Fell left upon the chairs; I went down into the kitchen and found they had broke open every lock there; and the butler's pantry was broke open; the maid told me there were some silver table-spoons and tea-spoons gone out of the kitchen. Mr. Fell being out of town, I could not tell what he had lost till he came home.</p>

               <p>(Mr. Fell looks at the spoons.)</p>
               <p>I believe these two are my spoons; the crest is taken out, but they appear to me very clearly to be my spoons.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to swear they are your spoons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>CLARKE. There was ink that had been fresh laid on one of the shirts all over the name; I washed it with soap, which took the ink out, and left Mr. Fell's name very plain.</p>
               <p>Mr. FELL. I can swear that this is my shirt, the mark on the other shirt appears to have been cut out; I have compared it with some of my other shirts, and am satisfied it is mine; I believe the shoes to be mine; the shoemaker who wrote my name in them is present.</p>

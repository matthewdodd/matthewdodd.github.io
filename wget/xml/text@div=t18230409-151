             till then. While my husband was confined in Newgate, I saw Samuel in Petticoat-lane - I knew him before by sight. He acted as a lawyer. He said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Marks, I understand your husband is in trouble. I know the officers who have taken him, and if you have got any money I could settle it." I said, I had no money, but how much did he want. He said he would enquire, and let me know. Next day I was waiting at home with

                  Mary

            ; we were drinking coffee when Samuel came up into the room, and asked to speak with me. I said, he had no occasion to be afraid, for it was Ryan's sister - (Ryan was in Newgate with my husband). He then said, he had seen the officers, and could settle it for 20 l. I said, I had no money, and did not know what to do. He said, it wanted three weeks to the sessions, and perhaps I could get it by then. Next day I went to my husband, and told him. In consequence of having seen my husband, I saw Samuel again, two or three days after, he came to my place. I said, I was getting the money ready as fast as I could; that I had seen my husband, and he was satisfied. I sold my bed, bedstead, drawers, two tables, and a stove for 7 l.; my friends advanced me 3 l.; and 
               <persName id="t18230409-151-person1390">

             gave me 3 l.; I got a coat and breeches from Ryan's son in Newgate, which I pawned for 20 s.; I pawned my wearing apparel for 2 l.; this was all I could raise. Samuel came to me several times. I told him I had got 16 l., and promised if he would take it I would give him the other 4 l. after my husband was discharged. He was to take the whole of the money, and divide it all among the officers, and I was to give him 4 l. to make up the 20 l. He said, he would trust to my generosity to be paid for his trouble afterwards. In the course of conversation, I said, I was not satisfied that he was doing right by me, unless I saw some of the officers. He said, he would soon satisfy me. In the evening I was sitting with Mrs. Ryan; a boy came and said I was wanted at the Three Pigeons, public-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090066"></xptr>Houndsditch. I went there, and and saw Taylor and Samuel. Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"Make yourself happy, for it shall be all right." I asked where the other officers were. He said, they were all under him, and he could satisfy them, for he could do as he liked with them. I drank with them - nothing more passed then. They came down to me once after that, and I was sent for again to the Three Pigeons, and saw Taylor and Samuel in the back parlour alone. They told me to make myself as happy as I could, for I should soon have my husband at home. It then, I believe, wanted about a week to the sessions. After that I saw Samuel almost every day, he told me the bill was to be thrown out; that the sessions began on a Monday, and Tuesday was appointed for the bill to be thrown out. I was to attend Clerkenwell sessions to see they were doing right by me. I attended, and saw Taylor, Samuel, Harris, and Allensby there, all speaking together. I waited in the Court until I heard the bill called out</p>
               <p>"not found against Ryan and Marks;" and when I came down the steps of the Sessions House, Samuel and Taylor took my arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come along home, and get the money." They called a coach. The money was to be given the moment the bill was thrown out. I and Samuel, and his son, and

               <p>"Make yourself happy, for all is right." They asked me to drink. I said I could not, for it was tea time. Taylor called out</p>
               <p>"Tea for six." The landlady asked me to take tea with her, which I did. After tea I went into the back parlour; Taylor and Samuel were drinking - there were other people (strangers) in the room. I bid them good night, and went away. Next night a stranger came to me, saying, I was wanted at one Green's chandler's shop, in Petticoat-lane. Taylor had told me his sister livid there. I went with Mrs. Ryan, and saw Taylor. I said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter" - He said,</p>
               <p>"There is a nice bother with the officers, they are not satisfied, and are going to prefer another bill against your husband." I cried, and said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know what in the world to do, for I have not another shilling in the world to bless myself with." He bid me stop while he looked for Romaine. I stopped near an hour, he never returned. I then went to the Three Pigeons, and saw Taylor and Romaine speaking together. I cried to them, and said, I did not know what I should do, for I was distressed to the utmost. Romaine said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, I will provide you two counsel;" and Taylor said</p>
               <p>"Never mind, when it comes to the Old Bailey I'll try and save your husband." I left them satisfied, and did not see them after. On Sunday morning I was at my place, and somebody said there was a true bill found against my husband. I did not see them again until the day my husband was tried here, I then saw Taylor and Samuel. Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"Make no noise, make no bother, I'll try and save your husband yet." My husband is now in prison. He was tried on the Tuesday after I heard the bill was found, and has never been at liberty since. - (See December Sessions, page 46.) I saw Samuel after the trial, and told him I was very much hurt at his wickedness, and I did not know what to do. He said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, do not say any thing. I'll do any thing in the world to serve you - I'll give you your money back again." After this, an enquiry was made, and I was summoned to Marlborough-street about it. This was a week or a fortnight after my husband was tried. Before I was examined I saw Samuel. He said if I would say what he told me, he would save my husband, and be a witness for me, and told me to say, I gave the officers the money, instead of giving it to him - and I did tell the Justice so.</p>

Yes; I told my friends the whole concern - he sent and came to me, and said he heard I was going to tell the truth, and put him in it, and if I did not do it he would give me 4 l. to prosecute the officers to keep him out of it. He gave me 4 l. in the presence of

               <p>"no bill against Ryan and Marks" - we came down the steps; Taylor took hold of Mrs. Marks with one shoulder and Romaine on the other; a coach was called, we got in with her, Romaine, and his son. Taylor got on the box and rode to the end of Sun-street - got out, and Taylor said</p>
               <p>"I have an acquaintance in Houndsditch who keeps<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090067"></xptr>the Fleur-de-lis, we will meet there" - he went away. I went home to my mother, stopped there two or three minutes, then came and met Marks in Houndsditch, and went with her to the Fleur-de-lis. Romaine was with her when I met her - she shewed me the money in the street in his presence, and when she got inside the door she said</p>
               <p>"Here is the money," and counted 16 l. into Romaine's hands - he called Taylor, and they went into the back parlour together. I staid a minute or two; Romaine and Taylor went out, called for tea, and I went away; another bill was found, and my brother is transported for life. There was an enquiry about it before the Magistrate afterwards, and Romaine said if I would say what he told me he would regain my brother's liberty, for it was not too late, and he would be an evidence against the officers - he told me to say the money was paid into Taylor's hands instead of his, and by saying that one word, I need not fret, for it would regain by brother's liberty. I did say so, it was not true, but I would have said any thing else to regain my brother's liberty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Can you tell me the day of the month on which the money was paid - No. I never said it was on the 20th to my recollection.</p>

               <p>"Good God, what shall I do, I have spent all my money." Taylor said at Green's there was the devil to pay - that there was not money enough for the officer, and they were going to file another bill - he left Mrs. Marks and I in the shop together for a quarter of an hour, telling her he would go to look for Romaine - we stopped half an hour, and as he did not come we went to the Three Pigeons, and found him and Romaine together. Mrs. Marks cried and said</p>

            . My pocket was picked in Pall-Mall.

Taylor is a constable of Clerkenwell; he collared the man who robbed me; he was at the door of the Grand Jury room with me. I was called in first; we were all four at the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Green Man, on Finchley-common. On Saturday, the 9th of April. I was standing outside my door, between six and seven o'clock, and observed a wagon coming down the hill from Lon<lb></lb>don, with four horses in it, and laden with sacks of soot—I did not see the driver at the time—I saw a lad lying down on the sacks in the wagen—the horses, in coming down the hill, got one of the traces unbooked—the lad at the top looked over the side, and attempted to get off, am I sup<lb></lb>posed, to hook the trace on—in doing so, he fell from the shaft to the ground—he did not attempt to jump off, but came along the sacks very carefully, and got down on the shaft of the wagon, and sat down there—he then gave a spring off, and missed his footing, I belive, and fell back<lb></lb>wards to the ground—the fore wheel ran over his leg—he gave a sudden twist, and put his head under the hind wheel, which went over his head and leg too—it killed him instantly—he never moved after—I had not seen the wagoner at that time—I saw him an hour or an hour and a half afterwards—I got George Collins to help me to take the deccassed into my house, and I went for Mr. White, the surgeon, who came in ten minutes—the deceased's head was squeezed quite flat—Mr. White put his had toge<lb></lb>ther and put his hat on to keep it in from—the leg was nearly served from his body—it hung by a small sinew—the wagon belonged to a Mr. Titmus—the driver passed about this time; but I was engaged with the deceased, and did not see him—the driver was not sober—he was certainly the worse for liquor—I saw him again that evening, and hour or two after<lb></lb>wards—I had not noticed him before; but the prisoner is the man who came back as the driver—he had been to put his team up.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the wagon heavily laden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I should consider it a heavy load—there were four very powerful horses—it was exactly on the top the hill when I first saw it—the driver was not by the side of the wagon then—the speed increased in coming down the hill—the load forced the horses on—I did not see the wagon stopped, being engaged with the man—if he had not attempted to get down and fasten the trace, no accident would have occurred—on of the men in my stables called to him not to get down; but he did—it was in consequence of his doing so, and missing his footing, that the accident happened—the horses had not run away, or any thing of that sort—when the prisoner came back, after putting his team up, I showed him the body of the deceased—he was dreadfully affected, and could not stand; in fact, he fell back into the kitchen, next to the room where the man was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Lincoln, a gardener at Finch<lb></lb>ley On Saturday evening, the 9th of April, a little before seven o'clock, I was on the road by Finchley-common—I saw several wagons on the road, going towards Finchley—I came by the side of them a long way—they came very steadily along about three parts of the way; then one the drivers whipped his horses, as I suppose, to pass the other team which was before him—there were four or five in a line—the horses started off directly, and I saw a trace-chain hanging on the ground—I saw somebody on the top of the wagon, lying across the sacks—I did not see any thing happen to him—I had not got up to the spot—I believe the prisoner was the driver; but I cannot swear to him—I told him I was fearful he would have an accident as the chain was undone—he made no answer—he ap<lb></lb>peared tipsy—the wagon went on—I did not see the boy who was on</p>

Q.</hi> Was it at the foot of the hill you first saw the four or five teams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was some distance I came to the brow of the hill—they were going very slowly along till the driver whipped the horses—I think that was the second team, but I am not sure—I should think three teams might go a-breast on the road—I did not see any body in the road—there is a foot-path—I cannot say whether it was in consequence of the trace becoming loose that the horses started off—the wagon passed the driver directly the horse started off—he followed it directly—the horses did not stop—the other wagons appeared to be loaded with soot.</p>

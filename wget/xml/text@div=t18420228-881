                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Turnham-green, in the parish of Chiswick. I had a pony gelding, about thirteen hands which I saw safe in my stable about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day on the 8th of February—I missed it about nine or ten next morning—the stable is in the corner of a garden, and you have to go through a field, then through the garden, and through a chaise-house, to get to it—the field gate was locked, the stable was not—my boy attends to my pony—I did not examine the gate myself—I saw the pony again at the station in Smith</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 284.) On Wednesday, the 19th of February, I was in Smithfield—the prisoner was brought to me by a man who said he had bought the pony of him for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the pony was with them—he came to me that I might see he had bought it fairly—that is not an uncommon thing in Smithfield—I asked the prisoner where he got the pony from, thinking it was a very low price—he said his master had sent him with it—I asked who his master was—he said, "Mr. Draper, of Turnham-green, opposite the White Hart"—I told him I must take him to the station—he said, "Very well"—I took him there, and the pony was left at the Greyhound-yard stables, near the station—I then proceeded to Turnham-green—I found a Mr. Draper there, but he knew nothing of the prisoner—as I was taking the prisoner next morning before the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate, he said he should not have taken it without the prosecutor's son had asked him to do it, and showed him how to undo the stable-door; that he was to take it to London and sell it, bring back the money, and he would give the prisoner part of it.</p>

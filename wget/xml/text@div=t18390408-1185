I am a painter and glazier, and live in Shepherd-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—I keep the whole house—the prisoner was my servant for four months, and left on the 30th of January—about the 25th of February she applied to me for a character. On the 1st of March when I came down stairs at six o'clock in the morning I found my workmen in the house—I made inquiry of them how they got in, as I had not let them in—I sent for a constable, and on going over the house I missed the pro<lb></lb>perty stated, from various parts of the house—some from the room the prisoner had slept in, and some from my sister's room—I had seen the silver spoons, spectacles, and eye-glass the night before—we had three keys be<lb></lb>longing to the door, which hung in a secret place in the day time, and one of those keys were missing after the 25th, when the prisoner came for a character—I had the highest opinion of her.</p>

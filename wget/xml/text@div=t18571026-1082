                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; we live in Bethnal Green. On 18th Sept. I was in bed; my husband was at work—it was between 2 and 3 o'clock—we had had words the previous day—he had been wandering about the place—he has been bad in his bead several times—I did not think he was so bad as he was—I had hit him with a broom, and he turned away—on that morning he cut me a little—I was in bed; he was standing at his bench—I aggravated him—he came to the bed side, and took hold of me, and I did the same to him—he gave me one or two small cuts; I believe it was an accident—I consider I was the worst of the two—he was a very kind man, and very affectionate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Ebury-street, Pimlico. On Saturday night, 21st August, the prisoner came to my shop about 9 o'clock—I served her with a quartern loaf, the price of it was sixpence—she gave me a shilling; I gave her sixpence change, and she left—I put the shilling which she gave me in a bowl in my till—there were sixpences and a half-crown, but no other shilling there—the prisoner came again in a quarter-of-an-hour—I then served her with half a-pound of seed-cake; the price of that was 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling; I put that in the same bowl with the other, and gave her 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—she left, and came back in 5 or 6 minutes afterwards for half-a-pound of seed-cake, the same as before—she gave me a shilling; I gave her 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put that shilling in the same place with the others—after she had left on the last occasion I examined the shillings in the bowl, and found they were bad—no other person served in the shop but myself on that evening—I am sure I put the three shillings in that bowl that I had received from the prisoner—when I found the shillings were bad I wrapped them in paper, and put them in a drawer in the parlour, which I locked—I gave them to the constable on the Tuesday—I am sure they were the same shillings I had of the prisoner—the prisoner came again on the Tuesday afternoon between 5 and 6 o'clock—I saw her come in, and I recognised her—she asked for a half-quartern loaf—I served her; it came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling; I tried it with my teeth, I bent it and found it was bad—I said, "It is a bad one," and I gave it her back—I said she had brought three bad shillings on the Saturday night—she said she never did—I said, yes she did—she said she would go and send her husband—she left the shop taking the bad shilling with her—I went after her and she was given in custody—I went to the station and there charged her</p>

I took the prisoner in custody on Tuesday night, 24th August—I took one shilling from her hand at the station—I received these three shillings from Mr. Fey at the station—before he marked the shillings the prisoner said they were old ones, not new ones—two of these are of 1846, and one is 1844—as I was taking the prisoner to the station she said she did not pass him the money on the Saturday, she had not been in the shop—the next morning in going to the court she told me she did not pass any shillings, they were half-crowns that she had; that her husband gave her four half-crowns on Saturday, and she had not passed any shillings at Mr. Fey's.</p>

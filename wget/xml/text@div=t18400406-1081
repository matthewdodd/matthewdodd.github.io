                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Kenrick, of Brook Green farm, Hendon. On the 13th of March I was employed at the Ox<lb></lb>gate farm, belonging to Mr. Kenrick—I loaded a load of hay on the cart at five o'clock in the evening—Weston was in the employ of Mr. Kenrick, and pitched me that load of hay—I backed the cart In the shed after bind<lb></lb>ing it, and between eight and nine o'clock I went to the shed and saw the cart there, and found a truss of hay above the ropes that I had bound on the load—I had not put that truss on the cart—I also found a sack of beans about the middle of the load of hay, close under the truss—I went to London and informed my master—Giles, who was in Mr. Kenrick's employ, went back with me—I showed him the cart—I saw that cart about three o'clock the following day—Weston had it—he was starting to go to Lon<lb></lb>don—I walked behind and followed it—Weston stopped opposite the watering-trough at the Cock public-house at Kilburn, and I stopped—I heard the rattle of some beans, but was not close enough to see any thing—Giles walked on—Weston was with the cart then—it stopped there eight or ten minutes—I was not close enough to see if Weston went on with it or not—I suppose he did—I was behind the cart a little distance—he did not come back and meet me—I saw a truss of hay lying on the ground near the water-trough—I searched and found a sack con<lb></lb>taining some beans placed under the gateway leading to the yard of the Cock public-house—I staid by the property till a policeman and Giles came—the beans in the sack were of the same kind as my master's—it was the same sack that I had seen the evening before—the hay that I found at the watering-trough was the same quality as my master's.</p>

Ridgway came town, and I went to the Oxgate farm—I saw the cart, and found a turss of hay on the top, and a sack with about two bushels of beans—I made a mark on the sack—Weston came to the ears after I left it, and I saw him coming down the lane with it—Ridgway and I then followed him to the Cock public-house at Kilburn—when I heard the cart stop I walked on, and when I got opposite the cart, about seven yards from it, I turned round—I saw Weston get on the cart, and put down the hay and beats—he then got down, took the beans, and carried them under the gateway eight or nine yards off—he then went to his horses and went on towards London—waited about an hour and a quarter, and then I taw a policeman with Miller in custody, and the hay and beans—I went to the station-house, and then went on to my master's and gave information—this is the sack that I saw—here are three marks which I made on it with my knife.</p>

I was on duty at kilburn—the two witnesses pointed out to me the hay and beans—I watched and saw Miller come and take up the sack of beans an carry them into the Cock public-house yard; as soon as he saw me he dropped them—I walked up to him and asked what he had dropped there—he said "Nothing," I said I saw him drop a sack with beans in it, and then he said he had dropped it—I asked him what he was going to do with them, he said he did not know—I believe he is a labourer—I took him to the station-house, then went to the prosecutor's yard, in Oxford-street, where I saw Weston loading a cart with manure; his master gave him into custody and told him it was for leaving hay and beans at the Cook public-house—he said he left it there to bait his horses on returning back to the farm—he had three horses in his cart—I found five pecks and three-quarters of beans in the sack.</p>

Weston and his wife lived at Oxgate farm, he had the care of the premises, and all the things there were under his care—he came on the day stated to Oxford-street, from Oxgate farm, which is five miles from town—the horses are never baited on the road—they are baited and watered in town for two or three hours while the men unload the cart and load the manure—Weston had no right or authority from me to take beans or hay from my farm under pretence of baiting the horses on the road—he came to my yard that morning about five minutes past five o'clock—the policeman afterwards came and told me what he had been doing—I took him to Weston, and said "Weston, how could you for shame of yourself, after I have trusted you with all my property, rob me?" he said he had not robbed me—I said, "What did you do with the</p>

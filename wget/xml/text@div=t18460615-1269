                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Norton, of James-street, Bolton-terrace, Camden-down. I have known the prisoner five or six years—on the 23rd of May, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in the City of Hereford public-house, Union-street—I called for a pint of beer—the prisoner was there, and asked me very kindly to have a drop of beer—I said, "No, thank you, I don't feel very well"—he was very tipsy—I was talking to the landlady—he asked me to have a bit of supper—in about a quarter of an hour he went out and brought in some pork, and gave me a bit on some bread—up to that time we were quite peaceable together—I then asked a man if he would take a piece of pork—the man got up and took the greater portion of it—I do not know his name, but had often seen him with the prisoner—his taking too much appeared to provoke the prisoner—I cannot say whether the prisoner sat next to me, but he was very close to me—I received a blow on my back, on my left side, five or ten minutes after the man took the pork—I cannot say who did it—it bled—I was taken to a doctor and then to the Hospital, from which I was discharged last Tuesday—I am well now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Hereford—I saw Mrs. Norton and the prisoner there between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—the prisoner went out and fetched some meat and asked her to have some sapper—he sat by her side and she asked him to have some—he said, "No"—she told him to go after his wh----s—he then took a knife which laid on the table close to him—they had been eating with it—he said, "You b----y b——h, I will stab you," and stabbed her with it in the left side—she bled—I took the knife out of hit hand and put it on the table—the prisoner took her in his arms and said, "Let me look at the wound"—I took her to a chemist's shop—the knife produced is the same—she only had one cut.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> They had been sitting some time together in a friendly way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking—I did not hear him say, "I hope I have not hurt you"—he might have said so—I did not observe the knife in his hand before—Norton was close to him.</p>

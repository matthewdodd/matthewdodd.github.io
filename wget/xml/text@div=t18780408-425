I was called and the prisoner was given into my charge—he said that he bought the note and another party filled it in for him—I took him to the station and found on him another advance note, signed J. Cowell, Master, and dated 23rd March, payable to the order of James McDonald—I also found an old advance note upon him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I had seen the gentleman who gave me the note two or three times before. He asked me if I was in want of a ship and if I had my certificate in my pocket. I showed it to him, and he said "I can give you half a month's advance now. "He did so, and I took it to a man who said he believed it was forged. I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission, and I have never received my certificate and papers since they were taken from me at the police-station. I have been six years in one employ, and was chief engineer of the Gresham in 1874.</p>

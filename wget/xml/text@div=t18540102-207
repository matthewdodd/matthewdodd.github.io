I am an inmate of the Queen's-ward, Greenwich Hospital On 22nd Dec., between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, I was at the Royal Hospital public house; there were twenty or thirty people there—I was going to pay for a pot of beer, and took out a bag, with a little purse inside it, containing half a crown and two sovereigns—as I had it between my knees some person's hand came over my shoulder, tore it right away, and then threw the little bag to the other side of the room—I did not see who it was, I only saw the hand—I do not know the prisoner—I saw my money safe in the bag at the time.</p>

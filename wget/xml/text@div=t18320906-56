On the 11th of July the prisoner came there for a night's lodging; he slept in the same room with me, but in a separate bed - I got up about six o'clock the next morning, and left my trousers, waistcoat, and braces on the top of my bed; I left him in bed - I went to the room in an hour and a half, and missed the property; he was then gone; I overtook him in the layers in the Liverpoolroad - I said, "You have got my clothes;" he pulled them out of his hat, threw them down, and asked me to let him go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is this a kind of lodging-house? A. Yes; I cannot exactly swear the prisoner is the person I saw in bed - I cannot swear to these clothes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You missed your trousers, waistcoat, and braces? A. Yes; and they were found in the prisoner's hat - I believe them to be mine, but I cannot swear to them, nor say that the prisoner is the man; I have not seen him since; I was cleaning the parlour when he went out, and I took him between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

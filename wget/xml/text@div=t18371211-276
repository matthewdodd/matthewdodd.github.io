                  </hi>. I am mate of the brig <hi rend="italic">Robinson,</hi> at Greenwich. On Saturday night, the 10th of December, I was in the Shakspeare, inquiring for a bed—the prisoner asked me if I would go with her—I told her I was married, I did not want to go with her—I wished to go to a private bed, as I was in trouble in consequence of my brother's death—she said she had a good fire, and I might be quiet there—I asked if there was a pen and ink, she said, "Yes"—I went with her, and she had no ink—I put my watch on the table, and went to bed, and left her sitting by the fire—in two or three hours I went to get up, and my watch was gone—she awoke me by coming to bed; I got up immediately and the watch was gone—I asked her where my watch was—she said she could not tell me—I then went to get my clothes on, and my money was gone—I asked her about it, and if she was in need—she said she knew nothing about it—I opened the door and called the policeman—I do not know whether any one else had been in the room—I did not see any one but her—I left her in charge of all my property—I do not know whether she went out while I was asleep—the watch is not found—I valued it, as I had it ever since I was a little boy—it was about three hours after I went to bed, by the officers account, that I was awoke by her coming to bed.</p>

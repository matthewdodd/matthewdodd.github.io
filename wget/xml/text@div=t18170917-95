On Saturday the 16th of August, at nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was at my house; I shut up at twelve o'clock - He and several more staid in the house until I began to clear it, and fastened one of the doors which leads into Hare-street - both doors go into the same passage;-next morning I missed the barrel of spruce beer out of the passage. About three days after the prisoner came to my house again, and said I had been giving him a bad character, as I had reported that he took the peppermint away - I told him it was Dantzic spruce. He said it should be made good; I asked him how his breeches got stained, he said he had been drinking spruce. I told him I thought it was mine, and gave him in charge.</p>

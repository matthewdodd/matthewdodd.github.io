               <p>Q. Tell us, distinctly and slowly, when you got to the house, what you did? - A. Between nine and ten o'clock we entered the house of the King's-arms; when I went in, there were a great many people in the tap-room, and hearing a fiddle playing up one pair of stairs, myself, and several more, went up through the tap-room; Miller, and

               <p>Q. Before you coupled them together, did you say any thing about any warrant that you had? - A. Miller had it in his hand, and read it to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he read it in such a way as the persons in the room could hear it? - A. I was so very busy that I cannot say whether they heard it or not, I heard it.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went into the room, how were they employed? - A. Some dancing, and the fiddle playing; then I followed two prisoners down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. They were persons that you had coupled together? - A. Yes; and in going out at the street-door, I saw an opposite door open, but I, and two others, went and told them to shut the door; the door was then shut, and upon turning on my left-hand, to go up the street, I saw one of the prisoners at the bar, Timothy Brian, with a stick, making a blow at me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body see Limerick? - A. No, he was behind our backs; we tried then to get Brian up, but could not get him up, and we were afraid of losing the people we had made prisoners; we went after them, and brought them to the corner of New Compton-street, Broad-street, St. Giles's.</p>

Yes, they were; I went with them as far as New Compton-street, I left them in care of other people, and then returned again; and, in returning back, William Smith, Cockin, and myself, I was not gone ten minutes in coming back, I saw one of our people, Birch, coming back again with his head tied up, and without a hat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you had left the house? - A. It might be better than ten minutes; Birch said, for God's sake go back, for there is murder being committed; we then made all the haste we possibly could, till we came to the corner of Maynard-street again; then we saw

               <p>Q. At the time you apprehended him, did he say any thing? - A. He said something in Irish, and the other man can explain it when he is called upon; he was flourishing it, and hopping upon his left leg, and bleeding at that time; I conducted him towards the Eight Bells, in Denmark-street, towards the watch-house; I left him in custody of the other officers, in Denmark-street, near the Eight Bells, and then I went towards Bow-street; and in King-street, Grant, the deceased, was being led by two officers.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was Grant at that time? - A. He said, oh Lord, oh Lord, go back for God Almighty's sake, for he was a dead man, and there was murder being committed; I then went back with Smith and Cockin to Maynard-street, to the King's-arms; the first thing I saw was Ravenhill, one of our officers, sitting in a chair by the fire, and the blood was making a clean breach out of him like water; I went backwards, and there I saw Beresford, the officer, lying bleeding, insensible; then we got a coach for Beresford, and the other walked.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Brian first attacked you, did he say any thing at all what it was for? - A. No, he did not say a single word; and the second time when he was apprehended, he said, oh Lord, oh Lord, I am bleeding, and he did bleed all over my coat.</p>

Upon your oath have you never said that the deceased received the fatal would on the stairs, between the room above and the room below? - A.

               <p>Q. Was that at the time you had these people in custody, and were conducting them to the watch-house? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that man do? - A. He attempted to knock me down with a shovel, (producing a large shovel); I prevented the blow with my stick, and stepping back, something took me off my legs, and I thought he had knocked me down; I got up immediately, and he was making a blow at Jones with the same shovel; I then caught the shovel with the hook of my stick, and then I caught it in my hand; I struck the man upon the arm 
several times, and then at last he let it go all of a sudden, and, by getting hold of the shovel in a hurry, I fell down again.</p>


               <p>Q. It was slippery, frosty weather? - A. It was very slippery; when I got up again, I had the shovel in my hand, and the man was gone.</p>

            , and another person, Townsend, I believe his name was.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time this passed, and you overcame him, and gave him this beating, did Brian say any thing at all? - A. He said something in Irish, but I did not understand him; then I went down near St. Giles's church, to see that those other people we had sent out before were gone safe along.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far was this house, the King's arms, from St. Giles's church? - A. I cannot say, I am so little acquainted with that part of the town; upon my return from St. Giles's church, I met Brian again, with this stick in his hand,(producing another), in Maynard-street, about ten or fifteen yards from the King's-arms; he was brandishing it about, and was going to strike us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time? - A. Yes, in the same sort of language; he said it plainer then than he did before, but what it was I cannot tell; I seized him directly, and took this stick away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What space of time was there between his going out with Jones, and coming back again to Maynard-street? - A. Not more than ten or fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see any cutlass that he had? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blood? - A. Yes, there was blood upon him, the blood ran down his jacket, he had a white jacket on; I then took him, and lodged him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that go back to the King's-arms? - A. No; after I had secured him in the watch-house, I went to Bow-street, and saw Grant led into the

               <p>Q. It was the day after Christmas day? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go in with your constables staves in your hands? - A. No; when we got in, somebody called out draw your cutlasses.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you draw your cutlasses? - A. Going up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the other cutlasses drawn upon the stairs? - A. I saw several as soon as I got up into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a constable's staff? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other constables staves with them? - A. There might be for ought I know, I did not see one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not every one of you cutlasses? - A. I believe they had.</p>
               <p>Q. There were all your patrole there, were there not? - A. I do not know, there are a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet before you went? - A. At the Brown Bear.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you not all armed with cutlasses? - A. I dare say they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any one of them have a constable's staff? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I take it, if all the officers had constable's staves in their hands, you must have seen it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Or if any number of them had? - A. I should suppose so, but I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately upon your coming into the house, you and the other officers, you drew your swords? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment you went into the room, you endeavoured to apprehend them, without saying any thing of course? - A. Miller said a great deal to them; he was talking, I suppose, for the space of five minutes with different people.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any paper in the hand of any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I went with my brother officers to Maynard-street: I saw Brian capering upon one leg, when we first saw him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that after the fray happened or before? - A. After; he had a white-thorn stick half way in his hand; and he said, horroo, for the bloody Sarsenegs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the meaning of that word? - A. I have been in company with Irish people, a great many times, and I understand that Sarseneg means an Englishman.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that stick, and of him? - A. He was taken to the watch-house, and Smith wrenched the stick out of his hand; I went as far as Cross-street with them, and then Jones and me came back again to the house; the mischief was all done then, and the people were bleeding.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the people, that were there bleeding, your officers? - A. Yes; Grant was gone; there was only Ravenhill and Beresford there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At the time when you heard this expression, that you speak so correctly to-day, it was after he had been a good deal beat? - A. I did not see him beat; he had some blood upon his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn any other Irish expressions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that is the meaning of the word Sarseneg? - A. I only go by information that that is the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear the meaning of it? - A. On the 26th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. On this very occasion? - A. Yes; and I have heard it before; I have worked with Irish people.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether this is a Welch word or Irish? - A. I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable of St. Clement's: I went, with the other officers, to the King's-arms public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Grant one that went with you? - A. Duncan Grant and I went together; he was one of the captains of the patrol; we went, and I saw Miller read the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Miller read the warrant? - A. He read it in the back-parlour, at the Brown Bear, before we went; I never was inside of the door of the club-room at all; I went through the tap-room up one pair of stairs; and just before I went into the room, somebody said, take care of Kennedy, meaning the poker; when I went into the taproom, I took a large pair of tongs, and a stick, and went up stairs, and Grant with me, and Cockin; as soon as we got up stairs, two people were brought out, by Kit Jones, for us to take to St. Giles's watch-house, they were delivered to me, Grant, and Cockin; we took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take them through the taproom? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all quiet there at that time? - A. I saw nothing amiss in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might be in the tap-room at that time? - A. I do not recollect whether there were any or not, for I rather think they were frightened, and gone away; the tap-room was very clear when we came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Grant go with you to the watch-house? - A. Yes; then Grant said, I think we had better go back, and see after our brother officers; accordingly we did go back; just as we got to the corner of Maynard-street, we heard a terrible riot, fighting, and knocking about, in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the house when you heard that noise? - A. About as far as from here to that gallery; Grant said, they are fighting, we had better go in; says I, I will not part with you you may depend upon it; Grant brushed into the tap-room directly; I was going to follow him directly, and was cut right down the head.</p>
               <p>Q. With what? - A. I cannot say; I saw a long cutlass, fluted all the way, and turned up at the end; one man said to me, b-st me, or something like it, I can't be positive to the word, what you have come again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that person was? - A. I think Sullivan, but I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at Sullivan? - A. I think he is the man, but I cannot swear it; I saw Brian, he stood next to the bar, where the light was, and Sullivan next to him, that was the way that I saw the cutlass; I was at that moment beat back into the passage; as soon as I had got half-way out at the door to get into the passage, somebody came behind me and beat me most unmercifully, and got me down; I then began to fight and clear my way, and somebody caught hold of the cutlass which I had in my hand, from behind me, I drew it through his hand, and recovered it, and kept it; immediately as I had done that, I had a cut come across my fingers, which broke the guard of my cutlass; I then made my way into the tap-room again, I got into the room, and there I saw Grant lay; somebody came behind me, and cut me across my wrist and my arm, I do not know who did it; I said to Grant, I was sorry to see him lay there, I would help him if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. It broke your arm, did it not? - A. Yes, in two places; it cut the bone through.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080018"></xptr>Q. How long had you parted with Grant before you saw him in that condition? - A. The whole was not above five or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did these people chiefly consist of the patrol, or the persons you found there originally? - A. There were more of these people than of our party, because we were weakened by some going away; they were mostly strangers, and were fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Grant parted from you? - A. He was hustled by the people in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between that and your seeing him again? - A. It could not be above five minutes; if it had, I do not think I should have lived myself, I bled to that degree.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You say you are sure you saw Brian and Sullivan in the room upon your return? - A. Yes; but I cannot swear that they struck me; and there was a short man with them in a brown jacket which I laid hold of, but he was rescued from me.</p>
               <p>Q. When Brian was standing next the candle, how far was that from where the deceased was knocked down? - A. About as far as from here to where that gentleman sits. (Pointing to the shorthand writer).</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw the cutlass in somebody's hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you observed Brian and Sullivan, did you see a cutlass in their hands at all? - A. I did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons besides the officers that had a cutlass? - A. Not that I observed; I had enough to do in the confusion, for my hat was pulled over my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who pulled your hat over your eyes? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. The officers had cutlusses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cutlass that you saw by the light, a cutlass of the same sort with those of the officers? - A. No; it was larger, and longer a great deal; I thought it was a recruiting-officer's cutlass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do I understand you right that there was a disturbance in the house? - A. Yes; the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Brian and Sullivan were standing in the room, what part of the room? - A. Brian stood against the bar, and Sullivan next to him, and that short man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a fire-place in the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they near the fire-place? - A. No, they were the other side of the room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Grant had been to the watch-house, and upon your return to the tap-room, you saw nobody at all in custody? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Upon your oath, was there not any body in custody at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the tap-room, was the prisoners, Sullivan and Brian, in custody at that time? - A. Not to my knowledge; I am almost confident they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other officers in the tap-room when you came in? - A. Two or three more.</p>
               <p>Q. You all had cutlasses? - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the deceased? - A. His head lay towards the wainscot of the tap-room, and his feet towards the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any of the officers were upon the stairs then? - A. No.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you see any below stairs afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any cutlasses in the hands of any but officers? - A. I cannot say that I did; I had enough to do to keep the blood out of my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw this sword before you were struck? - A. No; I saw the stroke of a cutlass at me, but I cannot say who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner, Sullivan, was taken into custody? - A. Yes, and made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your warrant to apprehend rogues and vagrants? - A. We went to take all idle and disorderly persons, and deserters; so, I suppose, the warrant said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the warrant read to you? - A. Yes; in the back room at the Brown Bear.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you one that accompanied Miller up stairs? - A. Yes; but I did not go into the clubroom.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Sullivan dressed? - A. He had a blue coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not a blue livery coat - do you not know he is servant to the Countess of Antrim? - A. I do not know, I have understood so since; I think, when I went in, he asked me how I did, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had he a blue coat on? - A. He had.</p>

I do not recollect seeing any other man there but myself; there were some other officers up stairs; Brian came in without any stick in his hand, and bleeding; and said, where is the bloody thieves, where are they all; he directly turned round and went out of the tap-room; he had been gone out but a very few minutes before there were a dozen or fourteen men came in, with bludgeons and cutlasses; I ran before them, and went up stairs into the club-room to Miller, and some other officers; I desired Miller to come down stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Of these twelve or fourteen men, can you be sure whether any of them were officers? - A. I am sure they were not; Miller and I came down to the foot of the stairs, and I was no sooner at the foot of the stairs before my hat was pulled over my face, and I was pulled on the ground; I received a violent blow with a stick, or some weapon, over my shoulders, and was trampled upon by the people.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Grant at that time? - A. I saw him laying with his head towards the door-way as you go out of the tap-room, and his two knees up towards his face; I went towards him, and pulled a pistol out of my pocket, and said, the first man that attempted to come in doors I would shoot him, there was a mob of them at the door then; that is all I know of it.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time the disturbance commenced, were there many of them sent off? - A. Yes, the major part of them, I believe, were gone; when I came down stairs into the tap-room, there were a great number of people fighting and cutting at our patrole.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say cutting, did you discover any weapons they were using? - A. Cutlasses and bludgeons; I drew my cutlass when I got to the bottom of the stairs; I then saw Grant on his legs, standing, with his head very much cut, and leaning forward; after I came down, he received a violent cut with a cutlass; I saw the blow struck, for I was as close to the deceased as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who struck him? - A. I am not positive, but, to the best of my recollection, it was Sullivan; it was a tall man, in a blue coat.</p>

             at the time that Grant received the blow which brought him to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. That blow was upon the shoulder? - A. Yes; he fell upon his back, and drew his knees up, and said, mercy, mercy, oh Lord, I am murdered! but, before he had well uttered the words, the prisoner, Patrick Holland, stooped, and made a blow at him over his legs or thighs, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. With what did he strike this blow at his legs? - A. It was with a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see at that time whether the blow took effect or not? - A. The man was lying upon his back, as I was endeavouring to defend the other Irishman off from him, it did strike him, and I had my cutlass in my hand, and cut him over the face, which he bears the mark of now; upon that, after I had struck the blow at Holland, Donohough came up, and pulled my hat over my face, and bound me down, and at that time my cutlass was wrenched out of my hand; I had two slight cuts in my face by a cutlass; I had several blows with sticks, till I was senseless for a short time, and when I recovered myself, I found all the Irishmen, who had been fighting against us, gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the deceased been removed before he recovered? - A. He was removed; there was not a man left in the place but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Duncan Grant? - A. Not till I saw him in St. George's hospital, I think, the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. He died in the hospital, I believe, on the 22d of January? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You called this a cock and hen club; most clubs have regular meetings; you do not know whether they had ever met before or not? - A. I did not understand that it was a regular club, it was a club where they paid sixpence a-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I saw the money in the plate.</p>

               <p>Q. Then how do you know they ever met before? - A. I have been told so.</p>

I always said, from the very first of it, that I should know the man who cut Grant when he was down.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you always said too that you should know the two other persons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you never could have said, that you could not identify either of the persons? - A I never said any such thing that I know of.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. And you never said, before the Coroner, that you could not? - </p>
               <p>Court. He says this: before the Coroner, the deponent cannot take upon him to identify any of the persons who beat the deceased, or cut him with bludgeons and cutlasses, at that time; but that he could always know the person who cut him when he was down if he saw him again.</p>

There was only one man that remained in the house, he was in custody, and I stood by him, he and a woman were tied together with a handkerchief; when they found they were coming, the man made an attempt to unloose himself, I was paying attention to him when they rushed in; there came then two sticks over my head as fast as they could pelt, and in falling, the man that I stood by, knocked the staff out of my hand, and got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after he got away that this accident happened to the deceased? - A. Yes, as I understood, for I was insensible; I never saw Grant at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, after they came in, they had nobody to liberate, for the man and woman had liberated themselves? - A. Yes, when I was knocked down.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the Bow-street officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when this mischief happened to Grant? - A. I was up stairs; I came down upon hearing the noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to point out any of the people who committed this injury? - A. Yes, Sullivan; the man in the blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to speak positively, or only as to belief? - A. Positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the time that these people were attacking the officers? - A. When I came down stairs, there was Sullivan in the tap-room, I had known him before that; I heard a great noise of cutting, and sticks going backwards and forwards; I went to go into the passage, and, from some person on my left-hand, I received a blow with the point of a stick upon my collar-bone; I immediately afterwards received a shove, from some person behind me, across the tap-room against the table; I had my cutlass at the time in my hand; in that situation, I received a violent blow upon the left-side of my head, which cut me to the bone.</p>
               <p>Q. From a stick, or a sharp instrument? - A. From a stick, I believe; I was stunned, and my cutlass was then taken from me; after that I received two cuts with a sharp instrument on the top of my head, and two afterwards upon my shoulder to the bone pretty near.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you retain your senses, or lose them? - A. When my blood began to run pretty freely from me I began to recover, and I supported myself upon one hand; as soon as I was recovered, I saw Grant lying upon the floor, near the fender, or on the fender, I cannot tell which; he lifed up his hand, and said, Ravenhill, help me, I am murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. He was afterwards conveyed away to the hospital? - A. Yes; I was too much hurt to be able to assist him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you came down stairs, you saw Sullivan in the tap-room? - A. Yes; and two men standing behind him.</p>

               <p>Q. He had been in custody? - A. Not that I knew of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room with Miller? - A. My situation was at the top of the stairs; Miller went in first.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the room, what did you see Miller do? - A. I was not in the room, my business was to keep the stairs clear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At the time this riot commenced, how many were there in custody? - A. There were about eighteen sent away.</p>
               <p>Q. How many remained? - A. Only the women.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where were the women in custody? - A. In a little room, on the right-hand of the stairs, by themselves; they were there till the men were gone.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was at the Ship, in Bainbridge-street, on St. Stephen's-day, at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the King's-arms, in Maynard-street? - A. I believe it is about a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Sullivan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him that evening, when you were at the Ship, in Bainbridge-street? - A. To the best of my knowledge he came in there.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has worked, occasionally, for you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe, when he came in, whether he had any thing in his hand? - A. Yes; he had a hanger in one hand, and, I believe, some kind of stick in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - A. Not a word, it was momentary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other persons there that Sullivan spoke to? - A. I do not know that he directed his discourse to any body in particular; he said, what do you stand there for, and see people cut to pieces, or something similar to that; to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Holland, or Berry? - A. I know their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the public-house when he came in and made use of this expression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went out, what became of Berry and Holland? - A. Berry, if any body was to say he went as far as the scene of action I would not believe them, for he returned directly; Holland followed Sullivan, I believe; I think he did, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Holland come back again? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was Holland when he came back again? - A. That is a critical thing.</p>
               <p>Q. No, it is not; you must speak the truth. -Upon your oath, in what condition was Holland when he came in again to that public-house? - A. A man that I take to be Holland returned with his face all over blood, and a cutlass in each hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be gone? - A. I suppose, about a quarter of an hour; I did not know that it was him in the condition he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his face afterwards washed? - A. It appeared so, the blood was wiped off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then know the man? - A. It was Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any harm done to his face? - A. It appeared to me there was a cut across his nose, or face, or some part thereof.</p>
               <p>Q. And that man was Holland? - A. It might be the same man that was bloody for any thing I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any officer there? - A. I do not know what they were, I saw a man, with a cutlass in his hand, coming off the foot of the stairs; I have understood since that he was an officer; I never saw the man before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Brian do any thing in the taproom? - A. Yes; I saw him strike a man with a half-gallon pot, and knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing else? - A. He knocked him down, and hit him again while he was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Berry do any thing? - A. I saw him hit the same man with a stick about the shoulder and the head somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a stick was it, a small stick, or a large one? - A. It was a hand stick, such as they take in their hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did all those appear to be wounds given with a cutting instrument? - A. The wound on the right arm I am not quite sure was given with a cutting instrument or not; all the others I am conscious were.</p>

            , and Herne, upon which they all retired from the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I humbly submit to your Lordship, that, taking for granted the evidence which is now given discloses the whole of this transaction, (reserving to my clients nevertheless all the benefit of further evidence to be adduced), the offence proved amounts to no more than manslaughter.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am not disposed to controvert the law, as it has been laid down by my learned Friend, Mr. Knowlys, in his opening, that where a constable is acting legally, under a legal warrant, he is so far protected by law, that the killing of him will be murder; but I submit to your Lordship, that this case is not the case stated by my learned Friend; for that the warrant, under which these officers acted, is not a legal warrant; and that the officers, who were executing that warrant, were not the persons who by law ought to have executed it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the warrant is founded upon the 6th section of the 17th Geo. II. ch. 5. I will read the whole of that clause: "And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the Justices of the Peace for every county, riding, city, borough, town corporate, division, or liberty, or any two of them, shall, four times in the year at least, or oftener, if need be, meet in their respective divisions, and by their warrant command the constables or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080028"></xptr>other peace officers of every hundred, parish, town, and hamlet in their several divisions, who shall be assisted with sufficient men of the same places, to make a general privy search in one night throughout their several respective limits, for the finding and apprehending of rougues and vagabonds." That, I believe, is the whole of the clause which applies to this warrant, but I will read to your Lordship the whole of the clause: "And every Justice of the Peace shall also, on receiving information that rogues and vagabonds are in any place within his jurisdiction, issue his warrant to the constable or other officer of such place to search for and apprehend such rogues and vagabonds; and such rogues and vagabonds as they shall find and apprehend upon such searches, they shall cause to be brought before the Justices." I say, my Lord, I believe it is the first part of this clause upon which the warrant is grounded, because this is a warrant for a"general privy search," which is authorized only by the first part of the clause: the last clause empowers a single Justice to issue his warrant for searching a particular place, upon a particular information received by him.</p>
               <p>I submit to your Lordship, that it ought to appear upon the face of the warrant that it is executed by two Magistrates at a meeting. It is not merely a ministerial, it is a judicial act: the Justices must "meet" in order to perform it. They are directed by the statute to meet"four times in the year at least, or oftener if need be." It is not pretended that this was one of the "four times;" it must be, therefore, one of the extraordinary occasions for which the statute has made provision; the law of the four times of the year, or upon one of the special occasions supposes the warrant to be the result of the deliberation of the Justices at a meeting; and I contend that it cannot be a legal warrant for this purpose, unless it does so purport to be executed by the Justices at a meeting.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am confirmed in this point by a precedent of some authority, in the 4th volume of Burn's Justice, folio 397, from which it appears that this has been considered to be the construction of the form required by the statute. The precedent given for a general privy search warrant is thus: -</p>
               <p>"Westmoreland -To the High Constable of Lonsdale Ward, within the said county. At a meeting of the Justices of our Lord the King, assigned to keep the peace within the said county, held at - for the division of Lonsdale Ward aforesaid, &amp;c. by us -, two of the said Justices assembled at the said meeting, being resident, living, and dwelling within the said division, we do hereby command you forthwith to issue your warrants to all the petty constables within the said ward for making a general privy search for rogues and vagabonds, according to the form herein indorsed." Then follows the form of the high constable's warrant.</p>

               <p>But I submit to your Lordship with confidence, that it plainly appears from the Act of Parliament alone, without the authority of Burn, that it must be at a meeting, for it is only at a meeting that the Justices have the power to do this act. This is a statute, conferring upon Justices extraordinary power, and prescribing to them, at the same time, the manner in which that power shall be exercised by them, and if they do not exercise that power in the manner prescribed to them, they transgress the law.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the next objection I have to make to the warrant is, not only that it does not appear upon the face of it to be executed at a meeting, but, it is proved by the evidence, that it was so executed, as to be no warrant at all for the purpose for which it is issued. It is proved, that when the name of Mr. Floud was subscribed, the warrant was a blank paper, a printed form, the blanks not being filled up; that after it had been subscribed by the name of Mr. Floud, it was filled up; that then Sir William Addington signed it, and he gave it to Miller, the person to whom it was directed. I venture to say, without fear of contradiction, that this statute never meant to authorize Magistrates so to act; when it requires Magistrates to do a certain act at a meeting, when the least number allowed for the doing of that act is two, it never meant to say, that one Magistrate might execute the warrant in blank, leaving it afterwards in the power of the second Magistrate to direct the blow wheresoever he pleased, to be executed by any persons whomsoever, whether they were legally authorized, or not legally authorized, to leave it in short to the discretion or indiscretion of one Magistrate to do any thing the most opposite to that which the Act of Parliament prescribed. Therefore, I submit to your Lordship, that instead of "a general privy search warrant," which it purports upon the face of it to be, it is no such thing; for a general privy search warrant must not only be executed by two Magistrates, but must be executed by two Magistrates together at a meeting. In the first place it is proved that it is not executed by two Magistrates together, for that Sir 
               <persName id="t17990508-21-person305">

             executed it alone; and in the next place it is proved, that in truth it was never executed by Mr. Floud at all; for the signature of a Magistrate to a blank paper never can be deemed to be an execution of a warrant -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. I do not know whether I may not stop you here in some degree, because I put it to the Counsel for the prosecution, whether they found their prosecution upon the idea that this is but manslaughter, supposing the warrant to be bad; for I hold, that if the warrant was good, it never having been read below stairs, but being carried up stairs, it would not alter the offence; but what I shall state to the Jury is this, that whether the warrant is bad or good, does not signify a straw, for the warrant is functus officio; for these men come into the tap-room, and there they execute their malicious purpose, founded upon some malice preconceived by the conduct of the officers. I shall suppose the warrant as bad as you wish it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then, my Lord, I shall take it that the warrant is illegal, and therefore I shall further submit to your Lordship, (taking the facts to be true which have been spoken to by the witnesses), that this case comes within the scope of cases already determined, which make it manslaughter.</p>
               <p>My learned Friend, Mr. Knowlys, in his opening to the Jury, stated a case which he has attempted to substantiate by evidence, that the officers going to this house to execute a lawful warrant, did apprehend certain persons, supposed to be such persons as were described in the warrant; that some of those persons were taken away, that others were in custody, and were not taken away;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080029"></xptr>that one man and a woman tied together were in the custody of the officers upon the staircase, and coming down the stairs for the purpose of being taken to the watch-house, at the time these persons came to the house; that a number of women were in custody up stairs, and that the prisoners, and others, came to the house for the purpose of rescuing those who were in the custody of the officers; and, for the purpose of so rescuing them, committed the assault. My learned Friends consumed a considerable portion of time in proving acts of violence on one of the prisoners, Brian, prior to the rushing of the persons into the tap-room, namely, attacking the officers in the street for the purpose of rescuing those persons who were being conveyed to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Therefore the case stated, and supposed to be proved by my learned Friends on the other tide, is not the case of a quarrel between the persons now charged with murder and the officers, upon any other ground than the execution of that warrant, and the taking persons into custody under that warrant; and the only motive which has been imputed to the prisoners at the bar, is, that they wished to assist their friends; and they are attempted to be connected thus: that one of them, Sullivan, was, in fact, liberated by an assault upon the officer who had him in custody, by a person charged to be connected with the prisoners now at the bar; that he, Sullivan, afterwards went to a neighbouring public-house, and called out other persons, which other persons are now charged with coming to the King's-arms for the purpose of rescuing the women, and the man, who were then in the custody of the officers, and some of whom were in the course of being conveyed to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>These being the facts of this case, and this the motive, which my learned Friends have spent so many hours to six upon the prisoners, and which facts and motives would, if the warrant were legal, and the warrant was good, would amount within persons executing it, the persons authorized by law to execute it, constitute that act of killing with malice prepence, which the law denominates murder; then, I submit to your Lordship, that, taking the warrant to be bad, and not to have been executed by persons having a right to execute it; because the persons having a right to execute it are the constables of the district, division, and so on, - when, in point of fact, it is not directed to the persons to whom it is necessary it should be directed, for it is directed to Mr. Wild, high constable, and to the several petty constables, of the county of Middlesex; whereas the statute requires the warrant to be directed to the constables, or other peace-officers, of every hundred, parish, town, or hamlet, who, it is true, may have assistants, but they must be "sufficient men of the same places." None of the persons who were sent to execute the warrant were the persons authorized by law to execute it. I submit, therefore. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. I have admitted that to you. Suppose the officers committed a trespass in executing the warrant, then you are to prove that these people had a right to kill them for it - that is your mode of arguing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I beg your Lordship's pardon, that is not my mode of arguing; and I own I did not expect, when the whole of my argument is built upon a confession that the prisoners are guilty to the extent of manslaughter, that I should be told I was proving, or attempting to prove, that they had a right to kill the officers, because the officer had committed a trespass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. That is, that we have a right to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter on that account.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. That certainly is my argument; and I will endeavour to convince your Lordship, upon the authority of cases, that this crime is only the crime of manslaughter.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I will begin with the case of Hopkin Hugget, which is in Kelynge, folio 59."At a Goal Delivery of Newgate, in April, 1666, upon an indictment of murder, against Hopkin Hugget, a special verdict was found to this effect: we find that

            , whereof he instantly died." The question was submitted to the Judges, whether that this was murder or manslaughter. It was considered by all the Judges of England, who met at Serjeant's-inn. The Report says, "The Lord Chief Justice Bridgeman, Lord Chief Baron Hale, Brother Atkins, Brother Tyrell, Brother Turner, Brother Browne, Brother Archer, and Brother Rainsford, having had the notes of the special verdict three days before, delivered their opinion as then advised; but, they said, they would not be bound by it, that this was no murder, but only manslaughter." Lord Chief Justice Keylinge, and three others, held it to be murder. The eight Judges who decided this case, certainly qualified their decision at the time, by saying they would not be bound by it; but I do not find that they ever recanted that opinion, or that it was ever revoked, or even softened down. It has never been shaken by any subsequent determination; and I take the liberty of maintaining that it is law; "They said, that if a man be unduly arrested, or restrained of his liberty, by three men, although he be quiet himself, and do not endeavour any rescue, yet this is a provocation to all other men of England, not only his friends, but strangers also, for common humanity sake, as my Lord-Bridgeman said, to endeavour his rescue; and if, in such endeavour of rescue, they kill any one, this is not murder but only manslaughter."</p>
               <p>My Lord, I submit to your Lordship that this case,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080030"></xptr>(supposing the result of the evidence to be what I have stated), is precisely within the principle of that case; because there, there was a person illegally arrested, for the liberation of whom, certain persons, who appear to have been strangers to him, interfered, and committed an assault upon the officers who had him in custody; and, in the course of that assault, they stabbed one of the officers, who instantly died in consequence of that stab. Here, for the purpose of rescuing persons, those who were illegally restrained of their liberty, persons interfered, and assaulted the officers who had the others in custody, and one of the officers died in consequence of the wounds he received.</p>
               <p>But, my Lord, there is another case in which this principle is recognized, and in which this law is applied to: a case, in my opinion, infinitely less favourable to the defendant, than the case of the defendants now before your Lordship. I speak of the case of the Queen and Tooley, 2d Lord Raymond, 1295."An indictment was found against the defendants for the murder of one Dent; and, upon not guilty pleaded, the Jury found a special verdict;" in which special verdict these facts were stated: "That by a statute made the 27th of Eliz. for the good government of Westminster, it is enacted, that for reformation of disorders in that city, the Dean, High Steward, or his deputy, or two capital Burgessss, may hear and punish incontinencies, according to the custom of London; that, by the custom of London, any constable of any ward, parish, or precinct, may execute his office throughout the whole City; that within the City, Borough, and Liberty of Westminster, it has been used, that every person duly appointed constable, of any parish within the Liberties of the Borough, and the Vill of Westminster, his office of constable, in and through the whole Borough of Westminster, and Liberties thereof, has executed, and used to execute. That, the 8th of March. 8th Ann, three commissioners duly appointed, by virtue of the Act for recruiting the army, for putting the Act in execution, by virtue of that Act, made their warrant, under their hands and seals, directed to the constables of the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, within the City of Westminster, thereby commanding the constables to make search within the said City and Liberty, for persons within the description of that Act; which warrant, after that day, was delivered to the constables of the parish of St. Margaret, to be executed; that after that day,

               <p>Now I submit to your Lordship, that, in that case, where there had been no previous disturbance, where there was only one constable, and his deputy, assuming a power which turned out to be illegal, where the constable had apprehended a person, where he had lodged that person in safe custody, and where no reasonable harm could be expected to come to her, though the persons who assaulted the constable were strangers to her, yet, as the constable was acting illegally, it was decided by Lord Holt, and six other Judges, (five undoubtedly being diffentient), that it was not murder but manslaughter only, it does appear to me utterly impossible to distinguish the principle of that case from this; for -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. You might as well state, at the same time, what Mr. Justice Foster says, "That case stands, as I conceive, on no better ground than the opinion of seven learned Judges against five."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Your Lordship could hardly suppose me guilty of such folly, as to attempt to conceal from your Lordship any thing contained in the book of Mr. Justice Foster, with the whole of which your Lordship must be so intimately acquainted. I certainly did intend to notice that observation, though not exactly at this moment, because I did not doubt it would be cited by my learned Friends on the other side; but as your Lordship has called my attention to it, I will do it now. No man does, or can entertain a higher respect for the name and character of Mr. Justice Foster than I do; but yet, I cannot bring myself to yield the authority of Lord Holt, and Lord Hale, even to Mr. Justice Foster.</p>
               <p>I was stating to your Lordship, that the principle of this case is not to be distinguished from that of the Queen and Tooley, Here is an illegal warrant, executed by persons who are not the persons authorized by law to execute such a warrant, even if it were legal; they had taken a number of people into custody; in their way to the watch-house with some of their prisoners, they say, they were assaulted by Brian. For what purpose? No purpose can be stated but that of rescue. Another of the prisoners at the bar, Sullivan, they say, was drinking at the public-house, they took him into custody, and were conveying him to the watch-house, when they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080031"></xptr>assaulted, and he was rescued out of their hands; and then it is in evidence that he went to a public-house, and said. why do you suffer men to be cut to pieces thus; that he called two persons out, one of whom is now at the bar; that they followed him to the King's-arms public-house, and commenced a violent attack upon the officers, in the house; which officers were some up stairs guarding the prisoners there, some of them on the stairs, and one of them in the tap-room actually conducting two of their prisoners out, a man and a woman, who, by means of this attack, were actually rescued. This case comes, therefore, I contend, precisely within the principle of that case. Then, the question is, what authority that case is entitled to? Mr. Justice Foster, in discussing that case, and disputing its authority, does not touch very strongly upon the case of the King and Hugget, but he maintains, that the decision in the case of the King and Hugget, does not warrant the decision in the case of the Queen and Tooley; and, my Lord, undoubtedly the authority of Mr. Justice Foster is entitled to considerable weight; but, I shall submit to your Lordship, that both those cases are law, and it is not even the authority of -</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. I shall certainly consider it as my duty to hold these cases to be law. I shall not think myself at liberty even to speak flirtingly of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I was sure I should anticipate something of that kind from your Lordship, that where seven Judges have determined a point, even though five Judges dissent, that point, so determined, is the law of the land; and therefore, I trust, I need not argue any further that these cases are law. I humbly submit to your Lordship, that the principle upon which these two cases are determined, is the principle which must decide this case. The attack upon the officers can be referred to no other motive, connected as it is with an attempt to rescue and an actual rescue, than that of rescue. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. If you put that to me, I must submit it to the Jury. I shall state to the Jury the ground upon which those cases went; I shall state to them what I think of this case; and I shall put it to them, whether they think there are, in this case, the same ingredients that were in that case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Undoubtedly, my Lord; I do not mean to argue that the facts are exactly the same, but that they are so similar as to bring the cases within one principle. The facts of two cases may differ in many particulars, and yet the principle of both be the same.</p>
               <p>My Lord, There is a subsequent case, which I need hardly quote to your Lordship, a case in which there was the interference of a third person, for the rescue of another who was arrested; and, indeed, I have cited now; but cases of the interference of third persons, I have confined myself to such cases as appear to me to apply strictly to the present. I should have consumed much more of your Lordship's time, if I had gone into the cases of persons resisting arrests of themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. In the present instance, it does not appear that either of the prisoners at the bar were arrested.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Yes, my Lord, Sullivan was arrested.</p>
               <p>Mr Justice Grose. He had been arrested, but was at liberty at the time the riot commenced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. At the time of the last attack in the public-house, he was at liberty, and he is charged by the witnesses with being one of the assailants; but that was only a few minutes after he had been liberated from this illegal arrest, and his blood had not had time to cool, and, therefore, is intitled to the humane consideration of the law, which makes allowance for the passions and infirmities of human nature.</p>

            , who was a constable of the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, to the house of one Ward, in Castle-street, in that parish, in whose house the prisoner cohabited with a man of the name of Farmello. That Prothero went to the house of Ward, accompanied by Barnet, for the purpose of apprehending Farmello, as an idle and disorderly person, under the stat. 19 Geo. II. chap. 10. That Prothero had a general search-warrant for that purpose." Then here is the case of an officer acting in his own district, and there is no objection to the warrant on the ground of irregularity of form stated."That upon Prothero's coming to the house of Ward, he, together with Barnet and others, went up stairs to the lodging-house of Farmello, in which Farmello and the prisoner cohabited at that time. That Prothero did not know Farmello. That Prothero knocked at the door, and demanded to be admitted; that a male voice called out from within, "who's there?" That Prothero answered,"it is me;" upon which a servant maid belonging to the house said, there was another door by which they might enter, the bolt of which was on the inside of a room not belonging to Farmello's lodging: that this door was unbolted, and opened by two men of the name of Ellis and Stephens. That Prothero and Barnet then entered Farmello's room. That Prothero said to Farmello, "you must come along with us." Farmello said,"for what?" That Barnet said, "come, come, you must go." That before Prothero could answer Farmello, the prisoner stepped past Prothero, and struck Barnet under the left arm with a knife she then had in her hand, saying, "by G-d, he shall not go." That the knife was left sticking in the side of Barnet, who turned round, saying he was a dead man. That Barnet died of that wound about four o'clock the next day. That Farmello was not an object of the said Act of Parliament. The question was, whether the offence amounted to murder or manslaughter. This case was argued in the Exchequer Chamber, on the 19th of April, 1780, by Mr. Howarth, for the Crown, and Mr. Erskine, for the prisoner, before ten of the Judges;" and the cases I have cited to your Lordship were, with others, cited and relied on. Mr. Leach says, in a note, "It is said that the Judges held it to be manslaughter only, but no opinion was ever publicly given." However. the prisoner, after laying eighteen months in jail, was discharged.</p>
               <p>If, therefore, I am not entitled to state this case as an explicit and unequivocal decision that the crime proved amounted to no more than manslaughter, I think I may state this, that if the Judges had been of opinion it was murder, she would not have been discharged. In that case the warrant was regular, and the person executing that warrant was the person who ought to have executed it.</p>

The marginal note says, it was illegal; but I submit to your Lordship, that that marginal note is an incorrect conclusion from that part of the case, in which it is said, that Farmello, the person arrested, was not an object of the Act. There is nothing in the case which implies that the warrant was irregular, and therefore I humbly conceive I was correct in staring, that the warrant was regular.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. If he was not an object of the Act, the warrant was illegal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. With great deference to your Lordship, I submit that the regularity or legality of the warrant cannot be affected by Farmello not being an object of the Act, because this is not stated to be a warrant to apprehend Farmello, by name; it is stated to be "a general search-warrant." The officer erred in the execution of it, inasmuch as he attempted to apprehend a person who was not an object of the Act.</p>
               <p>In that case, I submit to your Lordship, the warrant was regular in form, and it was executed by the proper officer, the constable of the parish. In the case now before your Lordship, every thing is wrong; the warrant is irregular in form, it is void and illegal in substance, and it was executed by persons who ought not to have attempted to execute it, because the law has confined the execution to other persons. Upon the whole, therefore, I submit. that the offence proved by the evidence for the Crown, is no higher than manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I shall trouble your Lordship with a few observations on the same side with Mr. Gurney, and though the case has been ably and fully argued by him, and the hour of the day is far advanced, yet feeling an imperative duty to submit my humble opinion to the Court, I am perfectly satisfied the good old rule of justice will be attended to, "that the accused shall be fully heard before judgment shall pass upon them:" and that therefore your Lordship will favour me, their advocate, with that attentive and patient hearing, which, under the circumstances of this important case, I may require.</p>
               <p>Convinced of this fact, I shall take the liberty to contend with confidence, though with humility, that the offence which has been proved against the defendants, cannot by any possible construction, amount to murder, for the facts, as I understand them, are shortly these:"A warrant was issued by the Bow-street Magistrates, directing Miller. and other officers belonging to that office to make a privy search in the parish of St. Giles, and to apprehend all rogues, vagabonds, idle and disorderly persons, and particularly such as they should find in the house of one Flannery, a publican, in Maynard-street, in the said parish; and under this warrant, the officers force into the house of Flannery, without notice, and arrest a number of persons there assembled, amongst whom were some of the prisoners at the bar, but who, at the time they were apprehended, were not guilty of any act of riot or disorder: that in consequence an attempt to rescue ensues, and that, in the affray, the unfortunate deceased received the wounds whereof he died." -</p>
               <p>These are the facts, together with this important one, that the warrant under which they acted is admitted to be illegal and void.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. No such thing has been admitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What I assert has been conceded by the Court; and there is not a school-boy, however ignorant, much less a man professing an acquaintance with the jurisprudence of his country, who can deny this fact,"that a warrant, (as that in question has been proved on the cross-examination to have been). signed in blank by one Magistrate, and, at a subsequent period, signed and filled up by another, when it should have been the joint act of both, signed by both together, at a meeting held for that purpose, is illegal and void to all intents and purposes; and was it necessary for me, on this occasion, after what has fallen from the Court, to argue the point, I could demonstrate, beyond a possibility of doubt, that the warrant was not only issued in a manner unprecedented and informal, but that it is illegal and void from the beginning to the end. However, since the point has been allowed by the express declaration of the Court, I will not waste time in pointing out its manifold iregularities; but, taking the warrant to have been illegal, I shall contend the arrest was unjustifiable, that it was a violation of the liberty of the subject, and that, by consequence; the homicide which followed, cannot be considered murder.</p>
               <p>That the arrest must be illegal, since the warrant was illegal, is manifest as the fun at noon day, for it is through the warrant only the officers derive their power. If, therefore, the warrant, which was the foundation, fails them, their proceedings must be without authority, and by consequence illegal. When I said they must derive their authority through the warrant, I only state what the statute has directed, 17 Geo. II. c. 5, for without warrant they have no power to make a privy search under the Act, and at common law they have no such authority at all; the only case in which they can arrest without warrant under this Act is, where they see an act of vagrancy committed in the public streets; in such case they may arrest without warrant, (for I will not blink the act), but in such case only; and they have no earthly authority to enter the house of any man for the purpose of a privy search, without a warrant regularly signed and issued by two Magistrates: and, miserable indeed would be the situation of the inhabitants of this land, if their houses, which our ancestors proudly called their castles, were liable to the incursions of every low and common officer, who might think sit to enter them at his own pleasure, without warrant, perhaps for oppressive purposes, though under the cloak of justice!</p>
               <p>I hope it will not be said, that by the common law peace officers, without warrant virtute officii to enter the house of any man for the purpose of arresting those whom they shall consider rogues and vagabonds, or idle and disorderly persons: if this is asserted, I shall expect to have it proved, for mere assertion without proof cannot operate with me against that which is the result of serious and attentive enquiry; for I submit, that at common law peace officers have no authority to arrest virtute officii, and without warrant from a Justice, but where they see an offence committed immediately in their presence; as for instance, where they see a riot going on, they may arrest the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080033"></xptr>parties; but, if the riot is over, they cannot arrest those concerned without a warrant from a Magistrate, much less can they enter into another man's house, as they have done on the occasion under consideration, and deprive men of their liberty, to whom not even the smallest irregularity is imputable. Hence, therefore, I submit, that as at common law they had no authority for what they did, and since, by the statute they had none, their authority under that, viz. the warrant failing, I shall be glad to learn from what source they can derive a power which neither emanates from the common law, nor flows through the medium of the statute? To me it is manifest they had none, that they acted without authority illegally and unjustly, that consequently they are trespassers, and must submit to that which resulted from their own misconduct; for surely it cannot be denied, that when officers are trespassers, by arresting men on whom they should not have laid their hands, and in an attempt to rescue those, whom they have illegally restrained, one of the officers, who are the wrong doers, is killed, the homicide, in such case, cannot be more than manslaughter: for this is a principle so fully established, that I should have thought it would not be disputed; however, to put a case, suppose a riot has been committed in the street, and, after it is over, a constable, endeavouring to arrest the rioters, not having a warrant from a Justice, is killed, would such homicide, in point of law be considered murder? Certainly it would not, because the officer had no right to arrest virtute officii without warrant, after the riot had ceased. To prove that I am not arguing hypothetically, I will mention a case in which this very point has been held; it was that of

He was indicted for the murder of one Wilkinson, who was an officer, sent to take Power into custody for riotous behaviour: when, as it appeared in evidence, that the riot was over when he endeavoured to arrest Power, the Court held that he was proceeding illegally, and that where a person does an act that causes the death of him who illegally restrains his liberty, the offence certainly cannot be more than manslaughter. Then taking this case for law, of which there can be no question, I will ask, is it not authority by which the present should in some measure be governed; for in the case now before the Court, the officers were trespassers, they acted without authority, and, under the pretence of seizing idle and disorderly persons, they arrest men whom they are forced to admit were sober, quiet, and orderly, for thus they speak of the landlord of the house, Flannery, thus of Sullivan, one of the prisoners, whom, notwithstanding, they had the andacity to handcuff, and drag, like felons, into the public street: then were not these officers the worst of trespassers? Did not they violate the sacred liberty of the subject? And doth not this case, therefore, come within the rule laid down in that I have just mentioned?

            , and the Queen v. Tooley, mentioned by Mr. Gurney? By-the-by, there is an observation made by Lord Chief Justice Holt, in delivering the opinion of the Judges on the last of those cases, which I will take the liberty to repeat, as it is in itself coming from so great authority, abundantly sufficient to establish all I have been contending for to-day. He says, "the prisoners had sufficient provocation; for if one be imprisoned on unlawful authority, it is a sufficient provocation to all people, out of compassion, much more where it is done under the colour of justice, and where the liberty of the subject is invaded, it is a provocation to all the people of England; for the people should be concerned for Magna Charta and the law; but he who imprisons another against law, is an offender against Magna Charta." And he expressly says, in another part of the argument, "a constable cannot arrest but when he seen an actual breach of the peace; and if the affray be over, he cannot arrest without a warrant." On these words, which are not only the language of this great Judge, but which are to be found in all our books, I might pin my faith, and ask, are they not decisive on the present occasion, when the officers are to be considered as acting without warrant? Therefore, without authority; and consequently improperly restraining the liberty of those they apprehended; may, doth it not follow, a fortiori, in this case, that the homicide cannot be murder, when it is recollected that, in the Queen v. Tooley, the officer was killed in a second attack that was made upon him half an hour after the first, when the human passion might have subsided; whereas, in the case before the Court, there was no interval, the attack was momentary, and the accident just as sudden.</p>

            , Knight, when he never was knighted, but a Baronet, it was held an ill warrant; and that, therefore, killing the officer who executed it, was not murder. So I submit, in the case before the Court, the arrest by the officers was illegal, they restrained the liberty of their fellow subjects without authority, and, therefore, the homicide which followed cannot be murder.</p>
               <p>These cases which have been mentioned, appear, in my humble judgment, decisive in favour of all the prisoners; for from them it is manifest, that the offence, as it applies in general, cannot be more than manslaughter; for in each of the cases as reported, the homicide was by third persons, who were, notwithstanding, so far protected by the law, as to be held free from the crime of murder; how much more favourable does the case of the prisoner, Sullivan, appear, who was one of those illegally arrested; in favour of him the books are full of authorities; and, I submit, that as to him, the homicide is no more than se defendendo; and that this is the law as determined in modern as well as ancient times. There is a case, mentioned by Lord Coke, 4 Inst. 333. in which it has been held, that when a man is illegally arrested, and kills the assailant, his offence cannot be more than homicide, se defendendo; and, I believe, it has never yet been over-ruled; this was the case of Simpson, which <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080034"></xptr>happened when the Court of High Commission was in existence, whose odious authority must be known to every man; from this Court a warrant had been issued to arrest one Simpson, for adultery; and it was directed to

            , an officer, who arrested Simpson, and was killed by him; and the question was, whether under this warrant Butler had a right to arrest Simpson, for if he had, it was murder; but if not, only a small offence, se defendendo; and after conference, and long consideration, the Judges resolved, that the High Commissioners had no authority to issue a warrant to arrest in that case, but should have proceeded by way of citation; and that therefore the arrest being illegal, the killing was not murder: then let me ask, can I have a greater authority than my Lord Coke, the very oracle of the law? And after this determination, can the case of Sullivan be considered more than se defendendo? I am sure it cannot, unless the established law is overturned; and I am equally sure your Lordship will not introduce a change, or alter the law as it has been held, not only by Lord Chief Justice Holt, but at the time the Institute was written.</p>
               <p>These observations I felt it my duty to submit, and shall add but one or two more, applying them to the misconduct of the officers: Mr. Justice Foster has stated, in his book on the Crown Law, p. 319, that "when officers misbehave, even in the execution of legal process, they forfeit that protection the law would otherwise afford them;" then, even on this point, had I no other, I might safely put the issue, for the conduct of the officers has been, as proved by themselves, most grossly improper; for they not only refused to show their warrant, on entering the house, as they were bound to have done, but they seized, arrested, and handcuffed men, as rogues and vagrants, not one of whom was of such descript on. When I assert this, I am authorized to do so, for the fact has not been proved against me; therefore the maxim will apply." at non existentibus, et non apparentibus eadem est ratio." But I am not driven to this necessity; for it is clear, from the evidence, that there was not in the house a single person who could be deemed a rogue and vagrant, or idle and disorderly, within the meaning of the statute; for the statute has clearly described all such as shall be so considered, and not left it to the power of construction; and the terms, as used in the Act, are widely different in their meaning from that which in common parlance we apply to them; for instance, he might, in common speech, be called idle who loiters in a public-house, but he would not be within the scope, or meaning of the statute; again, we call him idle who is less attentive to industry than he should be; and I would call the learned Gentleman who conducts this prosecution disorderly, if he were to interrupt me whilst addressing the Court; yet it would be absurd to say he was disorderly within the meaning of the Act of Parliament; then let me ask, who was there disorderly in the house of Flannery, the publican? Was the landlord disorderly when he was wantonly assaulted by the officers, and that in his own parlour? Was the prisoner, Sullivan, disorderly, who was sitting peaceably in the tap-room? Certainly not; nor was there an appearance of disorder until the officers had created it, by illegally arresting and handcuffing men, who were peaceable and orderly, under the unjustifiable pretence that they were rogues and vagabonds; here, therefore, I say, the officers were trespassers in having so misbehaved; first neglecting to shew their warrant, and, secondly, in restraining the liberty of men who, even had the warrant been a legal one, were not by any means within the meaning of the law. And from this I may conclude, in the words of Mr. Foster, that the officers, by their own misconduct, have forfeited the special protection of the law.</p>
               <p>With these observations I shall conclude, submitting, as I have contended, that as to Sullivan, his offence cannot be more than se defendendo; and that of the other prisoners, manslaughter only; first, because the officers, even supposing they had a legal warrant, refused to shew it, grossly misbehaved, and arrested men who were not objects of the Act of Parliament; and, secondly, I rely on this, not only that the warrant was illegal and void, and therefore the officers trespassers, but also that the assray was sudden and momentary; that no time intervened for the human passion to have subsisted, and that, by consequence, the homicide cannot be murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. If your Lordship will give me leave, I will read three lines from Lord Hale: 1st Hale, 457."If the Sheriff's bailiff comes to execute a process, but hath not a lawful warrant, as if the name of the bailiff, plaintiff, or defendant, be interlined, or inserted after the sealing thereof by the bailiff himself, or any other; if such bailiff be killed, it is but manslaughter, and not murder."</p>

               <p>The next case that is mentioned, is the case in the 4th institute; and to be sure, if that case can be thought to bear upon this, it must be most strange indeed. - Here is a man comes to apprehend a person upon a warrant for an offence, which he himself must know was no temporal offence, and gave him no authority to take him; for the crime of adultery is not a crime punishable by imprisonment, and therefore he comes there perfectly without authority, and the consequence was it was held not to be murder.</p>
               <p>There was a case cited, by Mr. Gurney, from Lord Hale, and there a bailiff has no power to grant writs, undoubtedly; if the Sheriff's bailiff comes to execute a warrant, which is interlined after it is sealed, he has no right to act upon it against any person whatever, in any degree whatever, and therefore he is, in that case, acting without authority, and he must take the consequence, it certainly would not be murder if he died under the execution of that wrongful process.</p>
               <p>Then, my Lord, there are two other cases which are supposed to apply - but when I am arguing in this way,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080035"></xptr>and it is supposed that the legality of the warrant is given up, I am ready to argue, whenever it may be necessary, that it is legal; but in the present stage of the argument, putting the warrant entirely out of the question, I say that those two cases do not apply; and I will tell your Lordship why I conceived they do not apply: My Lord, with respect to Hugget's case, that to be sure is as widely different from this as one Pole can be from the other - what is that case? Some persons lay hold of a man, and it is expressly stated that it was done "without warrant, for ought appears to us," they "impressed a man who is not yet known, to serve in his Majesty's service in the wars against the Dutch nation." My Lord, let us see what a serious case that is: some men come and lay hold of another to carry him out of the realm, to kidnap him: - My Lord, surely that is a case in which it might be expected that the passions of men might be roused, they were not going to carry him to a place where he might be amenable to the laws of his country, but to send him abroad; that case might be very properly ruled to be manslaughter; indeed, I have no right to consider it as properly ruled, for the Judges did in that instance, saying, they would not hold it as a precedent; they did it with the greatest reluctance, and said, they would not be bound by it; they looked upon it as a case just upon the verge of the one crime or the other, and that they would never rule in favour of any person, under any circumstances before them, unless these circumstances tally in every iota with the circumstances of that very individual case which stands so determined.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Is it supposed, or pretended, or can any man living suppose that this man, who was going to be carried out of the kingdom, is to be compared with the present case, where they were going to be put into a course of legal enquiry? - Therefore that case does not apply to this in the least.</p>
               <p>With respect to the case in 2d Lord Raymond, it is as wide from this as a case can be. The facts stated are, that he was a constable, that he was walking about and he seized this woman, whom he laid hold of, she was committing no act of disorder; though she had formerly committed disorderly acts, she was at that time an unoffending person, and therefore that case does not apply.</p>
               <p>Then, my Lord, with respect to that part of the evidence which these gentlemen have quoted, it makes a strong case of malice against Sullivan indeed, and against those who were with him: it is expressly proved, that Sullivan submitted to that apprehension without any sign whatever of resentment; he was perfectly calm and collected, and said, he would go with them and would make no objection to the arrest: afterwards he is let go, and let us see what he does when he is let go; he comes to the public-house with a most evident falsehood, a falsehood calculated for what? Calculated to rouse the resentment of every person there. He says, "why do you suffer men to be murdered thus?" Upon which the other persons accompany him, and they proceed to commit this shocking barbarity upon the officers, of whom Sullivan had never made any complaint. My Lord, I would put that as strong and cogent evidence indeed, that the intent to rescue was not the intent of his mind, but mixed with another intent, which the law will never countenance, an intent to revenge upon these people for an arrest which he never suspected to be illegal, because he never made an objection to it. Is it not proved, that at the time this man went into that public-house, all was quiet and all peaceable? Is it then true, or could it be true, that these officers (whose conduct was unknown to the men to whom he addressed himself, in order to rouse them to resentment), were murdering people? That is a falsehood issuing out of his mouth, upon which all the after barbarity was founded. I say, therefore, that this is strong evidence of malice against the officers, and therefore that will go to implicate him, if the facts are believed by the Jury, of which they of course will judge. But, my Lord, is it to be said, that this was without colour of authority. I did not give up this point: but I submit to your Lordship, that these officers themselves, even without a warrant, were justified in laying hold of people in an act of disorder. It has been said, that they had no right to enter into this house. My Lord, it was a public-house, in which there must be a recognizance entered into to keep good order; a house into which police officers and constables are bound to go and see that they do keep order: they found an unlawful assembly in that house - a club, consisting of a mixture of men and women, with dancing and music, and that sort of disorder, a meeting that never could have been licensed upon an application; that never could, in the fair exercise of the discretion of a Magistrate, have obtained a licence. They found there likewise persons, who were idle and disorderly persons, whom they had a right to take; for I take it that any constable, and there were two constables here acting with these people, that any constable has a right to take persons acting disorderly, and there were persons who did afterwards turn out to be men of that description; for it is in evidence, that two of them were deserters; and therefore I contend, that, without any warrant, the custody of some of these people was lawful; and, if the custody of any was lawful, these officers had a legal right to take them, and were then in the exercise of a legal authority. At the time they were conveying away, all the persons, except Sullivan, were perfectly ignorant of what was passing; Sullivan knew that they submitted to it, and made no objection whatever. If, therefore, we are to have reformers and speculators upon the law, who, when they see a constable, shall take upon them to decide whether the warrant is a lawful one or not, I hope the parties who do so speculate, will suffer the consequences of taking the law into their own hands. I am extremely sorry to have troubled your Lordship at this late hour of the day, and I will not add another observation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. My Lord, I shall certainly abstain from arguing the legality of this warrant, although my learned Friend, Mr. Knowlys, has professed himself perfectly ready to meet me, whenever it may be necessary. I shall only say, I am perfectly ready to meet him. But I take it that your Lordship has said, the warrant is illegal, and therefore the question will be, whether this case does or does not come within the principle of the cases that I have cited. My Friend has endeavoured to distinguish this case from them; but I submit that he has distinguished them only in trifling circumstances, and that he cannot distinguish them in principle.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080036"></xptr>My learned Friend says, Hugget's case differs from this, because there the parties intended to take the person they arrested out of the kingdom, and therefore Hugget and the others were entitled to decide upon it at once, and prevent an unlawful imprisonment and transportation from the realm of the person arrested; but the principle is the same; a man has a right to protect his own liberty from unlawful restraint; he is entitled to the assistance of other persons, even of strangers, to protect and rescue him; and if, in the scuffle that ensues, the man, imposing that unlawful restraint, is killed, the law gives such allowance to those persons as to the persons so rescuing, the law considers that homicide as manslaughter, and not murder.</p>
               <p>My Lord, in Tooley's case, the facts are infinitely short of the facts in this case. My learned Friend, Mr. Knowlys, says, here was no violence, no disorder, till the prisoners at the bar interfered; so there was no violence, no disorder, till those persons interfered, who were strangers to the woman, and who did not commence the attack till the woman was actually in the round-house. Now let us compare the facts of that case with the facts of this. The house is beset by these officers, under court of a warrant, now proved to be illegal; some of them go in, and others keep the door; every person in the house is taken into custody; those of them who were in the lower part were actually carried off towards the watch-house; one of them is rescued; he goes to a public-house; and says to some people there, why do you suffer people thus to be cut to pieces? and collects some assistants there. Another of the prisoners attacks some of the patrol, to rescue the persons out of their custody; first one stick is taken from him, and then another, and he continues in acts of aggression almost uninterruptedly from the beginning to the end. Other persons are taken into custody up stairs, some of them are conveyed away, and others are kept in custody there. My learned Friend supposes, for the purpose of this argument, that the officers had discharged the whole of their duty, or what they imagined to be their duty. Certainly not, because if they had, they would have left the house; certainly not, because some of them were conducting a man and a woman out of the house; certainly not, because some of them were keeping guard upon the rest of the women who were up stairs, till the other officers, whom they had sent to the watch-house, should return. Then this comes exactly within the decision in Tooley's case and in Hugget's case; the liberty of the people in the house was unlawfully restrained by these officers, and these persons came and assaulted the officers for the purpose of rescuing those people.</p>
               <p>But, my learned Friend states, that the officers had a right to arrest the people who were at the public-house, even without a warrant. I was a little surprized that my learned Friend should state such a position, that, without any warrant, they, not one of them being constables, of the parish of St. Giles, had a right to arrest these poor people, because they were amusing themselves with dancing. I take it that they were acting wrongfully, under colour of authority, and therefore the law does not give them that protection which it does when they act legally. But what will my Friend say to their arrest of the persons in the tap-room, of whom Sullivan was one, who were drinking their beer quietly and peaceably, and to not one of whom can any disorder be imputed, till these fifty-eight officers, armed with cutlasses, rushed into the house; themselves the authors of all the disorder that followed their illegal conduct, the primary cause of all the mischief that ensued.</p>
               <p>My Learned Friend asks, are we to have reformers and speculators upon the law? Are persons to speculate upon the legality or illegality of warrants? I will not answer my learned Friend in my own language, I will answer him in the language of the Judges of England, in the case of Hugget: "If a man be unduly arrested or restrained of his liberty, by three men, although he be quiet himself, and do not endeavour any rescue, yet this is a provocation to all other men of England, not only his friends, but strangers also, for common humanity sake, to endeavour his rescue; and, if in such endeavour of rescue, they kill any one, this is no murder, but only manslaughter." In that case, the persons produced a paper as a warrant; Hugget and the others speculated upon its being no warrant; and the Judges, because they speculated rightly, reduced the offence to manslaughter. Here the prisoners might speculate upon that warrant, which turns out to be illegal; they were acting for the rescue of those persons who were illegally restrained of their liberty; and, therefore, I trust your Lordship will coincide with those great and venerable judges, in reducing the offence to manslaughter. This cannot be imagined to be a case of antecedent malice between the parties, for it does not appear they had ever seen each other before the arrest of the persons in this house, some of whom were conveyed, and others conveying to prison, was the only ground of dissention between them: that unlawful arrest provoked the prisoners to that violent attempt to rescue, in consequence of which the homicide took place.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am sure neither your Lordship, or any one who hears me will suppose that I am justifying the conduct of the prisoners: I am not maintaining that it is commendable for persons to take by violence what is called the law into their own hands; I shall not be supposed to be vindicating their conduct, but I am standing here as an English lawyer, bound to do my duty to my clients: that duty I hope I have now discharged; and I trust, that upon the authority of these cases, your Lordship will be of opinion, that such of the prisoners as are implicated in this transaction are not guilty of the crime with which they stand charged by this indictment, but of the crime of manslaughter only.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Some observations have been made by the learned Gentleman of so strange a nature, that I think they certainly require an answer. The learned Gentleman began by mentioning the case of Sir Harry Ferrers; he says, it arose on a warrant which stiled him Knight, when it caught to have stiled him Baronet, and that therefore they had no right to take up the person whom they did take up. Now that is exactly what I contend for, and so that case approximates to this; for I say that the officers had no right to take Sullivan while he was demeaning himself peaceably and quietly, nor any of those whom they arrested, for there was not one of them an offender against the statute.</p>
               <p>Again, as to the other cases, he has argued in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080037"></xptr>favour, and drawn the chain tighter, if possible, against himself. He says, the persons taken into custody made no resistance; they were taken, and they submitted as they ought to have submitted. So I might say in the case of Hugget; he had submitted, but said, that did not justify the officers, they were still trespassers: the restraint of liberty was improper and illegal, and therefore it was held to be manslaughter only. The same observation applies in the case of the Queen and Tooley; the woman was in custody at the very time, at a distance from the place where the assault was committed, and the prisoners first drew their swords, and attacked the officer, and the heat of passion had abundant time to subside, but what did they do? They made a second attack upon the officers, and drew their swords again; but here the attack is all sudden, no interval, no time for the passion of the human mind to subside, and therefore it is as strong a case in favour of the accused as it can be.</p>
               <p>There is only one observation more. My learned Friend has said, that they had a right, without a warrant, to go into this house: I was surprized to see any lawyer stand up here, and lay down such a position; and he says, it was a public house; admitting that, if it was not a public-house, they would have no right to enter it; that is the sort of argument that he is driven to: but had they a right to enter it as trespassers? Had they a right to take away that man, who was sitting quietly, drinking his pint of beer? Had they a right to take away those persons who were up stairs, where no rogues or va gabonds were assembled? Let me suppose a case, that a number of high and noble persons were to assemble, an a number of officers should come, because they heard a fiddle where they were met, would it be contended they had a right to enter that house, and apprehend them? Certainly not: Then where is the difference? Does the law make any between the rich and poor, the noble and the labourer, the peer and the peasant? Forbid it, justice! the law of England has forbid it! and, I trust in God, it ever will!</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. In this case I have no difficulty at all, because I agree with all the cases that have been cited, and all the learned authorities that have been cited, but those cases only go to prove that if a man, in endeavouring to rescue another who is unlawfully, or whom he supposes is unlawfully arrested, does that in consequence of which death ensues, there, under the circumstances, it may be manslaughter and not murder. I agree to that law; but I shall state to the Jury, when the case comes for me to state it to them, that allowing all that is said by the Counsel to be true respecting those cases, they are to judge whether or not, at the time this unfortunate man was killed, there was not a total end of that illegal imprisonment; and the question for them to determine will be, whether what happened did not happen from a precedent resolution to commit murder upon these officers, because they had done what they had done, that I shall leave to the Jury, and therefore you will go on with your case.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am the landlord of the King's-arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Miller, and the other officers, coming to your house on the 26th of December? - A. I do very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they come? - A. Some minutes past eight; I was in the parlour with two men in company, the parlour door was open; I can see from the parlour door into the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the two men with you? - A. One was Mr. Harris, in undertaker, and the other was Quin, a market man; the officers all rushed in, in a hurry, with their swords over their heads (in this manner); they rushed in at the parlour door; I said, what do you want, gentlemen; one of them said, there is the landlord, handcuff him; I said, what is the matter, I have done nothing amiss; I said, I will go with you without being handcuffed; they would not have me go without being handcuffed; I was very unwilling to be handcuffed, and we had a tussel about it; they handcuffed me, knocked me down, and cut my head with a staff, and my hand with a sword; they threw me back upon a chair, pulled the chair from under me, and put their feet upon my breast; I struggled and got up; then they had the door locked up, and I could neither get out nor no one come in; my wife was there, and they took hold of her, and pulled her by the hair, and tore her cap and handkerchief off; then one of the officers came up; my wife said, you know my husband, do not ill use him, that was to Mr. Jacob, the officer; Jacob advised me to be handcuffed, and go quietly with them; I asked them why they handcuffed me, and they would never let me know the reason.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they show you any warrant? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them for a warrant? - A. I never asked about a warrant, I knew nothing about the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they handcuff any other persons who were with you? - A. Not in the same room, but they took Harris and the other; I did not see them handcuffed; they took them to one watch-house, and me to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any disturbance in your house till the officers came there? - A. They were as quiet as company could be in a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who began the distrubance? - A. I was the first person that had a cut upon my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it created that distrubance? - A. The officers.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you, or the persons with you, any weapons whatever? - A. Not one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080038"></xptr>Q. You had some persons up stairs? - A. Yes, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Dancing to a fiddle? - A. They were having a fiddle, and singing a song very agreeably.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they noisy at all? - A. No, they made so little noise, that you could hardly hear them down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What description of people were they, were they labouring people? - A. They were hardworking, industrious people.</p>
               <p>Q. This was St. Stephen's night? - A. Yes; and in the country they come from, they generally have a merry-making that night; I do not think there were a half a dozen English among them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do know the prisoner, Sullivan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him that night? - A. I saw him standing with his back to the fire in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Sullivan at this time? - A. A very honest, industrious man, and chairman to some lady at St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. Chairman to the Marchioness of Donegal? - A. I have understood so; I do not think he had been four minutes in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you the man that kept this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the very man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These people were thirty or forty Irish? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you Irish yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this club been held at your house? - A. I cannot exactly say how long; I do not know how long the house has been a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Ever since you have had the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of your club? - A. I know of no name for it, only people that behave friendly together.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in custody? - A. Two months, wanting three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember such an expression as this-If you had known the officers had been coming, there should not a man of them have gone away alive? - A. I heard some such expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made use of that expression? - A. That expression was made use of before Sir

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to swear that you never did utter them? - A. I advised them to take care of themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you advise? - A. The officers, that would go freely along with them if they would"me be quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath, what do you mean by advising the officers to take care of themselves -</p>
               <p>Look at the Jury, and explain that? - A. I thought there would be no row at all if they would let me walk along, I would go with one man.</p>
               <p>Q. If they did not let you go free, what was to follow then? - A. I did not know what would be the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you believe they were to be knocked down, if they did not let you go free? - A. No, I had not been there.</p>
               <p>Q. My question to you is, how came you to advise them to take care of themselves? - A. Not to go where the row was in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any row in the street when they took you? - A. We heard something of it at the other end of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was there any row in the street when they took you? - A. I suppose not, because I was inside then; upon my oath there was not a row in the house till I got out of it; and when I got outside the door, I said, let us go this way, and take care of ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not say, that if you had known, there should not one of them come away alive? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you say it? - A. At no time that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you tell me, that I did not say that at that time? - A. I did not say it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Irishmen had you in your house that night? - A. I did not go into the room that night to see how many were there.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot form any guess, unless you went up stairs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them come in? - A. I saw some come in and some go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have no kind of guess how many you might have? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many since that time have been taken up as deserters? - A. I do not know of any deserters.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were there not two taken out of your house, and committed as deserters? - A. I heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how many persons have been taken up in your house within a week of that time? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have any been taken up within a week of that time? - A. There were not, as I know of; I never asked any body who or what he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to pledge yourself, upon your oath, that your house was quiet at the time this Cock and Hen club was going on? - A. There was not the least noise or falling out, or riot, in any company in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You said to the officers, if they would let you speak, there would be no <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080039"></xptr>disturbance? - A. Yes; I offered to go singly with any single man of them.</p>
               <p>Q. And you heard a row near the door? - A. Yes, on the right hand side, and I advised them to turn to the left, and so they did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many doors off might that be? - A. As nigh as I can imagine, it might be six or seven doors off; it was a very dark night, I could hardly see four yards before me; there were only three lamps in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is the street? - A. I suppose four times as long as this Court.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a carpenter and undertaker, in business for myself, I keep a house in Swallow-street: On the 26th of December, I was drinking a glass of rum and water, in the parlour, at Mr. Flannery's.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner did the officers come into the house? - A. I had been there about ten minutes, and the officers came in, I heard a great noise like the rustling of so many horses; after that, several men came into the room, six or seven, to the best of my knowledge, they had got cutlasses in their hands; they then laid hold of the landlord of the house, and he asked what it was for; he said he would go quietly with them, not to use him ill; they said, come, come, that will not do, and endeavoured to handcuff him; they had a long tussel, and after that, they got him down upon the floor, he got up again; he asked them repeatedly again, what it was for, and said he would go with them, he had done nothing amiss; they then had another struggle, and after that they handcuffed him, and got him down a second time; and after he was handcuffed they opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got him down, was any thing done to him? - A. To the best of my knowledge, two of them learned upon his stomach with their knees.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who the men were? - A. I did not, they were two of the patrol.</p>


               <p>Q. Was Flannery at all hurt? - A. He was, with a staff, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he hurt any where else? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any weapons at all? - A. No; they had cutlasses; they then handcuffed me; there was another person that they handcuffed with me, and then they took us out of the house together; I repeatedly asked what it was for, and could not get any intelligence; they took us to Covent-garden watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you doing any thing more than drinking a glass of rum and water quietly? - A. Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it began the disturbance and riot? - A. The officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Would there have been any disturbance if they had not come? - A. None in the world; I did not know there had been any body else in the taproom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not know there were any persons up stairs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did not hear them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been thirty or forty persons in the room you must have heard them? - A. I did not hear them at all; I had not been in the house ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard the fiddle playing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any dancing? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you hear any noise over your head arise from dancing? - A. None in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only disturbance was the officers coming in, and the resistance of the landlord by a struggling with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you heard nobody come down stairs from the club-room at all into the parlour where you were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in that house before? - A. Once.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of this Cock and Hen club kept at that house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did the landlord resist for any other reason than because they would not tell him what they wanted him for? - A. Nothing else.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080040"></xptr>The prisoner, Sullivan, called eight, Brian three, and Holland six witnesses, who gave them an excellent character for peaceable and quiet behaviour.</p>
               <p>Summing up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. Gentlemen of the Jury. This indictment charges the prisoners at the bar with the most serious and heavy offence, of which, during your attendance here, you have had occasion to enquire; indeed, it is the most beinous offence that can exist in society: that of one man committing murder upon another.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, at the outset of this business, there were ten persons who were accused of this crime, but the candour of the Counsel for the prosecution have eased you and me of some trouble, because, they have fairly acknowledged, that the evidence is hardly so strong against six out of the ten as to induce them to expect you to convict; for, undoubtedly, nothing but proof, amounting to clear conviction, in the minds of a Jury, ought to convict any man of a crime, more especially so heinous and important a crime as that of murder.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I will state to you, in a very few words, what I take the law to be upon this subject; and I will then state to you what the question for your peculiar attention is; I will then read to you the evidence, and in going through that evidence, I will make, as I go on, such remarks, upon what the different witnesses may say that at all comes home to the point in question, as seems to me material, or that will at all direct your verdict. Gentlemen, the crime of murder is the killing a man of malice aforethought, as it is said; and, Gentlemen, wherever one man is proved to have killed another, the law presumes malice; and it is then incumbent upon that man, against whom the killing is proved, to shew, by evidence, that it does not amount to the serious crime of murder, but that it is either manslaughter, or self defence, or something or other which may fairly justify the person who committed the act, in doing what he did.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, In the present case, much has been said to you, and cases have been cited to you, (all of which I have no sort of objection to your recollecting, as far as you can) to induce you to suppose that the law of those cases is applicable to this case, that these prisoners are not guilty, upon the ground, that they interfered only for the purpose of rescuing some people who were illegally taken up. Now, Gentlemen, upon that subject, I will not enquire whether this warrant was perfectly legal or not; perhaps there might, in strictness, be some objections to the warrant, but still, if a man is taken up by an illegal warrant, and the person who takes him up, after the business is over, goes about his business, and there is an end of it, why no other man has a right to suppose he is to go and kill the person who has executed the warrant, and, therefore, the question in this case is not the question that was made in some of the cases you have heard; for in those cases, the persons were endeavouring to rescue others illegally taken up, and in the course of that rescue it happened that somebody or other was killed; the Jury, upon that occasion, said, or the Court said, that that was not that sort of killing called murder, but that it was manslaughter; now I take the present question to be of another sort, and if it is not of that sort I tell you, you should acquit the prisoners, which is this: I take the question to be, whether that which has been done, supposing it to be done by the prisoners, has not been done in prosecution of a premeditated design in the prisoners, or some of them, to weak their vengeance upon the constables, and, in so doing, this murder was committed. You will therefore consider, whether the killing of this man, which I tell you is murder, till the contrary is proved, has not happened from a premeditated design in the prisoners to wreak their vengeance upon the constables, and desiring so to wreak their vengeance upon the constables, this accident has happened; for after this business was over, that is, after these people were taken into custody, these persons being in the house, and there being no person to rescue, they violently, and with cutlasses, did that from which death ensues, why, to be fare, there is no pretence to say that that was for the purpose of rescue; but it was for the purpose of wreaking their vengeance upon them for something they did not like. I wish you, therefore, to attend to this: whether they did it for the purpose of rescuing; if you think so, you will tell me so, or say they are only guilty of manslaughter; but if they did it not for the purpose of rescuing, but from some premeditated malice, entertained by them against the person of the deceased as one of the officers, then, to be sure, the case differs from all those circumstances you have have had read to you, and it is in point of law murder; and therefore I wish to put the question to you, whether you think the prisoners have done it in consequence of premeditated malice, for the purpose of wreaking their vengeance upon them, for having done that which was not perfectly agreeable to them. Now, I will read to you the evidence, which is pretty long, in the best manner I am able.</p>
               <p>(Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence for the prosecution).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This is the evidence on the part of the prosecution; and now, Gentlemen, in order to induce you to believe, either that this evidence is not true, or that the officers were the only persons to blame, and that this sort of accusation against the prisoners at the bar is not at all founded, they call two witnesses, or three, whose evidence I will read to you; (reads it). Gentlemen, this is the evidence on the part of the prisoners; to contradict the fact, or to make such impressions on your minds as it ought to make, to induce you to believe, that in reality what has been deposed on the part of the prosecution is not true; the other evidence that has been brought, has been to the character of the witnesses, and I will read you that: (reads it).</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, this is the evidence to character; and all I shall say upon the subject of character is this: if, upon considering the circumstances of the case, you are doubtful whether the prisoners are guilty, take what has been said of their characters into your consideration, and if you think it sit to weigh in favour of innocence, let it have its weight; at the same time, it is my duty to make one observation: that it is extraordinary that all these prisoners should have had the character of being sober, honest, and quiet, quiet in particular, when they are found, on the 26th of December, at night, collected together in the form of a club, forty or fifty of them, a Cock and Hen club, with dancing, and singing, and fiddling, and doing what you have heard done; at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080041"></xptr>same time, as far as character can go, let it weigh with you; why then the question is, whether the accident that has happened to the unfortunate deceased was not in consequence of something done in prosecution of a premeditated plan, for the purpose of wreaking vengeance upon the constables, and not for the purpose of rescuing any one.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you find, with respect to Brian, no less than six witnesses who speak to him, and you find their evidence introduces him, first in the street with a stick, committing violence before the disturbance took place in the tap-room; next you find him in the tap-room; and then you find him in the same street after the disturbance took place. Gentlemen, you recollect the whole of his conduct, I will not repeat it to you, but you will judge from his conduct, and from the conduct of the rest, whether the whole of this scene did not proceed from premeditated malice against the officers, who were doing their duty in executing, as far as they could, this warrant, legal or illegal, for I put it so to you; and you will recollect, it appears, by the majority of the witnesses, that at the time that these men, I mean the persons who are at the bar, and the other persons, went into the tap-room, there was no pretence to say, when the mischief happened to the deceased, there was a creature they could liberate, the persons were all gone; and if the purpose of liberating any body had been their purpose, we should have heard who they had liberated; but if it was their purpose to liberate, what occasion had one or two persons to give the officers severe blows, such as might have put an end to others as well as this man; and what occasion was there to have struck this poor creature who is dead upon his legs, upon his arms, and other parts, which there is no occasion to mention; but that is not all, for this man was not the particular object, for almost all the officers, called to you, one or other of them, as they happened to be in the tap-room, received different blows from different parts of this party, who were combined together for the purpose, that I think you see very clearly. Well, thus it stands as to Brian; with respect to him, it seems the strongest evidence that is given.</p>
               <p>As to Donohough, you will recollect what they say respecting the swing of the stick; it is strong, but not the same number of witnesses as respecting Brian; the witnesses who speak to him are, Miller and Smith; you have heard the evidence, I will only take notice, that there are not so many different acts proved with respect to him as with respect to Brian. With respect to Holland, I make the same observation; as to him, Miller is one witnesses, to be sure, a very strong one, and Egan is another witnesses, and the facts are very strong, if you believe the evidence, when I observe, that with respect to one there are six witnesses, and with respect to another only two; I do not mean that those two witnesses may not prove facts as decisive and as strong as the others; but I think it my duty to state that circumstances to you, that there are not so many witnesses; one of them proved a very strong circumstance indeed, the circumstances of striking a blow upon the leg, which was confirmed by she surgeon.</p>
               <p>With respect to Sullivan and, the character you have heard, there are no less than time different witnesses; one of them proves him to have been in the mob, and apparently consulting and concerting what should be done. Now these are the witnesses who say any thing material with respect to the prisoners, I have stated to you the evidence, and, if you are satisfied that that which was done was done in prosecution of a premeditated plan and design for the purpose of wreaking vengeance on the constables, then undoubtedly it is murder; if you can believe it was done in consequence of any other plan, if there is any thing which can justify you in saying that their crime is manslaughter, according to that which has been argued by the Counsel for the prisoners, and not murder, why then, in that case, you will say they are guilty of manslaughter, and not of murder, but you will observe the difference: I stated to you, that those cases which were stated from the different books were cases in which rescue was attempted of made, and the death happened pending the rescue: then apply all that, and find, if you can, an attempt to rescue; you cannot, according to my idea, but it is for you to determine: it cannot be contended, as it seems to me, that it was done in prosecution of such an attempt; at the same time, if you have the least reason in your minds to say it was not done with that premeditated malice, you must find them guilty of manslaughter: but, remember how material it is in this great town, that the peace should be preserved, and how material it is, that persons, if they will meet in such clubs, should keep themselves quietly, soberly, and according to law, I say, if you recollect that, and then attend to this evidence, and are satisfied in your own minds that these men had the pernicious, premeditated plan, of doing mischief to the officers, and not of a rescue, then your duty to the public calls upon you to say they are guilty of murder, and not of manslaughter. However, you will lay your heads together, and I am very happy to observe, in a case like this, that you have given such attention as you have given. I am firmly persuaded, that when you lay your heads together, your verdict will be formed upon good sense and justice, and that, with that verdict, the public will be perfectly satisfied.</p>

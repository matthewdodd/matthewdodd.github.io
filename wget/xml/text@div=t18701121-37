                  </hi>. I am managing clerk of the Foreign Department, in Messrs. Stubba' Mercantile Agency—my attention was directed to the col<lb></lb>lections for the relief of the sick and wounded in the war, in consequence of which I went to Messrs. Coutta', and had a conversation with them, and on the 1st September I went to the defendant's office, at 8, Gracechurch Street—I found "Emigration Agency" up on the door—I went several times between the 1st and the 18th, and then I found that "Emigration Agency" had been painted out, and "Society for the Relief of the Sick and Wounded in the War" in its place—I saw the defendant on 1st September—I asked him if his name was Whellams, and he said "Yes"—I asked if he was the person whose name appeared on the boxes—he said "Yes"—I asked him what security the public had to know that the moneys that were put into those boxes were properly applied for the purposes of the charity—he said he himself was the security—I said "What security can you give yourself; would it not be better to have a committee of three gentlemen, say, an English gentleman, a French gentle-man, and a German gentleman, to come and attend the opening of the boxes at night, to see that all was right?"—he said I was exceedingly im<lb></lb>pertinent, to make these remarks, and that be acted under the authority of the Society, at 2, St. Martin's Place, and he showed me two papers in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187011210065"></xptr>
               <p>proof; one was a blank paper, marked with a red cross at the top, and was a subscription lift for the Society in aid of the Sick and Wounded, and the committee set out—he said I was very impertinent, and if I did not go out I should get a kick—that was all that passed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the boxes I referred to; but the first box I saw had not got the name of the collector on it—in other respects it was the same sort of her—I had seen the boxes carried about by boys—between the 24th August and 18th October I suppose I saw between 400 and 500, or 300 and 400—on 18th October I went and saw the prisoner again; he case out of his office, and spoke to me on the landing—I said I had come for the same purpose as before, I wanted information—he ceiled me a meddling, impertinent fellow, and he referred me to the National Society, and to Coutts bank, for information—I told him I had been there, and I was referred back to him—he said he had no information to give me, and if I did not leave the premises, he would order the porter to remove me by force—he called on a friend of his, who he said was Colonel Dowling, who also threatened to kick me—he introduced him to me as "My friend, Colonel Dowling"—he was down stairs, and he lifted his foot—he called on the porter to remove me, and I was kicked down three steps by the porter—I had subscribed to these boxes—I told the prisoner so on 1st September, and I subscribed afterwards, several times, and I mentioned that on 18th October.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not go to the National Society, or to Coutt's bank, and ask them to prosecute I can't say whether say member of the firm went—I called myself the prosecutor, at Guildhall—I was the pro<lb></lb>secutor then—I told you then that I was not instructed by the National Society, but I prosecuted, because I took a fancy to it—no one instructed me to put pennies in the boxes, I did it of my own free will—I am a German, and I found it was for a German object—I charged Mr. Whellams and his servant Hallam with an assault, first of all—the case of assault was dismissed—the Magistrate said it was a most trivial charge—I don't know that I hare said before that I went to Mr. Whellam's several times—I may not have been asked the question—Mr. Whellams told me that the amounts collected were regularly entered in the books, and that the Society knew all about it, speaking of the Society at 2, St. Martin's Place—he did not explain to me the system that he adopted—I did not go to his place intoxi<lb></lb>cated—I was never drunk in my life—I hare told you that Hallam kicked me down stain—that was the charge brought against him at Guildhall—he did not kick me with his foot, he took me by the shoulders; it was the Colonel who threatened to kick me, and lifted his foot—I said at Guildhall that I had seen the prisoner driving about in a dog-cart with a very fine horse, end straw<lb></lb>coloured gloves—I did not say chocolate gloves, or a high-stepping horse—I think the reporter drew rather on his imagination—I saw him driving a kind of dog cart, and a good hone; if the reporter called it a high-stopping one, I can't help it.</p>

            . On the 10th of May, between twelve and one, I went up stairs to put my things on; and I brought my things down into the parlour; as I was coming down stairs, the prisoner was in the drawing room selling some oranges to my lodger, and my lodger asked me to accept of an orange; I went into the drawing room, and accepted a couple of oranges from the lady, and we all came down into the parlour; the prisoner went in with me, and my parlour lodger bought some more oranges of her; I laid my cushion down on the parlour table, with this gold pin stuck into it; the prisoner went away; I put on my clothes, and missed the pin; I searched diligently after it, but could not find it; from thence I went out, to pursue this woman; I found her in Mortimer-street; I asked her how she came to take the pin away; she did not deny having it, but said, she did not take it with intent to keep it, but was just going back to remit it to me again: we went to Justice Read's, and she was committed: the value of the pin is five shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel. I have friends here.</p>

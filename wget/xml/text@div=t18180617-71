On Monday the 18th of May, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, looked at some things at the door, he then came in and asked the price of velveteen breeches; I took down a pile of breeches from the shelf, and shewed them to him - He asked if he could try them on - He took two pair into the passage, by the side of the parlour, to try on. A young man came to the door and asked about some clothes. When the prisoner came out of the passage, he said one pair were too large, and the other too small; I said I had more, and went round the counter to look for them, I then missed one pair which I knew I had left on the counter. I told him I did not know what had become of them; he asked me if I thought he had them? I said I did not know what to think. I went round the counter, saw his coat-pockets stick out, and felt them. He said I was coming very close; I said Yes; because I had lost a pair of breeches. He said I might strip him if I liked. While I was looking for them he went out, I sent my daughter after him, he said he would not come back; I then sent my man for him. The constable brought him back, and found the breeches upon him. I gave him in charge.</p>

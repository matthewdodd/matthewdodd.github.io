                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman D</hi> 73). On the night of 6th Nov. I was on duty near Grove-street, and in consequence of hearing a cry of "Murder!" I went to 14, Little Grove-street, with Milton, and found the prisoner's father standing at the door in his shirt—in consequence of what he said, we went into the back-yard in search of the prisoner—Milton was looking into the wash-house for him—I heard something on the wall on the opposite side, looked up and saw the prisoner throw this stone(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) on to Milton's back—it knocked him down into the wash-house—I picked him up and he was almost senseless—he came <hi rend="italic">round</hi> in a minute or two—I went into the next yard, and the prisoner said, "Here I am"—I told him he must go with me to the station—he went a few steps and then kicked me on the leg, and tried to escape—I used my staff, and took him to the station.</p>

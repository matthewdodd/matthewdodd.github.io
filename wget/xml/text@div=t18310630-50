On Saturday night, the 28th of May, I was passing his shop about eleven o'clock, or a little after - I saw the prisoner standing by the side of his shop with a piece of meat of some description in his hand; he put it into his basket and went away - I gave information to Mr. Somers, Jun., who pursued him, and brought him back; I saw the basket examined - it contained a piece of salt-beef and a loin of lamb; he begged forgiveness - he said he took the beef from distress, and the lamb he had bought and paid for.</p>

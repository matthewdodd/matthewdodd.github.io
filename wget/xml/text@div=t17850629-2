               <p>The Indictment was opened by Mr. Knowles; and the Case by Mr. Silvester, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner at the bar was <rs id="t17850629-2-deflabel10" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17850629-2-defend61 t17850629-2-deflabel10"></join> to Mr. Parsloe, who kept a subscription-house in St. James's-street; and this is a case which must from the nature of it depend on circumstances; it is necessary I should lay all the circumstances before you, that you may be enabled to judge whether they are sufficient to convince you in your minds of the guilt of the prisoner at the bar. On Friday the 8th of April, the day before the fire, Mr. Parsloe had been bottling some wine, and he finished it about nine; he ordered his porter to remove the straw, and take it to a back part of the house, every thing was perfectly safe at that time; about ten, a servant was ordered to go down into the cellar for some beer, and he went without a candle, and at that time there was no light; some time afterwards he went down again for some more beer, without a candle; and then every thing was safe; the boy desired the porter to lend him a candle to go and draw some beer for himself; says he I choose to have my beer cold; he took a candle, and went down into the cellar, and returned a few minutes after, and being asked for the candle, he said he had dropped it; the servants thought nothing then, but in a few minutes after they were alarmed with the smell of fire, and they found that some straw had been set on fire, not in the beer cellar; and that some corks that were upon some prickles for bottles were consumed: however, this was soon put out with some water; and the boy on going to bed was very inquisitive among the servants, whether supposing his master's house had been burnt, it would have ruined him or not; says he, I suppose if it was burnt down, then he would be ruined, and then he must turn me over, he would have no business for me; that night they sat up, but no more alarm happened; the next day in the afternoon, about six, or a quarter before, a Miss Wheeler, the daughter of Mrs. Parsloe, and a Mrs . Murrel, another daughter, had been up stairs; for as this is a house in the public way, their apartments were up stairs ; the last person that went up stairs was Mrs. Murrel; she came down from her own room, and went into her sister's room, for the purpose of shutting the windows; that was the room where the fire began; she said, she would not shut the windows, and she came down without a candle, and every thing was safe at that time; the boy at this time was very particular in his enquiries, whether all the family were at tea, and whether the ladies were at tea; they said yes; and while the waiter was going to clean some glasses, he observed the boy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290006"></xptr> with a candle; he asked him to lend it him; says the boy no, I cannot lend you the candle, but I will stand by you and light you; while he was in the act of cleaning the glasses, and this boy holding the candle, the bell rang, the waiter left the boy in this closet with a candle, and went into his master's room with a decanter which was called for; there are two staircases to this house, and this boy stood at the glass-closet, near the two pair of stairs; the waiter having got the decanter carried it up the great stair-case, and when he got up the one pair of stairs, he met this boy coming down the two pair of stairs great stair-case without a candle; he was coming down in a great hurry, and went into the hall; in a very few minutes afterwards a cracking was heard in the room upstairs, Miss Wheeler's ro om, which had been left perfectly safe a few minutes before; the servants said, what is that cracking, the boy immediately said, there is a fire in my master's house? the fire was exceeding rapid, and the house was intirely consumed. Gentlemen, these are the facts to bring this charge home to the prisoner; the magistrate thought proper to commit him, and you are to judge from those circumstances, and some others, of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner. Offences of this kind must always from the nature of the case depend upon circumstances, because if persons are wicked enough to set fire to the house of another, they always do it with that degree of caution, not that they shall be seen in the very act; but if these circumstances, when put together, are strong enough to convince you that this boy was the perpetrator of the offence, you will say so; if not, I am sure from the knowledge I have of you, you will do your duty in acquitting him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am fifteen.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. On the Friday I was bottling some wine by the cellar, and there were some prickles stood there, and I ordered the porter to take them away, they were full of straw, and I told the boy to light him, that was about eight ; they were carried away, and the prisoner lighted the porter up the garden with them; I then went up stairs to clean myself, and about ten I had some bread and cheese, and about half after ten one of the maid servants came up, and said the cellar was on fire; upon that we all came down stairs, and there were some people came, and I went down to the door that led to the cellar, and we kept the door fast for fear it should get a head, and the people went into the street and threw some water, and put the fire out, the fire was near to the cellar door.</p>
               <p>[The plan of the house and cellar shewn to the Court.]</p>
               <p>Court. Was this fire within the house? - Yes, by the passage leading to the cellar door.</p>
               <p>What was on fire there? - There was corks in a basket, and several bottles broke, and a paper bag; it was put out, and I and one of my daughters sat up till four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose nobody had seen this, were those corks near any combustible matter, or any part of the house? - It was quite close to the wall.</p>
               <p>What was the wall built of? - Brick and plaister; there was a shelf which was standing over the prickles.</p>
               <p>What was the floor? - It was a stone floor.</p>
               <p>Then there was no likelihood of this communicating to the house? - Yes, my Lord, there was an oil cask stood very near it, with thirty-six gallons of oil in it.</p>
               <p>How near? - At a very little distance.</p>
               <p>What do you call a very little distance? - About three yards</p>
               <p>How long had it been there? - About two days; I staid up till about four in the morning, and every thing was perfectly safe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290007"></xptr>Mr. Silvester. After the straw and the hamper had been removed, had any body any occasion to go into that place? - No, it was shut up, nobody had any business there, they could go to it two or three ways.</p>
               <p>Was the way to it through the beer cellar? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Which way were they to get to it then? Look at this plan.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. He can state the fact without the plan ; I know nothing of the authenticity of the plan.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no occasion to look at the plan.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Could they go to this place from the beer cellar? - Yes, on the Saturday I was drinking tea, between six and seven, and one of my daughters said, I think I smell a smell of fire now, no says my wife, there is nothing but what happened last night; I opened my door and saw my house all in flames, in consequence of which my house was burnt down to the ground.</p>

               <p>Jury. Had you any words with the boy? - He ran away from me three times, he never made any complaint; I had no suspicion of the boy, till I was informed by some of the servants, and I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe after the boy was taken up and sent to the watch-house you was so good to send him some money? - I believe I sent him a shilling.</p>
               <p>There were many applications made to him whilst he was in custody, to confess that he set the house on fire? - Only myself , I went to him, and pressed him a good deal, but he always said he did not.</p>
               <p>As to the situation of this place, it is a strong arch, I take it for granted? - No, it is not an arch.</p>
               <p>It is bricked then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was at the distance of three or four yards from this oil? - Three yards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I am desired to ask a fact, was this boy taken up by you before? - He had run away three times.</p>
               <p>Had you chastised him, or punished him in any way? - No, never, Sir, only told him to be a good boy.</p>

               <p>Where was he standing when he said that? - He was out of the door about three or four steps.</p>

               <p>I am a waiter at this house, on Saturday evening about a quarter past six, as I was standing in the passage leading to Mr. Parsloe's sitting room, the prisoner came by me to the larder with a lighted candle, the glass closet is close to the larder, where I was standing between the back stairs and the hall stairs, and on his return I asked him to lend me the candle, he told me he could not spare it, but he was not in a hurry, he would stop and light me, I asked him whether he was in a hurry, he said, he was not, he stopped there some minutes, I took away my glasses, and left him there; I do not know which way he went, it might be twenty minutes after that, that I saw him coming down the best stair case from the first landing without either candle or candlestick.</p>
               <p>How soon after you saw him was the alarm of fire? - I believe twenty-five minutes or half an hour, as near as I can say, where I left him was between the back stairs and the servants hall, I saw him afterwards coming down the great stairs, I do not know where he came from, he had no business that way; from the time that I saw him in the passage, to the time I saw him coming down the great stairs, was twenty-five minutes.</p>
               <p>How long was it between your seeing him without a candle, and the alarm of fire? - Five or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you say anything to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first saw him with the candle, he was about his necessary business? - I believe he was, he had business in the larder, but he might have fetched anything without a candle.</p>
               <p>Why, you wanted a candle yourself? - I could not see to wipe the glasses so clean.</p>
               <p>Why, then it was necessary for him to have a candle? - When I met him, I asked him where he had been, and he made no reply.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What occasioned you to leave off wiping your glasses? - To carry them into their proper place, then I carried a bottle of wine into the colonel's room, I went only once into the prosecutor's parlour; the larder and the glass closet, and the stairs, are close by the parlour, you must go by all them to go to it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290011"></xptr> when the parlour door is open you may see the two stairs, in some situations of that room, there are frequent occasions for the servants and others to go into that parlour.</p>
               <p>The fire was very rapid? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When he was coming down the best stair-case, might he possibly be coming down from the parlour? - I met him on the one pair of stairs , on my left hand; you might go from the parlour door, but it was usual for the servants to go on the back stairs.</p>
               <p>The parlour is on the ground floor? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you ever given any particular description of the found of that foot? - I thought it was a woman's step, I could not particularly tell, it was not so heavy as a man's; I have described it to be the sound of a woman's, or some other person not so heavy as a man; I had been in bed eight or nine days, from an accident; the prisoner knew I was ill, and knew where I lay, my room door was wide open.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived at the house? - Almost three years, I have observed the boy's character and conduct; I never knew any blemish of his character, I had never any doubt of him before, I thought him an orderly well-behaved boy.</p>

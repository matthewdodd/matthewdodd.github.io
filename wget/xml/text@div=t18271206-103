On the 25th of November, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was in bed, in my room; my husband was gone out for milk. I heard a noise at the shop-door, and called out "Who is there?" twice, and received no answer; I called again, and the prisoner answered, "Me, don't you know me?" I said "No, what do you want?" he said,"Some tobacco, can't you serve me?" I said "No, I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060069"></xptr>in bed, my husband will be in shortly;" he said he would come again in a quarter of an hour; I heard a bustle, got to the foot of my bed, looked into the shop, and saw him lifting the basket of chesnuts - I ran out just as I was, and caught hold of him; he got away from me with the basket. I said, "I know you;" he has been in my shop before and taken things - I have cautioned him about it; he drew me to the street-door, and then I drew back; he took the basket out, but dropped the chesnuts about the street; he was taken on the Tuesday following - he lived a little way off.</p>

            . I live in Ram-alley, and am a willow-cutter; the prisoner has lodged with me for two years, and works for me. Last Sunday week, at the time this robbery is charged, he was in bed; I will swear before God, my maker, I roused him up myself at eight o'clock, and sent him to this very shop for a pint of beer - I did not send him there, but her husband tells me he went there - he brought no basket back; I heard the clock strike eight, and then roused him, as I often do, for he is fond of sleep. I know the clock struck eight, but the husband told me he came a quarter before eight, and the woman said it was a few minutes to seven, which I know to be false - I counted the clock particularly that morning.</p>

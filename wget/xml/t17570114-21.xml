On the 15th of December, in the evening, I was sent for, and informed somebody were stealing my bricks. I went there, and all I can say is, that the bricks are my property that lay there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether any were missing from the heap ?</p>

               <p>Q. Have you heard the prisoner say any thing about them?</p>
               <p>Jefferson. He beg'd I'd be favourable to him, and said it was so trifling a thing he thought I could not be off from pardoning him for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him accused of taking any ?</p>
               <p>Jefferson. I did; but can't say he did immediately own it.</p>

            . I live close by where the brick-heap was. I stood by my door and saw a man come and carry away several baskets full of bricks from that heap. I thought I'd detect him. When he came again and fill'd his basket I went and laid hold of him. He said he'd do so no more. I asked him where he carried them. He said, into Purpool-Lane. I asked him what to do. He said, they were to build up a job, in mending a chimney. I carried him into the yard. We charged a constable with him. There came the bricklayer that he was stealing the bricks for. I took him and carried him into the yard also; but he got over the place, and so got away.</p>

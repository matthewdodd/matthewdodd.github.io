            , No. 13, St. Martin's-court. When I read the order I told the prisoner it was not Mr. Barnes's writing; he said Mr. Barnes was out, and Mrs. Barnes wrote it - I believed that, and gave him the goods he applied for. Mr. Barnes came to our house on the 2d of April, and I asked him how he approved of the articles; I then found I had been imposed upon. About half-past five o'clock the same evening the prisoner brought another order for two more of the same kind, as from Mr. Barnes; we sent for an officer, and gave charge of him. I knew he had formerly worked for Mr. Barnes, and supposed all was right.</p>
               <p>HENRY BARNES. I deal with Mr. Moreland. The prisoner had been in my employ about seven years, but had left me about nine months; he had no authority to apply for any umbrellas, on my account, on the 31st of March - he had no order given him to get them, and I have never seen them.</p>

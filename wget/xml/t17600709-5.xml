She denied having any thing but what was her own. I told her, she had better own it, for they were certain that she had robb'd them, and it might be the better for her; she still denied it; I said there is the constable below stairs, and we must search. Then she said, she would go up and open her box, and cry'd. She opened the box, and in it were found these goods mentioned.

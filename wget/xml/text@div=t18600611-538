                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). On 4th June, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was on the premises of Mr. Vonder Heyde, a whole<lb></lb>sale tobacconist in Thames-street—I saw the prisoner there—he was in Mr. Vonder Heyde's employment—he took a parcel from underneath the counter—he gave it to a boy to take to a public-house next door, to be left till called for—I was in the shop at this time, in plain clothes; I could hear what was said—I saw the prisoner go out of the warehouse about 7 o'clock, or a little after—I was at the public-house door then—he went into the public-house and got the parcel—directly he saw me he walked iu at the private bar of the public-house—in there I asked him what he had got in that parcel—he said, "A pound and a half of tobacco"—I asked him whether he had got an invoice for it—he said, "No"—I told him that I was a detective officer—I asked him whether it was entered in the book—he said, "No"—I asked him whether Mr. Vonder Heyde was aware that he took the tobacco—he said, "Yes"—I asked him where he was going to take it to—he said to a friend of his named Scrivener at Mile-end—he said it was for a friend of Mr. Scrivener's, that he was in the habit of supplying his friend with tobacco and charging him wholesale price for it—he wanted me to accompany him to Mile-end; I declined to go—I took him to the station, where he was searched—on him were found twelve cigars and a case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, four coins, and a fusee box—I went to his lodgings; I found there this tobacco, and this snuff-box—there is a pound and a half of the tobacco.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale tobacco manufacturer in Lower Thames-street, City—the prisoner was foreman and shopman in my employment—I have looked at this tobacco—to the best of my belief it is mine—I have similar tobacco in my shop—this snuff-box is my property—the prisoner had no right to remove any of those articles from my premises without making an entry of themvthere is no entry made of this—I have not got my book here—I only knew from the policeman, of the prisoner</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then he had the right to take them out if he entered them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If there had been an order to a customer in the usual course of business, he would have taken them out, and have made the entry—he is a salesman—I do not know that he sometimes takes goods out for sale to people, besides those he serves in the shop—he has to account to me for so much tobacco or so much money—I have had no opportunity of seeing him after the policeman communicated with me—it is an impossibility to tell whether he has taken it out of the bulk or not—we make him responsible for the contents of the drawer—we judge by his returns whether they are correct or not—the bulk is in the warehouse—if the prisoner had wanted anything of the sort he would have put in the book the quantity that he required, and showed that to another man who would have signed his initials to the bookvthe drawer contained four or five or half a dozen pounds—it will hold as much as twelve if it is filled—it is not always full—I do not put it in myself—the cutter puts in what the prisoner orders—supposing the prisoner wished for twelve pounds in the drawer, there is room for it; he could put it in, and then it would be entered against him, and he would have to account for so much, or so much money—if he wanted it from the store he would have to apply to the man who supplies it to him—there are several men about the place who give it out from the store—there is the cutter, and another man, and the boy—the prisoner might, by applying to one of them, get it from the store, and it would be entered in his book—he enters it, and the man who supplies it, puts his initials as having supplied it—I have not any book here—the prisoner has been with me, I think, about three years and a half—about from 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money would pass through his hands in the course of a week—he has filled the same place there the whole time—he is a counter man; to attend to the counter department, which is the ready money part.</p>

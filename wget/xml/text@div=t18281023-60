            . I am a labourer in the East India Company's employ, and am also an officer. I was directed by Fraser on the 19th of September, to station myself in the warehouse, No. 19; I concealed myself there about eight o'clock in the morning - in the afternoon the prisoner came into a little room, about half-past one o'clock; I had noticed this chest of tea particularly; it was about the centre of the room - the floor near it was perfectly clean; the prisoner came to the first window, stopped there about a minute, and then walked round, feeling with his feet, as if to see if any one was secreted there; the men at times conceal themselves there to sleep - he then went to the chest, moved part of the head, and put his hand in - he took something out, which he smelt, and returned it to the chest; he took something more out, and walked away with it in his hand; he came back in five minutes, and was going to return to the chest, but a noise occurred, which prevented him - he went away; I waited two hours - nobody else came, and I then informed Barber and Fraser; after the prisoner left the chest, there was some tea sprinkled on the floor, in two places; he was sent for, and I told him I suspected he had something belonging to the Company; he said he had not - I said it was my duty to search him, and if he had, to produce it; he then pulled some tea from his trousers pocket - I said I was not satisfied, and in searching him found a small packet more of tea on him, and in his right-hand coat pocket a 4lbs. weight, such as the Company use; he said he had had one before, and was going to take that home to pound something with, and would bring it back, and that he had obtained Mr. Barber's leave to do so - Barber said he had not; we allow nothing to go off the premises: these weights are made particularly for the Company - the tea weighed about three quarters of an ounce, besides what was spilt; I kept the weight in my possession, and gave the tea to the Excise-officer.</p>

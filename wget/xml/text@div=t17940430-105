               <p>Q. Did you ever see your cloth again? - Yes, at Justice Davis's office, in Lambeth-street. When I went the next day they both strictly denied that they had the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you perfectly sober? - I drank no more than what I have told you, I had nothing stronger than tea before I came to that public house.</p>

On Friday, being Good Friday, the prosecutor came to me again, and asked if Solomon or Sullivan had left a bundle or parcel in my bar, I told him no, there is nothing left there; he says it is very odd what they have done with it, he said down by Whitechapel they took it from me; this past till Saturday when

After that I was informed that Nowland had taken Askins. I went to different shops to see if I could find the cloth about Bishopsgate-street, but I could not find any thing of it, but in the course of two or three days afterwards, I was told that it was pawned at a shop in Holborn, I went there and asked for a piece of cloth pawned for five shillings; which the pawnbroker produced.</p>

This gentleman he came up for Sullivan, being an East India pensioner, he sent for him to drink a pot of beer with him, Sullivan goes down and I thought he had no money, I goes with my shirt sleeves into the tap-room, and the prosecutor was asking this man several questions as, why he did not get himself shaved? they asked me to drink, my shopmate had one pot and I another, and he calls for a pot, and there was three quarterns of gin called for, that was drank, and there were three more called for, that was drank, and he called for three more himself, and he invites this man to go down to get his pension tickets at the Rising Sun, at Wapping, and Mr. Sullivan asked me if I would go too, I said I would get my clothes on and follow them, by the time I got up to them they had both broke a pane of glass, they were both drunk, I came up, and there were a par<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300164"></xptr>cel of Jews about them, they were both holding a test to have this glass paid for, and I takes them down to the coach stand, at the end of Petticoat-lane, and the coachman would not take him, he had no money; and he says come into the Bull's Head, the corner of Petticoat-lane, and take this cloth and get what you can on it; so I went and pawned it, and when I returned they were both gone.</p>
               <p>Q. To Webb. Where they drunk or sober when they went out of your house? - I cannot say, I drawed them one pot of beer while I was there, what my servants drawed them after, I was out, I cannot tell. I know Solomon Askins to be a hard working man all the time that ever I knew him, which has been about two or three years, Sullivan has but just come there.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>My husband is a shoemaker, I deal in the street; as I was in Whitechapel, I saw these three men very much in liquor, and the prosecutor said to the man Askins, d-n your eyes, take this and get me a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Askins? - No farther than by dealing in the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the other? - As long as I have known the other, and I have drank with him as often as I have with the other.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Askin called two other witnesses who gave him a good characer.</p>

               <p>I am servant at the Rainbow. On Sunday evening, about half past five o'clock, I put them three pots the corner of Chancery-lane, while I went into a house, a patten shop, close by, and I went up two pair of stairs; whilst I was up, I heard the pots rattle, and when I came down I enquired for the pots; I was looking about for them, and a tall man came up, and I asked him if he knew any thing of them, and he said he saw a woman with them; says he, follow me; and I went with him up Bell-yard and across Clement's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see her? - In Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop her? - Yes, and she had the pots under her apron; she laid the pots down and begged I would let her go; I told her I would not, I would take her to my master, and he might do as he liked; and as I came by Chancery lane she pointed to the place where she took them from. The pots have been locked up ever since.(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no friends to speak for me, nobody at all; but many things that he has said is very false, many words.</p>

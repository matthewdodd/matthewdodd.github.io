                  </hi>. I live in Hackney-road, and am a shoemaker, the prisoner is my wife. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 23rd of July, I came home—I required some supper to be cooked—she refused to do so—I cooked it myself, and was about to eat it, when she dashed it on the floor, and said that I and a young man who was there, who works in the shop, should not eat it—she then requested to go out, and it being very late, I locked the door, and would not let her—she then wished to fight, and stood up in a fighting attitude—it all arose from my cooking the supper—she came up to me with her fist clenched—I told her to sit down—she turned, and took a knife from her bosom, came up to me, and stabbed me in the left cheek—I took her hand and tried to get the knife from her—before I could get it she stabbed me in the thigh—she appeared to be very angry, and said she would murder me—I bled much from the wound in the thigh, and went to the doctor.</p>

About a fortnight ago I left home in the afternoon, with my handkerchief in my pocket; I felt a pull at my pocket at the end of <placeName id="t18251208-8-crimeloc38">Little New-street, Shoe-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You at first saw it on the ground? A. I saw it falling - I felt a violent pull at my pocket - when I turned round the prisoner was nearest to me. I had heard somebody close at my heels from Fleet-street.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

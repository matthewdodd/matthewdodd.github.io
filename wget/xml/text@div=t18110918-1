            . I am an officer. On the 17th of July, about a quarter after one in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner coming out of the <placeName id="t18110918-1-crimeloc4">London Docks</placeName>

The prisoner said he worked for Mr. Spence; that is all he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these repairs going on at the London Docks, to which such lead were used - A Yes. I believe it to be the property of the London Dock Company.</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to the London Dock Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they repairing the London Dock - A. Yes, on the 17th of July, and Mr. Spence is the chief plumber employed for the London Dock. The prisoner was employed by Mr. Spence, I saw him at work at half past twelve on that day, he was doing plumber's work, I took the prisoner in custody, and the other officer took the lead; the lead is the property of the London Dock Company.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was called out of the dock to my master's shop to load a cart, and sent back. On my returning into the dock I went into a corner, there I saw that lead among some old stuff. I put it into my jacket, and took it out of the Dock with me.</p>

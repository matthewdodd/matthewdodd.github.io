               <p>MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>JOHN PEARCEY. I am a watchman, of Anderson's-gardens, Bethnal-green-road. On Sunday night, the 24th of January. I stopped Higden with a basket and a bundle, a little before twelve o'clock; I asked what he had - he said it was his own, and he was going to Haggerstone; I took him to the watch-house, and asked what he had in the basket - he said wine, but what was in the bundle he did not know; I opened it, and found these other articles in it - I asked where he got them from; he said from his brother-in-law, who lived with Mr. Somes in Mile-end-road - I went there, found Willis, and asked if he had seen his brother-in-law the night before; he denied it, but after some time he said he had, and had parted with him at half-past nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was there any other conversation with Willis? A. Not at that time; Higden told me where he got them - I could not have found it, but for him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SOMES. I live in <placeName id="t18300218-93-crimeloc514">New-grove, Mile-end</placeName>

On Monday, the 25th of January, the witness came to me, and I called up Willis - I said he had robbed me of some wine, which he denied; these two bottles I can positively identify, but not the other three, though I think they are mine - I know these two by the marks on the corks; these trousers, found in the bundle, are mine -I cannot swear to this shirt; Willis slept next the stable, and the wine was kept in a locker in the servant's room -I never gave Willis liberty to take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you take upon yourself to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180047"></xptr>swear you have lost a single bottle of wine? A. I will swear to these bottles, on account of the marks of K. &amp; Co. which I suppose is the wine merchants - it was made a present to me; I mixed five bottles of this sort; it is Madeira - it is impossible I can swear this is Madeira without tasting it; Willis was my <rs id="t18300218-93-deflabel515" type="occupation">footman</rs>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether his brother-in-law had been there? A. I do not; he denied it at first, and then said he had been there.</p>

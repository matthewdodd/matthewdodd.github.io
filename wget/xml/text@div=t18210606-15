I received a very severe blow on the head, and was stunned for a minute; we both fell down together. I still kept my hold, but being overpowered, I let him go; they dragged me along about three yards - the prisoner got up and ran. I lost sight of him, and saw him again on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, was his staggering against you the effects of drunkenness, or by design - A. In my opinion it was sham drunkenness - he rose and started away as if he was quite sober, and seized my chain like a sober man - I have no doubt of his being the man, I held him some time; it was a very wet and dull evening - the lamps were not lit, it was not dark enough. I have not recovered my property - I believe the robbery was committed in Whitechapel parish.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and live in Whitechapel. On Friday evening, about nine o'clock, I was running down Brick-lane very fast, out of the rain, and saw a lady at the corner of the court, in great agitation, crying out, thieves! - I ran into the court, got my feet entangled in an umbrella which stood there open, and saw some people hustling the prosecutor, I saw the prisoner get up and start from them - I am positive he was one of them. As soon as I got disentangled, I followed as fast as I could; he crossed into the narrow part of the court into old Montague-street, turned round very cooly, and said, I wonder which way he is gone - nobody was before him; I never lost sight of him, and am sure he is the man. I laid hold of him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are the man who has committed the robbery or assault;" another came up and said, what are you going to do with that man, I said</p>
               <p>"I was going to take him;" he said, d - n your eyes, you shall not take him, and said to the prisoner, give me your stick; the prisoner had a bludgeon about two feet long - I had not seen it before, he had it in his hand, and gave it to the other, who beat me about the head most severely with it; he gave me eight or nine blows. which broke my hold, and both ran away - I followed; they crossed over into Wingfield street; my head bled very fast, indeed the blood ran down into my bosom. I went home, got my head dressed, and called on Lickfield the officer. I have since seen Mr. and Mrs. Foot. I saw the prisoner on the monday evening following at Spitalfields watch-house, and immediately recognized him; he is the man I am confident - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

            . I am headborough of Christchurch, Middlesex. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, the 28th, on this charge, Steward having given me information. I found him in George-street, Wentworth-street, standing talking to a young woman at a window; I looked under his hat, went up and said,</p>
               <p>"What is your name," he said,

               <p>"You are the man I want." I did not say what for, as it is a dangerous place; when I got him out of the street, I said, I wanted him for robbing Mr. Foot; he said, he was innocent. I got Mr. Foot, who said he was the man. I fetched Steward, who also said he was the man.</p>
               <p>MR. FOOT. Steward has since seen my wife with me, she is the lady who was with me that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (written) I declare myself innocent of the charge against me. I have hitherto maintained a character without suspicion, and as it was almost dark (as the prosecutor allows) when he was assaulted, he is more likely to be mistaken in the person that injured him. than that I should all at once become a character, directly opposite to what I had always been. I was not found in any bad company, but was taken up three days after, standing alone quietly at my own door. I made not the smallest resistance, being conscious of my own innocence.</p>

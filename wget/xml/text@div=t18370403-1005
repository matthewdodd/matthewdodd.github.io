                  </hi>. I am eleven years old; I am the son of Job Smith, of Queen-street, Finsbury, a carpenter. I was going into Shoreditch, on the 18th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and had a rule in my pocket—I did not see the prisoner—as I came back, Purton showed the rule to me—I know it, because I always have it in my pocket—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ann's-place, Hoxton. On the Saturday evening I was in Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner, and several other*, round a baker's shop, as a gentlemen came into the crowd—they tried their pockets—I then saw Smith come up to the crowd, and the prisoner tried a basket that he had got, but the lid was tied down, and he could not get it open—the boy then went out of the crowd, and the prisoner and another went up to him—they stooped down towards his pocket; I seized the prisoner—he had got the rule up his sleeve, and partly in his hand—I called the officer, who took him.</p>

               <p>Monday—Mrs. Lock came by, and begin to cry about her son, as I was talking to Susan Giles—when she was gone, Giles said, "How this? poor woman frets," and she said her son was here—I said, "What was it about?" and she said, A rule"—I said "Was it by a baker's shop, at the corner of Hare-alley," and she said, "Yes"—I said, "He picked it up"—Mrs. Lock lives in Old Cock-lane.</p>

I know Robinson—he is servant at the Swan with Two Necks—he used to bring me my dinner—on 26th Sept. he came to me, between 1 and 2 o'clock, with my dinner, and he asked me if I should like to look at some furs—I said that I did not want any—he said that he could let me have them cheap, and there would be no harm in my looking at them—I consented to see them, and he brought them in a short time afterwards—there were two sets, one sable, and one squirrel—he left them with me, and went away—he wanted 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the sable, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the squirrel—he came again that afternoon, and wanted to know what I thought of them—I told him I wanted to take them home, and show them to my mother—he said that he had two other sets, one sable, and one squirrel, and I could have them at the same price as the others, but he should lose 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a set by selling them for that—next day he came again, in the forenoon, and wanted to know if I had made up my mind whether I would have them or not—I told him I had not, and I had not brought the parcel back with me, but he should have them on Monday—he went away, and the officer came, and wanted me to get the other sets from Robinson—I went to where Robinson was employed, and left a mes<lb></lb>sage for him—when he came I was in the cutting room—I told him that I wanted him to bring the others, and there was a person waiting that I wanted to show them to—he turned away, to go and fetch them, and the officer took him into custody—I gave the furs that were in my possession to Mr. Pullen—I did not see them given to the policeman, but when I was called into the room they were lying on the table—I believe they were the same—the officer took them, in my presence—there was no mark on them—they were the same description of articles.</p>

I went on 27th Sept. to Gresham street, between 12 and 1 o'clock, to a back room on the first floor, where I saw Mr. Pullen and these furs—the last witness was there a portion of the time—I met Robinson leaving the room where the last witness is employed—I called him to the back room, where these furs were, and said, "I am a police officer; are these the furs you have been showing to the young woman in the next room for sale?"—he said, "Yes, they are"—I said, "They have been identified as stolen property; how do you account for the possession of them?"—he said, "I had them from a man in the country"—I asked him if he knew his name and address—he said, "No"—he then said, "I did not have them from a man in the country; I had them from a man at the Swan with Two Necks," and he was to give 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and had paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account—I said, "You have some more that you were about to fetch; where are they?"—he said that he had no more, and knew nothing about any more—I took him to the station—I went to the Swan with Two Necks, where Robinson had been acting as waiter—I believe he was the only waiter—I there found three sable boas, and three pairs of</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Swan with Two Necks. Robinson was in my service, he has lived with us twice; nine years altogether—he was general manservant and cellarman—the only manservant—his name is George Kirk, but he was always called William—I know the cupboard—it is a sort of a lumber cupboard, where dirty pipes are kept, which Robinson had the collecting of—it is a cupboard I never scarcely went to.</p>

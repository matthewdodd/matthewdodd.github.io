On the 5th of January, I went out to spend the day - it was late in the evening when I went home; when I got into the air, what little I had had took an affect upon me; the prisoner picked up with me in the street, and said he would take me to a lodging; I cannot say what street it was: he was quite a stranger to me; we went to a house where we slept in the same room - in the morning, the landlord awoke me, and asked if I knew the young man, as he had got all my clothes on; I do not know what time it was.</p>

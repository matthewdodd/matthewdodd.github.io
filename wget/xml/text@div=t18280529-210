               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Mrs. Lloyd here? A. No; I never allowed the prisoner to send goods out without my knowledge; I spoke to him about it, and he said he had sent out four pairs, but here are seven pairs; he never took out goods which were not ordered; my wife served in the shop; she is ill.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came he to mention about sending them out? A. In consequence of what was told me I found them packed into a hamper, and directed to Mr. Culver; the direction was in the prisoners' writing.</p>

            . I am errand-boy to Mr. Lloyd. I was sweeping out the shop about half-past eight in the morning and saw the prisoner put some Blucher boots and shoes into the basket; he tied the direction on and sent me with it to Tinsons' near Charing-cross; he told me to tell him he had no time to go to market with it, and it was to remain there till a note came from him; I delivered it to Tinson.</p>

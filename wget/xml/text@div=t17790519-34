On the night of the 24th or rather the morning of the 25th of April, at about half after twelve my wife and I fastened the house and went to bed. At about half after two o'clock I heard a noise, and got up; as I was going down I heard a cry of murder! fire! Mr. Hagstone, your house is broke open! I put my clothes on and went down to Mr. Lawrence's where I heard the thieves were; there I saw the two prisoners in custody; there was a great bunch of picklock keys found in Cremer's pocket.</p>
               <p>Was any part of your house broke open? - Yes; the flap of the cellar window and the cellar door were unlocked, and the street door was open; I was very certain all was fast before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was there at about half after two clock? - No light at all.</p>

               <p>While I was at the water side at the bottom of Darkhouse-lane, I saw two men endeavouring to break Mr. Hagstone's cellar-window open; Williams had passed me several times in the lane before; I went and told my partner of it, that is Commander, and then went down to the water-side again. When I came back I heard them inside the door; I called Commander up, and he came just as they opened the door.</p>
               <p>Were they in the inside? - Yes, inside of the door; I caught hold of Cremer and said, what business have you here? Williams said he used that house, and came to get a pint of beer; I secured Cremer; Williams struggled with Commander, and got away, but was afterward secured. After I was in court at the Mansion-house, Cremer said if I get clear of this, I will have you here.</p>
               <p>Did you secure the men? - Yes, and took them to the Green-man and Bell.</p>

               <p>Was there any day-light? - No, it was between one and two in the morning when I saw him, and between two and three when they were taken.</p>
               <p>You had never seen either of the men before? - No.</p>
               <p>You had never seen Williams before? - I saw him walking up and down the lane, and he came into the Green-man and Bell between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did he speak to you? - Yes; he asked me what I was looking out for as it was not tide time; I said I came out of the boat to warm my feet.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again by his voice? - I knew him by his face when I met him in the lane.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough in the lane to discern his face? - There was, because there were lights in the houses up and down the lane.</p>

               <p>The last witness called to me and told me a man was attempting to break Mr. Hagstone's cellar window; I went down and saw Williams standing facing Mr. Hagstone's, and the other at a little distance.</p>
               <p>Did you see them both then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish their faces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoners are the persons you saw then? - Yes; I went up to the publick-house again; Griffith went out and returned in about eight or ten minutes and said somebody was in the inside of Mr. Hagstone's house; accordingly I went down after him; he laid hold of Cremer, and I laid hold of Williams; Williams threw me down in the lane, but we secured them both and took them to the Green-man and Bell.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Between two and three o'clock in the morning on the 25th of April, on a Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>You did not let Williams go when you laid hold of him as he came out of the house? - Yes, I was obliged to let him go when he threw me down. I cried stop thief! and another man stopped him till I came up to him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man you took the first time was the same you took the second time? - I am.</p>
               <p>When you took him in the house did you see his face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Suppose you had not taken him for a fortnight after, could you have been sure that he was the person? - Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was taken the second time? - I suppose not half a moment, or a moment.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you know Williams before that night? - I have seen him before; I cannot say I knew his name before.</p>
               <p>Was you able to know him in the house? - Yes, because he came to me before.</p>
               <p>What light was there in the house, that you could see him by? - There was no light at all; the window shutters were open at the house on the opposite side of the way.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hagstone. I locked the cellar door and the street door that night; my master was with me when I locked the street door.</p>
               <p>Did you secure the slap of the cellar that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Hagstone. The slap of the cellar window is fastened from month's end to month's end; I saw it fast that night.</p>
               <p>To Stern. You did not look to see if the slap was fast that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you look to see how it was broke open the next morning? - No.</p>
               <p>Is this slap ever opened in the day-time? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>To Hagstone. What time of night did you look at the slap? - I cannot say as to the time of night; I cannot speak to an hour.</p>
               <p>Can you to two hours? - I cannot say to two hours.</p>
               <p>As it is not opened above once a month, do you look at that bolt every night? - Yes, every night.</p>
               <p>Is there no night in the year but what you look at it? - If I am in town; if I am not my wife looks at it; I look at it every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190046"></xptr> night when I am in town except it is my turn to go to bed, then my wife looks at it; I shewed to all my neighbours in the morning how it was broke open.</p>
               <p>If you shewed it to your neighbours in the morning, then you can tell the time you looked at it over-night? - I made a certainty of looking once; I was down many times.</p>
               <p>How was it broke open? - I look upon it by a wrench that will be produced. I tried the key's that were found upon Cremer, and they would open the lock of my cellar door, and the lock of the street door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the fastening of the slap broke? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Give as plain an account as you can of the manner in which the slap was broke open. - The bolts were sprung off, and the fastening below was forced off.</p>
               <p>You swear that positively? - Yes I do.</p>
               <p>There was nothing found upon Williams? - No.</p>

               <p>I had been on board a ship with Williams; and coming through Thames-street he asked me to go and have something to to drink; and took me to Mr. Hagstone's house, and we had two or three pots of beer; we then went and got some ham and beef for supper; we were some hours in the house; I was very much in liquour; I went out and laid down on the keys, where I lay four hours; Williams came to me; then I got up, and coming along Thames-street, he was first, he kicked a bundle before him in a bag; we took it up and what should it be but these things in it; I put them in my pocket; he said he would go to the house where we were before, and brought me to Hagstone's; he pushed against the door and it was open; he went in, and said there is no light, we will go somewhere else, and these men came up and took us.</p>
               <p>WILLIAMS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>We were in liquor; this young man laid down and went to sleep; I went and walked about, that is the reason that Griffith saw me in the lane; I said I would not leave him for fear of his being robbed, I told him there was a house I knew in Darkhouse-lane; we went to the door, I put my shoulder against it, and it opened, these men came up and asked what we were doing there; I said we were going to have something to drink but I believed they were a-bed, and then they took us.</p>

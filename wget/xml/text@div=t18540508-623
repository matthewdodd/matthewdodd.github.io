                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Thomas Clark, we carry on business at No. 106, Fetter-lane, as corn and coal merchants. The prisoner was in our service on 16th Jan. last, as a Carman—we sell coals by retail from the shop, and we are likewise Carmen; we remove goods as Carmen, but we do not cart coals as Carmen for other people—I keep a book—on 16th Jan., I gave the prisoner directions to fetch a ton of the best coals—the price of the best coals then was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get the coals—he got the coals and came back, and produced me this bill—I entered the coals in this book when he came back—he brought a ton of seconds coals—I looked at them and said they were very bad coals—he said they had no best, and he brought what they had got, seconds, and the price of them was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not give me any money—I never at any time gave the prisoner directions to get the bills made out for larger gums than the money he paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am wharf clerk to Messrs. Neal and Co., coal mer<lb></lb>chants, in Upper Ground-street, Blackfriars-road. I know the prisoner bought coals in the name of Clark—he came an 16th Jan. to our premises; he said he wanted a ton of coals—we have in our counting house a list of the different sorts of coals, and likewise the prices—I told the prisoner what coals we had—the list was there, but I told him—Northumberland was one sort that we had, and he said he would have Northumberlands—the price of them was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the price of the best I believe was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">refer<lb></lb>ing to the book</hi>); we had same as high as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we had none at the price of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the price of the best was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner chose to have one ton of Northumberlands, at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; I can<lb></lb>not tell now how he paid for them—I cannot charge my memory whether I had to give him change—I gave him the receipt, it is signed by me—this is the receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him the receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by his request.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us, as nearly as you can, what he said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said his master, Mr. Clark, was badly paid for drawing the coals, or carting them, and he requested to have a receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that Mr. Clark might have a reasonable profit—I said, "If Mr. Clark wishes to have a bill for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I most have 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the stamp"—I did it, because I thought it was obliging Mr. Clark—I did not understand that Mr. Clark was buying the coals to sell, but that he might have these 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more from the party for whom he was drawing or carting the coals—I have since found out that Clark and Honeysett are coal dealers—I am not aware whether they do not draw coals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you get anything by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He; I did it to be<lb></lb>nefit Mr. Clark—he was a stranger to me—he might have been there once or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080050"></xptr>
               <p>twice—I did not do it to catch a customer—it was quite immaterial to me—I have a salary—I did it that Mr. Clark might have a reasonable profit—I did not do it that he might charge a profit beyond the price of the coals—I supposed the party would pay him so much over the price he gave for the coals—it would not benefit the Carman—there would be a representation that the coals cost 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when they cost only 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the customer would be done, by my instrumentality, out of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—probably it may be dishonest on my part—I did mot think it was dishonest at the time—I am twenty-nine years old—it was a lie on my part—I am quite sure I did not pocket the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. myself, and that I did not swindle this man instead of the customer—I returned the account to my master the same day—I accounted to him for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure I did not keep the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe I did not tell Mr. Neal I had been giving a fraudulent receipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you were constantly in the habit of doing this thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been done by myself with Mr. Neal's knowledge and concurrence—there was something of the same kind, and Mr. Neal sanctioned it—he sanctioned the system by which customers were to be swindled by my giving false receipts—Mr. Neal lives in Upper Ground-street—he is a coal and coke merchant—he sanctions the system of giving receipts for a larger amount than was paid—it has been done once or twice in two or three months; whenever we are asked—Mr. Neal is here, and the book is here—here is on the counterfoil "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—here is the book from which this bill was torn.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Neal present when this request was made by the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I thought myself justified, in consequence of the prisoner's representation, to do this—at the close of that day I accounted to Mr. Neal for the moneys received in the day—I accounted to him for this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and entered it in the cash book—I accounted for this one ton of Northumberland coals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said, if you gave a receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you must have a stamp. Who paid for the stamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner gave me the stamp—it is usual, in the course of trade, to mention the sort of coals sold—this has not the sort of coals mentioned—it might be in the hurry of business—if I put it down it will enable the persons to know what sort of coals they have got—if I had put Northumberland coals on this ticket Mr. Clark would have known the price.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant, and carry on business under the name of Neal, Roll, and Savage, Old Jamaica-wharf, Upper Ground-street, near Blackfriars-bridge. On 16th Jan. I find, by referring to this day book, that Jordan accounted to me for one ton of Northumberland coals sold to Clark—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—that was the proper price for Northum<lb></lb>berland coals that day.</p>

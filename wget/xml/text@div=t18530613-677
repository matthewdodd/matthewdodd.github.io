                  </hi>. I am clerk to Depree and Austin, solicitors, of Lawrence-lane; I was clerk to the late Recorder. On Sunday night, 22nd May, I was at the foot of Holborn-hill, trying to put two little girls into one of the penny omnibuses, by the City Arms public house—there was a great crowd—I heard something crack at my left side, put my hand down, and touched the prisoner's hand, which was near my waistcoat pocket, where my watch was—I laid hold of his coat, and called "Police!"—I missed my watch—I did not lose sight of the prisoner—I am certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a steel and copper-plate printer, at 28, Gloucester-street, Cambridge—heath—I used to live at 6, Gloucester-place, Hackney-road—I removed nearly all my things from that house on Wed<lb></lb>nesdaymorning, 24th May, secured the house, and kept the key in my pos<lb></lb>session, intending to go back to remove the other things—on the next night, 25th, about ten o'clock, I returned to the house, intending to take away afew other things—there is a court-yard in front of the house—I saw a lightover the door, and heard steps in the passage—as I advanced to the door itwas opened from within by Kelly, who came out—I said, "What do you dohere?"—he said he found the door open and went to shut it—I laid hold ofhim—King then came out of the house, and seeing Kelly held by me, hestruck me on the side of my head with his fist—Kelly was then trying to getaway from me—we got outside the court-yard, and King took from his pocketa large stone and struck me at the side of the head with it—it cut me verymuch indeed—my head began to bleed—I still held Kelly—King kept hal<lb></lb>looingout, "Let him go; Jet him go;" and I kept hallooing, "Police"—King then took a crow-bar out of his pocket and tried to hit me with it, but Iguarded it off—he aimed it at my body—it cut my coat—I raised my armthree or four times to prevent the blows—he kept using that instrument while I was holding Kelly, and I received a severe gash on my left hand from it—Ihave not been able to use it since—I still kept hold of Kelly—Drinkwatercame to my assistance, and King ran away—he was afterwards taken, and Igave Kelly in charge—I did not let him go—King was taken a week after—Iwent back to my house, and found two tablets up stairs in the front-room, onthe floor, against the wall—I had left them in a cupboard—they had beenremoved, and a fishing-rod, which I had left in a corner in the front parlour, was removed into the middle of the room—I did not leave any one in thehouse the night before.</p>

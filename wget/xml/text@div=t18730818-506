                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver—I went out with my train from Moorgate Street about 6. 51 on Sunday night, 6th July, we got to the Child's Hill station about 7. 19, and on nearing it I noticed the prisoner lying in the four-foot on the up road—we were on the down line—we went on to Hendon—we came back about 7. 31, and near Child's Hill I looked to see if anything had been done to the line—I saw three iron bars placed across the metals—I could not quite come to a standstill, and the guards of the engine threw the bars aside—if we had been going fast they would have thrown the engine off the line—I proceeded on to Finchley, and while passing the next bridge the prisoner came from behind the bridge and threw something at us—I saw something come from his hand—I gave in<lb></lb>formation at the Finchley Road.</p>

I am the fireman who was with the Midland train out from Moorgate Street at 6. 51 on Sunday evening—I remember when the iron bars were knocked off by the guards of the engine—I saw a chair close to the metals, as if it had been laid on and fallen off, that was about 100 yards from the iron bars—the chair is the piece of iron that holds the rails—I saw the prisoner come out from the bridge—he appeared as if he would do us all the harm he could if he could get at us.</p>

I am a signalman in the employ of the Midland Rail way, in charge of a signal-box about a mile from Child's Hill station—I did not see where the iron bars were—the signal-box was between the two—I saw the prisoner that morning about 7. 45 walking up the line coming from Child's Hill towards the Finchley Road, away from the place where the mils were put—I spoke to him because I thought he had no right there, and I did not know him—the road is fenced on each side all the way along—he ap<lb></lb>peared</p>

About 7. 50 on Sunday morning, 6th July, I was on duty at the bridge in Mill Lane—I saw the prisoner walking along the railway line towards Finchley station—I went to the signal box there, where the last witness was on duty—I asked the signalman if he had any right to be there—he said "No,"—I asked the prisoner what he was there for, and he said "Anything"—in the meantime the station-master came down the line and said we had better detain him in custody—he appeared very peculiar in his manners.</p>

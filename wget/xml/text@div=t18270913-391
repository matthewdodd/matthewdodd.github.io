            . I am a constable. On the morning of this day week I saw Argent driving a sow through Church-street, Hackney; the other prisoner was on the path-way. I did not hear them conversing, but I gave information to the patrol - he went forward, and stopped it, and I took Argent into custody, and the sow. I asked him where he brought it from - he said he brought it from Leyton, and was going to take it to market. I went on to the Horse and Groom public-house, and turned it into the yard. I asked him then if he had any more - he said he had four others coming up the road. I asked whose they were - he said his father's; I know his father perfectly well - I went to Leyton. I saw his mother, and ascertained it was not theirs - I then went and told Walter, and gave information of it instantly.</p>

            . I am a labourer of Walthamstow. I was at Lee-bridge, and saw the two prisoners driving a sow before them along the road - I saw a sow this morning at Hackney, which I believe to be the same; it is marked in the same way, it has a white back, black head, and black quarters behind.</p>

Upon his going abroad he requested that I would either deliver the lease to the landlord, or lett the house furnished; the house was surrendered to me on the 15th of June last. My son, and I, and another person took an inventory of every thing in and upon the premisses; I examined every thing very minutely; a person I intended to put in charge of the house had been at that time engaged, I shut up the house; there was no person left in it. A gentleman made application to me on the 27th to see the house; when I went to it I found that the lock of the street door had been forced, and the key hole was filled with horse dung. I sent a person down the area. I saw the door which leads to the kitchen below was open; he came up and let me in at the street door of the house. I found the principal part of the bolt of the lock was in the staple; the box of the lock was on the door; then I went up stairs and found that every thing specified in the indictment was carried off; we found a good many articles left packed up, ready for carrying away; we found the back part of the house open, and the detached stables were open; and through that part the goods were carried away.</p>
               <p>Did they appear to be forced? - They did not. I advertised five guineas reward for a discovery of the parties; and some time in the beginning of July I received a letter from the office in Litchfield-street, desiring that I would be there at twelve o'clock. I went accordingly and saw these goods.</p>

He had a parcel the 3d day, but what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What time of day did you see him? - To the best of my knowledge between one and two in the day.</p>
               <p>Did he come out at the street-door? - No, the back-door, which answers to the kitchen; it is joining to the stables.</p>

               <p>Are you sure he is the person? - I am very confident; I looked particularly at him, and was amazed to see such a kind of man come to carry away the things. He had on a light green suit of clothes, very much faded.</p>

He was asked where he lived? He hesitated, at last he said he lived at Lambeth, and gave us a direction where. Mr. Bacchus and I went to his lodgings to see if we could find any locks or lead. When we came there I wondered to see the house so grandly furnished. I found there all the goods specified in the indictment; and we found this chissell (producing it.) Mr. Crosby and I tried it to some of the marks on Mr. Aberdeen's door, and it answered.</p>

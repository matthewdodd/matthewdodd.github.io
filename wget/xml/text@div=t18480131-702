                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, in Long Acre. The prisoner was in my service nearly two months—it was his duty to receive pledges, and return them on redemption—when an article is pledged, a ticket is pinned on it, and it is sent to the warehouse, and a duplicate of the ticket is given to the person pawning—when the article is redeemed, the ticket is taken off it, and pinned to the duplicate—the interest is marked on the back of the</p>

               <p>ticket, and the duplicate and the ticket are put into a drawer that we call "the delivery," and from that drawer we take them at night, and enter them in a book—on the 30th Dec. some persons in my trade were in my parlour—the prisoner's former master was one—I called the prisoner into the room, and I said, "I have a strong suspicion, George, that you have been robbing me"—he said, "I am certain that is not so," or words to that effect—I said, "Well, You are aware that for some time after you came, my accounts were constantly deficient, and it was not till I insisted that some means should be taken to make them more accurate, that they were at all correct"—he said, "Yes, it was so"—I said, "Have you any objection to turn the contents out of your pockets on to the table in the presence of these gentlemen"—he said, "No;" and immediately turned out bits of paper, and things of no conse<lb></lb>quence—I said to him twice, "Are you sure you have nothing else?"—he said, "I am sure I have nothing else"—I said, "To save the unpleasantness of calling in a policeman, have you any objection to my searching you my<lb></lb>self?"—he said, "No"—I put my hand in his right waistcoat pocket, and found the duplicate and ticket of a pair of boots (that was a pocket that he had felt in two or three times, when I said, "Have you taken out all?")—I said, "Pray, what is this?"—he appeared confused, and replied, "That is a pair of boots that I bought the duplicate of, of a man—he had no right to purchase the duplicate—I am under a penalty not to do it; but supposing he had done so, it was his duty to indorse the interest on the ticket, and put it in the delivery, and it would have been discharged in the book—I have the book here, and it is not marked off—I said, "Where are the boots?"—he said, "Up stairs, in my room"—I said, "If that is the case, how is it this dupli<lb></lb>cate is in your pocket, and no interest marked on the back of it?"—he said he had taken the boots into wear, and had not paid for them, but he intended to do so when he got the money—I said, "Are you sure you have nothing else belonging to me?'—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Where are your boxes?"—he said they were up in his room—I called one of boys, and desired him to go and fetch them down—they were brought down, one was locked and the other unlocked—in tha, there was nothing but a coat and waistcoat—I asked for the key of the other—the prisoner produced it—I opened it, and found in it a duplicate and ticket for two bottles, pawned for a shilling, on 11th Dec.—I have found in the book the entry of their being pawned, but it is not discharged—there is no interest marked on the back of the ticket—these tickets were not pinned together, they were lying separate, but I saw that they corresponded—I said, "What is this?"—he appeared not to know anything about it, but he afterwards said, "That is a ticket I bought also; I gave the man 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—he said he was sorry, he knew he had done that which was extremely wrong, and hoped I would do nothing with him—after his first examination before the Magistrate, I went to his aunt's, in Charlton-place, Vauxhall-road—I obtained the two bottles from his uncle—his aunt attended before the Magistrate, but she was not examined—the prisoner acknowledged that he gave his aunt he bottles.</p>

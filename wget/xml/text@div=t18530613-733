I was employed by the secretary of Sir John Key's committee to attend the election as inspector of the poll books—I recollect on the last day of the election I saw the defendant, about half-past 11 o'clock—the Hall was then rather quiet—I was stationed on the hustings, behind Book 4 and Book 5—the poll commenced at 9 o'clock—I saw the defendant come up with another man to Book 4—the defendant went to Book 5—I heard the last witness ask him the questions and administer the oath, and take his vote—he voted for Mr. Scott—when he had voted for Mr. Scott he came on the hustings with James Penny and another person, and went up the steps to the Chamberlain's office—I followed him, and asked him how long he had been a liveryman—he said twelve months—I told him he was no liveryman at all—I followed him into the yard—I met the beadle of the Carpenter's Company, and asked him if the defendant was a liveryman of the Carpenter's Company—he told me "No," and I gave him into custody, and James Penny into custody at the same time—the other party had left—I did not see him afterwards—I went to the station, and then before the Magistrate—I heard this defendant say at the station that he was not a liveryman of the Carpenter's Company—I cannot remember whether the inspector asked him any question.</p>

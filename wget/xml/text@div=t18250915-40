I have an iron box which I keep in an iron chest in the shew room at the back of the shop - it is generally kept locked. On the 28th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I missed fifty-six sovereigns, one guinea, and a 5 l. Bank note from the chest. I had counted my money five minutes before, and it was all safe - he had been backward and forward in the shew room while I was counting it, and nobody but him had been there before I missed it, for I was not out of the place; on my missing the money, he had absconded - I had not sent him out. I gave information to Cousins; he was not taken till the 19th of August. I had left him alone in the shew room for two minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you ever paid me any money for my service? A. No; I took him in great distress, and clothed him from head to foot - I had known him twelve years. When the officer brought him to me, he fell on his knees and hoped I would forgive him. I said "What have you done with the money you robbed me of;" he said "Oh I lost it just after I went out."</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Pite gave me information of the robbery. I was looking for the prisoner till the 19th of August, when I found him in a public-house in White Hart-yard - he came down stairs. I said "How do you do, I believe I am addressing Mr. T. Pickett;" he said "No. my name is Gray, I am not the person you take me to be." I said "I know you very well, you must go with me to Mr. Pite, in Holborn;" he immediately sunk on his knee, and said "For God's sake don't take me there; if you do, I am a dead man." I took him to Mr. Pite; he begged for mercy, and said he had lost the money soon after he had taken it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Having made up my mind to plead guilty, I have not sought for witnesses to character.</p>

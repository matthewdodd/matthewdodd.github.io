                  </hi>. I am in the service of the London General omnibus Company—I live at 79, Star Street, Edgware Road—I am a Tafton man—I came up to London in December last for the purpose of getting employment, and I was taken into the London General Omnibus company's service in January, and first conducted the FU omnibus on Saturday, 9th January—I have my book here in which I kept an account—on the 11th and 13th I conducted a different omnibus—those were the only times that I had conducted an omnibus in London before the 14th January—on Thursday morning, 14th January, I was at the company's office in the Edgware Read; I got there about 8 o'clock in the morning—I saw the district road manager, Mr. Wild, and I afterwards saw the prisoner Murphy—I had never seen him before—he came to the office just before 9 o'clock—he asked Mr. Wild for a rest—Mr. Wild said "You are frequently wanting rests," and he said he wanted to go to some place particularly—Mr. Wild told me to go on his <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> for one day, and he was to show me what to do—I went out of the office with Murphy and I went with him to Paddington Green to the King and Queen, public-house, where the stables were—on the way there Murphy said "Are you a new man"—I said I was and had come from Taunton—he said it was lucky he had seen me, he would show me how to manage about the takings—he said that 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day was not much for a man, it was not sufficient to find a man in <hi rend="italic">lush</hi>, and he said I should have to give his driver a dollar a day; he said he did—I said "So much as that" he said "Yes, you can do it very well; you can have four or five <hi rend="italic">hog</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bob</hi>" (I don't know which he said) "a day for yourself"—then he said he would give me his book to show me what he paid in as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030004"></xptr>
               <p>his takings, and I was to take that as a guide—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book and he said I could refer to it each journey to see what he took, and I was to give it again to his driver at night, and whatever I did I was not to pay in any more than he did, if anything, less; being a new man, he said, they would not take any notice of it—the book was shut when he gave it to me, and no part of it was referred to—I don't recollect that anything further was said about it—when we got to the King and Queen he gave me my time-bills—there were eight time tills and the total bill which were then in blank—he gave me the times of the first two journies, which I wrote down myself—he told me what to put down—he then said "The <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> has come round I will make the driver make out the other times for you"—Bride<lb></lb>groom was the driver of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—Murphy told me that I could get any fares between the Lonsdale and the office, as there was no one about there, and I was to take a little out of each fare, and the last journey I was to look and if I saw any old <hi rend="italic">fogey</hi> sitting in the corner I was to take stock of him over the door, and if I saw him looking up at the bill mind him, but not to be too timid, as a great many people looked out of curiosity—the omnibus came out—Bridegroom was driving and Murphy got up on the bus by his side and he told me to get up on the other side of the driver, that was when the omnibus came from the King and Queen—I said I would get up behind—I had all the way bills and the book with me—I had not seen what was in the book—I was not aware then that the times were entered in that book—the omnibus went to the Earl Lonsdale, Portobello Road; as we passed the Royal Oak, Murphy called me to come in front to the driver over the roof, but I refused—I said I was going to put in my journey bill, and I got inside and put my journey bill in—when we got to the Earl Lonsdale, which is the starting point, Murphy got down—he said I was to mind what he told me, he had made it all right with the driver and that he would get me a lot of people and we were to mind and take care of ourselves and do as he told me—he told me to mind and give the driver the book in the night—Murphy then went away and I did not see him after that—he said the fares were all right between the Royal Oak and the office because there was no one there—I said "There is a time-keeper at the Royal Oak," and he said "He is nothing, he is nobody"—that was all that passed between us—on the first journey Bridegroom drove properly, and as I received the fares I made the marks on the way-bill—when I had a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fare I marked it in that line, and so on—we started the first journey at 9.41 and. returned from Charing Cross at 10.38—on my return 1 went into the Earl Lonsdale to add up the amount I had returned, but pre<lb></lb>viously to that I had called at the office on the way down and made a com<lb></lb>plaint to Mr. Wild and 1 arranged to see him later in the day—I went into the Earl Lonsdale after the first journey and began to make up my way bill—Bridegroom came in, and, looking over me, he saw 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was the total of the first journey—he said "D----my eyes, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said "Yes"—he asked how much I had kept back—I told him not anything—he said "Why, the other man never paid in as much as that"—he asked me to give him the book, and I took the book out of my pocket and gave it to him—he referred back to some of the previous days and compared my first journey with his first journies, and he said "He has never hardly paid in so much money as that"—I told him I had taken the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had made a penny mistake in putting down, on that journey—I had made a stroke in the penny line, and Bridegroom asked me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030005"></xptr>
               <p>the meaning of that—I told him a lady had paid me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I put it down to the 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fare, and I had put the penny down there so as to explain at the office—he said I was a b----fool, they would not have known anything about it, but as I had done it it ought to be put down as an excess fare, and he wrote that himself against it—he said if I did not keep back some for him he was not going to get passengers, he was not going to work for six <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> a day, and it was no good for him to get passengers if I gave it all to them—some man came and called him outside; he came back again and said "You are the man who was on the FU" and I said "Yes"—he said "Well, you won't get any 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fares here on this one"—the FU was the omnibus 1 had been on the previous Saturday and I had taken 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one journey and had returned it properly—the second journey he drove very badly—if he saw an empty <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> in front he would keep behind it, and if the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was full he would get in front of it till he met another, and if I rang for him he would not stop, but for all the passengers I did carry I made the entries on the way-bill and at the end of the journey I had taken 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went into the Earl Lonsdale to make up the way-bill—Bridegroom came in and looked over my bill and he said "You haven't got so much now"—I said "No"—he said he was not going to get a lot of people if I was giving it to them—I spoke to him about the driving and said if he did it again I should report him—I told him I had rung for him and he did not pull up, and he said he did not hear me ring—I said "You must have heard, because I hallowed as well"—I asked him to make out my time-bills for me for the other journies and I gave him the six bills for the remaining six journies—he made out one and gave them all back to me—I said "Make them all out for me now," and he said "No, I shall make them out at the end of each journey"—he wrote all that way-bill, but my figures, the time and "Earl Lonsdale to Charing Cross," and "Bridegroom" and "Poole" as the driver and conductor—I had written the first two—on the third journey I picked up two ladies just at the Earl Lonsdale—before they got in they told me to put them down at a shop in Westbound Grove—I told them I did not know it, but if they told me when they arrived I would put them down—Bridegroom said "I know where it is, I will pull up all right"—the ladies got in, and got out at that place—when they got in he called me up to him on the top of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he said "Have those, they won't know anything about it"—I told him I should not, and I got back on the step again—when they got out they paid me and I put down the fares—the prisoner asked me if I bad put them down—I said "Yes, I have"—he started off very furiously and then he either drove very fast or very slow, which prevented me from getting pas<lb></lb>sengers properly—at the end of that journey I went into the Earl Lonsdale to make up the way-bill, and I had only earned 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Bridegroom came in and said 1 had not taken so much—I said "No"—he said "Well, I ain't going to get them unless you like to keep back some for ourselves"—I told him I should not do it—he said "Well, I can get as many as any man on the road"—I said "Let me see how much you can get next time"—he made out the bill for the next journey—I wanted him to make out the whole, but he would not—he entered the times and the names at the bottom—he drove very well the fourth journey, and I took 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to the Earl Lous<lb></lb>dale to make out the bill as before and he said then he could get as many passengers as anyone on the road, but he was not going to work for six <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> a day—I had made out a part of that time-bill and he took it out of my hands and put in 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and seventeen passengers and the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the rest</p>

               <p>is in my own writing—he made out my time-bill for the fifth journey—I got 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that journey—he drove properly—during that journey I saw Mr. Wild at Regent Circus—I made a complaint to him—I filled up my bill of that journey at the Earl Lonsdale, and while I was there Bridegroom came in—there were about half a dozen other people there, conductors and men who had to do with the horses—Bridegroom made up some of this bill for the fifth journey, his figures are nineteen passengers and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the total 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is the total of the two ways—he called the men's atten<lb></lb>tion to the figures in the book, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he said "You will get all the b----lot of the men <hi rend="italic">sacked</hi>, you will get them all down on you"—I told him if he took my book again I should report him for it—he entered 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my book—before he touched the bills I had entered the full amount of passengers carried in the lines and he added it up—one of the men said I ought to be swamped, and another said I should find myself down Houndsditch one morning—Bridegroom said he would take good care I should not get so many passengers again—he said "I don't believe you have taken so much money"—I said I had—he asked me if I knew how much I had in the morning when I came out—I said "Yes, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he told me to take my money out and count it—I did so, and found I was 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. short—he said "There, you see you are 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. short, I knew d----well you had not taken the money"—I said "There is my dinner and beer, and that"—I reckoned that that came to 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and made it right—I satisfied myself the money was right—he made out the bill for the sixth journey—he drove very badly that time—I believe it was that journey that a gentleman gave me a parcel and sixpence, and told me I was to take it to a place in Westbound Grove—I said 1 did not know where it was—Bride<lb></lb>groom said "I know where it is," and the gentleman gave the sixpence and the parcel to him—he pulled up at the shop, 119, Westbound Grove, and I took in the parcel—when we arrived at the Earl Lonsdale, I asked Bridegroom for the money for the parcel—(I had taken 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that journey, without the parcel)—he said it was not b----likely, and he should keep it for himself—I told him I should enter it to him, and he said, he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and keep 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. himself—I said "No, I shall have the whole of the sixpence"—he threw it down on the floor, and told me to take the b----sixpence—I picked it up—this is the way-bill—there is no line for parcels, but I made an entry of the parcel on my total-bill—I called at the office to learn how to eater it, and I afterwards put it on the total-bill—I asked Bridegroom to make out the way-bill for the seventh journey—he said he would see me b----first—I said I would go without them, and then he told me to come in and he would make them out for me, and I went in, and he made out the two for the seventh and eighth journies; the two last journies—before we started he said I should not have so many passengers—I earned 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the seventh journey but he did not drive properly—before we started on the eighth journey he said "You can keep back some now because there is nobody about"—I told him I should not do so, I would rather throw the place up and should tell Mr. Wild so; and I wanted to—he drove very badly and I earned 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we did not go back that journey to the Earl Lonsdale—there was only one passenger left at Paddington Station and he got out at Westbourne Grove, and Bridegroom drove to the King and Queen where the stables were—he got down there and told me to go into the house, he would be in in a moment, and I was to give him the other</p>

               <p>man's book; but I ran off and went home and took the book with me—the way-bills are put in the letter-box at the office each journey and I have to make a summary of the total day's earnings—they amounted to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether, including the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the parcel—I entered that on the summary bill with the total amount of the money and sent it in the next morning with the money—I saw Mr. Wild and made a statement to him—the conductor's wages were is a day and the driver's 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was afterwards employed on one of the omnibuses of the company as odd man—I saw Murphy, I fancy it was the next day; it was within a day or two—I think it was on the 16th—he was on the back of another <hi rend="italic">fats</hi> and he called to me for his book—I shook my head at him and he got off and ran after us—I told the driver to drive on as fast as he could so that he did not overtake us—I afterwards saw him at the Earl Lonsdale and he asked me for his book—I told him I had not got it—he said I should not go out of the house until he had it, he would break my b----nose for me if I did not tip it up. and he went and shut the door—my time was close on to go with my <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and 1 told my driver he was to go on with the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—Bridegroom came up and told him to let me out, and he said "You will get us into a scrape" I think that was on the 17th—Murphy followed me out as I was going from the tap-room and said "Mind I gave you that book to take the time out from and it is a b----pretty trick you are serving me"—I got out to my <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> as quick as I could and got off—I was not aware till after I gave up my book to Mr. Wild that the times of the various journies were entered in it—I was shown it at Hammersmith—in the way-bill for the 3.45 journey in the column for the fourpenny fares there is a mark in the second division like two strokes—I carried that out as "two passengers, 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and the com<lb></lb>pany afterwards charged me that extra fourpence as if there were three passengers instead of two—I don't remember whether there were three or two, but I was charged with the extra 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the way-bill for the 5.42 journey I have carried out two twopenny fares as 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is a mistake against myself.</p>

I am road inspector in the employment of the London General Omnibus Company—I live at 10, Cirencester Street, Paddington—I was at the" office in the Edgware Road on 14th January—Poole came there about 9 o'clock, or a little later, and whilst he was there Murphy came in—he said "Can I rest to-day?"—I said "You are frequently wanting rest"—he said "I want to go somewhere particularly to-day"—I then told Poole, who was in the office, to go for him for the day—I said to Murphy "Instruct him where to go," and they left the office together—I was in the office about 10 o'clock in the morning when the omnibus came down its first journey from the Lonsdale—Poole came in and made a statement to me—he was in rather an excited state—I made arrangements to see him at the Circus in the afternoon—I saw him there at 6 o'clock in the evening—he was stand<lb></lb>ing behind the omnibus then—I saw him again in the morning and he made a further statement to me—he brought the book which has-been produced, with him—I took him to Mr. Trevitt, the superintendent, and he made a statement to him—Poole was first employed by the company on the 9th January, I think.</p>

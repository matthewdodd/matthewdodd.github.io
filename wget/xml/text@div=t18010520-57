             sworn. - I live at Hackeny: On Monday the 13th of April, I lost my horse, from <placeName id="t18010520-57-crimeloc320">No. 94, Wardour-street, Soho</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18010520-57-crimeloc320" type="placeName" value="No. 94, Wardour-street, Soho"></interp>

Fownes and Scott, with the saddle on; when I came out I missed my horse; that was about a quarter past two; I saw it again on Wednesday night, about nine o'clock, at Mr. Minton's, Tothill-fields; he is a horse slaughterer; he was tacked up in a stable, and served with hay; I knew the horse again immediately; it had a white spot between the knee and shoulder, the inner foot white behind, bald faced and had a nervous humour upon him; I have had the horse near two years; it was a black gelding; I took him home on the Thursday; I found my own bridle at Mr. Minton's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long did you stay in the house before you came out and missed your horse? - A. It might be an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten your horse up? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of the house yourself from the time you first went in till you came out and missed the horse? - A. Yes; I had been out about ten minutes before I missed him; a lady wanted me to unhang him, that she might pass, and I did not hang him again; I did not hang him at first, somebody else did; I never do myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse was across the pavement, and incommoded the lady's passage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you left him in a loose, unprotected state? - A. I threw my bridle over his neck and left him; he never left me before.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the horse did not stray? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Wardour-street is not a very broad street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then two carriages coming together would very likely cause the horse to move? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not the prisoner's defence, before the Magistrate, that the horse had strayed? - A. I do not remember any such thing; I believe he did say he had found the horse.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARROW sworn. - I am a horse-slaughterer: On Monday, the 13th of April, the prisoner came to me to sell a horse, about four o'clock in the afternoon; he told me the horse was at the livery-stable, and if I would go with him he would sell it me for a guinea and a half; upon that I went with the man to the White Horse, in the Broad-way, Westminster; the horse was shewn me; upon looking at it, I thought the horse was too good for slaughter, and at too low a price; upon which I told him, if he would give an account where he got the horse, I would give him twice that money for him; he then told me he bought it of a man at Paddington; that he gave twenty-five shillings for it; upon which I had him taken into custody, and advertised the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the horse? - A. About ten guineas; on Wednesday night the prosecutor owned the horse, and had it the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did he not say that he found the horse, that it was a strayed horse? - A. No; he told me that he had bought the horse.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARLEY sworn. - I am a constable; Mr. Minton sent for me to take the prisoner into custody; I searched him, and found some duplicates upon it; he was taken before the Magistrate and committed.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MINTON sworn. - I am a horse-slaughterer, in Tothill-fields; Barrow is my servant; the prisoner came to my house, and said he had a horse to sell; Barrow and I both went to see the horse, at the White Horse, Broad-way, Westminster; he ordered the ostler to bring the horse out of the stable; he asked a guinea and a half for it; he was as well dressed as any trademan need to be; I asked him how he came by the horse; he said he bought it of a man at Paddington; I told him it was a stolen horse, and he should not take it away; I sent for a constable and had him detained; he gave the same account before the Magistrate, that he had bought the horse, but did not say where; the horse was a very useful horse, a very good tradesman's horse, about six years old.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of it be? - A. The horse might be worth ten or twelve pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

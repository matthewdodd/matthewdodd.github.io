               <p>Q. What age are you?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I shall be thirteen in September next.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know you have taken an oath?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you swear to?</p>
               <p>Dixon. To tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say your catechism?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What will be the consequence if you don't tell the truth?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I shall go to Hell.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your father and mother?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I have no mother, my father is a plaisterer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes; I was his <rs id="t17720715-52-deflabel271" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17720715-52-defend476 t17720715-52-deflabel271"></join>, I had lived with him six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a mistress.</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes. My master had not a bed for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150037"></xptr> me, so I lay at the foot of his bed; my mistress has a nurse child, and a child of her own that lay in the same bed. He beat his wife and turned her out of doors last Wednesday was week at night; she took the nurse child with her, and left her own child at home; we got our suppers, and then he swore if I did not come to bed he would murder me, so I went as usual to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Dixon. About ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie at the bottom of the bed?</p>
               <p>Dixon. There were two chairs at the foot of the bed, and the cradle bed upon them; he was in bed before me: I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you to go to bed or he would murder you, did he mean to go to bed as usual?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes; whilst I was asleep he came to the foot of the bed to me; I waked and found him upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes; I don't know how to pronounce it; his private parts were in mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hurt you?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes, a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been hurt so before?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know they were his private parts?</p>
               <p>Dixon. By what I had heard people say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it hard or soft what you felt?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Hard; I was afraid to make any noise, because he used to use his wife so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure his private parts were in yours?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they in?</p>
               <p>Dixon. But a little way I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing besides something hard?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie still?</p>
               <p>Dixon. When I stirred he got off, and pretended he was asleep; I got up to give the little child some drink, and he went up to the head of the bed, and said, he had only been down in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive any thing after he got off you?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I was sore two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing left behind when he got off?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Not that I know of; I went to bed again, but I could not go to sleep; when I lay still he was coming again, but finding me awake he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come again?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lodge in the house with you?</p>
               <p>Dixon. Yes. I told my mistress next day.</p>
               <p>Q. You can't say how far he was in your body, whether an inch, or two inches, or more?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No, I can't.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark on your shift?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I did not look; Mrs. Atkins said there was some blood on it, I did not see it; the next day my mistress begged me to go and lie with him, for the sake of the child, for she said I could hang him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any attempt that night?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress lie there the second night?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you told your mistress?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I don't know, I believe he did, because my mistress told several people she could hang him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your father of it?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No; I was afraid he would lick me.</p>

            . I am a washer-woman; I live next door to the prosecutor's father; she came home on Tuesday; she said her mistress had pawned her clothes; she said she was ruined; I asked her how she was ruined; my master, said she, has got on me while I was asleep, and then she said, he came again, and did you know what, and by her linen I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand he did not do it the first time?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I did not ask her; she said he got off and went away, and the second time he got on her, and did you know what.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand her to mean, by doing you know what?</p>
               <p>Atkins. That he had lain with her.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time and not the first?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes; the shift she had worn six weeks, (she took three, her mistress had pawned the other) that was i n a dreadful condition; there were marks of blood on it and others.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she say it happened?</p>
               <p>Atkins. The Wednesday night before, (this was the Tuesday) she told her mistress, and she said as soon as she got her cloaths, she would tell her father, and he should hang her master.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's father;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150038"></xptr> she was let a servant to the prisoner; he said he had good lodging for her, but had no bed but the bed they lay in; he fell out on the Friday with his wife, and she went off with my child; the prisoner, and I went in quest of them; we found her, but not his wife; she then told this woman she was ill used; I took her into the garret, and she said he got on her when she was asleep; I said, did you feel any thing? she said she did; I said, was he on you? she said, yes, and she felt what he had, he put it to her; she said he got out of the bed and came up again, and pretended he had been to fetch some water, and when he had got into bed again, she felt him getting up, and she said, are you getting up again? and he said, no, and lay down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand by your daughter he had lain with her?</p>

               <p>Q. from the Prisoner to the Father. Did not your daughter come home to you on Thursday?</p>
               <p>Dixon. She did; she said there had been a quarrel between the master and mistress, and she was to come away on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. She said nothing of this affair then?</p>
               <p>Dixon. No: but told me, her master had given her warning to come away on Saturday, and I told her to come away on Friday. She went to her mistress, and she persuaded her to go home again, because she was afraid of the child; that was the Thursday night.</p>

               <p>It is true I am a poor man, and could not raise the price of a second bed. I took in a nurse child; my wife could not do without a girl; Mr. Dixon offered me his daughter. I wanted to take some money of the father of the nurse child, in Cornhill; my wife was with this girl at Hackney; I desired her to come to town to get this money; she came under pretence of getting it; she said he was not at home, whereas there was but 3 s. due on the balance; I went the next day, and when I found it out I was very angry with her. After she was gone, we went to supper and to bed in the usual way; it being hot I might throw my legs down to the foot of the bed, that is all I know; she went to her father and never told me of it.</p>

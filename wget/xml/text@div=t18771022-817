                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver in the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company's employ—on Saturday, the 14th July last, I took down an engine to fetch a train from Swanley Junction—I had some refreshment that evening at the Bull public-house, near Birchwood Corner—it is kept by a Mr. Hutton—I left that house, a little before nine o'clock, to return to the station—I was not due to leave the station till eleven o'clock—I took a parcel of food from the Bull for my fireman—as I was going along the road to the station I saw two men come towards me on donkeys—I was then about half a mile on my way—I made way for them to pass, and just as I thought they had passed I received a blow on the back of the head; I stumbled forward, and as soon as I could recover myself I turned to look who it was—I saw the faces of both men—one was on a donkey, and the other standing then—they were quite close to me, and I made the remark that it was cowardly for two men to attack a little man like me, and the one on the donkey (Pateman) said "That's the b——y Yorkshireman"—with that they both fell to beating me with sticks and kicking me about the body and head, Pateman having got off the donkey—I was in the road, and they kicked me when I was standing up and when I was down—my hat was lost—they continued to kick and beat me—one of them said "What have you under your coat?" and I told them it was food for my mate—one of them pulled open my coat and took the parcel from me, and by some means or other I managed to get up—as I was running away I received three blows on the side of my head with a stick—the third blow knocked me down again—when I recovered I saw the men going up the hill in front of me—I followed them as well as I could to the Bull—just before they got to the Bull they turned down a lane to the right—that is a lane leaning towards Dartford—one donkey was a lightish one, and the others were more of a brown, darkish—there were three donkeys, but two men—Mr. Hutton took care of me, and had me washed and drove me back afterwards to the station, and I went up to town with my fireman on the engine—I went to Dartford the nest day and lodged a complaint.</p>

I am the landlord of the Bull at Birchwood Corner—on Saturday evening, the 14th July, the last witness came to my house and had some refreshment, and left my house a little before nine o'clock—he took some bread and veal and ham wrapped up in a paper—he returned about 9.30, very much excited—he had been knocked about and complained very much—I had him attended to, and drove him to the station—he was quite sober—I know both the prisoners—they are donkey-drivers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the prisoner Thomas—I am also a donkey proprietor and driver, and live near Bromley—it is the custom of myself and brother to go to Swanley Junction with our carts—I did so last summer—on the 14th July I was with Walter Pateman, and we went to the White Hart at Orpington at about 9 a.m., and remained there till 5 p.m.—Orpington is the next station below Chisle hurst, and about three and a half miles from Lullington Castle—when we left at five, we went to Birchwood; we had four donkeys with us—we then went to Swanley, where a society called the Swanley Club meets—it met that night, and we went to the meeting—my brother was at the Club; we met him not much past six—I suppose we left the club at 8.10—the two prisoners, myself, and a man named Bilsby, and we went to the Woodman (Mr. Turner's)—we did not stop there long; we had one pot of beer—we divided our donkey money and went home, straight along that road to the Lullington Castle (<hi rend="italic">showing on the plan</hi>)—we did not go in—we left Pateman behind us, between Mr. Beenham's farm and Mr. Mill's, I remaining with my brother—Bilsby remained with us till we turned into our road, which leads the Heathfield farm—we went to the house-carts, to my mother's first—we told Bilsby to take the donkeys to Swanley—he turned to go; we never turned to see—I suppose it was not quite nine o'clock—it was 8.45 when we came out of Mr. Turner's house, and we had a very short distance to go—we are just at the top of the railway—if trains pass by we could hear them—a train came in soon after we got home, I suppose what they call the 5 to 9 train—when we got to my mother's house there was William Pateman at home, the prisoner's brother, who is married to one of my sisters—my brother stepped indoors—we remained the night—I came out to go and tie my pony up—my brother was up in the van dressed—presently I came back again, and my brother-was still there, and then we stopped all night—my mother was left in the van when I went to tie up the pony—when we first got to the house-cart, Mary Reynolds, my wife, was there, William Pateman, his wife, my sister—I was present when Terry arrested, my brother—some little time after Terry called upon me—Sergeant Fisher was there, and I was arrested, and was handcuffed to my brother and Pateman—I was discharged on Tuesday.</p>

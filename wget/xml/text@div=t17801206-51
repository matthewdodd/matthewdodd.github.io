One Hunsdon, a sheriff's officer, came to me on a Sunday, and asked if one Mr. Sutton lived there? My brother, who opened the door, said No, Mrs. Tulk lived there. He asked my brother, if we had not lost gold fish. My brother said we had. He said he was come to detect rogues and villains; and asked me if I would prosecute, if he told me who they were. He asked me to give it under my hand that I would prosecute. I told Hunsdon,</p>
               <p>"I did not know him; I had never seen</p>
               <p>"him before. He said he was come to tell me</p>
               <p>"of rogues and villains; but would not tell</p>
               <p>"me who they were. I would do no such</p>
               <p>"thing." He then said, other people had been robbed, that he was going farther, and he went away. I sent for Mr. Townsend, a magistrate, to my house, who discovered that Hunsdon was the receiver of these fish. The prisoners were taken up by the information of one Mitchell: They were brought before Mr. Townsend, and charged with stealing these fish. Hetherington said he was guilty.</p>
               <p>Did you make either of them any promise that you would not prosecute them if they confessed? - No, I never saw them till they were brought before Mr. Townsend.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by Mr. Townsend to induce them to confess? - No.</p>
               <p>You accused them of stealing your fish? - Yes, by the information of Mitchell; I found part of a letter of Hetherington's on my premisses; I charged Hetherington before the magistrate, and he confessed taking the fish. Sorrell said that he was with Hetherington and Mitchell. I found some fish on the premisses of Hunsdon, which I thought were mine, but I will not swear to fish.</p>
               <p>When was the last time you lost fish? - I think on the 5th of October.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How large is the bason in which the fish were kept? - Larger than the middle of this place.</p>
               <p>Is it paved at the bottom? - It is not, it is a very muddy bottom.</p>
               <p>Are there no other but gold and silver fish? - I believe there are tench, I have tried to take the tench.</p>
               <p>You lost fish, you do not know that they were stolen, only by the information of Mitchell? - Yes, a great many had been drawn out on the grass, and trodden to pieces.</p>
               <p>You could not pick out your little Neptune among this parcel? - I believe I could. Some of them sell for five shillings a pair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman TOWNSEND sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a magistrate for the county of Middlesex. These men were brought before me, in consequence of a warrant issued against them on a charge of stealing these fish. Immediately as the prisoners came in they confessed themselves guilty. Hetherington said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060046"></xptr> I have been exceeding guilty, every thing that falls upon me I deserve. He said Sorrell was drawn in by him and by Hunsdon, who was to receive the fish. The evidence of the time when they stole the fish was doubtful. Hetherington  said to Sorrell, You cannot forget the day, it was the day after the great storm; that was, I believe, the night of the 15th or 16th. He further confessed, that he had been there several times before with other people; that he got 80 one night, 30 another, and so on. Sorrell said the bladder was hung upon the tree, and he put the fish into it himself: He said the evidence was more outrageous than the others; that he got into the tree, and shook down the apples; upon which he said to him, You rascal, what are you about? Do you want to make a noise, to cause a discovery?</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said to induce them to confess the fact? - There was not.</p>
               <p>(The prisoners left their defence to their counsel.)</p>

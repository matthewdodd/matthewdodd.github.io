At half-past two on the morning of 27th April, I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Essex-street, Islington, and saw the prisoner there with another man, each carrying a bundle—I spoke to them and said, "I want to speak to you," they both ran away immediately, and as they passed over the canal bridge, they threw the bundles into the canal—I overtook the prisoner, and handed him over to another policeman—I then went down to the canal and got this bundle</p>

I said,"Yes," and gave it to him - he gave me a farthing, and said, "Go back and get half a pint of rum, and take for it out of the sovereign;" I said it was not a sovereign, it was a farthing; he told me to go along, but I would not; I took hold of him and kept him till he was taken.</p>

I saw the prisoner with Bird, at No. 1, Eagle-street - the prisoner was trying to get from her - it is a house of ill-fame - she said he had given her a farthing for a sovereign - the prisoner took some money out of his pocket, which fell on the ground - I picked up two half-crowns, several shillings, and four or five sixpences - I took him to the Yorkshire Grey.</p>

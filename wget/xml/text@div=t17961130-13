               <p>ANDREW TEDEMAN sworn. - I am a constable of the Ward of Aldersgate: On the night of the 17th of this month, a pawnbroker's servant brought the prisoner to the watch-house, and gave charge of her; I perceived a bundle under her cloak, which she tried to conceal; I asked her what she had under her cloak; she said it was nothing to me; I forced the bundle from her, and found two quart pots in it; I asked her how she came by them; she told me she had found them in Long-acre; I looked at the directions on the pots, one proved to be Mr. Mansfield's, the Horse-and-groom, Lincoln's-inn-fields, the other belonged to Mr. Bolt, in Longacre; I took the pots from her, and went the next morning to Mr. Mansfield's; I have had the pot ever since.</p>
               <p>DAVID PERRYMAN sworn. - I observed her to have a bundle under her arm; I asked her to let me look what it was; she put it on the counter, and produced some fragments of victuals.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the watch-house? - A. Yes; I saw her attempt to conceal the bundle under the bench; I saw the officer take it from her, and take out two quart pewter pots, one was Mr. Mansfield's, the other Mr. Bolt's.</p>

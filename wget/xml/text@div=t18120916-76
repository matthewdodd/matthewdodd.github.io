            . Q. In consequence of a burglary being committed in the house of Mr. Holwell, you were led to an enquiry - A. I was, and that enquiry led me to the house of Howell; he deals in old rags, iron, and glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find there any saltcellars - A. I found the saltcellars in the one pair of stairs in Howell's bed-room. I found nothing in the lower part that could be identified.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went up stairs, was there any obstacle made by the wife or Howell - A. Howell or his wife, stated, that the room was not fit for us to go into. I replied, that we were married men; we had no idle curiosity to gratify. And in the one pair bedroom, these salt cellars were found. Mr. Holwell exclaimed; Oh! dear; these are the saltcellars that we have lost so long. Howell said he bought them of

             some months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you spoken to Howell before about Lewis - A. I had. I told him to be very cautious what answers he gave, as Lewis and Young had been suspected of a burglary. I asked, if he had seen them lately; he answered, no. Have you bought any thing of them lately? No. Have you received any thing of them lately? No. Then he stated, that he had bought them of Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state any thing of the price he had given for them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards inquire of Lewis about these saltcellars - A. I did; I asked him where he got the saltcellars that he had sold to Howell. He said he had taken them from Mr. Holwell's, while in his service.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by him in the presence of Howell about them - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Howell's Defence. I purchased the salts. I gave a fair price for them. I kept these salts for my own use; on my own mantle-piece</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 21st of April, about half after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the King's private road, St. Luke's, Chelsea; the prisoner had passed me as I was talking to another man in the road; I perceived that he had something of a bulk under his coat, I followed him, and when I came up with him I asked him what he had got under his coat; he pulled out these pieces of cloth that I have got in my hand; I asked him if he had got any flannel, he said yes, he had bought it at a shop in Oxford-street; I said I believe you live in Chelsea, he said he did, I had seen the man before; I said I should have paid a penny a-yard more than I should have walked to Oxford-street to buy flannel; he replied I work in George-street, Oxford-street, he said he was a <rs id="t18070513-8-deflabel49" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

I said, this is the first time, I suppose, he said it was; I told him to be cautious of telling an untruth, for I should search his house, I put him in the watch-house, and went to his lodgings, and there I found the remainder of the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. That was taken at another time, we must not hear that, only what was taken at one time.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Albert Chapman, a linen-draper, in Great Russell-street. At half-past one o'clock, on the 6th of July, the prisoner came to our shop, and asked for some mouseline-de<lb></lb>laine</p>

               <p>—she selected one out of the first lot I showed her, and put it under her arm—she asked for one with a darker ground—I showed her one, which she bought—she then looked at other articles, and left the shop—I followed her across the street, and brought her back—I said I thought she had something which did not belong to her—she said, "Have I?"—I took it from under her dress, and gave her in charge—this is the dress—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

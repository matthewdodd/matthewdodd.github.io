               <p>Q. Could you be a month missing these articles? - A. They could not have been taken till within a week, without my missing them; I missed them the latter end of November, or beginning of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see this spoon again, and when? - A. On the 16th of January, in my own counting-house; Mr. Murl, partner with Mr. Cox, sent the spoon, in two pieces, and the skewer, in three; Mr. Bennet is here, who belongs to Mr. Murl.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see him, before you missed the things? - A. In the course of that week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you now correct yourself? - A. Yes; if I said otherwise I was mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Murl produced them, was any body with him? - A. Yes; a clerk of Mr. Dickson's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This spoon and the skewer were lost, as you imagine, or, at least, might be lost out of your kitchen? - A. I only suppose so; I did not see them taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a tavern in Water-lane, Tower-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you have a good deal of company resort to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a vast number of persons have access to your kitchen, as well as Mr. Dickson and his servant? - A. Yes; of course.</p>
               <p>Q. And, of course, in the way of your business, as a tavern-keeper, your plate must lie in that kitchen liable to the inroads of any body that thinks fit to come? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had been in your house in the course of the week preceding the time of your missing them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many persons might have been in your kitchen in the course of that week? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In the beginning of December, or the beginning of November, you missed them, after rumaging, and the property was not found till six weeks after? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Mr. Murl, who brought the property to you to-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the clerk who came with Mr. Murl, with the spoons and the skewer, to-day? - A. No; I have not.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BENNET sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Messrs. Cox, Murl, and Co. refiners, in Little Britain: On the 28th of November last, the prisoner at the bar brought a table-spoon and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130150"></xptr>skewer to offer me for sale, at our counting-house, in Little Britain; the spoon was in two, and the skewer in three pieces; from their appearance, I thought there was something improper in the business, and I detained them.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner respecting these articles? - A. I asked him, from whom he brought them; he said, it was nothing to me, if I did not like to buy them, I might give them him back; I told him, I should not, till I was more satisfied how he came by them; I then asked him, what his name was; he said, his name was Morris; I asked him, where he lived; he said, he lived with a Mr. Dickson, an attorney, in Mincing-lane; I then told him, if he brought a memorandum from Mr. Dickson, or brought Mr. Dickson with him, if our gentlemen were in the way, the property would be delivered up to him; he then went away, leaving the things in my possession, in a kind of huff, because I would not deliver him up the property; when Mr. Murl came back from dinner, the same evening, I informed him of the circumstance.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and Mr. Murl you must not tell us. - A. The prisoner called again upon the 5th of January; the articles had laid upon a desk of mine from the 28th of November till the prisoner called again upon the 5th of January; there were three or four other clerks, besides myself, present; he told me, he had come for those articles he left the 28th of November; I told him, I could not deliver them up, without the authority of my master; if he would call the next morning, about eleven, they would be, one, or both, in the way; he said, he could not call at eleven, he would call between the hours of four and six in the evening, those being the hours of absence from office; I saw Mr. Murl about an hour and a half after this, and I communicated it to Mr. Murl; the next morning, the 6th, I delivered the two articles to Mr. Murl, in the same condition in which I had received them from the prisoner; the next time I saw them was about three or four hours after; when Mr. Murl came back from 'Change, he brought them back with him, to the counting-house, and I gave them, the next morning, to Mr. Cox, to take them to the Mansion-house; I went with him, to the Mansion-house; they were then left in the hands of the constable, who is here, his name is Juson.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he apprehended? - A. On the 7th, by means of Mr. Barnes; I was sent for on the 7th, to attend the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. The day before he was not in custody? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Who apprehended the prisoner? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are clerk to the house of Cox and Murl? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is one of the most respectable houses in the city of London, as refiners? - A. None more so.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar came with these things, and you told him, if he would bring a memorandum from Mr. Dickson, his master, you would purchase them at a future day? - A. Yes; if our gentlemen were satisfied, it was to be delivered up.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner, who brought the spoon and the other thing broke, gave his own name? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. The very name by which he is indicted, where he lived, and who was his master? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you had entertained suspicions, and would not deliver up the property, he came again to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>DANIEL JUSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of Tower-ward, (produces the property): I received it from one of my Lord Mayor's clerks, at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. These are the articles that were produced before the Lord Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Bennett). Look at these things, and see if they are the same? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. I have not; they have been out of my possession a long while.</p>
               <p>Q. But where the articles you gave to Mr. Cox, the same things that were produced before the Lord Mayor? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces are there there? - A. The spoon in two, the skewer in three; just as they were when the prisoner brought them to me; there is a mark of W S M upon the spoon, there has been a mark upon the skewer, which is erased out.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Barnes). Look at these articles, and see if you can put them together? - A. They appear as if they belonged to each other; the broken parts fit each other; and it has the cypher upon it, W S M; I had had them five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to swear that they are your's? - A. Yes; here is the fellow spoon to it.(producing it), with the same cypher; I have also the fellow to the skewer, (producing it); the cypher upon it is the same; and upon the broken one it is defaced.</p>
               <p>Jury. The cypher and crest are both nearly out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130151"></xptr>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he lived with me about four years, up to the time he was taken; I have trusted him with several hundred pounds; I might say two thousand pounds, to go to the banker's; and I have left him in my house, with five thousand pounds property, and never missed a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your opinion such, of him, that if he were discharged at this moment, you would take him again? - A. I would.</p>
               <p>Q. As to his general character for honesty, have you any doubt of it? - A. I never heard any thing against him till this charge; or I would not have trusted him in my house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was he with you as clerk? - A. Not particularly as clerk; he used to go of messages, and errands.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is he? - A. I take him to be about forty years.</p>
               <p>Q. What salary had he? - A. He had no particular salary whatever; he used to go with me wherever I went almost.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means did his subsistence arise? - A. When he wanted half-a-guinea I let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he no demand upon you for his work and labour? - A. Never; I used to clothe him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live in the house with you? - A. He frequently slept in the house; if I went any where he dined with me.</p>
               <p>Q. He was under no regular establishment with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And his living with you was accidentally what you close to give him in return for such service as he did you? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been bred up in the office of an attorney? - A. No; the way I first became acquainted with him was, I tried a cause for him, between him and the sheriffs of London, in which I succeeded, and recovered 300l. and odd for him; he was a china-man.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into your service, there was an end of his china trade? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think of taking this man, in any shape, into your service? - A. I took him out of charity; for all that he had to receive out of that business, he had to pay again directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he lived with you ever since? - A. Yes: I have trusted him to take money to the banker's, and he never robbed me of a shilling; I never heard any thing bad of him in my life till the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a single man? - A. Yes; he used to sleep in my dining-room.</p>

               <p>Court. (To the Prisoner). You have stood in great need of that character; that has induced the prosecutor, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, to recommend you to mercy, upon this occasion; had it not been for that recommendation, and that character, which, I believe has come from a description of men, very different from those, whom unfortunately we see daily and hourly in this place, your punishment would have been very different; but there is no doubt, that the persons who have appeared in your favour are persons of character, and their evidence having impressed the mind of the Jury, has had its due weight. The Court have taken into consideration the circumstances of your case, and finding the readiness of Mr. Dixon to receive you again into his service, and to entertain you as he has been accustomed to do, are desirous that you should return to that employment, bearing in mind the lesson that you have had to day-that, till the moment before this offence, your character has not received any impeachment, you will be careful during the remainder of your life, and use double diligence that, you may keep it in future unspotted, remembering the narrow escape you have had; the sentence of this Court in consequence of that good character, is, that you be <rs id="t17960113-93-punish525" type="punishmentDescription">

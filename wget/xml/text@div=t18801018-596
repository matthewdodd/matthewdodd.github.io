I am a grocer, of 38, North Street, Lambeth—about 6.30 a.m. on 18th September I went into my shop—a pane of glass and part of the sash were broken in the back door—I had seen it safe over night—the till was gone—about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in it—I also found these things produced: a bunch of thread, a piece of comb, a necktie, a yard measure, and a piece of paper with this direction on it, "Mrs. Barbary, 22, Three Ways Road, Nunhead," which were not there the previous night—I went to bed about 11.30—I never saw the prisoner before—the back door had been left open.</p>

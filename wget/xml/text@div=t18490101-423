On Saturday evening, 16th Dec., about a quarter or ten minutes past seven o'clock, I went into my bed-room, which is the front room on the first-floor, to make the bed—there are two chests of drawers in that room, rn one of which my husband always keeps his money—it is a small drawer, and is always kept loeked—it was to all appearance safe as usual at that time, and the window quite shut—it had not been opened that day—it is a small sash-window, with a catch at the side—I did not notice whether that catch was up or down at the time—I came down stairs, and in about twenty or twenty-five minutes a little girl, named Sarah Ann Sharp, came and told me something—I immediately took a light, and ran up to my bed-room—I could not get in—I called same men to <hi rend="italic">vay</hi> assistance, and afterwards got in—I found a chaif had been placed</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William White, of 22, Brandon-street, nearly opposite Mr. Butler's, and am a milliner. On Saturday evening, 16th Dec, about half-past seven o'clock, I was going from the Kent-road to my own house, and had occasion to pass Mr. Butler's on the opposite side of the way—I saw a man looking out of the bed-room window, which was wide open—I was then eight or ten yards off—I looked at him, and I believe he saw me, for he drew back into the room—I saw another man on the pavement, under the window, with an umbrella—it was raining—I had an umbrella up, leaning over my right shoulder—I heard the man under the window say, "<hi rend="italic">Damme</hi>, be quick"—the man then came forward to the window again, and jumped out into the street—whether he jumped from the window, or first stepped on the ledge, I cannot tell—I had not an opportunity of seeing his face fully the first time; the second time I saw it perfectly—the prisoner is the man—I had very frequently seen him before at Mr. Butler's, where I was in the habit of going twice a day for my beer—I never spoke to him, and did not know his name—in the summer-time he was generally sitting on a form outside the bar-window—there is a gaslight in the bar-window; that threw a light up towards the first-floor quite sufficient for me to see the man, and when he jumped down, the man with the umbrella first ran, the prisoner followed him round the corner—I immediately went in, and described the man to Mrs. Butler—when the prisoner alighted on the ground I was not more than two yards from him—I was crossing the road, and I stood still when he jumped, by the side of a chaise-cart—I have not the slightest doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

               <p>since the summer, but I did not know where he lived—he used to be in com<lb></lb>pany with a stout man—I knew that stout man by sight, for I had to take home some dresses to a person at 25, Charles-street, Lock's-fields, and this stout man opened the door to roe, which made me notice him particularly afterwards—I have seen him sitting with the prisoner before that and after<lb></lb>wards also—I did not know his name either—the prisoner used to wear a hat; on this night he had a black shiny cap on, like oilskin, I cannot say whether it had a front to it—it was not over his face—it seemed on the crown of hit head—it was a darkish night—there was no light, except from the bar-parlour—I am certain that the shutters of the bar-parlour were down—I saw a little girl in advance of me; I do not know her name, the was nearer to Mr. Butler's house than I was—she gave the first alarm—the next time I saw the prisoner was on the Wednesday morning following, the 19th, at the station—the sergeant came after me, and told me he had got the man—he did not point him out to me—I was sent into the room—there were several men there—I was sent in to recognise the man that I had been in the habit of seeing at Mr. Butler's, and I knew him in a minute—I cannot tell how he was dressed, no more than the cap—I saw his features very clearly—the light was thrown upon his face from the bar<lb></lb>window, which is a bow<lb></lb>window—the gas<lb></lb>lamp outside was not alight, but the gas inside the window was, and I saw the prisoner's features from that—it is a large window, all glass—it is flat to the house, not a bow—I did not notice the man's face the first time, but the second time, when he got out, I saw it perfectly, as he was getting out, and at the window—those were the only opportunities I bad of seeing him—he had nothing on his face—his cap was on his head—I could see his face plainly—I did not notice whether he had whiskers—I had always seen him with whiskers—I did not run alter him—I am timid, and I imme<lb></lb>diately went in and told Mrs. Butler.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 82). I was called to Butler's house on Saturday, 16th Dec.—I saw some marks on the leaden ledge outside the first-floor window, apparently from shoe-nails—the ledge extends about eight inches from the wall over the bar-window—it is put to carry the wet off—it is level, so that a person could stand on it, and get from it in at the front window—a person could easily get from the ground to that ledge, it is only six or seven feet high—it is a very low house; you go down a step to get into it—if one man assisted another to get up, of course it would be easier—I received from Mrs. Butler a description of a person—I also received other information, in consequence of which I sought for the prisoner—I bad seen him before, but did not know his name—I went to 72, St. Andrew's-road, Kent-road, and with other constables watched that house from two o'clock on Sunday until Tuesday night, 19th, about nine, when I saw the prisoner come into St. Andrew's-road, come along on the opposite side to where he lived, and pass his house, 72—after he had passed it four or five houses, he crossed the road in a slanting direction, went into an a venue or court leading into St. George's-road, about a dozen or eighteen steps, then returned and went on the same side of the way as his house, and just as he got to the door he coughed—he did not knock—the door was opened almost</p>

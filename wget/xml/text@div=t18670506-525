I reside at 12, Windsor Terrace—at a quarter to nine on the evening of 13th April I was in the Great Dover Road—I was going to catch a nine o'clock train—as I was passing Leicester Houses a man seized me at the back of my head—he put one hand over my mouth—I looked him full in the face—there was sufficient light for me to see him—two others pinned my arms behind me and took my watch, and rifled my pockets—I had a sovereign and 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I fell down and they ran</p>

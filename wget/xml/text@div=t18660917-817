                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman to Mr. Mungo McGeorge, of Friday Street, London, Manchester warehouseman—the prisoner was in his employ as assistant warehouseman, and had been there between nine and ten years, I think—on the evening of Friday, 24th August, I saw the prisoner leaving the warehouse, and followed him—I noticed an unusual bulk in his coat pocket—I followed him to the corner of the Mansion House, then stopped him, and said, "What have you got in your pocket, William?"—he said, "I have got a paper"—I said, "You have got more than one paper"—he said, "Yes, I have got two"—I said, "It is more bulky than that, William; you must show me what you have got"—he then hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Shall I go back to the warehouse with you?"—I said, "Certainly"—he then walked back to the warehouse, and he took this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170069"></xptr>
               <p>waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his pocket and gave it to me—it is the property of Mr. McGeorge—I said, "This is very wrong, William, and I must give you in charge"—he said, "I am very sorry; don't say anything about it," or words to that effect—I said, "No, I cannot look over this; I must give you in charge, William"—he said, "Pray do not; only think of my wife and family," and one or two expressions of that kind—I said, "It is per<lb></lb>fectly absurd to talk of them; you ought to have thought of that before; you have done wrong, and I must give you in charge"—we then waited for some time in the warehouse, thinking an officer would come past—I omitted something which he stated at first—he said, "I was only taking it home to show my wife, and if she approved of it I intended to keep it, purchase it," and then what I have stated took place—no officer came past, and he suggested that he should walk to the station with me, and he did—I gave him into custody at the station—the persons in Mr. McGeorge's em<lb></lb>ploy are allowed to purchase goods—when the goods are selected they are brought forward to the entering counter and entered to the parties for whom they are intended—if he does not purchase them he makes an entry, to show that they are had on approval, and if they are not approved of and returned on the following day they are credited to their account—no person is allowed to take goods on approval without reporting the fact and having an entry made—the report ought to be made to me—the prisoner did not report that he was taking this waistcoat away to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has he on other occasions bought goods, which have been entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has on many occasions—I have got the invoices of all the goods he purchased—those are some (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I don't think he had any goods on credit, except up to the end of the week—he has not on many occasions had credit, that I am aware of—all the warehousemen have a similar privilege of buying goods—I never knew a case of a man borrow<lb></lb>ing goods for a day—I never took goods for a day in my life—I put a pair of trousers on for about two hours one day, to go to a funeral, but not without the knowledge of Mr. McGeorge—the warehouseman gave them to me, and put them back in stock again afterwards—I believe there was one other similar case on one other occasion—I don't know that some of the men have engagements as singers in the evening—I don't know of their borrowing clothes occasionally—if the prisoner had asked permission to show the waistcoat to his wife it would have been granted, the proper entry being made—he was originally a porter in the service, and has been raised to a warehouseman—I went to his house with the police directly after he was taken into custody—he gave us the address at the station.</p>

I am the wife of Alexander Saunders, of 73, Wardour Street—we lodged on the same floor as the prisoners—they were there three weeks and four days—there was no wall, only a wooden partition between their room and mine, and I could hear plainly what went on in their room—after they had been there a week I heard a child scream, it was a younger voice than that of the elder boy; it was one sudden cry and no more, as the cry was smothered—I could hear a strap as I thought—that occurred repeatedly in the day—time—I have seen the prisoners leave the house in the morning, and have seen the eldest child go to school—I have never tried whether the door was locked.</p>

I also found this stick and this strap without a buckle—I found the female prisoner and the youngest boy at home—I asked her if she was the mother of the boy—she said "Yes"—I said that I was a detective officer and had received information that she had been ill—treating him—I found on the child's right hand, near the knuckles, a large wound which had nothing on it, and was very dirty—there was also a wound on one finger—the child was very thin and I sent a man for the relieving officer from the workhouse—I saw in a cupboard three long French loaves, and some rump steak not cooked, and some cooked beef—the father came in after the medical man was there—I took off the child's clothes—he had on a jacket and knickerbockers and shoes, but no shirt or stockings—the other boy had a shirt and socks and everything right—I told the father what I was there for—he said that the child was delicate and could not eat—somebody went to the cupboard and broke off a piece bread and he ate that, and afterwards at Marlborough Street a gentleman offered him five or six little wine biscuits, and he ate the lot ravenously, a whole one at a time—he was weighed at the workhouse in his clothes, boots, and cap, and only weighed 32 lbs.—he has improved now in appearance and in flesh—he was filthily dirty and his head was in a filthy state—there was a folding mattrass, and in one corner of the room was a little heap of straw broken up very short, as it had been very much used.</p>

I am a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company, and visiting medical officer of the Westminster Union—on 9th April I saw the child, he presented a pallid emaciated appearance—he was apparently six years old; his feet and hands were cold and livid, there was a considerable bruise on his right temple, the middle finger of his right hand was much bruised, and there was a small ulcer on the finger next to it; and an ulceration behind each ear, which might have been from neglect and dirt, or from injury, or from the weak state of the blood—there were ulcera<lb></lb>ions on his toes, and a large ulcer on his right thigh, and another on the back of his <hi rend="italic">right</hi> hand across the knuckles, the mark of which will always remain and so will those on the thigh, as there is complete loss of structure—that indicates a burn I think.

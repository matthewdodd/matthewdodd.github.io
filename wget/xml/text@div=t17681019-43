            . I live at the King's Arms, between St. John's street and Islington; on the 3d of September, a little before twelve at night, I was going down to the watch-house; near the turnpike I heard the cry of murder, I turned back again to the turnpike, I heard the blows and sticks go; I asked the turnpike man to go into the fields with me; he said he could not go off his duty; then I returned to the watch-house at Clerkenwell-green, they had heard the cry there; after that I went to Bridewell near one o'clock, there was Mr. Stoddart, the keeper, very much bruised, he had been stabbed and ill used; he was in his own house within the gate, very bloody, lying on his back on a pillow or bed; his clothes were taken off all but his shirt, he had his right-hand over his left-side on a wound; as soon as I could come near him, I asked him how he came to be in that condition; he said he was coming down from the <placeName id="t17681019-43-crimeloc252">New River Head</placeName>

            . I was servant to the deceased; betwixt twelve and one, between the Saturday night and Sunday the 4th of September, my master was brought home by two or three men and a woman; I found him sitting on a bench in the yard, he said, I am a dead man, Langley; he said, two rascals stopped me in the first field, and said to him, d - n your eyes, your money or life; one of the villains sought fair, and the other cut him with a knife or cutlace; that he overpowered one of them, and got him down, and the other villain came and stabbed him under the breast; we took him up into the parlour, and set him in a chair, and called his sister; I went and called Mr. Hart the surgeon, he came and dressed him about one o'clock; when he was lying in bed, I found a wound on his left-side, an inch or an inch and a half long; his hands were very bloody, he had a cut across the top of his forehead; he said he tore one of the rascals coats off in the fields; we went several of us up into the field, there we found a hat, two wigs, a coat, and two or three pieces of a black silk handkerchief; I staid on the spot; just after day-light I observed a milkman pick up something; he went four or five yards, and put down his things, and came back again to look; I went to him, and said, have you lost any thing; he said, no, but I have found a silver button, he gave it me; I said, go over with me into the field, I will show you where my master was stabbed and the blood; there we found my master's watch-chain and a clasp-knife all bloody, within about two yards of it; I can swear to the chain by the seal, I know it well; I went to see the prisoner in Tothil-fields Bridewell the Friday after he was taken; he said he and Simpson stopped my master with intent to rob him, and that Simpson was the man that stabbed and cut him.</p>

I am a surgeon, I was called in to Mr. Stoddart on the 4th of September, about one in the morning; I found several wounds about him, but the greatest injury seemed to be on his left-side; he had a great difficulty in fetching his breath, and he spit some blood, there was a cut about an inch and a half long on his side; I dressed him, and after a few days he appeared to get rather better; on Tuesday the 13th in the morning I found him much worse, he complained<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190029"></xptr> of a great fulness in his stomach, and of a greater difficulty of breathing; he continued growing worse and worse, till the day he died, which was the 18th; I opened the body, and found the left cavity of the thorax near full of an extravasated fluid, which was the cause of his death; I saw him in health about an hour before he went out that evening; that wound had not past very far on his side, his death could not have been from that; he said he had been beat and trod upon by two footpads that used him very ill, it must be the bruises that occasioned his death; I desired him at first not to talk, as it would be injurious to him; but when he began to get a little better he gave a particular account, and frequently repeated to me that he was stopped at the end of a lane by Islington Spaw by two fellows, who demanded his money or life; that he said, you rascals, I hope you shall have neither; that he had them down several times in the lane, and in the ditch, and they endeavoured to get away from him, and he ran after them, and got one by the coat, which the man slipped off; then he took hold of him, and tore his shirt off, and left him naked, but being faint by the loss of blood, he could not stand it any longer, and they got away from him; one ran away, and he had the other in a ditch, and the other came back again and cut him, he thought with a cutlace; he said, sometimes he was down, and at other times they were; he said he remembered receiving a blow on his side, which he thought was by a stick, which I think occasioned that extravasated fluid, which deprived the left lobe of the lungs from receiving any air, which hindered it by way of suffocation; I saw a cut in his coat where the wound on his side was, he mentioned being beat by both of them.</p>

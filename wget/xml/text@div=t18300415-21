            . I am single, and keep a confectioner's shop. It is my dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square; the prisoner was apprehended at ten minutes past nine o'clock - this cake was in my shop, and the door shut I am sure, but not locked; I shut it myself - it fastens with a spring lock inside, but can be opened outside by lifting the latch; I am sure it was latched - when the officer took the prisoner, I immediately missed the cake, and when he took the prisoner away, I went to my parlour, which is behind the shop, and missed my watch from the mantel-piece; the door between the shop and parlour was open - I had occasion to go down into the kitchen, and was not absent above three or five minutes; the watch was safe when I went down, for I saw it - I did not miss it till the officer took the prisoner off to the watch-house; I ran after him on missing it.</p>

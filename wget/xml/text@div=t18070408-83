            ; he clapped a pistol to my breast, he told me my money or my life, no hesitating; he rifled my pockets and took four pennyworth of halfpence; I believe I had a few more, but I am sure I had four pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this. - A. It was moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how the man was dressed. - A. He had got long sailor's trowsers on, and a long light coloured great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was under that. - A. I could not tell, it was buttoned up to the top.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the coat. - A. A road colour, and his trowsers I took to be blue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his countenance. - A. Yes, I looked in his face all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be with you. - A. He was with me as much as five minutes, I'll be bound for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before. - A. No, never sir, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards. - A. I heard there was such a person taken; I saw him afterwards get out of a coach; it struck me directly that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where. - A. At Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that. - A. It was the second time of their being examined. I was robbed on a Friday; this was almost three weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know he was in custody when he come out of the coach - had he irons on. - A. Yes, he had irons on when I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether you knew when you saw him that he was a prisoner. - A. Yes, I was sure he was a prisoner. There was Roach's brother he came to me when I was in the yard; I walked over to the other side of the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. That has nothing to do with this business.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Roach's brother said to me so sure as I swore against these men, we were all dead men.</p>
               <p>Court. Now look at the prisoner, are you sure he is the man. - A. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear to him by his features. - A. Yes, and by his nose; I looked at his face when he undone my small clothes, and when he held the pistol to my cheek I took notice of his nose all the time; the other man presented the pistol to my cheek, I saw him but once, and by that I will not say I am sure of him; the other man I took to be Roach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. How often have you been robbed. - A. Never before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When he put the pistol so you you was alarmed. A. I was at first, till I threw my purse away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080048"></xptr> Q. You had a pistol put to your head, that alarmed you - when persons are alarmed they have not their senses so much about them. - A. I know that.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat had this man on that robbed you. - A. A largish round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. It come over his face. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had his hat on, and you say it was a moonlight night. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the moon coming on the top of his hat you could not see his face. - A. That did not hide his face from me. I dropped my purse down between two trees, I marked where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you think most about, your money or your life. - A. I thought more about my purse than my life; I had four pounds about me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that when you saw the prisoner get out of the coach it struck you that he was the man. - A. Yes, I did not like to swear to him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that you could not swear to him, - A. I said I will not swear to him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you attend three or four examinations before you swore to him. - A. No, only one.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not swear to him at the first. - A. No, I said I won't; I did at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of a reward afterwards. - A. No, I had heard of that before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never hand any conversation with any body about any reward. - A. Not now.</p>
               <p>Q. You are talking to me now, has no one told you that there is a reward for convicting a man of a highway robbery. - A. I have been told so.</p>
               <p>Q. You expect to get a great deal more than four-pence. - A. I do not expect to get any.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is to be given do not you expect to get part of it. - A. Yes, if it is given.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do expect it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you say so at first, have any of the officers told you. - A. No, I have heard it in different places in the country.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker and live at Hammersmith. The prisoner was in my service from the 9th of November last. On the 23rd of February I procured an officer and gave him into custody—I was present when his box was searched, and there was found into it the articles which the officer now produces—this towel I had in pledge—it was pledged on the 18th of August—it has not been applied for to be redeemed—I know this book—this was in pledge also—I do not know anything of this Guern<lb></lb>sey-frock myself—I found some duplicates of ours in his box, And here it one corresponding with the Guernsey-frock—when we take in a pledge we give the person one duplicate and keep another ourselves, which is pinned to the article—he had no right to have these duplicates in his box at all—I have searched to see if I have such a pledge at that referred to in this duplicate, and I cannot find it in the place—I found tea duplicates in his box.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I found the goods upon the prisoner in his room, the waistcoat upon his back. - I lost the things upon Saturday last out of my room; I came home about two or three o'clock, and undrest myself, and left the waistcoat and breeches upon the table in the room; I left nobody in the room; the barber was in the room when I undrest myself, but went out before me, and I shut the door after me; the key was broke, I could not lock it; I came home again between twelve and one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you miss the waistcoat and breeches then? - No; not till next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, when the prisoner called upon me in the room: I first missed them between eight and nine o'clock upon Sunday morning; when I missed them I was going to shew the prisoner the waistcoat, as it was a new one.</p>
               <p>What was you going to shew it him for? As it was a new waistcoat, and a new pattern, having been intimately acquainted with him the last two months past; it was a silk waistcoat: I could not find it, I looked in the trunk, I thought the chamber-maid might have put it in the trunk; then I missed my breeches; the chamber-maid could neither find the waistcoat nor the breeches. I asked her if she had put them any where. </p>
               <p>Where did you lodge? - At the <placeName id="t17811205-11-crimeloc60">Saracen's Head, Friday-street</placeName>

               <p>Did the prisoner lodge at the same house? No; at the Blossoms inn, Lawrence-lane: the chambermaid said she did not know any thing of them; the prisoner was present; then I immediately said they were stole: the prisoner made some remarks, that it was no more than a common thing; he had lost several things at the Blossom's inn. I told the chambermaid not to make herself uneasy, but speak about it, and say who had been in the room; I gave them up for lost. Upon the Monday morning I went to call upon the prisoner, about nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect; and I saw him sitting in the Coffee-room at the Blossoms-inn, with my waistcoat on, with several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050023"></xptr> gentlemen of my acquaintance with him. After the first compliments were over, I asked him where he got that waistcoat? for it was very like that which I had lost, which was stole out of my room: he told me Mr. Stanton's taylor made it; I said the taylor, never could have made it on purpose for him, I was confident, as I saw ne'er another of the pattern in town, and the taylor, or some fellow or other had stole it from me, and sold it to him; he said it could be no such thing; he had made him not only that, but black stocking breeches, and that Mr. Stanton had got a waistcoat off the same piece; that he gave 2 l. 10 s. for the waistcoat, and 2 l. 5 s. for the breeches; I think that is as near the sum as I can recollect. I waited in the room till the gentlemen had done breakfast; I desired Mr. Findley to go up with me into his room, and I desired I might see the back of the waistcoat, and I observed it was pinned with black pins all the way down, to make it fit him. I immediately observed that, and said the taylor was a lubber, or the waistcoat was never made for him.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - I don't know what excuse he made to that; I insisted immediately upon seeing Stanton's taylor; I was positive it was mine, it was a great deal too long for him, and too large: he said he could not see the taylor at that time, he would call upon him another time; he said he was going to Chatham upon a party then; as I found he was, I insisted upon calling upon the taylor directly; I ran to the window to call for the waiter to go for him; he desired I would not: he says, then I tell it you as a secret, I bought it of a Jew, and I gave 2 l. 10 s. for it, which I told him was more than the original value, and when jews sold things, they generally sold them for less.</p>
               <p>That was more than the value? - Yes; I believe it was 2 l. 2 s. or 2 l. 5 s. I gave for it; I told him the man that had the waistcoat had my breeches and things; he said he did not know; he had seen him several times. Before I looked at the breeches, I threw some down upon the ground, and found mine, and I said I will take my oath these are my breeches, have them where you will.</p>
               <p>You found a pair of breeches that you believed to be your own? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they sattin? - They were what they call Florentine, I gave two or three pounds for them.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular you know them by? - The first day I put them on, I struck them against a place and broke a little hole, one upon the knee and another upon the strap, both at the same time. It is very remarkable, which made me swear to it, there was a little ouze, it broke a stitch in the weaving.</p>
               <p>Did you see those marks upon those breeches you found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there any buckles? - There were a pair of stone knee buckles I gave a guinea or a guinea and a half for, I bought them of Mr. Manly of Chatham, there was a purse there but I had taken out the money.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the purse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the buckles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt they were all your things? - I have not the least doubt they were mine.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you found those other things? - I was angry he did not tell me he had bought the breeches as well as the other things, he said he intended to surprize me. I told him it would be a very agreeable surprize, if he would tell me the person he bought them of. I asked him if he had bought the knee buckles or silk stockings of him, he had often bought silk stockings, he shewed me a pair he bought lately. I asked him if he knew where the Jew was, he said that he did not, that he owed him a guinea or some such thing, and he would come there again. I insisted upon his breaking off the engagement of going to Chatham, and go and see for the Jew, for he had told me his name was

               <p>What did he say then? - We went back to the Blossom's Inn. I had no suspicion he could be guilty of any such thing. I said I hoped we should find the man between this and Monday. I left word if Isaacs came to the Blossom's Inn, to send him to the Saracen's head. I was in hopes of buying my silk stocking again. No Jew came on Monday. I mentioned the circumstance of his calling a great many times upon me, and leaving a note, and being shewn up to my room when he had no business there. I concluded he was the man.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing farther from your own knowledge? - I asked him first of all if the Jew was come, he said, he believed there had been a man to enquire after him the night before, but he said he had not seen him. I immediately told him he was both Jew and thief, and he was taken into custody that morning.</p>
               <p>What is he? - When I first was acquainted with him by accident, going to take him a place to go to Chatham, he dined at the ordinary with a gentleman acquainted with our ship, we agreed to spend the evening together; he told me he was an officer in the Irish horse.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Two months; after that he told me he had a commission in the forty-fourth regiment at Quebec, and one night he was intoxicated, and said, his name was not Findley but Carr, but went by that name, as he had killed a man in a duel in Ireland, and desired I would call him Findley.</p>

I said nineteen in the corner; as the lamp was up, I saw him go up stairs. I can't say I saw him go into the room, neither did I see him come down again: about half an hour after that, as I was going to Honey-lane market, somebody touched me upon the shoulder, as I was crossing by Honey-lane market, and followed me to the other side of the way, and asked me if Mr. Littlehales was come in?

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Upon the Friday evening, there was a broker, with a green bag, he told me he had a very handsome waistcoat to sell, and some small cloaths: I brought him to the inn; he had two pair of breeches, the one small, the other large, and two waistcoats; I agreed to give him two guineas and a half for the waistcoat and breeches, he was to come to me again for a guinea, he was to come and bring me another pair of small cloaths; I told him if he would leave them with me, he might enquire of the people of the house, he said there was not the least occasion. I had the waistcoat, it was too wide, he was to come and take it in on Monday; I wore the waistcoat all Sunday, and put it on again on Monday. I intended going to Mr. Littlehales, I had not the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050025"></xptr> least notion of taking any thing from him. Upon Sunday morning, I asked the waiter if he was at home; he said he did not know whether he was or not; I saw the hairdresser; I asked if he was at home, he said yes; I asked what staircase, he said one pair of stairs along the gallery, they directed me to go up another flight of stairs which I had missed; I went up to Mr. Littlehales; I wanted to go away, the other gentleman was going out, I promised to go with him and have Mr. Littlehales with me; he then told me he had got a handsome waistcoat, he described it striped sattin, which made me think the things were never his. When Mr. Littlehales came to me on Monday morning, he asked to look at my waistcoat, I took it off, he said this must be my waistcoat, I said it was impossible, he looked at it again, and said it certainly is mine, and I will swear to it. I told him if it was his, I had purchased it of this Isaacs, the gentleman asked what I paid for the waistcoat; I said two guineas and a half, which the broker said was the price, I was to give him that and the breeches for two guineas and a half; he asked for the taylor belonging to the house, these gentlemen were present when Mr. Littlehales came in, I could not contradict myself before them. I went up stairs and told them who I had them of, we went to Loughborough-street to speak to the person, I knew the Jew; we went to Petticoat-lane, we did not tell the man what we wanted then, but Mr. Littlehales said he wanted to buy some silk stockings of him, he did not appear to be the right person, she said she would give us any information she could. I told Mr. Littlehales as the things must be your's I have no notion of keeping them, though I shall lose considerably by it, and you are welcome, as this man will come to me again, as he was to have a guinea more. I gave him the things again, and went with the other people to Chatham. This morning he came to me before I was up, and asked directly off hand, did you see that man? I said no; then says he, I believe you are the person. No, says I, I am not. Then he insisted upon my opening my boxes. I gave him the liberty to look over every thing I had in the room, and there was nothing of his.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to your character?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No; the people at the Inn must have seen the man going up stairs with me on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>He called no witnesses to his character, he said he had not sent for any, and he had none there.</p>

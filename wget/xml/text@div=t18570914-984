                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich. On a Thursday evening, about the middle of Feb., I put a counterpane into a tub, put it on a copper, and set it at the foot of the stairs, and the next morning it was missed—the prisoner lived at the next house to me—I afterwards received the ticket of the counterpane from Mr. Miller—the prisoner had gone away before I received the ticket.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner had charge of some houses for my husband, in Ann Street, Woolwich. In Feb. last she came, and said, "Pitman has gone"—I said, "Has he left his rent?"—she said, "No" and said, "He has left the ticket of his watch for his rent," and handed me this duplicate wrapped in paper—I took it, and put it into the iron safe—I did not doubt but it was the ticket of the watch.</p>

On 28th May the prisoner came to my mother, and gave her this ticket; she said, "Pitman has left, and left the ticket of his watch"—she came again on 1st June, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off Pitman's rent, and asked me for the ticket—I said that my mother was not at home, and if she was she would not give her the ticket without the other 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Pitman owed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

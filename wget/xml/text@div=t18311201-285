On the evening of the 30th of November, the prisoner came into the coffee-room about a quarter before six o'clock; he staid there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, had a glass of ale, and was going out, when I heard a sound of silver; I waited at the door, and allowed him to pass me, and saw obtruding from his right-hand coat pocket, a spoon or prong; I followed him: he began to run, and run towards Bell-yard - I came up and caught him by the collar; I heard some silver fall, and all the observation he made was, "I have no plate."</p>

            . I live at Derby, and am a conveyancer. On the 30th of November I was sitting in the coffee-room, and saw a person walk across the room from the adjoining box, towards the door; he went about a yard past the table, in the centre of the room, which is used as a sideboard - he then took a number of spoons from the sideboard, went towards the door, and was putting them into his pocket - I was rising from my seat, and at that moment Mr. Lawrence opened the half door; the man ran out at the other door - two of the spoons fell from his hand or his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know that the prisoner is the man? A. No.</p>

            . I am waiter to Mr. Lawrence. I saw the prisoner in my master's coffee-room - he had a glass of ale, and then asked me to give him another - I left the room to do so; there were some silver spoons on the centre table of the room - when I returned with the ale I picked up two spoons at the door; the prisoner was then just gone out, and my master after him - I took the two spoons to the table, and found that one was then missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure there were no forks among them? A. Not among the spoons; there were at another part of the table - he did not appear intoxicated.</p>

               <p>MR. LAWRENCE. I saw the prisoner stopped, without losing sight of him; the third spoon has not been found - these are the two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going out, but finding I had left my gloves upon the table I went back, and called for another glass of ale; finding I had had enough before I went out without it - I made a stumble, and pushed the spoons from the table on the floor.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

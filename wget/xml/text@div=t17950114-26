On the 21st of last November, I was robbed, Sunday morning, about half an hour after five; the gown was behind my bed under my head, the rest were in a bundle by my bedside, I was in bed at the time at my own lodgings; the prisoner was a lodger in the same room, she awaked me taking the gown from underneath the head of my bed; she slept in another bed in the same room, it was before daylight, about half after five; she awaked me, and I missed my things, all my things. I said, Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I have lost all my things; she made answer, I will get up and get you a light; she went down stairs to get me a light but never returned.</p>

               <p>Q. If it was so dark, how could you make your discovery that your things were gone? - My gown was under the head of my bed, and she awaked me in pulling it from under me, and I felt about immediately and missed my other things, they were altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see her after? - I see no more of her till I met her by chance in the street, three weeks after, and she had the gown on, and I stopped her and asked her how she could be so cruel to rob me of all my things? she said I was deceived in the person; I said, no, I am not, you know you have got my gown on now, and she made a laugh and ran away, and I catched hold of her and called the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop her at that time? - I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140043"></xptr>Q. With the assistance of the watchman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of your things any where? - I went to the pawnbroker's and redeemed my apron myself, at my own expence, for I had not one to wear.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the pawnbroker here? - No. I told him my situation, and he told me I should not have them without I paid for them; the apron and handkerchief were pledged together for one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nobody here from the pawnbroker at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only thing that you recovered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She told me at Marlborough-street if I would give her the things again she would forgive me; she is nothing but a girl of the town, has never done a stroke of upholstery for this twelve months.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I said if you will return me my things, I don't want to prosecute you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I borrowed this woman's things to go as far as Hounslow in; there were three more beds in the room besides the bed where I slept in.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you borrow them of? - Of Ann Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did you ever lend her the things? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you get your livelihood by working at upholstery? - I do, and when I do not work at the upholstery I work at the army work.</p>
               <p>Q. You see the situation of this woman is a very critical one, I hope you are swearing that that is true. Had you any quarrel with this woman? - I have had no quarrel with her, she lived there a very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the story you have told here true? - It is.</p>
               <p>Jury. What induced the pawnbroker to give you the things? where had you the ticket from? - The prisoner gave me the ticket, and I got my apron out with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What upholsterers do you work for? - Mr. Morris, in St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was it she gave you the ticket? - At the justice's, for the apron and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ticket for the apron and handkerchief in one ticket? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My friends are all in the country, and I only came to London quite big with child.</p>

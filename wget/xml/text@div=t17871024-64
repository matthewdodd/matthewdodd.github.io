               <p>The deceased worked with me three weeks, and on Thursday evening, I was speaking to the prisoner, whom he had used ill several times; he struck the prisoner, several times; they fell to fighting, and he pulled him out by the shoulders to fight, and the prisoner struck him five or six blows, and the deceased fell down and expired immediately; he fell at my feet; immediately he died, in about five or six minutes after his fall; he was carried over to his habitation; the deceased was near six feet high, a stronger man than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to him upon his striking? - I did not hear him say any thing.</p>

               <p>I was present; the deceased struck first; I heard the prisoner say something saucy to him, and the deceased pulled him out on the pavement; I cannot tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Did you never say what he had said? - He said, would you fight such a lad as me; and the deceased said, yes; and he hit him two blow; there were very few blows; he fell down on the pavement, and was taken to his own habitation.</p>

               <p>I examined the body of the deceased, there was no contusion of any kind, no mark of violence; I did not open the body; there was a little blood issued from his nostrils, but no appearance of any bruise at all, not even on the nose.</p>
               <p>As the man died in such a manner, and as there was no outward marks of violence, why did not you open the body? - The time would not permit, and I did not think there was any utility in doing it.</p>
               <p>Could you form any opinion of the cause of his death? - I could not form any opinion, except it was by suffocation; he had been intoxicated in the course of the day, and through passion and the liquor he drank, it might happen.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Verseed. Was the deceased drunk? - He was not drunk then, but he had been drinking in the course of the morning.</p>
               <p>Had he been drinking with such excess as to occasion his death? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any degree of violence in the blows between these people? - No, Sir, I no more thought he was dead, than I think your Lordship is dead now.</p>

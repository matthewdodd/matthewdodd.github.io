                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Walker, of Barnet. On 13th Aug. I went to the Cock public-house, at Cock Fosters, about five o'clock, saw the prisoners there, and was in their company about half an hour—I came out, and went to another public-house—the prisoners followed me—I took out my money there to pay for a pot of beer—I left about seven, and went back to the Cock—Osborn followed me in—I left about twenty-five I minutes past eight—I was going to Barnet, and heard a rustling in the</p>

               <p>bushes—I walked on faster till I got over a wooden bridge—the prisoners came up. and knocked me down—Whitelock beat and kicked me while I was on the ground—I said, "You may take my money, but spare my life "—Osborne put his hand in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and took out a little leather purse with a sovereign, a half-sovereign, three half<lb></lb>crowns, and two shillings in it—they both ran off towards Cock Foster's, which was about a quarter of a mile off—I went to Barnet, gave information, went back with the officer, and found the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Arder. No, I was quite a stranger; I went up stairs with her; we had some bread and cheese, and then she asked me to lie with her; I said, as I was a little in liquor, I did not care if I did; she asked me what I would give her; I gave her a shilling or two; I was going into bed with my breeches on; she desired me to pull them off; when I had pulled them off, another woman came in, took up my breeches, and ran down stairs with them; I ran down stairs after her, and she left the breeches at the door; I took them up but missed my money; two men came to know what was the matter; I told them I had been robbed of my money; they pursued the prisoner and brought her back; I know her to be the woman that took up my breeches; she was taken before a Justice and searched, and the money dropped from under her arm, wrapped up in a bit of rag; there was a guinea, two half guineas, and twelve or thirteen shillings; that was the money I missed out of my breeches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer at the London-docks. I was in the docks on the 9th of Nov., about half-past twelve o'clock—I saw a man, who I be<lb></lb>lieve to be the prisoner, coming in a direction from the back of the East quay—I saw him go to some molasa-caska, and ttoop, as if putting something between them—he went away, and went back to the same spot, and stooped again, then came towards where I waa, stopped a few minutes, looking round, and returned round the corner out of my sight—I went to my work—at three o'clock the same person went by me again, and looked towards the molass<lb></lb>casks, returned and came back again—I had informed Hawkes, the foreman, who desired me to watch, and about half-past four, I saw the person again, coming in a direction from the East quay, he passed near the molass-casks, re<lb></lb>turned, went a few steps beyond them, then turned back to them, pulled his hat off, went on his knees, and reached between the casks with his arms to the fall extent, as if taking something from between them—his hat was close by him—I could not see whether he put anything into it, but ha put his hat on and walked away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the South quay warehouses. On the 9th of Nov., I received information from Saunders, who described a per<lb></lb>son to me in a shooting-jacket and overall-coat—I watched within fifty yards of the molass-caaks, and in about five minutes saw the prisoner come down the archway, where the molass-caiki are stowed, and remain at the bottom of the archway three or four minutes—after he went away, I went and found a brass bearing laying between two casks and under another, and a fender placed before it—persons pasting womld not notice it—I took it out, put it back again, and was watching at three o'clock, in a shed opposite the archway, and saw the prisoner come by the place down the archway, looking right and left till he came near where I was—he then looked right and left, returned towards the East quay, passed the casks, and looked at them—I continued there till half-past four, then saw him come down the archway, go to the casks, look at the spot attentively, eosae down the front towards where I was, he returned aid came to the casks, kaelt down, took his hat off, and seemed to put something into it, then went out of my sight—I went towards the archway—I saw the prisoner at the tail of a wagon, which was orating out, and saw him raise his arm as if placing something in the wagon—I was at the fore part of the wheel, and heard the clink of one metal against another—I looked, and saw the same brass bearing in it—the prisoner was dressed as Saunders has described.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Dr. Gregory, at Woolwich. On the 7th of April I was walking along, and the prisoner came up to me—he told me not to be frightened—he walked with me, and wanted to carry my umbrella—I told him to go away, bat he would not—he took hold of me, and I screamed, "Murder"—he let me go, but he took my bundle which I had, it contained the articles stated—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I had not seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman. On the morning of the 8th of April, I went into the New-road, Woolwich; and saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, I asked what he had got there—would he allow me to look at it—he said, "Certainly"—I found it was the articles which this young woman lost on Woolwich Common—he said, a man named <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> gave him the things, that he went with him to the Gun public-house, had a pint of beer, and there <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> went away and left the bundle with him—the prisoner was in the Artillery, but was discharged the day this was committed—the young woman was brought to see him, and said, she knew him again by his whiskers—I tried every means to trace where he slept that night, but could not—he was sober, and smoking a cigar; he went backwards and forwards by a clothes-shop, where they buy and sell articles of this kind.</p>

I had been in the hospital three months—and when I got out, a little liquor which I took had an effect upon me, and I cannot tell where I slept, but I found myself in a passage, and these things, were there—I took them up, and this man took me with them.</p>

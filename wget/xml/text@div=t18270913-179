            . I live at Hendon, and work for Mr. Thomas Jenkins. I went to work about half-past six o'clock, on the 25th of August, and on going through a little wicket-gate, into a bleaching-ground, I saw a wicket open, which goes into an orchard. I looked further, and saw the string was cut, which fastened the wicket. I directly went to the hen-house, found it was broken open, and nothing in it, but one guinea cock - I informed the servant - I went into the road, and met a man, whom I asked about the fowls; he asked me if I should know them again; I said, Yes, and one in particular. I have seen them since, and know them.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning of the 25th of August I heard some fowls go by my window; I got out of bed, looked out, and saw some men go past with fowls - I got up, with a neighbour, followed them, and took them; the prisoner was one - he said he was employed to carry them, and was to have three halfpence and his breakfast, when he got to London. I found six other fowls on another person - the prisoner had three in this bag - the other person ran away.(Fowls produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Commercial Road. On the 15th of November, the prisoner pawned this watch for two guineas; and on the 22d, he called to ask if I would advance him any more on a sextant which he had pawned, and I detained him.</p>

            . I received him in charge - he gave me the duplicate of the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner pleaded distress, and stated his intention of returning the watch which the prosecutrix had lent him - he had pawned it on hearing of a situation at Gravesend; and the moment he returned, went to the pawnbroker to get more advanced on a sextant, in order to redeem the watch.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR EDGE re-examined. I had lent him 2 s. 6 d. on the Sunday, as he said he could not pay for his lodging till he got a 20 l. note changed. I never lent him the watch - he very much admired a watch of mine, and said it had a shabby key - he left his trunk, containing his wearing apparel, behind.</p>

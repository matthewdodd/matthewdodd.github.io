            . I was at this house on Saturday night. I saw Clark give the prisoner two sovereigns to get change - I found him on Sunday morning, at a gin-shop in Barrett's-court, Wigmore-street, with Newman, and three or four girls, about half-past eight o'clock - I collared him, and asked what he had done with the two sovereigns; he said he had spent them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was intoxicated on the night in question, and next morning found himself in this public-house; he was going to return when he was apprehended, and that he supposed some women must have robbed him of the money.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH CLARK. He was quite sober.</p>
               <p>CHARLES POPE. He was sober that night, and so he was when I took him.</p>

I was sitting in a public-house; the prisoner came into the public-house. I went home with her to a room. I sat on the side of her bed. She took this money out of my pocket, and put it into her bosom. I went to take it out of her Bosom; she called for assistance; two more came up and knocked me down stairs.</p>

He came to me in the morning, and said I had robbed him. He said, if I did not give it him he would put an end to my existence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Williams, Deacon, and Co., of Birchin-lane. This check is forged—it is drawn by James Ellis—we have no account in any such name—no doubt it came from a check-book issued by our house—this</p>

               <p>other check for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is also from the same book—here are the counterfoils of them in this check-book—I think we have not had any more checks from this book presented at our house—this second check for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is signed "I.T. Wallis"—no such person keeps an account at our house—this is a forgery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a tea-dealer, and live in Harp-lane, Tower-street. I know this check-book, it belonged to my father—it was in my possession in Sept., till I gave it to the officer—I had kept it till lately, before the 12th Sept., on a desk along with a lot of letters—I know the pri<lb></lb>soner—I have seen him at my place of business—he came to see a Mr. Smith, who had rented my office, and whom I was allowing to use my office till he could get another—the prisoner used to come there—I have seen him near the desk on which this book was lying—I cannot say what he was doing—I cannot say positively whether I have seen him writing at that office—I will not be positive whether I have seen him at the desk—I have gone out of the office and left him there—in consequence of something I saw in the newspaper, my attention was drawn to the check-book—I examined it, and found twenty-six or twenty-seven of the checks were missing—I was not using this book myself—it was issued to my father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you draw the checks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not inquire of my father how many checks he issued—I found the blank foils in the book—I did not know how many blank foils there were in the book before my attention was drawn to it—those counterfoils which have been written on were in my father's handwriting, and 1 found twenty-six or twenty-seven blank counterfoils—my father is not here—I have seen a person named Mills once or twice in the street, and I have seen him in my office where the desk was, but not inside the rails—I believe he came to see Smith, he was an acquaint<lb></lb>ance of his—I wish to state that the banker's clerk has made a mistake—this book was not issued to Mr. Elmore, but to my father.</p>

I am a town traveller.

            In the beginning of February, state any thing that passed between you and any body else, respecting the tobacco in that warehouse? - A. On the 6th of Feburary, I went to the warehouse of my own accord, with Neal; Neal did not go into the warehouse, he went with me; I took some samples of tobacco from Mr. Frydag's warehouse; I took them on my back.</p>
               <p>Q. How many samples did you take out? - A. I cannot tell the quantity; Neal waited in St. Mary-Axe, at the corner of St. Helen's; I found him in the same place when I came out.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did Neal know you were going to steal those samples? - A. Yes; he went with me to Houndsditch, to Mr. Newman's, the other prisoner; Neal staid in the street, about two hundred yards from the house, when I left him; the tobacco was lodged at Mr. Newman's house, I sold it to Mr. Newman, it weighted two hundred and twenty pounds, at one shilling per pound; I saw the prisoner Newman and his brother.</p>

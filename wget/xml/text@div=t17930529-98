               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Cowles in Cornhill, he is in the jewellery line. Having occasion for the articles which are described in the indictment, I sent to Mr. Evance's, and was informed of their being defrauded of such articles, red morocco collars for ladies, being informed they had not got any, we applied for some elsewhere. The articles laying in the window was the cause of the prisoner bringing in some to offer for sale, he came in the 18th of April, saying he had an article which he found on Tower-hill, and seeing that I had an article of the same description in the window, he came to know if I would buy them; he did not know what their value were; from the appearance of his story I thought they were the collars that Mr. Evance's lad was defrauded of, I suspected him, and to be certain before ever I taxed him with it, I begged him to sit down while I went to shew them to Mr. Cowles who was hard by; instead of which I went to Mr. Evance's, and asked Mr. Evance's clerk if they had heard any thing of the collars? he informed me they had not; when I returned to the shop, I found the prisoner was gone, and had left the shop about a minute, I was informed he was gone down Sweeting's-alley; I immediately went in pursuit of him, at the bottom of Sweeting's-alley the prisoner looking about observed me, and he immediately communicated it to some others, as I conceived by their looking about too; I went up to him and asked him if he had not shewn to me some red morocco collars at a shop in Cornhill? he told me he had; says I, why did you leave the shop till you had done your business? the excuse he made was, that he had some business with these friends in Broad-street, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290175"></xptr>he wished to finish it in my absence; I told him he must come back with me and finish the business he had in hand first; accordingly he came back, and he was charged with the constable; the collars are in the custody of the constable.</p>

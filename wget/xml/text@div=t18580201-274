                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 118). On 7th Jan., I was on duty, in plain clothes, in the Lewisham Road, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, in company with Brown—I saw the prisoners walking together towards Lon<lb></lb>don; I followed them as far as New Cross, where there is a baker's shop, kept by Mr. Burgess—M'Carthy went in there, and Murray stood opposite the shop—M'Carthy came out, and I then went in; there was a little girl serv<lb></lb>ing, and, in consequence of what I said, she took this shilling out of the till and gave it to me—when M'Carthy came out, Murray crossed over to him, and they went on together towards London—when they were about sixty yards from the shop, they were in conversation, and I saw something pass from Murray to M'Carthy; they then crossed the road, and Murray went again towards Burgess's shop—I followed her; she went to the door of the shop, and I saw Mr. Burgess, the master of the shop, in the shop—Murray remained outside walking up and down, about five minutes—she then went as if she were going into the shop—she turned back from it again; I caught her, and found in her right hand this shilling, and in her left hand this half crown; they are both bad—I took her to the station—I had before told Brown to take M'Carthy.</p>

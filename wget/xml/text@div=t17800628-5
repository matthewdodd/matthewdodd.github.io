               <p>Do you live there? - I do. I instantly went out and found several of my neighbours gathered together in the front of the house where Davis lived, the two windows in the left hand parlour were open. I jumped into, one of them and got into the house and was instantly followed by three or four of my neighbours; we made towards the right-hand parlour, from whence we saw the smoke ascend, and we forced open the door, upon which there issued out a large quantity of smoke, which almost suffocated me.</p>
               <p>Was there any one in the house? - Not a creature. I ran to bring some water; I returned in two or three minutes, and then the windows of this room, in which the fire had been discovered, had been forced open by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280012"></xptr> people that had got into the house upon the alarm. I kept on fetching a few pails of water with other people, and then a man cried out, Here is the fire! and then threw out a large quantity of linen rags on fire. Some of the neighbours called to me to take them up; I did so, and bid a neighbour observe that they came out on fire from that house.</p>
               <p>Do you know what part of the room they came from? - No, they were thrown out into the court before I saw them. I called to Mr. Nott to desire he would take notice that they came out of that room on fire. As I kept on fetching the water and other people did the same, the whole floor was soon covered with water, but yet the smoke seemed to be as powerful as before we discovered the first fire. Another man on feeling round the wainscot of the same room cried out, Here is more fire! and instantly I heard a sliding door go up or down, and there was instantly a large quantity of linen rags, which were on fire thrown out into the court.</p>
               <p>Whose house is it? - It is my house, I let it to this Mr. Davis. I have purchased it not above a quarter of a year; he was the tenant when I purchased it.</p>
               <p>Did you see the house afterwards? - I did almost instantly.</p>
               <p>What was the condition of the house? - Upon examining a beaufet, where the second fire was found, the edges of the shelves appeared to be something injured by the fire.</p>
               <p>By that expression something injured, do you mean to say they had been on fire.? - I do not mean to say that.</p>
               <p>Did it appear blistered? - No, the edges of the shelves were black; the wainscoting behind seemed blistered.</p>
               <p>Was the beaufet a part of the dwelling-house or a fixture? - It is a part of the house; it joins the bricks, it is a part of the wainscoting itself.</p>
               <p>Who do you rent the house of? - The ground is the Duke of Newcastle's; I am a lease-holder under the duke.</p>
               <p>What interest has the prisoner in it? - He is a tenant from year to year.</p>

               <p>I live in Butcher-row. I keep the chop-house there. On Tuesday last, upon the alarm of fire I ran to the prisoner's house, I saw the smoke issuing from the right-hand parlour window; I went in at the left-hand parlour window; I went up into the one-pair-of-stairs room, suspecting the fire was there; I called, but had no answer. I came down stairs and then I found that the fire was in the right-hand parlour; when the parlour door was open the room was full of smoke; I ran over to my own house and got a pail of water, and ordered my servant to follow with more. I perceived that the fire came from the left corner of the room which afterwards turned out to be from under a bureau bedstead. I staid in the room so long that I was almost suffocated; I was then obliged to go into the court for air; I saw a person, as I stood at the window, take the rags from under the bureau and chuck them out at the window into the court. The prosecutor, Mr. Dyer, was present; he said, Take notice, Mr. Nott, that these rags came out of that room! The rags were burnt almost to tinder; I did not go into the room again till after the fire was put out; I then went into it, and looked to see if there was any fire under the bureau bedstead; I observed some of the boards were discoloured and some scorched.</p>

               <p>In what condition was that place after you had taken the rags out? - The bottom of the bedstead was burnt, and the floor was burnt.</p>

The prisoner came to the house between twelve and one o'clock that day, and inquired for Mr. Robinson; I said he was not at home - he said, "I mean young Mr. Robinson, the son;" I said he was not at home - he said young Mr. Robinson had been to the shop or warehouse, bought a bottle of patent ink, and said if he did not return by the time he brought it, I was to take it in and pay for it; I asked how much it came to - he said "3s. 6d., and here is the receipt;" I said I had only 1s. 6d. - he said, "Ma'am, I can get you change, I will go next door and get change;" I immediately went up stairs to my room, brought down a sovereign, and when I got to the bottom of the stairs, I said to him,</p>
               <p>"I don't know whether I am doing exactly right by paying for this, as I have no orders from Mr. Robinson" - he said, "Oh, you need not be in the least afraid, you are perfectly right;" at that moment a knock came at the door - he was standing in the passage, he took the sovereign from my fingers, and the moment I opened the door he went out; I have not seen him since till he was apprehended - it was the baker at the door; he left the bottle and receipt behind him, and never returned with the change - the bottle contained some sort of black stuff, whether it was ink I do not know; Mr. Robinson gave me a sovereign at the end of the year - I described the prisoner to a constable when it happened; he was not taken till the 12th of November - I took very particular notice of him; there is an expression in his countenance which struck me very forcibly at the time, and I firmly believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said at the Mansion-house the person was not at the door two minutes or not so much. Witness. I said no such thing - he was there I should think nearly ten minutes before he got the sovereign.</p>

Mr. Murray was at home - I said not; he wanted to know when he would he home - I said some time in the course of the day; he then asked if the lady was at home - Mr. Murray is a single man, there is no lady there; I asked his business - he pulled out of a blue bag a bottle; I took it from him, and was going to shut the door - he then said he was to receive 3s. 6d. for it, as Mr. Murray had ordered it; I told him to come in, for I had no change, and he must wait in the passage while I went up stairs for it - I did not intend to fetch the money, as I had paid for a bottle once before; I called Dr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090054"></xptr>Owen down, who was there, and he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I was working in Charlotte street, about the hour of one in the day; I saw a young man coming a long with the cheese, I saw the prisoner at the bar on his right hand, and another young man on the other side, I saw them both receive it from him; I immediately went to Mrs. Koster, I asked her if she had lost a cheese, she said yes; I ran up Charlotte street and met Mr. Stringer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the young man with the cheese. - A. I pursued him into Whitechapel, and from there into Brick lane; about sixty or seventy yards up Brick lane I overtook the prisoner with the cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not the young man that had the cheese first. - A. No, I immediately took hold of his coat and took him down to Lambeth street office.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did he give you. - A. He said he did not know the man that gave him the cheese.</p>
               <p>- STRINGER. On the 11th of November, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030044"></xptr> one o'clock, coming to the corner of Charlotte street I met Mr. Moss, he asked me if I had seen a young man with a Cheshire cheese, I told him I had, the prisoner and another young man; the other young man had the cheese when I passed him.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in pursuit of the cheese, did you find it. - A. We took the prisoner in Brick lane with the cheese upon his shoulder, Mr. Moss took hold of him and I took the cheese; we took them to Lambeth street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire of the boy how he came by the cheese. - A. He said that 
               <persName id="t18061203-43-person473">Jack</persName>
             the matseller gave him the cheese; there were three helping to carry it, and one had 
               <persName id="t18061203-43-person474">mats</persName>
             a carrying.</p>
               <p>(The cheese produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming along Whitechapel these two fellows employed me to carry the cheese, they said they would give me a shilling to carry it to Hare street, and they would shew me the house. As I was going along Brick lane these two gentlemen overtook me, and I looked round for these two men, they were both run away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

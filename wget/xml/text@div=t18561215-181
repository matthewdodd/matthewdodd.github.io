                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at 37, Bridge-street, South-work A person of the name of Clark, and a woman, came to me on the 28th Nov., and ordered twenty quarterns of bread and half a bushel of flour—about an hour and a half after they left, the prisoner came with a baker's barrow—he asked me for the twenty-one loaves that had been ordered by Mr. Clark, and I gave them to him—on going along with them, he said he was going to take them to Cornwall-road—that the man Clark had been in the employment of the London Printing and Publishing Company, at the corner of Charterhouse-lane; that he was well known; that they were going to have pork, cheese, and bacon from the country for the persons con<lb></lb>nected with it, and that they were going to open a chandler's shop—I saw him again on the morning of the 29th, he came with Clark—they had twenty-six quarterns of bread, a shilling's worth of small bread, and half a bushel of flour—while I was delivering it, the prisoner was in the shop—they took it away—Mr. Clark parted with the prisoner and said it was half-past 8 o'clock, time for his duty—the prisoner went away with the property, and I was to have the money on the Saturday evening at half-past 8 o'clock for all the quantities, and then they would arrange for what they wanted on the Monday—about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, a woman and a little boy came—they wanted any quantity—I said it was an extraordinary thing in a chandler's shop to sell so much as that—the boy tugged the dress of the woman, and that aroused my suspicions, and I would only let them have four quarterns of bread—T went afterwards to inquire next door, 30, Corn<lb></lb>wall-road—I saw there very little bread in the shop, and very little bread in the windpw—I saw the prisoner in the shop, and the woman Clark busying about in the shop—that was the woman that first came—I saw her and the other woman working about in the shop—afterwards I saw them delivering the bread, scales, weights, knife, broom, candlestick, two bags, tickets, and bills—the prisoner put them in the barrow and closed it—it was outside the door—the women were handing them to him—the shop was shut up—the prisoner went down Stamford-street at a trot—I followed him—the women were close behind him—I looked at the bread in the barrow—there were ten and a half quarterns of mine, that which I had de<lb></lb>livered to the prisoner—the price of all was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the shop was shut up, while they were putting the bread, &amp;c. into the barrow, that was about 7 o'clock—iny engagement was to meet the parties at about half-past 8 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Cornwall-road, and was next door to the prisoner, No. 29. I had the letting of No. 30—he told me that he wanted to take and open it as a baker's shop—he thought it would suit his daughter—that was on Thursday, the 27th—he said he would bring his daughter in the evening to look at it—they came, him, the daughter, and another man—they agreed to take it—they said they thought it would do—he said he was going to have the bread ready made, so that he did not want any oven—I saw him again that same evening—he took the ground floor—I was to have had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday, and they gave me a bill to hold till then, as security—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think it is good for nothing—it is payable at a bank, but the officer has been there, and there are no effects—the shop was opened on the Friday, and closed on Saturday, about 7 o'clock—I cannot say how much went away, but the barrow kept going away with bread—I thought there might have been customers a distance off.</p>

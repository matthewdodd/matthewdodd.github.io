                  </hi>. I live at 6, Melbourne-place, Plumstead, and am time-keeper at the Royal Arsenal—on 15th November, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, I was in High-street, Woolwich, and was accosted by the female prisoners—directly after they came up, the male prisoner and another one, not in custody, came up; Collins struck me in the stomach, and then again in the chest—he and the other one then laid hold of me, and the female prisoners tore open my coat, stole my watch, silver guard, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and ran away—Collins, before he left, kicked me on the knee which brought me to the ground and lamed me, and I was not able to pursue them—I could see their faces—I have known them by sight for the last three or four months, up and down the High-street—the watch has not yet been found.</p>

                  </hi>. Mrs. Flynn is my mother—I live with her and keep a lodging-house—there are two sitting rooms there—one is a common room for the lodgers to resort to—I generally stop with my mother in her room—on Saturday night, the 15th, the Saturday before Collins was taken on the Monday, I was in the kitchen at 7 o'clock—Collins was there, and a man named Donovan, and some other persons—we were playing at cards—I should think it was about half-past 7 when we began—Collins played up till 9 o'clock—I then went outside to change a sixpence, and saw two men, who asked me if Collins was in—on my return Collins went out to them—that was about 9 o'clock—I am certain it was about 9 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How are you certain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I went in next door for change for sixpence, I looked at the clock—there is a clock in the further kitchen, not in the one where we were sitting—I did not see a watch in my mother's possession—I don't know that she had one—the kitchen was full—none of the others are here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Collins playing at cards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—nobody took his place when he went out—Donovan was sitting nearest the gas on a form—there is a back and front kitchen—this was the front kitchen—you go through a door to the back—there is gas in both kitchens—they were pretty nigh full—Donovan was sitting with his back to the back kitchen—the clock is in the right-hand corner, going into the room, in the far corner—it stands up against the wall—you can see it from the front kitchen—we were playing "twenty-fives" at cards—I am sure nobody took Collins' hand when he went out—Donovan was playing at the time along with Collins—he did not rise from his seat that I saw—neither Ross nor Watson were there—it wanted two minutes to 9 when I went into the adjoining house—I next saw Collins about 11 o'clock, outside in the street—I was at the police-court, but I did not speak at all—I was not called in—I told Collins' mother that I was in the kitchen at the time—I don't know whether Donovan told her that—he was there—I did not see him speak to her—I did not see him at the police-court on either occasion—there were a great many people in the court—I stood outside with Collins' mother—I did not see Donovan—I did not tell her that Donovan was along with Collins in the kitchen that night—I gave her no names of persons who were there that night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 295). On this Saturday-night, 25th November, I saw Collins in company with another man, about ten yards from Rope-yard Rails—I said to a constable in plain clothes who was with me, "There is Collins, and another man standing there, who I think is young Murray"—that was about twenty minutes past 8—Collins knows the two women—he lives with Ross.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 9th of February, about half-past one o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Goswell-street. Johnson took a paper from his pocket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200056"></xptr>and gave Marrs something from it. He then left Johnson and went to a woman with cat's-meat, and had some weighed, and tendered her something white - she crossed to two public-houses. I heard her come and say to Marrs,</p>
               <p>"It is a bad shilling" - Johnson was then nearer the barrow. I then missed him. Marrs gave her the meat and she returned the shilling. I saw him join Johnson - I met Thompson - when he took Johnson and I took Marrs. I crossed the road and saw Johnson throw two shillings away, in Long-lane, which I picked up.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 9th of February I saw the prisoners in Barbican - I took Johnson, and found six shillings, wrapped separately in paper, in his pocket, and two loose ones in a glass.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. The eight shillings are all counterfeit, of the same die, and have never been in circulation.</p>

On the 19th of February, I left my room at seven o'clock in the morning, I fastened it with a padlock quite safe, I left the room quite secure, and every thing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the room did you leave three sheets and three blankets, and a bed quilt in it - A. I did. I returned to my room about half past six o'clock, as nigh as I can guess; I went to the landlord and asked him for the key, as I generally do, I had left these things in the room, and when I returned they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light when you returned - A. The day-light was closed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I had known him for a twelvemonth or more, he called on me about five o'clock, I had just done work; I went and drank with him at a public house; the things have never been found. The next day, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner called upon me at St. Martins lane, I told him he was the man I wanted to see, he must go with me to Mr. M'Lawrence; I told him he was accused of having taken the things, he refused going with me, he said he was going into the Strand he would call as he came back, and would go up to Mr. M'Lawrence; I would not trust him. I secured him in the warehouse until I sent for somebody to lay hold of him, he always denied that he had done the fact; I resigned him up to Mr. M'Lawrence. He always denied that he had been concerned in it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the man at the bar - A. No; I never saw him until I saw him at Bow-street. On Wednesday was the day that Tudor lost the goods. I went up stairs about ten o'clock, I brought down these blankets to mark them; I marked them with black paint, I took them up into the room again between three and four in the afternoon, I spread the blankets on the chairs, I put the padlock on the hasp, and I am sure I locked the door. About six o'clock a boy gave me some information; the boys are here.</p>

We were about twenty minutes together; we both came out together, I went towards Oxford-road; he told me he was going down the Strand. I left him in Church-lane, and turned up Oxford-road. It was before six.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the bar and reside at 5, Oxford Square, Hyde Park—I have been connected with the Charity Organization Society for some years, and in November, 1874, became secretary—the prisoner was employed in December, 1874, and in February, 1875, became inquiry officer and collector, and in April, 1875, chief inquiry officer—his salary was about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—his duty was to collect the subscriptions and pay them to Messrs. Twining, giving the donor a provisional receipt, leaving a counterfoil in his receipt book, and to make out a receipt in the secretary's book for the secretary's sig<lb></lb>nature, also to be sent to the donor—I produce the secretary's receipt book for 1875, and on the 15th June I find on counterfoil 59 an entry in the prisoner's writing of "Strand Charity Organisation Committee No. 59, St. George's Place. Received of the Duke of Northumberland on the 15th of June, 1875, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on behalf of the Committee (Signed) D. W."—I have no doubt I signed the receipt itself, but this signature on the receipt pro<lb></lb>duced is not mine—the No. is 249, and it reads "15th June, 1875. Re<lb></lb>ceived of the Duke of Northumberland, subscription 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I also produce the provisional receipt book, which is the only book out of which the collector ought to have given a receipt, and I find no counterfoil correspond<lb></lb>ing with this receipt—the form is different, the initials are in my hand<lb></lb>writing—this cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 15th June, 1875, on Messrs. Hoare's bank, and signed by Stapleton Greville is endorsed "Douglas Walker" and by "Lawrence Ryan"—the "Douglas Walker" is not my writing—I believe "Lawrence Ryan" is the prisoner's writing—I also produce the ledger which was kept by Mr. Poor—the prisoner was responsible for the correct<lb></lb>ness of the entries, and it was his duty weekly to see that the balance agreed with the accounts presented in the other books—Poor is dead—the donations appear on the one side and the outlay on the other—both Mr.</p>

               <p>Colenso and I gave instructions to Mr. Poor—this ledger is always produced at the weekly meetings of the society—Ryan generally brought it—I had an interview with the prisoner in June, 1876, when I asked him to account for certain inaccuracies, and he produced receipts and promised to give an explanation on the morrow; next morning he said the receipts were taken from the book, but he could not produce the book—those receipts did not include this one produced—the prisoner was then dismissed.</p>

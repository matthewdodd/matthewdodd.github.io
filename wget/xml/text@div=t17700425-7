            . I am butler to Mr. serjeant Nares; it is my business to see that all the doors and windows are fast before we go to bed. On the last day of February they were all fast at going to bed. I got up a little before seven, on the first of March, and found that the window-shutter of the parlour forward, the ground room, was broke open by main force, and the closet in the passage was broke open; it appeared to be broke open by some very strong instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark when you got up?</p>
               <p>Stancliff. It was daylight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Nares. On Thursday, which I believe was the first of March, the night of that day my house was broke open. I was called as early as it was discovered, which was rather after seven, and I saw where they came in. There are two setts of window-shutters, the outward in the street, and the inward. The outward were to pull to, and bolt withinside; to the other within, there is a bolt comes down to fasten them. I perceived the outward bolt was wrenched by an instrument which we found; they had left it in my wife's dressing-room. The outward bolt was wrenched so that it was bent; the screws were drawn so far as to bend it so as to let the shutter come open. That on the inside came directly down cross the window. It was a very large bar; had it fell, it must have alarmed the whole house, but the curtain had catched it. There were marks of mens feet on the pallisades where they stood to wrench the shutter. My bureau was all broke open. They had come into my study, and there they had taken away (for I am certain it was there over night) a large silver ink-stand, and in that I had that night put an amethyst ring set with diamonds, in the hollow of the ink-stand, and there were some other things taken. They had left the glasses belonging to the stand. They had searched all the papers in my bureau and in my pocket book. We went up into my wife's dressing-room; they had taken away the childrens perquisites. They had emptied out the money, and left one purse there; these were taken out of the bureau in my wife's dressing-room. There were four, but they had left one, which belonged to my eldest daughter. I verily believe they were surprised by something, for they left their instrument just by the bureau, a strong iron chissel. (Produced in court.) I had seen a two guinea piece in one of the purses, I think it belonged to my son; I think it was of king James the second, a very remarkable well-preserved two guinea piece; and I had likewise a queen Ann's guinea, which my wife picked out of the money that was produced at Sir

               <p>Q. Do you not think there are more two guinea pieces as well preserved as that?</p>

               <p>Mr. Nares. I dare say there are many. I have no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nares. The purses were all in my bureau. There was about 30 l. in money; two two guinea pieces, both very fresh, but one more than the other; a queen Ann's guinea, and several guineas besides. There was a crown piece of king William. I picked out a two guinea piece at Sir

As much as any body can swear to money, I believe I can swear to this guinea being in the purse in my bureau.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Nares. I verily believe this guinea to be mine; I can say no more. I remember there was a little piece of black upon the cheek of the head, and it was on when I saw it at Sir

            . About the first of March, Wood, Ogilvie, Shepherd Strutton, and myself were playing at skittles; we drank pretty freely, and staid pretty late; then we agreed to go to my room in George-alley, Shoe-lane, to supper. I had a fowl. We agreed to go out about twelve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250011"></xptr> o'clock. We agreed to take a walk down the Strand. Coming by serjeant Nares's house, Wood (I believe it was) said, Let's try if we can't get this house open; it is near Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the house before?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I had about a fortnight before, but had no intention then about breaking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you, or either of you, looked at the bolts?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, we had not. I went to one end of the street, and Ogilvie the other. By-and-by Wood came down the street, and said they had got something. I went home, and Ogilvie went home. It was Wood bid me go to one end of the street, and Ogilvie to the other. We went to see if any body came. We staid there about an hour. Wood stopped at serjeant Nare's house; when he came to me it might be about one or two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Strutton?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I believe he was along with Wood; we were all four together when we stopped at serjeant Nares's house. I left Strutton and Wood together in Chancery-lane. I saw nothing done. The next morning I saw them about seven at

               <p>Bagnall. Maguines's wife, I, Ogilvie, and Wood. Wood told me he had sold the things to Maguines for 22 l. He said he had sold him a pair of ear-rings, but did not say they were diamonds. Maguines was not at home when I was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Wood or Strutton say where they had the things?</p>

               <p>Q. What did the money consist in?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. It was guineas. I had seen Ogilvie have a two guinea piece about a week before this robbery was committed. I saw it several times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came by it?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. He told me his mother left it him. He had a good deal of money, I believe 30 or 40 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned this before the justice?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see at Lumley's?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I saw Maguines there; he was sitting up stairs with a good many people; his wife told me he was there about seven in the morning. I heard there was a feast there the night the robbery was committed. I called Maguines out at the door, and told him, I and Mr. Wood had something to sell. He said, he had not heard any thing of it yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you got them?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him they were stole?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I had been acquainted with him some time before this, but I never sold him any thing before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to him then?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. It was Wood that was acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me understand you: Had Wood sold him any thing before?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I believe Wood had sold him the things before I saw him; but I do not know whether he sold them to him or his wife. He said, he had heard nothing at all of it; I thought he had bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to tell him there were some things to be sold?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I can't tell how I came to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not seen him before seven that morning?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I had not; I saw his wife about half an hour after six. It was Wood that sold them. I never saw the silver stand-dish, nor ear-rings. I never saw nothing but the ready money.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go away from Carey-street?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I came away about two, and went home to bed; they all of them went to their homes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you appointed to meet at Maguines's?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250012"></xptr>Bagnall. No, we had not. I had no notion of meeting them at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I went down to see him as I often called there, but upon nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was divided first, the two guineas each, or the five guineas each?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. The two guineas each was divided first; that, they said, they took from Mr. Nares's house; the twenty-two guineas were divided not ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say Maguines was not at home, and you went and hid the goods in the ruins?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, never to my knowledge. I was taken up upon a thing I knew nothing at all about; and Sir John said, if I did not swear to this, he would indict me for something else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this chissel?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I know nothing of it. I never saw it before now to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see it when they stopt at Mr. serjeant Nares's house?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I did not see any tools at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wood go with you to Lumley's?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. Yes, he did. He was in the taproom when I went up stairs to Maguines.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Maguines? Tell the very words.</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I said, Wood had some things. He said, he had heard nothing of it yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any appointment with Maguines?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, I had been often out with Maguines at skittles, or a walking on Sundays.</p>
               <p>Will. Haliburton. I am a constable. I apprehended Ogilvie on a Sunday, I can't tell the day of the month, it was the day after the robbery, or a day or two after. There was a person with him that I knew to be an old offender. I found in Ogilvie's pocket either twelve or thirteen guineas, three half guineas, a two guinea piece, a twenty-seven shilling piece, a five and threepenny piece, and some silver. This is the two guinea piece that has been produced here. I produced that money at Sir

            . I live now in Hare-court, in the Temple; I was apprentice to Mr. Freeland, a stationer, in Carey-street, when Mr. serjeant Nares's house was robbed, over-against his house. I observed three young fellows about the house some days before the robbery, it may be six or seven days before. I believe I should know one of them, he was in a very remarkable dress. He lifted himself up upon his toes, and stood on tiptoe to look into Mr. Nares's parlour. They rather cast their eyes up and down, looking, I presume, at the bolts and shutters of the window. I think Bagnall is one of them by his face.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Watkins. I believe it was about noon, or in the afternoon.</p>

            . Mr. Watkins and I were both in the shop together; I saw them first, and mentioned them to Mr. Watkins. There were three men walked by the door two or three times, and took particular notice of the window-shutters and bolts, and to the best of my remembrance, Bagnall the evidence stood upon his toes, and looked in at the parlour window. I can't say I know either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Sarah Hall. Bagnall lived in Field-lane. I have seen the prisoners once or twice in company with him. I lived with him about six weeks; I left him about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How many beds had he at the time?</p>
               <p>S. Hall. He had one bed. He had one room, an upper room. When he went to live in George-alley, Shoe-lane, I left him; I did not stay a night with him there. They came two or three times, and drank a pint of beer together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them go out together on an evening?</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Buttesland-street, Hoxton. On Wednesday night, 1st December, about half-past 4 or quarter to 5 o'clock, I went to Mr. Winters, a cheesemonger, in Suffolk-street, Borough—the prisoner was there, and when he saw Mr. Winter pay me some money, he said, "Are you not going to stand something to drink?"—Mr. Winter said, You ought to"—I said, "Well, I will give you whatever you like"—Mr. Winter said, "I will have the order ready for you when you come back"—I am a ticket writer; I had taken him home some tickets and he paid me and gave the another order—I went and got a cup of tea and treated the prisoner to a glass of ale—I asked for the convenience of the house—the publican said that it was locked up, and the prisoner said that I could step across the road to his place, and before I had done what I went for, the prisoner said, "What are you going to stand to drink?"—he did not go into the necessary with me—I went first into his parlour—I told him that I did not come for that purpose, and I should stand no more drink with him—he said, "I will show you about that"—he shut the door, knocked the candle over, and came to collar me—I knocked his arm off several times, and kept him at bay some time—I stood in my own defence and got the upper hand of him—he took something from the sideboard struck me on the forehead with it and stunned me—I fell into a chair senseless and he put his hand in my pocket and took my money—it was something hard that he hit me with, not his fist—I asked him to let me go, and when he saw the blood running down my face he said that he was very sorry—I said that I wanted no sympathy from him, and when he opened the door, I collared him and halloed out—he fell with me into the road and then shut the door in my face—I stood on one side of the door till I saw it open and the prisoner come out, and when I saw that he was as far from the door as</p>

               <p>I was, I collared him and called "Police"—I told him he had robbed me, and I should give him in charge—he threw me down and got away—I mentioned before the Magistrate that he pushed me out of the house, but we had a struggle first—I do not know the name of the street this was in—it is a turning out of Suffolk-street, the next street to where the police-station is, but I did not know that there was a station there, and went all the way to the Bermondsey station—I followed him across the road to a beer shop, he went in—there were about six people there, I should say—he went right through the beer shop into the sitting-room and I followed him—he sat down to play a game at cards with a man, and I told two people who were sitting there what he had done to me, and after staying there five minutes went away and left him playing at cards—when I went into the prisoner's house, I had 10 pence, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I took 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Mr. Winter—I got the 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from two customers after leaving home, but I had paid for two pints of ale—I spent 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I lost 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as near as I can say—I had drank half a pint out of the first pint of ale, about a gill out of the next, and he poured the glass of ale back which I had poured him out of the pint pot, into my pint, and said that he did not like it, he must have mild ale—I drank out of the jug—I said, "If you wish to have more you must have it at your own expense"—there was an old lady lying on the outside of the bed when we first went into the prisoner's house, and when he called her she got up—she held my arm when I was going to strike him—she was a little obstruction to me, but I did not think it worth while to say anything about it before this time—my contention was with the prisoner—I do not think I said anything before the Magistrate about her holding my arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have been waterman at Waterloo-bridge forty years—I was tipsy, and do not recollect anything about it—I do not remember seeing him—if I had done anything wrong, why did not he give me in charge at 7 o'clock at night?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I gave him in charge next day—I went with two or three constables and knocked at the door—it was not opened, and they broke it open, but he was not there—I went home to my cousin's in Bermondsey that night, and he saw my clothes all over blood—he took no steps—I got there about 9 o'clock in the evening—I spoke to the police the same evening, and they told me to go to Stone's End station, but I was too fatigued.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 30). On 2d December, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was on duty at Stone's End station, and the last witness came and gave information to the Inspector that he had been robbed the night previously—I was directed to apprehend the prisoner—I went to his house with two other constables, and found him drunk in his own house—he was brought to the station, charged, and taken before a Magistrate, but he was too drunk for the Magistrate to deal with the case, and was remanded for three or four days, when he was committed for trial—he denied robbing the man, but said he had been drinking with him—the prosecutor had received a blow, but the blood had been washed off then—he did not say that he had been struck with an instrument, only that he had been knocked down and stunned—I found no instrument or weapon in the house—I did not see that the prisoner had had any blow—the prosecutor is rather the taller man of the two—he said that there was an old woman in the room, but did not say that she held his arms—I found the prisoner's wife there; she is not very young—I think a hard blow with a fist might have made the lump on the prosecutor's face; it was more like a bruise.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday, the 22d of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, with a bundle under his coat; I asked how he came by it - he said he brought it from his sister's, who lived in Holywell-lane, who was lying in, and he was going to take it to his mother, who lived in Rosemary-lane, to iron - I took him into a shop; he ran away, but I got him again - he then said his mother lived in Spitalfields.</p>

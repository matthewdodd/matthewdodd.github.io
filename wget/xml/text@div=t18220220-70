On Tuesday week, I ordered my man Clark, to take three horses to Epping Forest; they were all geldings, and were marked two or three days previous, with the West Ham mark - one of them was brought to me by Dickinson, on Thursday evening last; I am sure it was one of mine; it is now at my house - I gave 22 l. for it, in October. It has been ill, but is now getting better, and is worth 10 l.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. Last Thursday night, I was on duty with Hewitt, another patrol, and in Mile End-road, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner on the other side of the road, leading a gelding, he had a bridle, but no saddle; I ran over, and asked where he brought the horse from, he said he brought it from the Harrow, at Stratford, and it was given to him there by

I called Hewitt over, and took him - I went down to the Harrow, and enquired for Lee, but could not learn that any such person had been there. Several people said the horse was Winch's - I took it to him, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>MR. WINCH. When the horse was brought to me, I went to the forest, and found the other two there, on the part of the forest near Leightonstone. It had neither clog or chain on.</p>

            . I only know the same as Dickinson. I took the prisoner to the Harrow, that night, and then brought him to town, took him into Whitechaple, and asked if he could shew me the house he was to take the horse to; he took me to the Duke's Head, Whitechaple-road; there were no stables there. He said the man was to stop there till he brought it. I could not learn that Lee was there.</p>

At the end of the week, I found she was not likely to suit me; I gave her a months warning, in case either of us was suited before the month was up, we would part. On the 28th, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I went up stairs; I found she had gone away; she went away saying, she would go and get some pump water. She never returned. I examined the tea-spoons; I found four of them were gone. I had seen them that evening at tea, at eight o'clock. They were silver. I gave a pound for five of them; they are worth eight shillings. I missed four silver tablespoons after that; they are worth a pound. I missed four table cloths; they are worth a pound. I went into the parlour to look for the salt-spoons; they were also missing; they were worth four shillings. I have never seen any of the things since. On the Saturday following, I met the prisoner in Artillery-place, she went into a public-house with a man. I had her taken up; the prisoner abused me.</p>
               <p>MARY CUMMINGHAM. I was a servant to Mrs. Clark; she appointed me to come that night, on the 28th, I saw the silver tea-spoons; there were five silver tea-spoons went up, and four came down.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner leave the house - A. Between nine and ten; she said, she was going for water; she never returned. I saw the prisoner wipe the four tea-spoons, and place them on the dresser. What became of them after, I don't know. I have never seen them since. I know nothing of the tablecloth, or table-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner leave her clothes behind her - A. No; she lert an empty box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told the girl when she brought the things down I was going for some pump water; she said, she had come to live there; I told her to call her mistress; she would not. I went away as my mistress had brought this servant into the house, and had undermined me; I had no clothes; I had made away with them through sickness. I am innocent of this charge.</p>

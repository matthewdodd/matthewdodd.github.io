The Prosecutor depos'd, that being to go abroad with two Countrymen, and expecting to pay a bill before he came home again, he put 16 Guineas into his Purse. They went together to see Westminster Abbey, and from thence came to the Horseshoe Tavern in Drury-Lane about 6 at Night, and staid till between 9 and 10. By which time he got tolerably drunk; and parting with his 2 Friends at the Door, he presently met with another, but of a different Sex.

They drank Geneva till they could hardly see one another; and then taking out his Purse to pay the Reckoning, he found but 7 Guineas left out of the 16. But where or how the Money was lost, was more than he could tell; for all that he knew of the Matter, was, that it was gone, and that he got nothing for it, but a little Gin, and a little * * * </p>

They got up again; he called her his Dear Mother; she bade him kneel down, ask her Blessing, and kiss her * * *. He obey'd. But hark ye me, Son, says she, I understand that you lead a very fine Course of Life: You make a common Practice of getting drunk, and spending all that you have upon naughty Women, while your poor honest Wife and Daughters here, (pointing to the Prisoners) have had nothing to eat these 3 days. I have a good mind to whip you severely. Indeed Mamma, it's no such thing. What, do you deny it, Sirrah? Here, fetch me the Rods. Will you do so any more? No, never. Well! get you to Bed, and behave yourself as you ought to do, or i' faith I'll tickle your Toby. His Mother then took him up Stairs, where they two staid together about half an Hour; and when they came down again, he took out his Purse to pay the Reckoning, and said he had lost 9 Guineas. Upon which his Mother bade him good Night, There being no Proof that either of the Prisoner's had the Money, the Jury <rs id="t17250115-13-verdict70" type="verdictDescription">

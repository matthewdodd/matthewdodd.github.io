                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Hawthorn, and live in Fleur-de-Lis-street, Spitalfields—the prisoner lived in the ground floor of our house—On Tuesday evening, the 29th of October, I was in my room on the first floor—I heard a noise in his room, opened my door, and stood on the stairs, imagining he was quarrelling with the woman he lives with—I heard him say to his child, "Turn out"—I went down stairs, and saw the child run out—as I came down stairs I met the prisoner in the passage and caught him by the arm as he was striking the child, and entreated him not to strike the child, who was then gone out of the house—the prisoner was following him—he made me no answer, but followed the child, and struck him in the street—it was a dark night, and I could not tell what he struck him with—he then caught him by the shoulder, dragged him several paces along the street, brought him back again to the door, caught him by the shoulder, and threw him into the gutter facing the door—he held him by one hand and threw him down—I think the child's other shoulder came against the ground—he kept his head up—I do not think it touched the ground—I ran over, pushed him from the child, and took the child from him—I screamed loudly, which attracted the attention of persons who came round—I took the child into my own room, and found the blood streaming from his head—the child was always very dirty and very much neglected—a person took him from me and washed him—there was dirt and blood together on his head—I gave him a piece of bread and butter, and he ate it very eagerly—the prisoner told me some time before that the child was six years old—he was rather small for his age—his mother has been dead three years—it was the first time I had seen him ill-use the child—he has lived there nine weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at home with my wife on the Tuesday night, and heard a noise—I went down stairs on hearing my wife scream and met the prisoner at the door—I asked why he beat his child—he made, no answer—I said he had better give him something to eat than use him in that way—the child was brought up to my room—I saw the blood run<lb></lb>ning from its head—a neighbour took it from my wife and washed it—the prisoner came into the room—his woman spoke to him about it, and he made no answer—a policeman afterwards came up and spoke to him about it—he said he was sorry for it—the child was taken from the prisoner by direction of the magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information I went to the house and saw the child bleeding from the head freely—I saw two or three cuts in the head—I took the prisoner, and asked how he came to do it—he made no reply, but afterwards said he was very sorry for what he had done—he gave me no reason for it—he was sober—I took the child to a surgeon, and afterwards to the workhouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer, at Alresford, Suffolk—on 9th February I was staying at the Tavistock hotel—when I left my room in the morning I left in it my carpet bag, a frock coat and several other things, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the coat—I had missed the pomade previous to missing the coat—I was present when the prisoner was brought into the manager's room and searched—I was asked by the detective if this was my coat—I said "Yes"—he asked how I could swear to it—I said by the name of the maker on the back of the collar, Scott—the prisoner said. "Oh, I get Scott to make for me very often."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I left the coat hanging on a chair—I had not put it on for four or five days—I did not lock my bedroom door—I know the pomade pot by the stopper being irregular, and a part of the label having come off when I put it in warm water—it was shown to me in the manager's room—I deal with Mr. Scott, of Bond Street.</p>

On 9th February I went to the Tavistock hotel, and the prisoner was brought into the manager's room—I sent for the prosecutor—I asked the prisoner to undo his overcoat, and under<lb></lb>neath it he was wearing this coat—the name of Scottson, 55, Bond New Bond Street, is on the collar—I pointed it out to the prosecutor, and he said "This is my coat"—I said "How do you know it"—he said "My coat has in the—band of the collar, 'Scott Son, New Bond Street, London'"—the prisoner turned round and said "Why actually that is my tailor," or words to that effect—the coat was tried on the prosecutor and it fitted him exactly—this pot of pomade was found in his carpet bag, which was locked, in the prisoner's bedroom—I opened it with a key which the pri<lb></lb>soner gave me, he had a bunch of sixteen keys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He showed a good deal of reluctance in showing the coat—he did not unbutton his overcoat; I had to do it for him; he called me. all the scoundrels he could lay his tongue to, and said I had no business to do this—he did not say the coat had been left in his room by mistake—he was not charged with stealing the pomade at first, only the coat.</p>

            . Q. Did you at any time lose your watch - A. Yes; last Tuesday week, about ten minutes after eleven o'clock at night; I was at work at Mr. Moorman's, a saw maker, till one o'clock; about five o'clock I went into the City Arms, <placeName id="t18080713-5-crimeloc29">City road</placeName>

               <p>Q. How came you not to go to work in the afternoon - A. I had a little liquor in the forenoon; in the afternoon I took a walk in the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any thing - A. Not till nine o'clock at night; I then went into the house; I saw a young woman that I knew; she asked me to drink; I did. I continued with her an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner or any other man in company - A. Yes, there were two or three, but I knew none of them; I only knew the girl; I drank out of one pot and paid for another; that was all that I had; I came away and said that it was eleven o'clock; I did not know it was so late or else I would have gone sooner; somebody said come back and have another pot; I said I would rather not; I went out of the house;

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of them - A. He was; the two young women walked on before; the young men asked me which way I was going; I told them into Old street; they said they would bear me company and would see me home, they lived there. We walked on till we came between two gardens; there was pales on the left hand side and a bank on the other; the man on my left side was a soldier, and the prisoner was on my right; the prisoner gave me a bit of a jostle and pushed me against the other; the prisoner snatched at my watch; he hit his hand against my hat; he snatched the watch out with such force the chain broke, and the watch fell on the ground; I said that is mine; I went to stoop for it; he picked it up and ran away; the soldier ran towards Brick lane and the prisoner towards the City road; I ran after the prisoner; I lost sight of him; he was taken. When I came up to the place then I saw that the watchman had hold of him. The watch was picked up by a gentleman; Mr. Chard shewed it me the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at that time sober or in liquor - A. I had a little drop in the morning, and in the evening. I was sensible of every thing that passed.</p>

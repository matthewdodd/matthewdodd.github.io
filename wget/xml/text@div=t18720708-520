                  </hi>. I am captain of the ship <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi> lying in the West India Dock—the prisoner was the carpenter on board—on Friday night, 5th July, I left the ship in charge of the prisoner and the boy Innes—I had nine 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and eleven sovereigns in a tin cash-box in a drawer in my state room—I had seen them safe that afternoon when I took out three sovereigns—I returned to the vessel on Sunday night about 12 o'clock, and missed ten sovereigns from my cash-box—I was led to go there seeing that the prisoner was rather intoxicated, and that he had money—I searched all his pockets and took 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him—on the Saturday previous he said that he had no money, and asked me to give him a little, to get some tobacco, and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I left the state room door locked, and when I returned it was locked, but I found a bunch of old keys on board, one of which I found, unfor<lb></lb>tunately, fitted my state room door, which I was not aware of—no one had charge of the bunch, it was lying in the cabin—I asked the prisoner where he got all the money from—he said that he had no money—I said "You have"—he said "Ask the boy where I got it from; I got it from the boy"—I said that I would call a policeman—he made a rush on deck and went down to the forecastle—I heard his chest-lid go down with a bang—I went down and insisted on his coming out of the forecastle—I did my best to put him on deck—an officer came and searched the forecastle, but found nothing, as it was dark—we secured the forecastle, and found next morning that it had not been disturbed—I was just at the top of the ladder when the officer found the money—when we were searching the prisoner's chest, he said "You need not look there; you will find no money"—after searching the forecastle the policeman showed me six sovereigns and a half-sovereign.</p>

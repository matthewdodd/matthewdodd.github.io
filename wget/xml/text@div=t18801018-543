                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman BR</hi> 18). On Sunday morning, 22nd August, about 12 o'clock or a little after, I was in Leader Street, Chelsea—I heard screams coming from the neighbourhood of Oakham Street—I went to the corner of Wickham Place and saw a crowd of people—there was a Mrs. O'Brien there—she made a complaint to me; in consequence of not seeing any signs of violence upon her I refused to take the charge—she then flew at her husband; I separated them and endeavoured to disperse the crowd—I then saw the two prisoners with two females, one standing in front of Smith—I saw Smith with his arm back as though to strike a blow at the female with his clenched fist—I got in between them, put one hand on Smith and one hand on the female, and said "Don't strike the woman"—I don't know what Smith</p>

               <p>said at firsts he made some remark, but as soon as he got into the road he said "God strike me bleeding blind you don't go alive out of this street to-night"—Norman said "You have got none of your bleeding <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> with you here to-night; we have got you here now and we will settle you"—Smith tried to get at me, but the female kept him back—he said "Let me go and I will smash his bleeding brains out"—I said "I don't wish to have anything to say to you, go quietly away, it will be all the better for you"—upon that they walked a little way down the street—the woman whom Smith was about to strike rushed out at her door, and calling to the prisoners to come back, said she would fight either of them—I went and put her back and closed the door after her—I waited outside the door two or three minutes; I then looked down the street, I could not see the prisoners, and I thought they had gone out of the street altogether—I went a little way down and saw the prisoners on the dark side, underneath a wall—Smith rushed across the road and said "I have got you now," and struck me a terrific blow just over the left eye—as soon as I could recover myself I closed with him and got him by the scarf—as soon as he found I had hold of him he gave me a tremendous kick just on the inside of the right leg, above the ankle—I directly felt my leg give way, it would not support my weight—Norman rushed up to me, and between the two they forced me down on my back on the ground; I still had hold of Smith by my left hand—Norman got me by the throat and held me till I was very nearly strangled—I put back my hand to try and get my truncheon out, but it was gone—I then got hold of Norman by the scarf—I then had them both—a crowd rushed round me and got hold of the two prisoners and dragged them off me—I was dragged up with them—I was seized from behind and was pulled back ana the prisoners were pulled back with me, and we all fell down together—my leg got twisted underneath me in going down, and I called out "My leg is broken"—I was dragged up again—I still had hold of the two prisoners, one in each hand—some one struck me across the hand—I was thrown on the ground again, and when I was down both prisoners beat me about the head most unmerci<lb></lb>fully—I said "Do you intend to kill me?"—they both said "We will do you if yon don't let us go"—they repeated that several times—I said "I will never let you go as long as I live"—we had a desperate struggle after that—I was rolled over and dragged along the street—I still kept hold of the prisoners; I never left them—I succeeded in holding them until the arrival of 131 B, and they were taken into custody—I said to the constable "For Heaven's sake try and hold them, my leg is broke and I am done"—I was taken to St. George's Hospital—I have suffered great pain in my back since, and my head and leg, and am unfit for duty—after I had handed the prisoners over to the constable I found they were getting too strong for him, and I dragged myself on my back and got hold of Smith—some one in the crowd brought me my truncheon and put it into my hand—he struggled so violently I could hardly hold him—I struck him over my shoulder, and I think I cut him across the head—the prisoners were total strangers to me, I never saw them before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were several people round Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien, not a very great number—I did not see the prisoners among them—When I first saw Smith he had his hand up to strike the woman—his</p>

               <p>statement "God strike me blind you shall not go out of the street alive" was not made to the woman, but to me—the woman was not there then; she had gone indoors—up to that time the prisoners had not done any<lb></lb>thing to me—I often hear idle expressions without noticing them—when I saw the prisoners under the wall I did not see anybody else there—I believe there was one more person, but I did not see her; it was the female who was in company with them—it was then the attack was made upon me—after I succeeded in freeing myself a rush was made upon me by a crowd of people, and I was seized behind, and dragged backwards—both the prisoners said "I will do for you"—they used exactly the same words—there were several people there all the time; the night Was dark—I am quite sure the prisoners are the men—I never let go of them.</p>

I am a M.R.O.S. and house surgeon at St. George's Hospital—I was called to see Diamond; he was suffering from a double fracture of the large bone of the right leg;, and a single fracture of the small bone of the same leg, above the ankle joint—the upper fracture was probably done by a kick, and the under fracture by the foot being twisted underneath by the force of the crowd—he is unfit for duty, and will certainly not be fit for six months, and his ankle will be permanently injured—he is an out-patient at present—I cannot speak to any bruises about the body, on account of my attention being drawn entirely to his leg; it was a dangerous injury, and required a great deal of attention.</p>

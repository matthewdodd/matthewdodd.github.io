                  </hi>. I live at No. 178, Prospect-place, Maida-hill, Edgware-road. I know the prisoner—I believe him to be a jeweller—about the middle of Aug. last, I ordered him to make a signet ring, to weigh 8 dwts. of gold, to be hall marked, of the standard of 18 carats fine—the price was to be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner resides in the Goswell-road—I gave him the order in his shop—he told me he would execute the order—he produced a bunch of sizes, made of wire; and after fitting a great many upon my finger, I got one that fitted, and pointed it out to him; he then put a small piece of paper on the size, and sealed it with a bit of sealing wax, and stated that he would have the ring ready within a fortnight—I chose an onyx stone to put in the ring; that was to be included in the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called again at the shop at the time appointed, within a fortnight—it was near the latter end of July—I do not recollect the exact day—I saw him in his shop—he said, "I am not ready for you yet"—I asked him what he had done in the matter—he said, "I will let you see"—he went into a place at the rear of the shop, and brought out the ring—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the ring—it was then in a coarse state, and without the stone—I fitted it on my third finger—I told him that the size answered, and handed it back to him—he said it was ready to go to the Hall to be marked, and that it would be detained some time—there was no mark on the ring at that time—he told me to call between the 10th and 11th of the following month—I said I would call on the 11th—I did call on 11th Aug.—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner on that occasion—I saw Mrs. Nunn, the prisoner's wife—the ring was then produced by Mrs. Nunn; it was in the same state in which it now is, with the exception of this piece being cut off; it has been tested at the Hall—this bill of parcels was delivered to me by the prisoner's wife, with the ring—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the ring—I afterwards found out that the mark was not correct—about three weeks ago I showed the ring to Mr. Cogswell, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in Copenhagen-street, Islington—he is here—before that I thought that it appeared very much obliterated—I was buying an article of Cogs<lb></lb>well, and I asked him his opinion of the ring—I saw him looking at it as it was on my finger—in consequence of what Cogswell said, I went, next day, to Goldsmiths' Hall, with the ring—I there saw Mr. Sharp, the deputy warden of the Company.</p>

Mr. Russell, one of the General Inspectors of Prisons at that time—I got the appointment at the end of the eleven months—between that time and my departure, I was waiting for the appointment—I was about three months waiting for it—I did not start immediately—I was doing nothing between the time I actually got it and my starting—I left Van Diemen's Land on 8th Aug., 1845—I have not been living private ever since my return—in the first instance I received half pay from the Government, on returning here—between 1845 and the present time, I have been in communication with the Archbishop of Dublin and the then Lord Lieutenant, upon the subject of convict discipline, and drawing up a scheme for the management of the convicts—that is not all that I have been doing to gain my living—I have been twice employed by the Government since I came home, for three months at a time; I got 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each time—I have got my living in different ways—I do not mean to say that the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was my ostensible means of living—I have 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, an annuity in right of my wife—my wife is dead—it is not payable at the Bank of England; it is a private annuity—that is not the only means I have had of living, except the two sums of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I have had means from my brothers and rela<lb></lb>tives—that is the way in which I have lived—I have never been a rent collector—I have never collected rents for any one—I did not first become acquainted with Mr. Nunn by going to collect a portion of rent that was due to his landlord, Mr. Young—my friend, Dr. Young, with whom I have been acquainted and intimately connected, was the medical attendant of Nunn's family—Mr. Young purchased a diamond ring from Nunn; and he told me, if I wanted anything, Nunn would be a proper person to apply to—I do not know whether Nunn owed him a debt—I never applied for it—I now live at No. 187, Prospect-place, Maida-hill—I have lived between No. 10 and No. 178, for the last two years—my wife has been dead since-1850—in 1851, I recollect lodging at a Mr. Nightingale's—Mrs. Austin was not living with me there—I will swear that there was not a Mrs. Austin lodging with me there—there was a lady lodging with me there—she passed as my wife, by the name of Mrs. Austin—that was a Mrs. Murray—Mrs. Murray is at present residing at No. 1, Matilda-street—she passes by the name of Mrs. Murray—I believe she did live at No. 7, Dorset-crescent, New North-road—in point of fact, I know she did—she lodged there—she passed by the name of Keymer there, her maiden name—I visited her con<lb></lb>stantly, and sometimes staid all night, and two nights together on one occasion; but then she was in a dying state—I believe where she lodges now, in Matilda-street, she passes by the name of Keymer—I have never represented myself</p>

               <p>there to be her brother-in-law, never, to any person, I distinctly swear I have not—I cannot say what she may have said, but I will swear distinctly that I never represented myself as any connexion whatever, more than to be the friend of Mrs. Murray—I have never heard her mention to the people of the house what connexion or relation I was of hers—she was ill while she was at Matilda-street—I went to order this ring last July—in July, 1853, I was not at Bow station—I was at the Thames police court, and that for a charitable act, and immediately moving under the direction of Mr. Cowan, the member for Edinburgh—it was on a charge of obtaining a guinea by false pretences from Mr. Frederick Soames—I did not go under any pretence—I went in my proper person, without any pretence whatever—I went according to the fact—Murray preferred such a charge against me, that is, the husband of Mrs. Murray—I had got the pound, and handed it to Mrs. Murray—that was not at the time I was living with her as her husband; she had then ceased to live with me as my wife—she was then living at South Ockenden, in Essex, with her family—Mr. Murray was a schoolmaster at South Ockenden—I believe they had four children—I believe the eldest was thirteen years of age—Murray's distress was such that he had neither clothing, nor a bed to lie upon for a period of three years—I was written to by his wife to go and see the position they were in, and to know if I could do anything to assist them out of it; and his youngest child was dying at the time—I went down—I never took Mrs. Murray to live with me as Mrs. Austin, but when I went down on that occasion I asked Murray what could be done under the circumstances—he said, "If you wait on my friend Mr. Cowan, on my behalf, and explain what you see, I think he will assist me"—he wrote a letter, which he wished me to take to Mr. Cowan—on the following day I went to the Reform Club, saw Mr. Cowan, and represented the state of distress and destitution Murray was in—he said to me, "I gave him some money to go down there some time ago; I am sorry to hear of his state of distress; what can be done?"—I said, "Sir, it appears to me that Mr. Seymour Clarke, at the King's-cross station, will have regard to your application, and in all probability you may get him a clerkship there; I will be the bearer of any letter, and will explain the circumstances to Mr. Seymour Clarke for you"—he said, "Well, that is very good"—I said, "The next consideration is that he should be put in a way to come to show his qualifications to Mr. Clarke"—he asked me how much would do it—I said I could not say exactly, but they were in a very distressed state—he said, "I will draw up a document; Mrs. Murray is highly respectable in her connexions, and I will place 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as my subscription"—I said, "Very well; I shall wait upon Mrs. Murray's friends, Fladgate and Clark, of Craven-street, and the Rev. Mr. Drummond, the executors"—I waited upon them, and upon seeing Mr. Cowan's document, Mr. Fladgate said, "Murray is a very bad man, and nothing will I notice except what emanates from the clergyman of the parish where he has been residing for the last three years"—I then said, "Under the circumstances, I will go down and bring you a certificate from the minister of the parish"—I went down, and saw both the rector and the curate—the curate said, "I am sorry to hear that Murray and his family are in such utter distress; but the fact is, he has been here for the last three years, as I am informed, and I never heard of his being outside his door; what can I say for him?"—when I explained matters, he wrote upon this document that such a person was in the capacity of village schoolmaster, and that he heard nothing against his reputation during the time he was there—he sent him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was delivered</p>

               <p>to Mrs. Murray and her children in Murray's presence—the curate told me that he wanted to take his female child to have her educated by his governess, but Murray refused, and said the curate wanted his child for sinister purposes, and he would not allow her to go there—I returned with that statement to Mr. Cowan—I went to Mr. Fladgate, and from this representation he sent a guinea for the use of Mrs. Murray—the Rev. Mr. Drummond, of Charlton, her executor, also sent her a guinea—I went and delivered those sums over to her and to Murray, and as soon as he got it, with a portion of clothing that I brought him, he ran away, and left his wife and children at the Tillage of South Ockenden—the consequence was, that she was turned out of the place with her children—the money I got from Mr. Soames I handed over to her, with which she came to town—she made application to the Lambeth authorities—Murray was found, and made to take his children—Mr. Cowan gave him employment, and when he heard of the conduct he had pursued, having his name brought up at the Police Court, and all that sort of thing, he dismissed him from his place in Thames-street, and Murray left, and has not since been heard of—I have not lived with Mrs. Murray from that day to the present—it was previous to 1851, that I lived with her—I was told that Murray had been three years without a bed to sleep on, and when I went there I saw neither bed or bed clothes—he and his children slept indiscriminately on the bare floor—I did not know Murray until Mrs. Murray sent to me, stating the distress they were in—Murray was examined at the Police Court, and I called Mrs. Murray as my witness—I did not refuse to give my address at the police station—there was a remand, for the purpose of obtaining Mr. Cowan—I did refuse to give my address and for this purpose, until Mr. Soames was sent for to sign the charge sheet—I explained to the inspector that it was a vindictive and virulent proceeding on the part of Murray to prefer this charge, for which there was no foundation, and at that time I was living at No. 4, Kingsland-road—the charge sheet is there, which will show the date when I was first before the Magistrate—I was remanded to the following Tuesday, and for this purpose, I expected that Mr. Soames would come forward and sign the charge sheet, and I intended, if so, to remain under detention to make the charge of false imprisonment against me more complete than it would otherwise be—I remained in custody until the following Tuesday, and was then discharged—I cannot tell exactly how long I remained in custody, I think it was from the Saturday until the following Tuesday or Wednesday—I went to the House of Detention, Clerkenwell—when I came up again on the Tuesday, I might have refused to give any address; I could not swear that I did; Mr. Soames and Mr. Murray were examined; and I called Mrs. Murray to prove that she wrote to Mr. Soames to acknowledge the receipt of a sovereign, as Murray had at that time deserted her, and that he was not present to receive what was forthcoming—Mr. Soames said he could not swear whether he received the letter or not, but that he might have done so; and Murray admitted on that occasion before the Magistrate, that the clothing he was then wearing was what I had given to him—I recollect buying a case of pistols in the Goswell-road, for the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about two or two and a half years ago; there was the crest of a nobleman upon them; I wanted to have that removed, and my own initials put on—I applied to an engraver of the name of Halliday, to know to whom I should go to have it carefully done—he recommended me to a house in Northampton-street, and I went up to a garret there—I found some work<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>men there, more than three—I asked to have the marks taken off, and one of them immediately agreed to do it—it was done while I waited, as I was particular about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of talking with the person or persons there, did you mention that it would be a good speculation to go out to Australia and make sovereigns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not the most distant recollection of any such conversation—I will swear distinctly that no such conversation passed—I was not ten minutes in the place—I was there on two occasions—I swear distinctly that no such conversation passed on either occasion—I did not go there on a third occasion; never but twice, to the best of my knowledge—to the best of my knowledge I was never there except on the two occasions, to get my guard chain mended, and to get the pistols done; no such con<lb></lb>versation took place, or ever entered my head—when I went to get my guard chain mended, I stated that it had been cut at the Eagle Tavern—I said that I suspected it was done with such nippers as they, the chain makers, usually work with; not such nippers as thieves used, I never saw one—I have seen instruments used by thieves, but I did not see the instrument that was used upon that particular occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you understand much about gold, the standard and all that, con<lb></lb>nected with it?<hi rend="italic"> A.</hi> I understand that there is eighteen carat gold, and twenty-two carat—I had not purchased any article of Mr. Nunn previous to the ring being made—I recommended him two sisters as customers, to make a purchase—there was no gratuity given me for that recommendation—I do not remember recommending any other person who made any other purchase—I stated to Nunn that a third sister would be likely to make a purchase of him, if he would wait upon her and show her some of his jewellery—I was not to have a gratuity for that; the things they wanted were not to be standard gold of eighteen carats, there was no stipulation of that kind; I am sorry that there was not, for they turn out to be very bad—I recollect giving the precise directions as to the eighteen carats—I do not think I repeated my orders more than once that it was to be eighteen carats—he unquestionably said it should be so—I gave directions that he should have the ring made of standard gold of eighteen carats fine, which I believe to be the standard usually in use—I knew it from public accounts; I have seen an account given in the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi>, of the hall mark, and the usual letters used, and all that sort of thing—I cannot exactly tell you when I saw that; but I have seen it—I might have seen it before I gave the order; I had decidedly—I cannot tell you when it was, but I was always led to believe that by having any particular article of jewellery hall marked, it is beyond all question or doubt a genuine article, and that was the pro<lb></lb>minent reason why in getting that ring made, I wished to have it done—I said "eighteen carats fine"—the expression "fine gold" I have seen very early in life—I was never in the jewellery line—I said it was to be hall marked, and eighteen carats fine—I named that the stone was to be an onyx, but left the selection of it to Nunn—I fixed the precise weight 8 dwts.—I had not knowledge enough of jewellery to know what sort of solidity a ring of 8 dwts. would present—I fixed upon 8 dwts. because I thought the size of my finger would afford a substantial ring, and I thought that would be large and strong enough—I never weighed any jewellery, so as to know what sort of thing a ring of 8 dwts. would be; it was mere guess—when I called according to appointment, it was the prisoner who brought out the ring from the back of the premises—I put it on my finger, and fitted it, and said it would answer; I then took</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501010025"></xptr>
               <p>it off and looked at it—the prisoner remarked to me that it was then ready to go to the Hall to be marked, which would take some time—upon my oath, the words he used were not that it would take some time to finish it—I swear distinctly, if I was to appear before my Maker, these are the words he expressed to me distinctly, that the ring was then ready to go to the Hall to be marked, and that it would take some time to do it—he did not say that it would take some time to finish—I did not inquire how long it would take to finish—he said, "I will have it done by the 10th or the 11th"—I said, "As I have no other business in this neighbourhood from where I live, I will say the 11th, and do not disappoint me"—on the 11th, after leaving Mr. Nunn's shop, I took it and had it weighed at the next surgeon's shop, Mr. Roper's, I think—in consequence of not seeing the prisoner to receive the ring from him, I went into Roper's shop, and had it weighed—there was a young gentleman in the place, and I asked him to weigh it, and he did—it weighed more than 8 dwts.; I cannot exactly say how much it weighed, but it was beyond the 8 dwts.; that was the stone and all—I had it weighed just for my own information—before I left Nunn's shop, it occurred to me (though I did not express anything) that they did their work very slovenly at the Hall, as I could discover nothing plain in the mark with the exception of the number 18 and the crown; and it also occurred to me that the particular parts that were not plain, might have occurred in the finishing of the ring after it left the Hall—I did not know what I should find besides the number and the crown—I did not know what the precise mark of the Goldsmiths' Company in London was—I had read the account in the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi> long before that, but could not bear in mind what the particulars were—where the mark of Her Majesty's head ought to he was not plain—it was about three weeks ago that I went to the pawnbroker's and showed him the ring—the pawnbroker was not a friend of mine—I considered it a friendly action to give me a candid opinion—I had never seen the man before, and when I appeared at the police office, I did not know his name—I stated that I had shown it to a great many persons—some valued it at nine guineas—I stated at the police court that I had shown it to a friend of mine who had found out that it was an old mark, but he said it wad a good ring—I meant Cogswell, the pawnbroker—he told me that late in the afternoon, and I went to Goldsmiths' Hall the following day—I do not know that the very day I went to the Hall, Mrs. Murray went to the prisoner's shop—I will swear positively that I do not know it—on Sunday evening last she confessed to me that she did go there—it was about 3 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon that I went to Goldsmiths' Hall, as near as I can remember—I cannot say that Mrs. Murray had been to the prisoner's shop that very morning—I believe Mrs. Murray is not here—I saw her the same night that I had been to the pawnbroker's.</p>

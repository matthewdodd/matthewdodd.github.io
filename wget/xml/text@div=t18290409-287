             re-examined. This is the order I received from the prisoner, and put on the file of the Society, on the evening of Saturday, the 21st of February; I gave it to Beswick on the Monday following, in the evening - it had been on the file till then; nobody but my own family had access to the bar - I know it to be the same paper, because I put my hand-writing on it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of March, in Osborne-street, St. James', at Mr. Salter's house; I searched him after I got to the office, and found this paper, among a number of others; this induced me to go to Mr. Beswick's - I told him, both before I found the paper, and after, that he was charged with forging certain orders; he wished me to allow him to put that paper into the fire; I told him he had had plenty of time to destroy any thing he chose before I took him - I then placed him in the back office, among a number of other prisoners: I observed him watching me very closely - I had occasion to go into the Magistrates' room, and after returning from the Magistrates' room, I found he was gone from where I had placed him: the place he had been in was not locked; I immediately ran out of the office door, and observed him turning the corner into Blenheim-street, about fifty yards from the office - I followed, and overtook him; I have known him twenty years - he bore an excellent character.</p>
               <p>The order was here read, as set out in the indictment; the paper found on the prisoner was verbatim the same, except not being headed "St. Ann's Society."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am unprepared with Counsel, having had so little time; I never knew a word of this charge till I had a note from the solicitor on Saturday - the keeper of Clerkenwell prison did not know I was to be tried here; I understood it was for a fraud.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. The landlady is here, if the prisoner wishes to examine her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to ask her.</p>
               <p>The Court inquired if the prosecutors were prepared to produce any rules of the Society, authorising the secretary to draw upon Mr. Thomas. - Mr. Phillips replied in the negative.</p>
               <p>GUILTY (of uttering). Aged 56.</p>

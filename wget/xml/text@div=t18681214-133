                  </hi>. I live at Renfrew Road, Kennington—the prisoner has been in my employ, as milk carrier, for about twelve months—he had to go to Waterloo Station every morning to receive a quantity of milk, to be delivered at St. James's Workhouse, Poland Street, and at Mr. Bonthron's, in Regent Street, who I contract with for milk, to be sent daily—the pri<lb></lb>soner as not authorized to sell milk to any other customer—he brought me a complaint from Mr. Bonthron, on 3rd December—the prisoner was in the habit of bringing me bread from Mr. Bonthron—I paid him for the bread, and said, "I find you are in the habit of selling milk, and I shall give you in custody for doing so"—he said, "I sold the milk, but I intended to have given you the money"—on this Thursday he was under notice to leave, and I gave him in charge on Saturday night, 5th December—he has never accounted to me for the money he received from chance customers.</p>

I live at 2, Angel Place, Broadwall—on the last day of November, I went into Mr. Hopkins' service—next morning I went with the prisoner to Waterloo Station, to fetch milk, to be delivered at the work-house and at Mr. Bonthron's—on Wednesday, 2nd December, I did the am—when we were delivering the milk at the workhouse, a woman came up with a jug, and the prisoner served her with some milk from Mr. Bon<lb></lb>thron's churn, and received the money for it.</p>

On the 5th of November I lost three shifts from my yard; I saw them safe hanging on the line at five o'clock, and at half-past six they were missing - these are two of them; one is missing - the prisoners lodged in a room which looks into our yard; I picked a button up in my yard, where two bricks had fallen - it was quite clean.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was it a dark evening? A. Nearly dark; I was in the wash-house - no persons can get to my back-yard, but from the other yard; the shifts were dry.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did you do? A.I went round to the prisoner's house, and set a person to watch; I went round to the pawnbrokers - I did not find any thing at the house, nor see the prisoners.</p>

            . The prosecutrix came to me, and told me she had lost this property; I said I would see if any one went in or came out of the prisoners' house - no one came out, till the prisoners did, which was about ten minutes before eight o'clock; their house is in Henry-street, Hampstead-road - they went down Tottenham-court-road; I followed them to the Adam and Eve public-house - I stood at the door, and they had a glass of something; they then came out, and came down the road; I followed them down to Tottenham-court chapel - it was then about eight o'clock, and, being cold, I returned; they had a hand-basket in their hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it concealed? A. It had two lids to it, but the basket itself was not concealed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to No. 2, Henry-street, Hampstead-road - but previous to that, I had received a button which the prosecutrix picked up in the yard; when I went into the apartment. I saw the two prisoners, and I saw a coat on the back of a chair - I asked the man if it was his coat, and he said it was; I took it, and found one button deficient, and the button I had corresponded with the buttons on the coat - I told him what Mrs. Hines had lost; he made great resistance, and said he would not be searched - this is the coat, and the button; I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is not this a common quality for buttons? A. It is marked "Best quality in London."</p>

            . I keep the house No 2, Henry-street. I remember William Hunter going to see after the roof, and to repair a chimney-pot; he laid the bricks straight which were on the wall - I cannot say that he had such a coat as this on then, but I think he had, and for a fortnight afterwards he wore black.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did he repair the house? A. I think about a month before; he had a blue coat on that day - I do not know whether he lost a button; the wall has been broken these twelve months: all the bricks were loose, and some had fallen down - some of them are often knocked off by cats; on the 6th of November some were pushed over within two yards of the chimney.</p>

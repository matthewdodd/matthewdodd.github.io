                  </hi>. I am a dealer in coals, and live in Mary-street, Hampstead-road. About one o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, the 12th of October, I was standing in front of my shop—I observed a cart near the shop—a man in it said something to me—I looked out, and saw the prisoner Collins almost opposite my shop, with a youth's coat over his arm—he was walking towards Robert-street—I went after him, and just at the corner, I saw him with Jones—they were two or three yards apart, and Jones then had the coat, and Collins had none—they were about one hundred and fifty yards from my shop—they had turned a corner—Jones went up Henry-street—I followed him, and when I got round the corner I saw the coat within Mr. Landen's iron rails, and Jones was con<lb></lb>cealing himself in the doorway—I laid hold of him, and called to the peo<lb></lb>ple to pursue Collins, when Mr. Godsden, the butcher, took him, brought him to me, and we took them both into Mary-street—we could not find an owner for the coat at that time—we took them to the station-house—Mrs. Garrard claimed the coat at the office—I first saw them about one hundred yards from Garrard's.</p>

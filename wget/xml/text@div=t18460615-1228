                  </hi>. I am a soap-manufacturer, and live in Dock-street, Whitechapel—the prisoner was in my service for eighteen months—I sent him out with soap on the 21st of May—I have since seen some soap produced by the officer—it corresponds with that 1 sent the prisoner out with—I could not swear to it—it was like mine in every respect—the prisoner was to go to se<lb></lb>veral places with the soap—I cannot tell whether he went—I seldom have anything to do with it myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 45). I stopped the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock that night with this soap under his arm—I asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I said he had—he said, nothing but his coat—I said, "Surely you have something else"—I felt and said, "There is something hard"—he said, "No, nothing but my coat"—I undid his coat and found these four bars of soap—he said one of their men had put these four bars of soap over-weight, he did not like the man to get into trouble, and he was going to take it home—I took him to the station—Mr. Stevens came, and the prisoner then said it was four bars of soap that he ought to have left ia Kennington-lane.</p>

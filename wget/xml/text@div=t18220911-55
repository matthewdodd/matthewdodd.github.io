A lady and gentleman came from the Crescent arm in arm; they advanced about a yard on the road, and a horse and gig at full gallop came directly upon them, and struck the lady on the side of her head, knocked her bonnet off, and they both fell with great violence; and the wheel went over the gentleman's body. I turned round and saw the chaise going on without any body in it - the gentleman got out or fell out. The lady and gentleman were brought into my lodge; he appeared very much hurt. A surgeon was sent for and he was put on my bed, and was sent to the Middlesex Hospital. The affair was so sudden that I could not see who drove the gig - I could not tell whether he was driving, or whether the horses ran away with him.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 12th of August I was coming up the New Road, and saw a man in a gig; I do not know the man rightly, but he was very much intoxicated. The reason I think so was that every whip he gave the horse he fell from one side to the other. I saw him strike several times. He sat on one side and then on the other, and fell from one side of the chaise to the other. The horse was gallopping in a way it ought not to have gallopped. I was not close to the chaise at the moment the accident happened; it had passed when I came up; I saw the person lying on the ground, and paid more attention to that. I did not see the person in the gig get out or fall out. I carried the man to the hospital on a shutter. I held Mr. Steel's horse while he went into the lodge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time was it - A. About a quarter past five in the afternoon. The chaise passed me near the turnpike, by the end of Portland-road; I followed it, on seeing it gallop; he galloped at a very quick pace, and he had the reins in one hand and the whip in the other, and reeled from one side to the other; but the reins were loose - he was tipsy.</p>

            . I am a silver smith; I was riding on the day in question, and saw the deceased after the accident happened, but not before I saw the chaise come through the turnpike by Warren-street, which is four or five hundred yards from the spot. The horse was gallopping. I saw him gallop from the gate to where the accident happened; the prisoner was the driver; I did not know him before, but I saw him thrown out of the gig when the wheel went over the man's body; the horse ran up the New Road; he was leaning back in the chaise, holding the reins very tight; he had them in his left hand and the whip in his right. The chaise went zig-zag, and the whip touched the horse, but he was not striking it; the horse was going at a great rate - it appeared running away. There was only a snaffle bit in the horse's mouth, which I think was improper. He did not appear to be urging the horse on; his endeavours appeared more to keep himself in; he appeared to be in liquor; the lash of the whip fell backwards and forwards, but he was not striking. He was so tipsy after the accident, that two men held him by the arms to keep him up. He went into a public-house. I asked his name and address - he said his name was Needham, and that he lived in the Borough. He appeared very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The chaise did not go in a straight direction - A. No; he leant his head quite over the back of the chaise; he was bailed and has surrendered. He did not appear injured by the fall, he had some brandy and water at the public-house.</p>

No one can feel more sorrow from this unfortunate circumstance than I do; but no blame can justly be attributed to me; the witnesses who state I was intoxicated are wholly mistaken; I had been engaged in town till late in the afternoon, and went to see my daughter, who was visiting her father-in-law at Pentonville. I passed on, and at the end of Tottenham-Court-road the belly band broke; I endeavoured to pull up, but the horse became unmanageable, and the band flapping about increased his fright; I used every exertion to pull in, but could not succeed, and the unsteady motion of the gig shook me about, which might make the witnesses think I was beating the horse; but I was pulling the reins with both hands. I called out to the unfortunate man to get out of the road, and was almost immediately after thrown out of the gig, and no doubt the effects of the fall might make the witnesses think me intoxicated; I did every thing in my power to prevent the accident.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. My father was on the Coroner's Inquest. I heard the verdict from him, and then made known what I knew. I was in the New-road when the accident happened. I stood and saw the horse coming along at a furious rate, about thirty yards in front of me; I stood with my back to the rails to see it pass, and just as it came by, he called out Hoy three or four times. The deceased and his wife were at that time crossing the road, and the prisoner trying every effort to stop the horse. He sat on the seat with both reins in his hand, and I think the whip lay over the dashing iron. He had both his hands on his breast, pulling as tight as he could. I did not observe the belly band. The chaise ran on with great rapidity, and he was thrown out about three yards from where the accident happened - he appeared much hurt by the fall, as if stunned. His forehead was grazed, and the back of his hands hurt. I ran to the deceased, and some people took him from my hands - I went to assist the prisoner; he appeared perfectly sober, but quite stunned - his mind seemed to wander very much, and he staggered a little when we picked him up.</p>

            . I saw the accident. The prisoner sat in his gig, pulling with all his might, to keep the horse from going on - I only saw him pass the lodge, and did not notice the belly band.</p>

            . I am driver of a Paddington stage. I saw the prisoner in his gig, at a quarter to seven o'clock. The belly band was broken, and I lent him a chain to mend it. He appeared sober, and got into his gig again - his hand was cut. I put a man in the gig to drive him home.</p>

            . I live in the prisoner's neighbourhood. I saw him about a mile from home on this night. His head and hands were cut. I am certain he was sober.</p>

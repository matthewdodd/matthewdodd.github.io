I am out of business, and lodge at 14, South Moulton Street—I know nothing of the prisoner—on the 20th of February in consequence of a statement made to me I examined my rooms about 9 o'clock a.m.—I missed several meerschaum pipes, five or six pairs of boots and shoes, three overcoats, a pair of opera glasses, a pair of plated candid—sticks, two cigar cases, an umbrella, and a walking-stick, value altogether about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I identify this meerschaum cigar holder, overcoat, umbrella, and walking-stick—I saw them safe the night previous to the 20th February, about midnight, before I went to bed.</p>

I am a pawnbroker, of 14, Milburn Street—this over-coat and cigar-holder were pledged with me by the prisoner on 20th February in the name of John French, 4, Grafton Street, about 10 a.m.—he said "Will you lend me more money on the cigar-holder if I want it? I have had more on it several times"—I said "If you come in the afternoon I have no doubt I can"—I lent him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each—soon after he went Sergeant Pickles came in and brought something to me, and from what he said I produced the goods to him—the prisoner came again directly after 3 o'clock—we got him round to the private office, sent for a constable, and handed him over.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 22nd July—I was waiting while he looked my papers out—there is a back parlour there—the man did not go in there—he seemed to know the prisoner very well—I did not know him, I never saw him at the prisoner's place before—I knew the pri<lb></lb>soner was in custody the day after—I have been to the Police Court three times—I did not give evidence—I never said anything to the police about this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert and fac-similist of handwriting—I see the address, "Joseph Smith, Fetter Lane," which was written by the prisoner—the ticket with "Welsford" on it, is in his writing—the other ticket is not in his writing; I cannot trace it at all—this letter from Hale, is not in his writing either—this is the first time I have seen it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever given evidence before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, except at Bow Street—I have given my opinion privately before—I served my apprenticeship in Glasgow, with Messrs. McClure and McDonald, lithogra<lb></lb>phers—I said at the Police Court that the yellow ticket, with "Howard" on it, was not in the prisoner's writing, and to the best of my belief it is not.</p>

I live at 329, Gray's Inn Road, and am a news-agent, the prisoner is my son—I have seen him write hundreds of times—this signature and address are in his writing—it is impossible he could have written the letter from Mr. Hale—the ticket with "Howard" on it, is not in his writing, but the one with "Welsford," is his—I was called before the Magistrate—I am positive he never wrote that letter—I know Mr. Farrah, and have known him fourteen or fifteen years; he knows me well, and my son as well.</p>

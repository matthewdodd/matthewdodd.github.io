               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harriet Brown's Defence</hi>. Mrs. Collett asked me to change the notes, and I did so at a place that used to be named Bridge's. I did not know they were stolen. She said her nephew had come up from the country and made her a present of them. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William Brown's Defence</hi>. On 16th Feb. about 9 o'clock, I had occasion to go into the yard, when I saw Weaver, who asked me to find him a train to Yorkshire. I went to the public-house where Farmer the barman is who has given evidence. I afterwards went with Weaver and Cum<lb></lb>mings to the station. Weaver gave me half-a-crown to get some beer, of which we all partook. He afterwards gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to fetch some ale, as we had to wait, and I brought back the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he said I might keep it. I came back home. I never received a penny with a guilty knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any of your property in August last - A. Yes; I missed it at various times. I found silver tops and glasses in the prisoner's box; the box was locked; I found the key in a hole in the cieling over his bed; I found in that box a soap glass, seven silver tops, plated tops and silver tops, a glass mug, and two keys: one of the keys belonged to my shop door, and the other key belonged to his father's street door.</p>

               <p>Q Did you find any thing else there - A. Yes, there were two glasses for painting, a quantity of penny pieces, and halfpence to the number mentioned in the indictment, I found a guinea and a pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak to them being your own - A. Certainly not; I sent for an officer prior to this; he was present when the box was searched; these two keys were found tied together; the officer came, he went to his father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any box that those keys fitted - A. Yes; I did not attend the search up stairs, I was present when the box at his father's was opened; it was brought down stairs locked; the officer had the key; that box contained a variety of articles which I had missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any of these articles that are worth forty shillings - A. No, there is not.</p>

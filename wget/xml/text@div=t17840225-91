               <p>Court to Prisoner. Would you ask this witness any questions? - I would rather ask the gentleman when he is examined, if your Lordship pleases.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>As the prisoner and two more were going out of our shop, I just stepped in, and my wife informed me a tea pot was stolen; I followed, and when we came to the end of White Hart-yard, they all stopped; the woman on my left hand, who was one of the three, took out two dishes from under her clothes, they were yellow dishes with blue edges; the prisoner at the bar was taking out a black tea pot from under her arm, and she dropped the cover of it; on hearing the cover fall, I offered my service to take it up, I told her I knew the pot was mine; she said, she only took it in a joke, and hoped I would not detain her, or words to that effect; I said, I certainly shall, it was a joke I could not dispense with, and I brought her to my house, and got a constable.</p>
               <p>Did you bring the tea pot with you? - I brought it in my hand, there is a selling mark upon it, of my own making, in red ink; the other two women made their escape; the value of the tea pot is one shilling, I did not get the dishes.</p>
               <p>Jury, looking at the tea pot. My Lord, the mark is of so simple a nature, it is a figure of one, any one can make such a mark as that.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they smartly dressed? - Very genteel, I could not have conceived it.</p>
               <p>Why did not you stop the others? - I confess I was flurried a good deal, I might not act with propriety.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you recollect whether I was rightly in my senses when you brought me back to the shop? - I should think you was not, or you would not have been guilty of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I mean to say, whether or no he could not perceive I had drank more that afternoon than had done me good?</p>
               <p>Court. That is no excuse at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took it back in my hand to the shop, but I would sooner have broke it.</p>
               <p>Court. I am sorry to hear a young woman of your age tell us, that you was so intoxicated you did not know what you did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This prosecution is for a thing of small value, but a person being in liquor is no excuse, for some of the lawyers tell you, that drunkenness being a voluntary crime, increases the guilt; but if a person had in a frolic taken such a thing, I think it would be too severe to construe it into a felony, and if you should take it in that light, it is possible you may acquit her.</p>

I waked last Friday night, about four o'clock; I heard a great noise below stairs; upon which I rang the bell, and alarmed the servants. I went down with one of my servants; I took the bar of my window in my hand; and I found, first of all, the door of the closet in the hall broke open. I found the fore gate and the back door barr'd up. I found seven or eight locks broke in the front parlour. From thence I went to the kitchen on the ground floor; there I found two or three more locks forced, and the maid's tea-chest. From thence I went to the housekeeper's room; there I observed that a window, looking into Mr. Thornton's back yard, was thrown open; the sash was up, and the door of Mr. Thornton's yard was forced open likewise. I found there two chissels, one in the house, the other in the garden. (Producing them.) Russel and Hayward, two of my servants, came down. I sent them into the front yard to see if any body was there. They returned, and said, they had found a man, and that another had escaped. Some table-spoons and some tea-spoons were found in the yard; of which Russel can give a more particular account.</p>

            . I am butler. On Friday morning, about four o'clock, I heard my master's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090040"></xptr> bell ring. I got up, and came down stairs with him. As we were coming down, I heard the hall door clap to. I looked out at the window, and saw two men in the fore court. I asked them who they were. One of them said Brown, or Bromley; I can't tell which; I rather believe it was Brown. I called to the watch to secure the gates, and I went down with my master, and we found the locks broke, as my master has described. After this, the coachman and I went into the fore court; he had a candle in his hand. We found Bromley, the evidence, in the corner of the court. The coachman and I secured him; we took him out of the front gates, and delivered him to the watchmen at the watch-house over the way. Returning back into the yard, I saw a handkerchief with a great many spoons in it. (Producing it.) I can swear these are Mr. Nesbit's property; there is Mr. Nesbit's crest upon them; they were usually kept in cases in the cupboard which was broke open; I had the care of them; I am positive they were safe in the cases the night before when I went to-bed. When I came in again, near the cupboard in the hall lay this coal-chissel, as it is called; a little farther on lay this sharp chissel. I observed in the kitchen a spice-cupboard was broke open; nothing was taken out of it. The sash in the housekeeper's room was thrown up; it was the house-keeper's business to fasten that window. I am sure that all the doors were safe at night when I went tobed. I heard the hall-door shut when I first waked. I could not get out of the hall into the court but at the hall-door, because all the windows were fast that looked that way. I saw marks upon the wall in the back yard of a man's feet who had been endeavouring to get over the wall. There are two doors; the back door goes to Mr. Thornton's passage, the fore door into Basinghall-street. The coachman and Mr. Southwell's coachman went in pursuit of them.</p>

            . I am Mr. Nesbit's coachman. I opened the door at the top of the house to call the watch to go round to the back door. They told me they were gone. I came down, and went out with Russel at the hall-door. We saw Bromley in the corner of the yard, endeavouring to get over the wall. Russel and I took him. He pretended to be in liquor. We delivered him to the watchmen. There were marks of feet upon the wall. The watch and I went round to Mr. Southwell's, and borrowed some cloaths, for I had come down in such hastle, that I had come without my cloaths. While I was dressing myself in Mr. Southwell's kitchen, I heard somebody come over the wall by the kitchen window. Whereupon Mr. Southwell's coachman and I went to Guildhall and alarmed the watchmen. We got candles, and went a-top of the leads; we searched about from about a quarter after five, till five minutes past seven. We saw the marks of feet upon the leads, which we traced from place to place. About ten minutes after seven, when it got very light, we saw the prisoner sitting a top of Mr. Waggoner's leads. Mr. Southwell's coachman went round with the watch to Mr. Waggoner's door; then we went round, and called the prisoner; he came and surrendered; we secured him, and led him down a little ladder through a house in Dyer's court, Mr. Hyde's house, I believe. He was searched, but we found nothing on him.</p>

            . I am coachman to Mr. Southwell. I went with Mr. Nesbit's coachman to the Comptroller's and Town-clerk's, to give the alarm, that the men might not escape over their houses. It had been a white frost that morning, so I could see the marks of feet upon the leads of Guildhall and the adjacent buildings. The Comptroller's footman came out, and said he had heard somebody run over the leads over his head. We followed that direction, and found a rope tied round a chimney, by which it appeared to us, that a man seemed to have got down; it was thirty feet to the bottom of the chimney; I did not care to venture that passage, but went down to the place where the bottom of the rope hung; there I saw the place where a man had jump'd across to another leads that went to Mr. Hyde's house; we went through there, and came to the top of the leads; there we found that this man had scaled a wall seven yards high, by the side of a chimney, to another house. We got a ladder in order to pursue him; we knew we must have him safe there. Mr. Nesbit's coachman went up first; when he got to the top, he saw the prisoner, and said, Tom, here is one. We advised him to surrender, for he could not make his escape. He got on his legs, and felt in his right-hand pocket; I apprehended it was for a pistol, but none was found on him. I left Mr. Nesbit's coachman to guard their wall, while I ran round to secure the passage into Fountain-court; in the mean time the prisoner surrendered.</p>

            . One Hudson, and I, and the prisoner went out one night, I forget what; it was the night before we were taken; indeed, I believe it was Friday morning; it was about four o'clock. We went out to see if we could get any money, wherever we could find it. We did not fix any particular place to go to. We came down Aldermanbury; we saw a gate in a back court. I said to Hudson, let's try to open it. Hudson and I opened the gate with this coal-chissel that has been produced. We got into the yard; then I went down some steps in a narrow place into a kitchen; the door was only upon the latch. We several times tried to open another door which went to the dwelling-house from the kitchen, but it was too strong, we could not break it open. Hudson and I went into the kitchen; the prisoner stood at the door. We found nothing in that kitchen but some stockings. I saw a sash over the way; I went to it, and pushed it up. I lifted up the sash; I put my hand against one inside shutter; it seemed not to be fast; it opened directly. The other shutter was screwed; I opened it; I pushed the blind up, unscrewed the door, and put the blind by the side of the place. Then I went in, and stuck a light. Hudson and I went in together; Smith stood in the alley. I went into several rooms; I opened some drawers, and found some lottery-tickets; I took them at first to be bank notes; I did not meddle with them when I found they were lottery-tickets. I broke open but one drawer; I found the keys for the rest. There was nobody but myself in the house at that time. Then I came to a place like a cupboard; I took this great chissel, and opened it. There were some cases in the cupboard that had in them some spoons and knives and forks. I took out all the spoons but four or five; I pulled my handkerchief off my neck, and put the spoons in. Then I came to the window, and called for Hudson and Smith. Hudson was at the window; Smith, the prisoner, was at the outer door in the alley. Hudson and the prisoner came in; his name is Thumper, or Smith. Just as I was getting in, I heard an alarm of a bell. I ran towards the street-door with a candle in my hand. I gave the spoons to Hudson first; Hudson gave them again to me; then I gave them to Smith. We were all three together in the house then. We tried some time before we could open the door: I pulled back the lock at last: I believe the door was only single locked; and I ran out with the spoons towards the gate; but I could not find any way out. I thought we had been in the street. If we had gone out the way we got in, we should have got off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the candle in your hand?</p>
               <p>Bromley. Yes, they were in the dark; for I had blown the candle out when I came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the door shut after you?</p>
               <p>Bromley. Yes; but I don't know whether Smith or Hudson followed me in the yard. I ran up to the corner of the wall and laid the spoons down; then I heard somebody on the other side of the wall call out, Why don't you come over? I don't know who it was, I was so much frightned; and being a little stupid with liquor, I could not get over; I made answer, I could not get over. Somebody looked out of one of the windows of the house; I said, if you come down here, I will blow your brains out. I said so to frighten them, because I wanted to get away. Two gentlemen came down and laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner get over that wall?</p>
               <p>Bromley. I can't say; I believe it must be Thumper, by his being catched there. Somebody got over the wall, but who it was, I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nesbit. The wall divides Mr. Fryer's garden from my court-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any marks on the wall?</p>
               <p>Mr. Nesbit. The wall had been new plaistered, and there were marks all up the wall from attempts to get over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am labourer in trust at Greenwich Hospital. On Monday, the 7th of September, I was at the infirmary of the Hospital, at noon—there was some alteration being made in the roof at the time—there were three plumbers and three labourers employed in stripping the copper; Marshall, Marriot, and Emmet were the plumbers, and the three laboureres I saw go away at noon—they appeared very bulky—I thought there was something under their jackets, and followed them into No. 4, Thames-street—I saw them go into the side door—I waited about two minutes, and saw Williams the labourer come out—I did not see how the door was opened—I was the others come out afterwards, and speak to Wil<lb></lb>liams—I afterwards saw the three plumbers come out; Emmett came out first—I saw Marriot counting money as he came out—I immediately went in by the side of them, before the door closed; when I got inside, I saw Mrs. Ingram standing at her inner door—I asked her to let me look inside—she asked what my business was—I said I wanted to look inside—she said she could not, as her husband was not at home—I said if I could not look in by fair means, I must by foul—she stood with her back to the door—she appeared alarmed, and allowed me to look inside, which I did, and saw six pieces of sheet copper lying on the floor; I asked her how she came by it—she said these four men had brought it in, and left it—I asked if she weighed it—she said, "No"—I asked if she had paid any money for it—she said not—I weighed it, and it was 105lbs. I sent for Mr. Lee, the clerk of the works—I remained in possession of the premises till he arrived—he looked at the copper, and fetched two policemen, who came and took charge of it, and took Mrs. Ingram into custody—I afterwards compared the copper with the copper on the premises—It corre<lb></lb>sponded on every respect with the place it was taken from—It corresponded with the copper which was taken off the infirmary roof, in quality, colour, and thickness, and several marks in it show where it had laid upon the</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the R division of police. In con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I went to Ingram's house, on Tuesday, the 8th of September, after the copper had been removed—the house is at the corner of a road, leading to the water side, called Bishop's-place—the shop is being fitted up for a plumber and glazier—there was a quantity of glass and things in the front shop—there is a door in Thames-street, in the usual way—I went down Bishop's-place, and found a side entrance—that is a very wide door, large enough to admit a cart—when you look at the door, at first it appears to be all one door; but on examining the side of the posts, I discovered a bit of brass, and on pressing my foot on that I found part of the door flew open, so as to admit a man—without that there did not appear a small door in the large one—on going in at that door, I found myself under a shed, with earth for the floor—I afterwards searched under the earth—I went into the workshops adjoining the shed, and removed a box or drawer which stood there with heavy tools in it, and found there was a trap-door—It is in the room adjoining the shed—the trap-door slanted down to a brick vault under the shed, woth boards at the top, and earth over the boards—there is no means of getting to that vault, but through the shoot I have described—the shoot is in the workshop behind the front shop—there was a furnace in the shop—I searched all over the premises, and found property whitch forms the subject of another indict<lb></lb>ment—the maleprisoner gave himself into my custody on Sunday week last, at Deptford—he said he had had the advice of his solicitor, who ad<lb></lb>vised him to surrender, and his doing so he hoped would be the means of saving his wife, as she was perfectly innocent.</p>

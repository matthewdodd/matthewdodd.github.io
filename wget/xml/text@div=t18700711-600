                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi>). On 6th June, about 1 o'clock, I was standing with Franklyn and Whatmore, two constables, at the corner of Cannon Street Road and Cable Street—we were in uniform—I saw a man emerge from a wall on the other side of the street, 25 or 30 yards I from where I was standing down Cable Street—I saw him step from I the wall and turn towards where we were standing, and then I saw a flash straight from his shoulder towards where we stood, neither up or down—I beard an explosion of fire arms, and a whiz in the air—I cannot tell what distance it was from me—I immediately ran and seized his throat with my left hand, and his left wrist, from behind, with my right, and at the same time two other witnesses seized his right hand, in which he held this pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by the stock, and was putting it into his pocket—I held him tightly till they took it from his hand—his right hand was then re<lb></lb>leased, and he put it towards his left side—I immediately let go of his throat, seized his arm, and said "Look out, he has got something more about him"—I then brought him down on his back, and at the same time Whatmore took this dagger from his inside breast-pocket, naked at it is now; there was no sheath—this sheath was put on at the station to prevent accident, it did not come from the prisoner—they searched him carefully, but found nothing more, and we let him get up—he said "Don't hurt me, will go quietly"—we took him to the station, where the charge was read over to him, and his statement was taken down by the acting inspector—he said "I have been rather roughly used," but up to that time he said nothing about the pistol—he gave his address 42, Watney Street, Com<lb></lb>mercial Road—I went there and found it was his lodging—I searched, but found nothing—he was sober—I could not find any traces of a bullet mark on the wall where we were standing—there was a gas lamp 10 or 11 yards from where we stood, and another lamp about 50 yards further off.</p>

               <p>gently—I did not see that he betrayed any excitement—he wilked eastwards towards Watney Street—his hand did not get into his pocket—the pistol was in his pocket, and his hand was on the stock of it, pushing it in—I did not say before the Magistrate "His hand was in his coat pocket when I seized him"—the pistol was in his hand when I got up—he held the pistol tight, but I held him too tightly for him to resist—the point of the pistol was towards the ground—he was not roughly used, only held very tight—I saw no cut on his lip—he was employed at some manure works at Normandy Wharf, Deptford Creek—I went there, and found he had been there a little over twelve months, and the master said that he bore a very good character—I heard the prisoner make a statement immediately after he was charged, which was taken down in writing—I did not hear him say that the pistol caught in the lining of his coat; he said "It went off acci<lb></lb>dentally as I was taking it out of my pocket"—the wall was 20 or 30 feet from where we stood—the pavement is, I think, 3 yards wide—if the bullet had come straight it would have hit the wall—there was nobody between me and the prisoner—I was not present at some bullet practice.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 198). On 6th June I was at the corner of Cannon Street, in uniform, and Franklyn and McDonald came up to me—I noticed the prisoner on the opposite side of the way, against the Crown and Dolphin public-house—he was walking up Cable Street East, going more east, away from us—he walked a couple of doors past the public-house, and I heard the report of a revolver—I turned round, and saw the smoke from the prisoner, facing me—I saw him drop his right hand, and imme<lb></lb>diately walk across the road—we all three ran after him—I went in front of him, and caught hold of his right band, and in his outside right coat pocket he had the stock of a revolver in his hand; I slid my hand down, and caught hold of the muzzle of it outside while it was in his pocket—he drew his hand from the revolver and put it to his left breast—Me Donald said "Look out, he has something there," and threw him down on his back—I put my hand in his breast pocket and took out this dagger, without any sheath—he said "I will go," that is all I heard him say, or "Don't hurt me, I will go"—I carried the revolver and dagger to the station, where I searched him, and found these papers, this book, and these twelve caps for the nipples of the pistol—one chamber had been discharged, and there was an exploded cap on the nipple—the other four chambers were loaded. <hi rend="italic">One of the paper related to a ball for a patriotic Irishman, and the pocket-book contained a cypher and key, and some addresses in America.</hi>

I did not fire at any person. I received some rough usage from the men who took me. I think the bullet may be found close to where I was standing.

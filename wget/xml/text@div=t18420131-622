                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living in Carnaby-street, St. James's—the prisoner was my apprentice. On the 26th of December I delivered to him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to the best of my belief, it was four half-crowns and two shillings, to pay to Mrs. Slaughter—he came back in the evening—he said nothing, and I had no doubt it was paid—next morning, about eleven o'clock, he left my place—I received this letter, which is the prisoner's writing—<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"When you receive these few lines I shall be far from you. I hope you will forgive me for absconding with your money; but you are a bad man, and I shall never forgive you for trying to, cheat Mrs. Slaughter. If you let me alone, I shall never trouble you more as you have been a tyrant to me."—I heard no more of the prisoner till the 5th of January, when I gave him in charge—he stated before the Magistrate that ill usage caused him to do this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi> I was bound apprentice to him on the 2nd of February with a premium of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the parish of St. James, and on the 28th, he pawned a suit of black clothes belonging to me, and he continued to make it a practice. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I believe it was done once or twice—I had the money for a few days—there was no money owing to the prisoner</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to me—he said if I would work hard he would allow me all I earned over 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I worked night and day to please him, till by his ill treatment I was obliged to leave him—I then came to him again—he let his. son wear a new pair of boots off my feet, and I was obliged to wear a pair of old ones, which exposed my feet for a long time, till I got him to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get them soled—he let met lie on the sweepings of the shop, put into a bag, till they became so infested with vermin that they crawled about the shop—I had no sheet, only a blanket and a rug to cover me—I have worked day all and night while he has been drinking for three months together—on Christmas-eve I worked all night, and I have done so several times, thinking he would notice my industry, but he always told me I was idle—I worked on Christmas-day till half-past twelve o'clock—I had my breakfast at seven, and had no more till about six, when he offered me a dinner, but I had been invited out—I applied to one of the guardians, and he advised me to go to a Magistrate, but I did not, knowing the trouble I had in getting a master, being afflicted as I was, and being in the workhouse—I stopped with him till the 27th of December, and then with 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I borrowed of Mrs. Slaughter, I went down to Yorkshire, to see an uncle, but hearing he was gone to Paisley, I returned to London, and hearing the prosecutor wanted to see me, I went to his house—he gave me in charge—he owed me more than this money. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The boots were a pair he could not were</p>

               <p>and he gave them to my son himself—I paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for soloing his boots—he has a disorder, and could not sleep in a decent bed—he would not attend to his duty at all—he did not work on Christmas-day for me—there was a good dinner, but he refused it, and said he was going out—he came back to my house—I owed him no money—I paid him on Christmas-eve.</p>

I hung out these things to dry in the yard; I do not exactly know their value. I asked her for them about ten o'clock in the morning - she said they were stolen from the yard; I said that was impossible, and insisted on having them found - she heard there was a search-warrant coming, and I saw her throw the lace on the fire; I took it off, and threw it into water, but most of it was burnt - there is sufficient left to identify. She ran out of the house, and was taken. I value them at 40 s.</p>

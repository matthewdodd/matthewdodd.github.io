               <p>SAMUEL BIGMORE. - I live at Haverill, in Suffolk - I sent a parcel on the 2d of December by the Haverill coach - it was directed to Mary Bigmore, Kennington-common - it contained twenty sovereigns - I wrapped it up between two pieces of wood, and a newspaper round it, and outside was a piece of blue paper - it was a small parcel - it was directed to No. 1, at Mr. Dawson's, Newington-terrace or place, Kennington-common - I gave it to John Regulus, the coachman at Haverill - he is a servant of the proprietors - the coach is called Nelson and Tregitt's coach - I wrote on the outside "Â£20" - I did not insure it - there was a letter in the parcel.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL BIGMORE. It was written in figures very legible - not an inch long.</p>
               <p>HENRY ANDREWS cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many hours after the coach arrived did you see the prisoner warming his hands by the fire? A. Twenty-four hours - it was four hours after I had last seen the parcel, that I saw the prisoner warming his hands - it had been out of my sight four hours - it is a regular coach-office; but not the office which persons come to to take places - there was no stranger near where the parcel was - my three fellow-servants were in the office, and Edgell - my fellow-servants are not here - I was attending to my business, casting up the books - I had my dinner in the course of the four hours - I dined in the office - my sister brought it to me; but she was not round the counter - the others were round the counter - they came round to mark off the book - I cannot say whether "20l." was written on the parcel or not - I did not notice it much - I had other parcels to mark off - I put it in a place of safety - I have been there about four years - two book-keepers have left lately, but not under charge - it was about eight or nine months ago.</p>

            , and I went down and found the lock was off; I opened the door, and stood in the passage about ten minutes, and I heard somebody down below; I stepped out and got assistance, and the prisoner and another man came up; the prisoner catched me by the collar, and asked me if I did not see a man, I told him no, and I immediately caught at him; they came out of the kitchen: the other pushed me out in the street, and the prisoner slipped out, and I followed him, and caught him the corner of St. Martin's Court, the other escaped; I found the lead sink below was all turned up, but not taken out of the room; the lock was found within the shop door, removed from the street door altogether, with the screws in it; the lead was not taken out of the frame.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Shelton. Is there any count for ripping and cutting? - No, only the count for stealing.</p>
               <p>Do you know what situation the house was left in before? - I was down there before, and it was locked; the lock appeared to be taken off with a screw driver, he dropped a screw driver out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Did the lock appear to be forced off, for the purpose of getting into the house, or did it appear to be taken off afterwards? - It appeared to me, to have been taken off withinside.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether it was an iron lock, or a wooden lock? - It was what we call a stock lock, iron work in a wooden frame.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you understand then, from the description of an iron lock, should you understand it was a lock of this kind, or a lock in an iron box? - No, I should not, it is called a stock lock, an iron lock, or a brass lock, according to the case of it.</p>

               <p>I took charge of the prisoner, and took him to the Justices; and went and searched the house, I have not the lock here, I did not conceive it to be necessary; I asked the the Justice whether I should bring the lock, and he said no; I found the lock on the side of an inner door, and in the kitchen I found this screw; I turned on one side, and I observed the lead raised all round from the frame, but not carried away; I found this sack likewise.</p>
               <p>What sort of lock was it? - A stock lock, a lock in an iron frame, I do not conceive it to be called an iron lock.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at St. James's-market, to carry some lead, I stopped and had a pennyworth of beer, and came along Leicester-fields, and up Castle-street, meaning to go home to my lodgings; I heard the cry of stop thief! I ran, I suppose there were twenty people, or more, and the gentleman took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, here is no taking away to constitute a complete stealing, any the least removal is sufficient, but here there was none; and though the same act of parliament, which makes it felony to steal, makes it felony to rip with intent to steal, yet there is no such charge in the indictment: and then in the count for the lock, they have called it an iron lock, which it certainly is not, therefore in point of law, the prisoner is entitled to his acquittal.</p>

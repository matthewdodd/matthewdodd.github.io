I live at 8, Boar's Head Yard, Whitechapel Road—on 26th September, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was coming home with my brother from the Pavilion Theatre—I was very drunk—I did not know I was stabbed—I don't know who did it—I was taken to the hospital, but I do not know how I got there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the last witness—I had been drinking with him on this Saturday night—I had a great deal to drink—I knew what I was about—he was going along in front of me—I saw the prisoner draw his hand away from my brother—he called out, "I am stabbed"—I said, "No you are not"—my brother then fell down, and I saw blood coming from him—I ran to the prisoner, and saw him put his hand in his right pocket—I gave him in charge—I did not hear him say anything.</p>

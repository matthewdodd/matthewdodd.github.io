Yes; but he went to the hospital about a fortnight before that; I asked him what that great bundle was; and he said, he was going to carry it to the other end of the town for a young man; I thought, sure the old man had not robbed me, and I ran up stairs, and found my things all safe.</p>

             sworn. - I had the key of my sister's box, I locked it myself; I went again on the 20th, and found it broke open, and the contents gone.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH KEMP sworn. - I live at Lamport, in Northamptonshire: Upon hearing that my box was broke open I came to town, and, in the prisoner's room, I found a bundle containing about a yard and a half of silk ferret that had my private mark upon it; the prisoner had then quitted the lodging, and gone to another; I also found in the bundle a piece of sponge that I had left in the box, and a hank of buttons. The box contained, among other things, the goods mentioned in the indictment: there were two cotton gowns and coats, worth one pound each; four petticoats, worth three guineas, they cost me more; a white calico gown, worth one pound; a muslin apron, that cost me half-a-guinea, and all my muslin handkerchiefs and caps; a pair of stays, worth a guinea and a half; a tea-pot, worth five shillings; a tablecloth, worth eighteen shillings; half-a-dozen napkins, worth ten shillings; and a great many more things mentioned in the indictment; I have never found any of them again.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. The prisoner was gone away when Mrs. Stevens came, he had left an old coat and waistcoat, a pair of stockings, leather breeches, and jacket, they were good for nothing, in the bundle; I told Mrs. Kemp, he had left a bundle, and she might look if any of her things were there.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that that bundle was his? - A. Because I had seen him wear the jacket and leather breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any other person lodged in the room after the prisoner had gone away, and before Mrs. Kemp came? - A. Yes, a barber lodged there, he lodges at my house now, he is not here; he works upon Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - A. I do not know, only Thomas. (An officer was sent by the Court to fetch him).</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Jones). How came the prisoner to quit your house? - A. I do not know; when he came first, he agreed upon a week's warning, but he went away without giving me any warning; there was another person lodged with me at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090006"></xptr>time, and does still, of the name of White, a porter; the prisoner said, first, I did not see him with a bundle, and then afterwards, he said, I did see him with a bundle, he was going to carry to be washed.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether any body had seen him about the house that day that you saw him go down Snow-hill? - A. No; my lodgers were both out at work.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned, after you had seen him upon Snow-hill, did you go up into the garret? - A. Yes, but I did not think any thing of the box.</p>

The prisoner came to look at some apartments which I had to let, on the 7th of December, it was dusk, my sister let him in, he said that he was recommended by some person who had my bill up; I shewed him the rooms, and told him if he would come down stairs, I would speak to him about them, he appeared to be a working man; he came down, and my sister brought a light into the parlour, he said he was a varnisher - I am sure he is the man; he left me and said, he would bring his wife to look at them the next day. I missed my husband's miniature the next morning, it hung over the fire-place; nobody else had been in the room.</p>

I said, you have been to look at some apartments at my house; he said, he had not been to look at any; my sister said, he was the man; he wanted me to go back, and said he would follow me; I got him to go with me, and when he had got about twelve yards he ran away, I followed him and took him; and said, if he would tell me where the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150066"></xptr>miniature was, I would set him at liberty - He would not.

I live there occasionally; my father does not. The servants of the firm sleep there; the rent is paid for out of the profits of the business. On the 14th of June, the two prisoners came to our warehouse about half past four in the afternoon, they wanted to look at cambric muslins; I could not understand them. I and my clerk, Mr. Barber, shewed them a great many; they wanted to look at more; we could not find any thing fine enough for them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces were taken down for them - A. A great many scores. They went away without buying, said, they would return with a broker. They seemed hurt that I could not understand what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after they were gone, did you miss any thing - A. I went away immediately. I thought their manner old; but I did not see them take any thing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BARKER. I am clerk to Messrs. Ainsworths. I assisted in shewing the goods to the prisoners; during the time they were there, I did not see them take any of the goods. After they were gone, I assisted in putting up the goods again; I missed seven pieces of cambric muslin, of two different qualities.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they part of what you had opened to shew the prisoners - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the time of their leaving you, and the time of making this discovery, had any other persons been there - A. No, there had not. In consequence of what I heard the next day, I went to Guildhall, and found them in custody, and then I went to Mr. Roberts, the Golden Fleece, Wine-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive of Mr. Roberts any pieces of cambric - A. No; the officer did. I found there seven pieces that I had lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Holyrood Stores—on Tuesday, 7th October, about half-past 7 in the evening, the prisoner and another man came—the prisoner asked for two glasses of <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi>, which is half stout and half porter—it came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and he gave me this florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I bit it, bent it, and told him it was bad—he said that he was not aware of it—he wanted it back, but I would not give it to him—he then gave me a half-crown, which I put in the till, and gave him the change; four sixpences and three penny-pieces—there were no florins or half-crowns in the till—I marked the florin, and gave it to the governor—I told the prisoner to go out of the house, or else I would lock him up; he remained, and I sent for a constable; but, before one came, the prisoner asked for two glasses of stout, which he had, and paid for with three penny pieces—while he was drinking it, a constable came, and my master gave the prisoner and hid companion in custody with the florin.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 36). The prisoner was given into my charge with this coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that he did not know it was bad I—he refused to give his address to me, and again at the station—I searched him at the station, and found a florin, a shilling, four sixpences, a three-penny <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>, and 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in copper—I did not discover it then, but on the Mon<lb></lb>day morning I found that the florin was bad, and, to make sure of it, I took it to Mr. Clark, a pawnbroker, in Long-acre—the prisoner was taken before a Magistrate on the Wednesday, remanded till Thursday, and then remanded again till Monday, when the prisoner was committed, and the other man discharged—I did not discover till that day that the florin was bad.</p>

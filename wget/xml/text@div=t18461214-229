                  </hi>. I live at Uxbridge, and am a carrier. Nash was in my service—I gave him directions, on the 1st of Dec, to take a load to Lon<lb></lb>don—he had no business to take any hay with him—he had a nose-bag for each horse, containing beans, bran, and chaff—the hay that is here I believe to be mine—four bushels of beans, bran, and chaff have been found—Nash had no business with anv of that—the other man who took the van on had sufficient for the horses—Nash had two horses, and had no right to have more than half a bushel for each nose-bag and one bushel beside—he had two bushels more than was allowed.</p>

At a quarter before three o'clock, on the morning of the 2nd of Dec, I was on duty at Uxbridge—I saw Mr. Johnson's van pass with two horses, and a large quantity of hay on the top of it—Briscoe was driving—I asked him how long they were going to be out—he said they were coming back at twelve o'clock at night—I said, "You have got a great deal of hay for two horses"—he said, "We have no bait"—I looked under the van, and saw three nose-bags—I said, "Who is going with you?"—he said, "Nash"—I followed the van to the Green Man, about a quarter of a mile—Nash did not come—I turned back and met him—I said to him, "Where are you off to to-night?"—he said, "To London"—I asked when he was to return—he said, at twelve o'clock at night—I then went to Mr. Johnson's, and from what he said I went and overtook Nash, driving, at Hillingdon Heath, two miles from Uxbridge—I asked him where he got the truss of hay from—he said out of his master's yard—I said I had seen Mr. Johnson—he said, "There it is, thank God I have not parted with it"</p>

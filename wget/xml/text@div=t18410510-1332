                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor, and live in Sandy's-row, Spi<lb></lb>talfields. The prisoner was in my employ—I bought a particular sort of oats, with some black tares among them—the prisoner fetched them from the cornchandler's, and they were placed in the stable on the 17th of April—he took them up into the loft—he came to me about four o'clock and said, "Master, I have mixed up two days' provision for the horses"—I went up and looked at it—I then went down and found a parcel in the stable con<lb></lb>cealed, all ready to take away—I examined it, and found a bag of oats and some black tares among them, behind a corn-bin, concealed under half a truss of straw—I went again about seven o'clock in the evening, and it was gone—I then fetched the constable, and it was found in Henry Ran<lb></lb>dall's</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Black Horse stable-yard. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the 17th of April, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner walk from one stable to another, and when he got into Randall's stable I saw him with this bag in his hand—he remained there about a minute, and came out without it—in about three-quarters of an hour I told the prosecutor that if he would look into Randall's stable he would find it.</p>

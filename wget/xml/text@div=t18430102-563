                  </hi>. I am a private in the Marines, at Deptford. On Tuesday night, the 27th of Dec., I was walking with the prisoner Baker, at Deptford, and between eleven and twelve o'clock, and met Herd walking in the street—we all three then walked together—we walked about the street all night, as we could not get into any place—at four o'clock in the morning, we went into a coffee shop—I called for three cups of coffee, and paid for it—I had some silver, and a sovereign in my pocket which I had not changed then—I paid away half-a-crown at the coffee-shop—we then went to a gin-shop opposite—I then had the sovereign, and some silver in my pocket—I changed the sovereign there, and then had about 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in my pocket—I had no copper to ray knowledge—my money was in a blue purse—after leaving the gin-shop, we went to the Little Crown—I went to sleep there, with my head on the table—I then laid on the form, and rolled off the form—the prisoners were both there when I went to sleep, which was about nine o'clock in the morning—I had my money then, and had paid for everything—I awoke between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I found the prisoners gone, and missed my-money, purse, and all—I saw Baker, as he came back afterwards, and said he wanted to speak to me—I went out to him and said, "What do you want?"—he said, "I am going to take you to the woman"—I said, "Why?"—he said, "I know the money is all safe"—I went with him to the Fishing Smack, where he said the woman was, but she was not there—I said, "Most likely you know where she is, I will wait while you fetch her"—I waited there an hour and a half—he never</p>

On the after<lb></lb>noon of the 31st of Dec., I met Herd at Woolwich—I stopped her, and asked her what she had done with the prosecutor's purse—she said, "Where is her?"—a policeman came up while I was talking to her—I was ordered to take her to the barracks—I asked her how the purse came oat of the man's pocket—she said, "I took it out"—I gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Little Crown, at Deptford. On the morning of the 28th of Dec., between nine and ten o'clock, the prosecutor came there with the prisoners, and had a pint of half-and-half, which Herd paid for—they had some rum and shrub also—I heard them talking together, and differing about half-a-crown—Herd said, "I have got no more," and pulled a blue purse out of her pocket—she counted the money out on the table, and there was 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she bad in her hand—I believe that did not come out of the purse—she put the money back into the purse, and I believe put it into her pocket—Baker said, "It is all right, we will go away, and be baek in half-an-hour"—they did not return—he came back about five o'clock, and took Miller out—I never saw him after.</p>

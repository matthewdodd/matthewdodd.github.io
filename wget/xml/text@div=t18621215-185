                  </hi>. I am single—I occupied the front room downstairs at 12, Wood's-buildings, on 22d November last, and had done so over twenty years—the prisoner occupied the front room upstairs, immediately above mine—he had lived there between six and seven weeks with his wife and three children; Johanna, the eldest, was between eight and nine years of age—on the evening of 22d November, my attention was first attracted by singing in the prisoner's room, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I don't know how long that continued—the next thing I heard was the little girl Johanna come down stairs; she went out and returned with some beer in a can—I saw her go up<lb></lb>stairs again, and not many minutes afterwards I heard quarrelling—I could not distinguish the voices of the persons; I should say there were more than one—the next thing I heard was the deceased man say" Give me my change"—I know it was him by it being a much gruffer voice than those occupying the room—he made use of an oath and said, "I will punch it out of you if you do not;" the next I heard was a heavy fall and a table fall over with crockery upon it—I then left my room and went half-way up<lb></lb>stairs—they opened the door and I saw the little boy with a light in his hand; that was all—they then shut the door again—I then came downstairs.—I heard screaming and went half-way up again—before that I went to the door and called "Police," and the neighbours came in—I then called up the stairs to know what was the matter; the prisoner's wife opened the door and said, "For God's sake, fetch a policeman, for he is chopping his brains out"—she then came out and the prisoner came out and pushed her—I came downstairs and she followed; I don't know whether the prisoner followed—I said, "Whatever is the matter? be quiet, or I will fetch a policeman"—he said, "You may," and he went back into the room—I came down stairs and I think I went into my own room, but I have not a recollection—the next thing I heard was a dragging sound as if something was being dragged, and</p>

               <p>a fall—the prisoner's wife was at my room door at that time—I then went out and saw the deceased at the bottom of the stairs, bleeding from the head over the right eye—some one went for a policeman; I don't know what I did; and Mrs. Powell came and pulled the deceased up and held his head—I afterwards went into the prisoner's room—after the surgeon had come, I went to fetch a counterpane and coat to cover the man, but some time elapsed; I can't say how long; I did not take any heed of the time—I did not see any one in the room; I saw a quantity of blood on the left-hand side going in at the door—I afterwards saw the deceased dead at St. Thomas's Hospital on the Friday week following; I don't know the day of the month—this happened on a Saturday night.</p>

On 22d Norember, about a quarter to 10, I was called to 12, Wood's-buildings, Old Kent-road—I saw the deceased Thomas Searle there lying at the foot of the stairs with three extensive wounds on the head—I asked who did it, and the prisoner, who was in the next room downstairs, replied, "I done it, policeman; I will give myself up to you"—I looked round the room at the poker and other things, but could not see any blood on them; and I looked at the prisoner's boots, and on his right boot I found a quantity of blood splashed all over it, and all round the sole—there was no blood on the other boot—the prisoner said, "He should not come after my wife"—I went upstairs, and found a lot of blood in the front room, on the left-hand side, and several spots of blood all down the stairs—Searle was taken in a cab to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, P</hi>). On 22d November, I was on duty at the station in Carter-street, Walworth-road—the prisoner was brought there about a quarter to 11—Brewer charged him with violently assaulting a man named Searle—I asked Brewer if there were any witnesses to the assault—the prisoner immediately replied, "No, there are no witnesses; I did it"—I told him to consider what he was saying, that it was a very serious charge against him—he replied, "I should not care for my own carcass, but for the sake of my poor children"—he said, "The old b—should have kept away from under my nose"—I afterwards saw the deceased at St. Thomas' Hospital, and he told me his name was Thomas Searle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital—on 22d November, Searle was brought there—he had received several injuries about the head, and two of his ribs were broken on the left side—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186212150119"></xptr>
               <p>there were several lacerated wounds about the right side of the head and forehead; the face itself was much swollen and contused—over the right eye there were two cuts parallel, extending about 2 1/2 inches in length, from the temple towards the nose, and there were injuries to the bones about the right eye—I should think the wound over the right eye was caused by some blunt instrument—he was under my care and that or another house<lb></lb>surgeon during the time he remained in the hospital—I believe he died on the Tuesday night—I subsequently examined the body; on the Tuesday week afterwards—the swelling had then very much subsided, and I was enabled to discover a fracture of the bones of the nose—the bone over the left eye was also fractured, and the seventh and eighth ribs were fractured—I have no doubt that those injuries caused his death—I believe those injuries might have been inflicted by this boot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might they not probably be inflicted by the fall downstairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not; the fracture of the ribs might—I believe the broken ribs did not perforate the lung—the viscera were all removed at the time I saw the body—if the broken rib had perforated the lung, that would of itself have been sufficient to cause death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read as follows:</hi>—"He decoyed my wife away, and for about a twelvemonth he had been cohabiting with her. About seven months ago; he took her away for three months, she then asked me to forgive her, and I took her back. I moved away from where I then lived, and Searle used to go to my house while I was at work. He decoyed her away two days and two nights while I was there. She came back, and I forgave her again. I took another room so that he should not know where I was, and last Saturday three weeks, I made an appointment with my wife, but when I got home she was not there. I went out and got rather intoxicated, and met her and him together. They went into a public-house, and I went in with them, and I have no recollection of what followed till I saw him at the bottom of the stairs. He had twice challenged me to fight before this.</p>

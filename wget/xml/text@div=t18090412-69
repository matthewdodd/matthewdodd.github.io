A man that was there, that I thought to be an officer, came up stairs, I desired him to go into my room to see if she had lodged the lace there; the lace was not there; I said it must be on the garret stairs; he went up and found it on the stairs; he said it is all right now, do not frighten yourself.</p>

            . I live in Chiswell-street, opposite of Mr. Brown; I was sitting at the three pair of stairs window, I observed two young women, one was standing at Mr. Brown's shop window and the other at the door looking through the glass; the prisoner had get her arms folded up; she went and spoke to the other woman and then they both went into the shop; the prisoner had a red shawl, and a check apron on, and as soon as she went into the shop I observed her take something and put it into he pocket, it was white; the moment she took it she walked off; the prisoner folded her arms and came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other take any thing - A. I saw the other take something and put it into her apron; the prisoner walked away, and the other one ran; they did not join together as I saw; they went towards Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. At the distance you was could you see into the shop, it is a wide street - A. I could perfectly see into the shop from where I was.</p>
               <p>- BROOKE. I am an officer; I heard the alarm of stop thief in Beech-street; I ran and saw the prisoner go up Golden-lane; when she turned up Collier's-court I lost sight of her; I went up Collier's-court, I said where is she; they said in there; just as I was going into the house a man came out; he said leave her; I told him I should not, and just as I got on the door step she met me, I took her out of the house. She said I have got nothing, I shall not go, I won't go; I told her she was my prisoner; she resisted and hit me three times over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lace ever found - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burton. What was that man that took the lace - A. I do not know, I never saw him before; I thought he was an officer.</p>

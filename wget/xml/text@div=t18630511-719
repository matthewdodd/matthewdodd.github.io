                  </hi>. I am a traveller, residing, in Francis-street, Brompton—on 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> April, at 1 o'clock in the morning, I was walking in Great Queen-street—I was attracted by a number of persons looking at some young men who were apparently fighting—I stopped to look—I had not done so half a minute when somebody came up and knocked my hat off—I cannot swear who it was; there were eight or ten persons round me—I was going to pick up my hat when Sullivan struck me a blow on the chest, and knocked me on my back—I am sure it was him—when I was down he was on top of me, with some others—I felt some one's hands over my person, and a parcel I had was taken out of my coat pocket—it was a large accountants' bill that I had got to certify—I am certain I had that before—I lost nothing from my waistcoat pocket—they all got up and ran away as the policeman James Castle came up—I cannot swear to Finchley.</p>

She asked me to go up stairs with her; I had not been above stairs with her above ten minutes before I was robbed of my purse with five guineas in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you did not shake this purse out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Anderson. No; I am sure I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the money?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I missed it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tax her with having it?</p>
               <p>Anderson. No, she run away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it before she was gone?</p>
               <p>Anderson. yes; I missed it directly as she went.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take hold of her?</p>
               <p>Anderson. Because I did not know where to find her.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take her then?</p>
               <p>Anderson. Because I had not presence of mind, I did not know but she might fall upon me again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mr. Anderson, look at me, and see whether you do me Justice: I desire you would look at me. I suppose my Lord will give you leave to look at me: And please you, my Lord, this man has known me and my husband a great while, and he asked me to drink a pot of beer with him, and he took me up with a warrant, and said I robbed him of five guineas. I am but a woman, if he saw me take the money, why did not he take it out of my hand? He had been in several other houses in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What company was you in afterwards?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I was in no other company.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you upon the bed with her?</p>
               <p>Anderson. Yes. <rs id="t17450710-2-verdict12" type="verdictDescription">

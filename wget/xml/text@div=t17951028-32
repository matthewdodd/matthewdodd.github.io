             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the wife of the prosecutor? - Yes. On the seventh day of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to ask me how I did. She had been a lodger with me about twelve months back. I asked her to stop, and take a bit of breakfast along with me, and after I had my breakfast, I asked her if she would stop in my place while I went to fetch a shovel that a neighbour had borrowed. When I came back she was there, and staid for about ten minutes, and then she went, and as soon as I opened my box, I missed a gown and shift.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was your box kept? - In the same room she was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it the last time before it was stole? - The Monday before.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did she take it? - Wednesday. The Monday following I found them at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did she pawn any shift? - No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never found the shift.</p>
               <p>Wildmen. The prosecutor called on me the Monday following, and I gave her the gown. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know it well; it was bought last Christmas. It is lined with a check apron, which is rather uncommon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Rogers has taken an oath to things that I never see; I lodged with Mrs. Rogers very nigh a twelve month, and she asked me one morning to come in and have some breakfast, I sat very near an hour in the room, and I came-out as I went in, and I never brought any thing out with me at all.</p>

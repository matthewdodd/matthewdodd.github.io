                  </hi>. I live in Compton-street, Soho, and am a hair-dresser. On the 15th of September, about two o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Oxford-street—she asked me to go with her to Shepherd-street—I said, "No"—she slipped her arm round my neck, and said, "Do come"—she tried to get my purse—I got that from her hand—I felt her hand in my pocket, and I missed a half-crown, and a paper with a memorandum on it—I charged her with taking it, asked her to give it up, and I would let her go—she said would I stand any thing to drink, I said, "No"—the policeman came up, and I gave her in charge—she threw a paper away, but I would not lose sight of her—I went to the station, and the next morning I went to the spot, and found this memorandum, which is mine, and this other, which is hers.</p>

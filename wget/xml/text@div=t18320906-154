               <p>JOHN THOMAS GRAVES, ESQ. I live at No. 2, Fig-tree-court, Inner Temple, and am a barrister. On the 18th of June, when I returned to my chambers in the evening, I found the door broken open, my furniture scattered about the room, my chest was broken open, and I missed some 5l. Bank notes; I do not know the numbers, but I received them at Paget's - I had no other notes - I afterwards got from a clerk in the Bank of England, this 5l. note, No. 11,191, dated 28th April, 1832; the prisoner was taken into custody - I asked her if an account which she gave at her own residence when she was taken, was true; she said it was in substance true, that she received the note, not from a man she met in the street, but from a man named Sanders, whom she knew.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you have traced all the notes you lost to different persons? A. Yes, one of them was at Chertsey, and two at Hampton; I lost four.</p>

            . I live in Fenchurch-street, and am a boot and shoe-maker. On Monday or Tuesday, in the first week in July, which was the 2nd or 3rd, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a pair of shoes for 6s.; she gave me this 5l. note, and the name of Sanders, 15, Liverpool-street, Bishopsgate, which is on it in my writing - she only said, "Sanders," and I put the word, "Mrs." - my man then told me that her name was not Sanders; she said,"What he says is very true, my name is not Sanders, but Solomons; if you don't like to take it, you need not, but Sanders is the name of the person I took the note of" - I gave her change, and sent the note to the Bank the next morning, and while my man was gone, the prisoner came to my shop; she said, "Have you inquired about the note;" I said, "No, I have passed it" - she said, "I called to pay the money for it," and then said she would tell me all about it; that it was a note which laid on the counter, belonging to her husband, that she was going to a wedding, and wanted some things, which she did not want him to know of; she again asked if I had put the name of Solomons on it - I said, "No, Sanders," she said, "I am obliged to you," and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a person named Publet in your service? A. Yes, and he knew her, as he had lived in her house; but she did not see him when she was at my shop, as he was in another shop at the time; I had my information from another man named Horne, but Publet confirmed it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at the Rosemary-branch, near Rosemary-lane, on the 6th of July; I saw her and her husband there - I had a warrant to search the house; they wanted to know what it was for - I did not satisfy them, but asked the prisoner, when her husband was not very near her, to account for the 5l. note; she then said it was a note belonging to her husband, which she took off the counter - I did not appear satisfied with that, and she called me aside, and said she would tell me all about it; she then went up stairs with me, and said she was not Mr. Solomon's wife, and that she had had the note from a gentleman, to go with him, and she would not have Mr. Solomons know it on any account; I asked if she knew the person - she said she had seen him once before, but did not know where he resided.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she received the note from Sanders, who accompanied her to Fenchurch-street, and waited outside while she purchased the shoes.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. GRAVES. Q. Have you made any inquiry as to the address of a person named Sanders? A. I enquired at Liverpool-street, and the woman who resided there, said she did not know such a person; but I heard that a person named Sanders was apprehended at Bow-street, and in consequence of a note I received from the prisoner, I let her know of it - she did not mention the name to me, but I did to her.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. I was at her house on the 2nd of July; I remember a gentleman coming there while I was there - he appeared respectably dressed; he asked her if she was quite well - she said, "Quite well, thank you Sanders;" he then asked if she had any thing in the house to drink - she said, "No, Sanders, I have not, but I will take the liberty of asking this young woman to get 1s. worth of brandy;" I went for it, and I had my share of it - she then said to him, "Sanders, I am going to a wedding, will you treat me with a pair of shoes;" he said, "I have no change, but I have a 5l. note, if you will go with me I will treat you with a pair" - they then went out together, and as she was going, she asked me to mind her place, which I did - she returned alone, and brought a parcel with her, wrapped up in paper, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060071"></xptr>she, showed me a pair of shoes, which seemed to be new; she might have been gone about an hour.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of man was he? A. A tallish gentleman - I had not seen him before; I called to see the prisoner, and show her my baby, after I came out of my confinement - there was no servant there; it was on Monday, the 2nd of July - I returned home to George-street, Minories; had been churched on the 1st of July - I did not take particular notice of Sanders; to the best of my knowledge, he had a brown coat and a black hat.</p>

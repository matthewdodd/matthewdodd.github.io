            . I live in John-street, Curtain-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, and rent the house. On the 15th of February, I and my wife went out together, leaving nobody in the house. I shut the doors and windows, and on returning, about eight o'clock, I opened the door with the key, and found two men in the house; I am positive that Moore is one of them, but cannot speak to the other; both ran away, and I followed them. Moore was stopped without my losing sight of him; the other ran down Charlotte-street, and next morning Glede was taken. I examined the house, and missed a clothes brush and a pair of shoes, which were safe about eleven o'clock in the morning, when we went out. They must have entered the house in front; there were marks of a crow-bar where they had tried to open the door; but it must have been opened by a false key. I saw Moore throw a crow-bar away as he ran. I did not see it picked up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you sure that you locked the door when you went out - A. I do not know whether my wife, or myself locked it but I tried it, and it was fast. I was not at home after eleven o'clock.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife - we went out at eleven o'clock; the door was fastened - we always try it, and are very particular with it; we returned about eight o'clock, my husband unlocked the door. I passed him, and the prisoner Glede caught hold of me by the shoulder. I saw them both in the parlour before they touched me - they had no light, but there is a gaslight from a public-house opposite. Glede took me by his two hands, as I was entering the parlour, and shoved me right out of doors. I am certain of him - Moore was behind him; Glede ran out first, and Moore followed. When a light was brought, I found every cupboard-door in the parlour thrown open, and a clothes brush, and pair of shoes taken off the table; there was nothing else down stairs that they could have taken; there was property up stairs. I saw Glede at the watch-house next morning, and knew him. I looked at him quite amazed in the room; the light was strong enough for me to notice his features. I thought at first that it was my brother playing us a trick; we have not found the brush or shoes; there were marks of a crow-bar on the door; it had been opened by a key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You at first thought it was your brother - A. I did not know what to think; my brother could not get into the house - my back was to the light, and his face towards it. I looked at him, before they moved to go out; they were hid up in a corner ready to run out when the door was open; we have no lodgers.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BEADLE READ. I live in Hoxton-market-place, and am in the prosecutor's service. I was standing near the house, and saw master and mistress come down the street, and open the door. I heard mistress scream, and master call Stop thief! I saw a person run out, and pursued him. I did not see him come out of the door; he was about five yards from it, and got off. I did not see his face, and do not know who he was. I saw him throw something away. I got a lantern, and found a crow-bar in the street, about thirty yards from the house - that was not thrown down by the man who I saw. Next morning I found three skeleton keys at the bottom of Willow-walk, three hundred yards from the house; the man I followed ran by that spot, and threw something from him there; he ran through Willow-walk.</p>

            . I am a constable. Turner gave Moore into my charge at ten minutes past eight o'clock. I found nothing nothing upon him. I locked him up, returned to the house, got a light, and went into Willow-walk, and found a dark lantern and phosphorus box, picklock key, and crow-bar, and the other keys were given to me next morning. I tried the crow-bar to the door, it exactly fits the marks, and here is some of the blue paint of the door on it. Next morning I apprehended Glede, in consequence of information, locked him up, and fetched Mrs. Turner, who said in his hearing,</p>
               <p>"That's the man" - he said,</p>

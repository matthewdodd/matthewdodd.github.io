               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Gifford, I take it for granted, that you kill a good many sheep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not kill any of these? - No.</p>
               <p>You sent them publickly to be sold at Smithfield? - I did, I did not suspect them to be stolen; I have known Kimpton about four months; he keeps a public house, and besides that, collects skins about the country.</p>
               <p>As I understand you, he felt the skins to see what they were worth if he bought them, and then emptied his pockets of two pounds worth of halfpence? - Yes; when he was doing all that, he said do it quickly; it was about four, and he was to return home; he then gave a considerable quantity of halfpence to Mash.</p>
               <p>When the sheep came down, this man Kimpton had a lien upon them for some time for the two pounds? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>During the whole conversation were they not treated as the property of young Mash? - I understood it so.</p>
               <p>So that during the whole transaction they were treated as his sheep? - Certainly, I took Rushin to be the brother of Mash.</p>
               <p>Did not Rushin only appear to be assisting Mash in disposing of his property? - No, Mr. Kimpton said they were two brothers, and I concluded Rushin to be the brother, by his giving me the price of the sheep.</p>
               <p>At what time was it that you met at Muswell-hill? - At half after one.</p>
               <p>During the whole business, did Kimpton act as if they were his sheep? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Kimpton lives directly opposite the work-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there a court yard before his house? - There is; I did not see these sheep there.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not say they were his sheep? - No, I understood by him they were two brothers.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. This skettle ground is an open place opposite the house, opposite the work-house? - I believe it is; I did not deliver the sheep to Cook.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher; I live in St. George's market, Oxford-road; I purchased some sheep on Monday was week.</p>
               <p>How many? - Thirteen.</p>
               <p>What kind of sheep? - Little Welch weathers; they were sent home to my house; I killed one, and on Wednesday I sent them home to my Lord's; I delivered them to the drover to take them where they came from; my Lord's steward came to my house, and told me to send them home.</p>
               <p>Strut. I know this witness, I went to his house on Monday, the 13th, at half past ten at night; I found twelve sheep, and one was killed; I went down, and there was a candle, and this little cropt sheep; I saw it, and said that is my Lord's property; I cannot say to the one that is dead; I felt him in the ear without the candle, and I said I am sure it was his sheep; then they brought the candle again, and I looked them over, and I am very positive they are my Lord's property, all of them; they were sent home to my Lord's on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Gifford. You went to my Lord's farm I understand? - I did; I saw the same sheep at my Lord's which I had bought of the man; I had put a mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much did you receive for these sheep? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>How much did Carr agree to give for them? - Fifteen shillings a-piece; that is nine pounds fifteen shillings; I kept them from Friday to Sunday in my open yard along with the rest of my sheep.</p>
               <p>Were they bought within ten miles of London? - I do not know how far it is; I never was there in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you not know it is not more than five? - I never measured; I do not know; I went on horseback; I do not count the mile stones as I ride.</p>
               <p>I ask you, now, upon your oath, do you believe that it exceeds five miles; do not you know that it is but four miles and a very little bit? - Upon my oath, I do not know how many miles it is; I cannot tell how long I was riding there and coming back.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it is more than four miles and a quarter? - I cannot tell; I never was there before.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it is ten miles? - I do not imagine it can be ten miles.</p>
               <p>Come, Mr. Gifford, was not you taken up for this yourself? - No, I was not, upon my oath; I was not committed for further examination, I was never in custody of an officer about it.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the prisoner Mash, I shall not call upon him to make any defence, there is no evidence at all to affect him.</p>

               <p>On Monday we proposed to meet at Muswell-hill, between one and two; I could not get my business done, I met Mr. Gifford at three, after that I had a mouthfull, of victualls, then we went down to look at these sheep; when we came to the sheep, they were in a lamb house; Gifford went in, and he said to the prisoner Rushin, what do you ask for ten of them? he said, fifteen shillings, or sixteen shillings; Gifford said, here are ten nice half guineas, I will give you for ten of them; he said, you shall not have them; Gifford came out to me, and said, what do you think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210112"></xptr>these skins are worth? I said, not above eighteen pence a-piece; Rushin took them into the field; he came after us, and asked us to have them; there was no answer made for some considerable time; it was near five before they had done; I was talking to the landlord about this house; I told him I should be very glad to embrace the opportunity to have the house; he put down my name; he said, he should be at the brewhouse on the Monday or Tuesday; I went to my father-in-law to enquire about it, as another person had engaged it, and I was taken on Wednesday.</p>

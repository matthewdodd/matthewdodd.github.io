                  </hi>. I live in Huggin-lane, Wood-street, in the front-room second floor of Thomas Burles's house. There is a good lock to my door—the prisoner lives in the back room on the same floor—I went into the hospital on the 24th of September—I am single—my silver watch, a £5 note, and other money, I left locked up in my desk—I came home from the hospital on Sunday afternoon, the 29th of October—I did not examine the room before the next morning—I asked for my desk, and it was where I left it—my life little girl went to lift it, and the lid came up—it was broken—the money and watch were all gone—I got a warrant, and searched the prisoner's premises, and found the note—the room door was not broken open—it was entered by a key—Mary Pearce and my daughter Louisa had the key, both of them are living there—my daughter is not fourteen years old.</p>

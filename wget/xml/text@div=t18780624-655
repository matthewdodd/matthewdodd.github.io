On Sunday morning, 26th May, about 12.45, I was with White and two other constables, who were in front of us, in Goldsmith Street, Vauxhall, which is the roughest neighbour<lb></lb>hood in our division—I saw the prisoner standing against a wall with a woman alongside of him—he said "You b—f—s—s, I should like to lick some of you"—he was a little the worse for drink, but knew what he was about—he rushed across the pavement, threw White down in the gutter, and fell on top of him—I pulled him off, pulled him up, and put him on his legs—he tried to kick me in the lower part of my body, but I put my hand down and caught the kick on my knuckles, which disabled my hand for three weeks—I laid hold of him with my left hand, he twisted himself round and made a violent back-handed blow at my stomach, which caused me to let go of him, and he ran away—a few minutes afterwards I found blood running down my leg, and knew nothing more till I was at the station, where I saw the prisoner—I was taken to the hospital that evening, and was in bed there 11 days—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my coat, waistcoat, trousers, and drawers, they are all cut through.</p>

I was with Smith and was tripped up by the prisoner, who fell on me, and Smith pulled him off—he made a kick at Smith which he stopped with his hand—I saw him strike Smith on the lower part of his body and run away—I followed and a policeman in uniform took up the chase—the prisoner was very violent, and when we took him we were all three thrown down—he had been drinking but knew perfectly well what he was about—when he found we had secured him he said "I have done what I wanted and now you can take me, you b—y f—s—s"—I found these two knives on him—I did not see any blood on them.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am surgeon to the police—I was called to Smith—he had lost a considerable quantity of blood—I found an incised wound about an inch long about an inch from his navel and of considerable depth, but I did not interfere with it as he was in a state of collapse—it was very dangerous—his life was in jeopardy for fire or six days—I have examined these knives—the largest and sharpest is the most pointed, and probably inflicted the wound—it would not have much blood on it as it went through all the clothes—it must have been a violent blow, as neither of the knives is very sharp.</p>

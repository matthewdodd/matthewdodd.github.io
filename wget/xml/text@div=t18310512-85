            , my uncle -On the 4th of May I saw the prisoner three or four doors from the shop, with a writing-desk under his arm; I went to the shop, missed the desk, and went out in pursuit of the prisoner - I saw the Police-constable; we went to the bottom of the street - I did not see the prisoner; the officer went one way, and I another - I then saw the prisoner with the desk; I followed him, but lost sight of him - I went through a public passage, and saw him again in Bagnigge-wells-road; I am quite sure the prisoner is the person I first saw with it - it might be a quarter of an hour from the time I first saw him till I got the desk from him; this is it - it is Mr. Thomas Parker's.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. I saw the prisoner running in Bagnigge-wells-road - he had a razor, but no desk then; a number of persons were running after him - I was in plain clothes, and he ran up to me; I took him - he put the razor into my hand, and said, "For God's sake, let me go - it is only this;" he left his hat in my hand, and got away, as it was raining, and I had my umbrella, but I took him again.</p>
               <p>JESSE PARKER. I am certain he carried the desk - I was behind him, but I know he is the person.</p>

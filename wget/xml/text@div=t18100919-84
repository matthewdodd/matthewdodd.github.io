               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did the prisoner ever account to you for the six guineas - A. He did not; he received the fee on the Friday, and left me on the Saturday, I did not see him until he was apprehended about five weeks afterwards. At the time he left my service there was about a guinea and a few shillings due to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner in the habit of receiving fees, and to balance the fees against his salary. - A. When there was a balance of salary due to him, I let the fee remain in his hand.</p>

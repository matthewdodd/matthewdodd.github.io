On Saturday, the 20th of September, I missed 3 s. from my desk, and in the afternoon another shilling, and between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I got Smith, a neighbour; we marked two shillings, five sixpence, eighteen penny pieces, and ten farthings - she came again on Saturday morning, about half-past six o'clock, and between seven and eight o'clock, I missed two shillings, two sixpences, and 10 1/2 d.; it must have been taken with a false key. I had lost a key of my desk two years ago. I fetched an officer; she was asked to produce her money, which she did after some time, and among it was two shillings, a sixpence, four penny pieces, and a halfpenny, marked. She denied having any key, but one was found upon her, which opened my desk.</p>

            . I am a broker. I marked this money on Saturday night, by Fenn's desire, locked it in the desk, and took the key home with me - there was other money there not marked. I returned at half-past seven o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was sent up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220019"></xptr>stairs; I then opened the desk, and missed two shillings, two sixpences, four penny pieces, and three halfpence, of the marked money, and 1 s. 5 d. of the unmarked money - she was charged with it, and declared she had none but her own. I asked her to produce what she had; she hesitated, but at last produced two shillings, a sixpence, four penny pieces, and five half-pence, marked, and a sixpence unmarked. I asked how she got that money; she said her mistress paid it to her, at seven o'clock on Saturday night - I had not marked it at that time. I said she must have a key of the desk, which she denied. I saw her putting something under her stays, and found it was a key, which opened the desk.</p>

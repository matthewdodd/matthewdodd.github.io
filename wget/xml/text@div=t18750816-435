                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi> 10). Between 11 and 12 o'olook on Saturday night, 23rd July, I placed some constables outside the premises of Messrs. Unwin, obtained the keys and went in to examine the premises, and under one of the counters I found Salmon and Andrews together—turning my light round to the other end of the counter, I saw Martindale stooping down with his head in the counter, but his body pro<lb></lb>duced—they were all three without coats, boots, or hats—I called constable Cole to assist me to take Martindale; I already had hold of the other two—I left a constable in charge of the premises and went to the station with the prisoners—I then returned and found that an entrance had been effected by getting into a disused churchyard, into which Messrs.</p>

               <p>Unwin's premises look—the windows were protected on the inside by iron bars—it appeared to me that the screws at the bottom of one of the bars had been removed, but had been replaced, not screwed home—entrance could be effected by moving back one of those bars—my impression is that without moving the bars, an entrance could be effected, although they were not wide enough for me they were wide enough for lads to get through—inside the window you land in the machine room—at the end there is a passage which leads into the shop—in that passage we found the three prisoners' coats, boots, and hats, which they are now wearing—there was a door at the end of the passage with a glass top, the putty had been taken out and the glass removed with a view to open the bolts, but the door being locked as well, it was forced—in addition to the window being taken out the door was forced—there was a holdfast lying on the ground with the broken glass—there were marks on the door leading to an inner office which corresponded with marks which this screwdriver would make—we found the screwdriver behind the counter, bent as it is now—I found a drawer had been forced which contained postage stamps, and there were a few receipt stamps as well in the drawer—I found about thirty-two receipts stamps on the ground in the middle of the shop where the prisoners had stood before they were taken to the station—they all have "Unwin Brothers" printed on the front of them—the marks on the drawer containing the stamps corresponded with the screwdriver—I found on Salmon, at the station, a metal match box, containing matches and a penknife—I did not know Martindale previously—he made a statement to me at the station—I cautioned him first, and he said "I was drawn into it by the other two"—I asked him how he came to be in the premises, if he was drawn into it, they did not carry him over—he said "When in the place they said 'pocket those pencils'; but I said I would not put them in my pocket lest we should be caught, and I did not want anything found on me."</p>

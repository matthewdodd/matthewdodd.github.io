I have been a soldier in the Bombay establishment—I was invalided, and came home by the ship Carnatic, on the 1st of July—I met with a girl named Sutee, and went with her to a house in Red Lion Court, Poplar—I slept with her all night—I had not been paid off at that time—I received my money on Tuesday, the 4th of July, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—the first thing I did then, was to buy a suit of clothes—I did not drink at all before I bought them—I went that evening to the Red Lion—I saw the prisoner there, and drank there—I do not remember where I then went to, for I was drunk—I did not come to myself for three or four days afterwards—I had received at the bank, on the Tuesday, 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I put into my waistcoat pocket—I know I had my money safe at the Red Lion—I had five sovereigns in a belt, and the rest in my waistcoat pocket, and when I came to my senses some days afterwards, I had no money left.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner then say, "Let us have some of the money," and did you not produce 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and count it into her hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollec<lb></lb>tion of it—I do not recollect saying, "No, I will keep it," and that she re<lb></lb>turned it to me, and said, "Well, keep it yourself"—I have no recollection of coming to London with her, or of buying some stockings for her in London, or of going with her to a cook-shop in Whitechapel to dine, or of inviting a friend whom I met in London to dine with us, or going with that friend to a public-house, and stopping there the best part of the afternoon—I have no recollection of going with the prisoner to a draper's shop, after our return to Poplar, and purchasing several articles for her; or her telling me that she had several things in pledge which she should like to have out, and showing me the tickets—I do not know Newby-place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Jones and your landlady were together looking for a policeman, did you leave them and go into another public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my landlady and Jones got me in the Red Lion, without a coat, and then they gave the prisoner in charge—I have no recollection of the policeman following me into the public-house, or saying I would not go with him—I was quite stupified—I do not know what I said—I do not know whether I told the policeman I would not give her in charge—I do not remember the policeman saying I must give her in charge, or his wanting to take some money from her hand, which she refused to let him have; or going to him, and saying, "What are you going to do with that woman?"—I do not recollect that we were both pushed along to the station, or that when I got there I said to the policeman, "What did you bring us here for?"—I do not know whether I sat for a couple of hours in the station, while the prisoner was locked up, I refusing to give her in charge—they might have kept me in the station till I made the charge if they had liked.</p>

I got my discharge from the army on the 8th of May—I went to lodge at a house in Red Lion-court, Poplar—the prisoner was mis<lb></lb>tress of the house—I was told it was a lodging-house—women used to come there, but the prisoner gave me a room to myself—I was out all day—on the Saturday night the prosecutor came to the house with a girl of the name of Sutee—they came into the sitting-room—I did not see the prosecutor, after Sunday evening, till about half-past-six o'clock on the Tuesday evening, when he came in with the prisoner and another woman, who, I believe, sold fish—he had been drinking—I could not say he was drunk—he sat down on the bed—the prisoner sat on a chair—the other woman sat down close by the door—after some time the prisoner asked if he was going to send for anything to drink—he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out two sove<lb></lb>reigns, a half-sovereign, and two half-crowns—she called me as a witness, and I saw the money—I could not swear it was that money, but I saw it was gold—she went down, and brought up a pint of beer, a pint of cyder, and half-a-pint of rum—all the company drank together—I saw the prosecutor begin to fumble about his pockets, and I heard some money jink in his pockets—the prisoner said, "I think he has more money in his possession"—she got up, put her hand into his pocket, and took out fourteen sove<lb></lb>reigns, and called me as a witness to take notice of it—the prosecutor was not very drunk then, not till after the prisoner went out again—she did not drink anything before she went out, or give him anything—I saw some beer, cyder, and rum poured out all together by Sutee—I could not say whether the prisoner poured any out—I only saw one tumbler handed to the prosecutor, and that was by Sutee—I only saw him drink out of that one tumbler after the money was taken from his pocket—he then threw himself backwards across the cot—the prisoner then went out, and returned in an hour and a half, as nearly as possible—I was in the room all the time—she had showed me the money in her hand before she went out, but she had not said what she meant to do with the fourteen sovereigns—when she came back she asked me to strip the prosecutor and put him to bed—I put him to bed—he went to sleep, and, the prisoner went out—it was then about half-past twelve at night, and she returned about half-past five in the morning—she then awoke him, and they both went out together—she asked him if he was going up to London to buy some things—he said yes; and when the prisoner returned she had some new things with her—she was given into custody about half-past five on Wednesday, I believe by Mrs. Tierney—the prisoner was at that time in a public-house—the policeman called me in, and pointed her out—he asked me whether that was the woman who committed the robbery—I said that was the woman who took the money from Thomas Hickey.</p>

At a quarter before 1 o'clock, on Tuesday, 11th Dec., I was on duty in Newcastle-street, Strand—it was between the night of the 10th and the morning of the 11th—I saw Bestow looking up at the front of Mr. Mumford's house, who is a corndealer, in Newcastle-street—he was standing on the opposite side of the way—I went round to the back of the Olympic, and there met Davis coming to<lb></lb>wards Newcastle-street—he was, perhaps, about twenty-five yards from Bastow—Davis looked at me very hard—I went a few yards further, and I saw Hoys standing up in the path, leaning against the theatre, in the dark—he came out and followed Davis, and they entered Newcastle-street—Moys and Davis joined, and went down on one side of the street, and Bas<lb></lb>tow on the other—they went as far as the Strand—they all three joined together, and went down the Strand towards Temple-bar—I saw another officer, and he and I followed them till we got within three or four yards of them—they then all turned round and looked at us, and all set off running in different directions—I was in uniform—they were in conversation when they separated—Moys ran up a small court opposite the White Hart, be<lb></lb>tween Holywell-street and the Strand; I followed and seized him—he asked me to allow him to stop for a needful purpose, which I did—I brought him into the Strand—we were about a yard of a yard and a half from the houses when he made a sudden spring back, placing his hand to his coat pocket behind—I put my hand behind him, and caught his hand in his right hand coat pocket—he was then over an area that projects a little distance out on the pavement—I found in that pocket 11 skeleton keys, and picklocks, wrapped in this bit of rag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said, "I suppose you are satisfied now"—my brother officer came back, and I said, "Take hold of him"—I then found these two instruments in separate pockets, which will open the lock of a street door when the key is in it, by turning the key round—I also in another pocket found this wrench to take nuts off, and in another pocket these matches—Moys said, "I can give a good account of these"—I told him I should take him to the station, and he might account there—he said, "I was going to do a job for Mr. Griffith, the coffee house keeper in Covent garden"—he was asked where he lived, and he would not tell—I have made inquiries, and there is no such person on the division—I cannot find such a person near Covent-gardan—Bastow was not taken that night, but on the 13th—I saw him in Horsemonger-lane—he saw me and turned back—I followed and took him into custody—I told him the charge, he said I was mistaken—I am quite sure he is the man—I told him I should take him for being concerned with Moys and Davis in having house breaking instru<lb></lb>ments in their possession—he refused to give his address, and said he was a sailor.</p>

On the 24th of July, the prisoner took a second floor furnished of me at sixteen shillings a week; on the 21st of August, in consequence of some information, I went into her apartment to see if the things were there, I then missed all the things mentioned in the indictment, and several more; when we went into the room she forced herself against the door as much as she could, but when we got in she took a knife, and said she would either kill or be killed before she would be taken.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you soon overpowered the woman, and took the knife from her. - A. Yes, we found where part of the things were, we took her to Hatton Garden, she told us the spoons were at the corner of Dean-street, and there we found them; with several other things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner and her sister lived together. - A. I only let the room to her, she brought her sister, and they lived together; the sister came the next day after the prisoner came, the sister laid in there.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner on the 21st of August in the forenoon, I went up stairs and knocked at the door, the prisoner at the bar opened the door, she said she expected us; the prisoner went to a closet, took up a knife, and held it in her hand with the blade towards herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the mischief she intended was against herself, not against you - A. No, I do not think it was, she begged permission to go into the adjoining room where her sister was, lying in bed (she had only lain in a fortnight), I gave her permission, and put my foot against the door, to prevent her from shutting it, she stood behind the door, keeping it close to my foot, she endeavoured to prevent my coming in; some conversation passed between her and her sister, about a moment, I saw their hands pass from one to another, whether there was any thing in it I do not know; then I pushed the door and went in, she said, Oh! Charlotte, this is all through you, if it had not been for you I should not have done this; her sister hung upon her, and to appearance she seemed to be in sits, I got her away and took her to the watchhouse; I went back and searched the apartment, and I found nothing there; at twelve o'clock I took her before the magistrate; when she came near the office, she burst out in tears, she told me that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170060"></xptr>table spoon was pledged at the corner of Dean-street in her sister's name.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

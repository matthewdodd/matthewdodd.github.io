               <p>ANDREW HILL. On the morning of the 27th of June, between three and four o'clock, I had been locked out of my lodgings, and was out all night - I am a <rs id="t18300708-75-viclabel429" type="occupation">journeyman-baker</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What time do you generally go to bed? A.Between eleven and twelve o'clock, but they went to bed earlier that evening; I tried to get in about twelve - I had been with a friend or two at the White Hart; I had not been in any other public-house - the knot of my handkerchief might have come untied; I have known it to do so - I do not know what the expences of a prosecution are - I have heard they are 3s. 6d. a day; I have been four days about this altogether - the handkerchief was tied behind, but might have come untied.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty and met the prisoner with two others at the top of Bunhill-row; I went up to him, and said, "Halloo, young fellow! where are you going?" he said to bathe; I said,"What have you about you?" he said Nothing - I took off his hat, and saw a red handkerchief with a little sprig on it in the hat; I gave it to him, and told him to take care of himself, or else I should have him again - he went away; I went to the Police-station, and heard of this robbery; the prosecutor came in, and described the handkerchief and the prisoner - I went out and took him in about ten minutes; he was then alone - the prosecutor said he was the man; there was no handkerchief there then - the prosecutor seemed perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.The prisoner had plenty of time to have gone off altogether? A. Yes - it is very unlikely that I shall get 14s. by this job, they do not like to give so much, they think 1s. 6d. a day enough; I was here the Session before - I had 3s. 6d. a day then; I have heard they have cut us down - I did not detain the prisoner at first, as I thought it was very unlikely I should find the owner of the handkerchief; he was not a respectable boy - I asked if he had any thing about him, I did not mention a handkerchief; it was a common pattern -I have seen many like it - it appeared as if it had been folded and round a man's neck; it was in a lump.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. About a quarter past three o'clock that morning I met the prosesecutor and the prisoner (to the best of my belief) linked together very close, up Whitecross-street - they turned through a court; I had seen the prosecutor three quarters of an hour before, and supposed he must have got drunk since - they got out of my sight, then the prosecutor came and said he had his handkerchief taken from his neck, and I gave information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the person before who was with the prosecutor? A. To the best of my knowledge I had seen him often before that night, and every hour of the night, because I am on the same beat; to the best of my knowledge I had seen him in bad company - I had no charge against him before; I was one of the old watchmen and a street-keeper.</p>

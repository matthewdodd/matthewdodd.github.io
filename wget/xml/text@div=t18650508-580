               <p>at a fruit-stall; I had seen the prisoner before that, and spoken to him as he went by concerning things he had done—I know him well; I saw him about a quarter of an hour before, with three others, loitering up and down the Borough—I kept my eyes on them—I saw the prosecutrix go up to the barrow, and the prisoner standing on her left side; two of the other men were standing behind her, and one in front—I saw her catch hold of the prisoner; he ran across the road, and the lady had hold of his coat crying out "Stop thief"—some carts stood in the road, which prevented him going down a court at the side of our shop—he turned round, hit the lady in the face and then ran down the court—about two or three hours afterwards the prisoner came and said, "You had better mind your own business and not look after me, or else I will give you a good thrashing for watching us about"—I saw him again in the evening with two others—they came with sticky and stayed for half an hour in the coffee-shop, next door to our shop, wait<lb></lb>ing for me; I declined to go out—I have known the prisoner five or six years; I could not be mistaken in his identity.</p>

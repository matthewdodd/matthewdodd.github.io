                  </hi>. I was a corporal in the 1st batallion of the 5th regiment of foot, quartered at Colchester—I left on 14th September last, without permission; and came up to London; I got there about 9 o'clock that night—I was at that time dressed in my regimentals; my number in the regi<lb></lb>ment was 534; I had on a scarlet tunic, a forage cap, blue regimental trowsers, white belt, and a black stock; there was a bayonet holder on the belt—on Saturday, 24th September, I met a man named Collins, in Fleet-street; I had never seen him before—we went to several publichouses together; it was between 10 and 11 when I first met him, and I was with him till 3 o'clock in the afternoon; I left him at a public-house called the "Three Tons," kept by a man named Baker, in West Harding-street, near Farringdon-street—he left me outside the door—I slept at that house that night—I had never been in that house before—I was still in my regimental dress—Collins came the next day, Sunday, again at about 10 o'clock; he was there when I came down, standing in the tap-room with another man of the name of Grieves—they both left the house together, and left me there; they returned in about half-an-hour with the prisoner—he had a bundle of clothes with him, it was a civilian's dress, the clothes I have on now—I took off my regimentals and put on the civilian's dress—at the time I was</p>

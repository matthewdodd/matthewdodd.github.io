                  </hi>. I am senior curate of St George's, Hanover-square—I was acquainted with my predecessor, Mr. Witham—the first time I saw the prisoner was in the vestry of St George's Church—Mr. Witham had charge of the district in which he lived—after Mr. Witham's death I became senior curate—that was two or three months previous to September—the prisoner then called on me very frequently, and I have been to his house—he came to raise money to purchase an instrument to keep his shoulder blade in its place—he said that if he used the instrument con<lb></lb>stantly, he should get sufficient strength to earn a livelihood at light labour—I told him that if any benevolent person would send me a subscription for him, I should be glad to take charge of it—he said that he had had a contribution of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Lord Palmerston, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Cowper, the First Commissioner of the Board of Works—after a little time he brought me an instrument which he said he had been measured for, and that Mr. Lindsay had made it, and he was to pay 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I objected to it as not being worth 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he brought it to me to induce me to give him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he having collected 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on my objecting to it, he said that the springs were covered with chamois leather, and that Mr. Lindsay had told him it was a very valuable instrument—I gave him no money on that occasion—he said that some alterations were to be made in it; and I said, "If you bring me the receipt, or bill, and show me the instrument again, I will give you the balance you require"—he afterwards brought a receipt which I objected to, as it was "By cash 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., balance 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. additional"—he told me that he would get from Mr. Lindsay a receipt for the entire sum, and afterwards brought me this receipt for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Mr. Lindsay's bill-head—it is, "Estimated cost of instrument, to J. Ridgway, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I would not psy it on that, and</p>

               <p>then he brought me this, "To making instrument for shoulder, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Received, J. Lindsay"—he said that he had got that receipt from Mr. Lindsay; and I took a sovereign from my purse and gave him; and as I had not got more, I authorized Mr. Evans, the clerk, to pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. additional—he said that part of the money which he had paid Mr. Lindsay he had borrowed of his landlord, which I afterwards found to be untrue—I asked him to give me the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had collected, and to tell Mr. Lindsay to send me in his bill, and I would pay the entire sum—he said that he should prefer paring the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. himself, because, as he was a very poor man, he might induce Mr. Lindsay to abate a little of his charges, or to make him a little present—that was before I gave him the order for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a truss-maker, of 37, Ludgate-street—about three months ago the prisoner came to me, and said that he came from Dr. John Ogle, of the West-end, for me to examine his shoulder for an in<lb></lb>strument, and give an estimate of the cost, and that the doctor wished him to have one of the most perfect construction—I told him it would be 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked me to write a letter to Dr. Ogle, which I did at the same time; and he said that Dr. Ogle wished me to enclose an invoice—I did so—this is it—this "Estimated cost" is my writing—I asked him if a card would do as well, and he said, "No"—a day or two afterwards he said he had lost the whole, and wanted another bill-head—being busy at the time, I gave him another, but there was no writing on it—this receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., signed, "Mark John Lindsay," is not written by me or by my authority—this one for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed, "J.

               <p>Q. Are you sure that he lifted the window up? - A. The window was lifted up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - A. I did not; I saw a man's arms put through the window; he took the hat and key; I immediately made away to the door that leads into Neptune-street; I turned to the right that leads into Wellclose-square; I saw him run from the window towards Wellclose-square; I halloaed out stop thief, and he was stopped; when I came up to him, I found the hat and key upon him; I brought him back to where he took the hat from, and my master insisted upon sending for a constable for him; I gave him in the charge of Dunbar.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this window, how long had you seen it before? - A. Before it was lifted up, it might be about a quarter of an hour, because I laid some halfpence in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the window was down? - A. I am certain that the window was down; it communicates to the street; we never open it, on account of having a safe close by it, and it has communication to the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you leave it in such a manner that any body may open it, as it leads to a safe, and put money there, that any idle boy may put his hand in and take it? - A. There is a little kind of a ledge at the bottom of the window, they cannot see the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you keep in that safe; I should think this window should be open, in order to keep it cool in hot weather; on the 27th of August it was warm weather? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you wanted to keep the provisions safe, you ought to keep it as cool as possible; are you certain sure the window was not open? - A. I am sure the cook had not opened it, we have no other servant there but the master's neice; I am sure the window was down, we cannot go past from the kitchen to the cellar without passing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this man? - A. I never saw him before; he has an ancient father that he takes care of, I hope you will be as favourable as you can; I took him before a Magistrate in hopes he would send him on board a man of war; it was very tempting to be sure, there was a blind to the window, this blind was gone to be mended, and outside you can see every transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the window open? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming across Wellclose-square between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock at night, when I heard the cry of stop thief; I was stopped by a man, who is not the man that gave the evidence against me; I am charged with the hat, which I know nothing at all about.</p>
               <p>Q. The hat was found upon you? - A. This is not the man that stopped me, that gave evidence against me now; this man came up afterwards with the hat, and challenged me with it; I know no more of the hat than Adam.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Who was it that stopped him? - A. A man that belongs to the West-India dock; he went to Shadwell Office; instead of that he was taken to Lambeth-street-office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had not the hat at the time when the man came up to me, nor do I know the man that stopped me, no more than a child that is not born of his mother; I know nothing of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Post-office—On 22d February I received instructions to send a letter to the Post-office in the Borough—I made up a test-letter—I put in it a half-sovereign, two shil<lb></lb>lings, and five postage stamps—I marked them all—I put the whole of the coins in a slip card, secured with a piece of paper—I put them all in the letter—the half-sovereign was fastened, so as to prevent its slipping out of the letter—I sealed the letter with black—it was directed to Mary Johnson, Dartford, Kent—I gave the letter to Mr. Clare, and instructed him to post it at the South Eastern District Office in the Borough—if it were posted there before 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it ought to have arrived at the General Post-office about 35 minutes past 4—when the bag arrived that ought to have had that letter, I examined it to see if that letter addressed to Dart-ford was there, and it was not there—the next bag arrived about 35 minutes past 5—I examined that also, and the letter was not there—finding that the letter had not come, I went to the district office in the Borough, in company with Mr. Clare and an officer of the name of Smee, about half-past 6 o'clock—when I got there the prisoner was brought into a private room where I way, and I told him I wished to make inquiries respecting a letter addressed to Dartford—I asked him if he knew anything about it—he said he did not—I then asked him if he had any money in his pockets—he admitted that he had, and I then directed Smee, the constable, to search him, and from one of his pockets Smee took some silver, and from another pocket the half-sovereign which I had enclosed in the letter—I told the prisoner that that half-sovereign had been enclosed in the letter that I was inquiring for, and I asked him where he got it—he said, "I brought it from home"—I said, "When?"—he said, "This morning"—I said, "It was in the letter about 4 o'clock this afternoon"—he said, "Indeed, Sir"—this is the half-sovereign—while I was still at the post-office the letter was shown me—this is it.</p>

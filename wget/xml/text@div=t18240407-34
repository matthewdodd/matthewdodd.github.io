            . I live in Broad-street-buildings. In November, 1822, I owed Messrs. Coopers eight guineas, and paid a cheque for that sum to some person; I cannot swear to the prisoner. I have destroyed the cheque - I have the banker's book, which I examined by the cheques, and find it entered there. I produce the receipt the person gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear that very cheque was returned, or do you speak of it in common with others - A. I cannot recollect the particular cheque, but I have checked off every payment, and this among them.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is there not an alteration in the figures of the receipt - A. Yes; it brings to my mind that the bill was made out for nine guineas; I begged him to get it corrected, which was done, and on returning I gave him the money. I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>
               <p>(Bill and receipt read: - signed E. S. Mann.)</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. This bill and receipt are both in the prisoner's writing.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Coopers. On the 27th of February last, I had some conversation with the prisoner about some deficiences in the cash account - I did not threaten or promise him anything. We went over a book in which a list of outstanding debts are kept, to ascertain the names and amounts of what he had received; he admitted the receipt of this among several other sums; he read them from the book. He requested me to take a letter to the prosecutors, and read me a copy of what he intended to write; he asked what I expected they would do - I said I could not tell, for the amount was very large.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the prosecutors' employ - A. About a year and a quarter. I was very intimate with the prisoner; I went to him by the direction of the prosecutors - he had been seriously ill, but was considerably better. I saw him in his bed-room, and took the book to him at his request; he read from it himself what he had received, and I wrote it down; the amount was 218 l. 7 s. 0 d. I held him out no inducement. I went to him in consequence of a letter he had written to them; I produced the letter to him; it was in his handwriting. I told him the letter would explain my business.</p>

               <p>To Mr. H. Cooper,</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir, What Mr. Harriet says is correct, and had you been kind enough to have called on me, I could explain it to you, but I could not to Mr. Page.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If there are deficiences it must arise from the inaccuracy of the books, or from the number of persons continually in the receipt of money; in the multiciplity of business, it is very possible that I might have forgotten sums of money, or paid it in trifling disbursements.</p>

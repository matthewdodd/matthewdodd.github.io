                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock manufacturer, and live is Finsbury-place. The prisoner was my errand-boy for about three months, and left me on the 20th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, when in consequence of suspicions that he had committed a trifling fraud, I said "I think you have in your pocket what I accuse you of," and in putting my hand into his pocket, I found a key—I said, "What is that?"—he said, "Only a brass key"—I pulled it up, and found a chain attached to it, he resisted my pulling it out, but I did, and found a watch to it, which had been in my care to repair, and which I had missed a few days before—he begged me to forgive him, and he would not be guilty of the like again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He did not give me any warning till he tool the watch from me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had given him a week's notice—he was to leave on the Saturday night he knew well he was to leave—I do not think he took the watch to show to his companions—I had missed it some days—he had plenty of opportunity to have sold or pawned it, as he had been out several times.</p>

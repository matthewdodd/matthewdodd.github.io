I took these pots from the prisoner Hume, one was in each pocket, under her gown - I found her going to her own apartments, in Flower and Deane-street - I asked her what she had got - she said, "Nothing" - I felt the pots, and she begged me not to expose her in the street.</p>

            . On the 29th of January, I was at the Castle public-house, Goodman's-stile - I saw Shepley there - he took a quart-pot, and put it into his hat - I told the publican of it - Shepley stopped about five minutes longer - he then went away - I followed him with Mr. Crutch, the publican - we stopped him at the corner of Chichester-street - Mr. Crutch took his hat off, and found the pot in it - he was liberated - on the 6th of February, I was going down Crutched-friars, and saw Hume standing at the corner of Savage-gardens - I knew her by her coming to the office to give Shepley a character - I then went into the Cheshire Cheese, and saw Shepley sitting with four or five pots round him - I came out - he came out, and crossed over to Hume, they went on, and stopped at a corner were he gave her something.</p>

               <p>Hume's Defence. I was not at the Cheshire Cheese at all that morning - I am the wife of this prisoner, but Hume was my maiden name - I wished my husband to state that, because I wish to take my share of the trouble.</p>

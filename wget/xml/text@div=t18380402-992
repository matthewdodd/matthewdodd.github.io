I know Curnock's caru—on the 6th of March, at six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man in Horrox-street, each with a cart loaded with bricks—there was a butcher's cart against a stable gate, and they were shifting it away that they might shoot the bricks—Townsend first shot his load of bricks, against the stable door, and then the other man shot his bricks down—I know they was both Curnock's carts—I took up one of the bricks in my hand, after they were shot out, and there was the letter A on it, which is the same sort brick that were used on the works—I have no doubt of the prisoner being one of the men—the carts were loaded with five hundred each—I told my foreman of it, and brought him to the place where the bricks were shot.</p>

             - he called on me first, in consequence of a letter, which I addressed to him - I was not at home. He called next day; he said he came in consequence of an advertisement about a situation, which I had replied to - he gave me his card (producing it)</p>
               <p>"Mr. Mitford, No. 9, Manchester-buildings." He said he had not interest himself, but it was through a friend that he could procure a situation - he was merely the agent. I had several interviews with him on the subject - he requested some sort of security as a pledge of my sincerity in the transaction, provided I should obtain the situation. This did not pass at the first interview. He required that I should deposit a sum of money in the Bank, and take a post bill, payable to my order; this was the first proposition he made - he said he thought it would be the easiest mode, and attended with no expence, and would be most satisfactory to myself; as the post bill would be payable to my order, and could not get into circulation without my endorsement, and in the event of my not procuring the situation, he would return the Bank post bill to me. In consequence of this, I paid 50 l. into the bank, and took the Bank post bill in question. (Looking at a paper) All except the figures here are my writing; it is the ticket I gave to procure the bill. read. (Mrs. E. Rogerson, payable to J. L. Rogerson or order 50 l). On the evening of the day I procured the bill, he called on me. I said I objected to give the Bank post bill out of my possession, because in the event of my not getting the situation, I should have some difficulty in getting it back. He said I could have no difficulty in getting it back, because being unendorsed it could be of no use to him. I gave it to him unendorsed, and gave him no authority to endorse it. He left me, saying he would see me in a few days. This was on the first of May. I did not see him after till he was apprehended. Not seeing him according to appointment, I went to Manchester-buildings on the Monday, but could not find him. On the following day, the 7th of May, I stopped the bill. He never called after receiving the bill. I received a variety of letters on the subject (looking at some) these are them - (looking at the bill) this is the bill I gave him. I never procured any other bank post bill in my life. My name is on the back of it - it was neither written by me or my authority. My real signature is at the bottom; as having received the amount at the Bank afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was not the name of Bloomfield mentioned by the prisoner - A. In the course of casual conversation, at one interview that name was mentioned. He did not say it was through Bloomfield's interest that it was to be obtained. He only said Bloomfield was sporting his figure about the town, and he understood he was a relative of Sir Benjamin's; but never said he was to procure the situation, or that he wanted it to deposit with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not place the bill in his hands as part of the consideration you was to pay him if he procured the situation - A. It was given to shew that money was forthcoming, and provided I got the situation I was to indorse it, and if not it was to be returned. I should have asked him to return it to me to be indorsed if I got the situation. I understand they frequently pass by mistake without being indorsed. I can swear to the bill by the number,

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you give the prisoner the same Bank post bill you received at the Bank that day - A. I did, I never had any other made payable to myself.</p>

He then begged my pardon, and said, Yes, he did recollect me. I asked why he did not come to Mr. Rogerson, according to his letters; he said he had done that which made him afraid to come to the house, and could not come, unless I promised him protection, and then he would call and pay some part of the money. I walked up as far as the corner of Orchard-street with him, and asked him for his address; he said it was not convenient to give it me, but he would call on Saturday and see Mr. Rogerson; we parted.</p>

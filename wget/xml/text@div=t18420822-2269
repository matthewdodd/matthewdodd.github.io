                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas John Turnbull, of Whitecross-place, Shoreditch. Porter lodged with his mother at my house for six weeks. On Saturday, the 2nd of July, I had a silver and a metal watch, hanging in the kitchen, against the wainscot—I saw them safe at one o'clock—the silver watch had a gold seal and a steel chain—the metal watch had only a ribbon—at six o'clock I missed them both, also a tea<lb></lb>spoon, a pencil-case, and a knife—I had some suspicion—I went up imme<lb></lb>diately to Porter, and found he was in bed alone—I looked at him, and saw he was not asleep, though his eyes were shut—I said, "George, what have you done with the things you have taken out of the kitchen?"—he said, "I have not been down stairs since I came up last night"—I sent for his mother, who was nursing a friend of mine, and she gave him in charge—he cried very much—when he was at the office, he said he brought some little boy in the house to take them away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Porter</hi>. I did not let the boy in to steal the things, and I did not say so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 20.) On the 10th of July, I took Porter at Mount Pleasant, East-road, City-road—his mother was present—I told him I belonged to the police, and he was charged with stealing two watches and some other things—he said, "I was persuaded by Wil<lb></lb>liam Brandon; we opened the door, and took the things"—I took him to the station, and went in pursuit of Drake—I took him about one o'clock the following morning—I told him it was for being concerned with Porter and Brandon in stealing some things from Mr. Turnbull—he said, "I never stole them; I was not there, I pledged the watch, and gave them half the money."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 10th of July, Brannan gave Porter to me—I took him to the station, and then went for Mrs. Turnbull—there was a charge made against Porter for stealing two watches and other things—he said he should not have done it but for another boy named Brandon—that his mother was out, nursing, and Brandon asked him if he could come to sleep there, and he would give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—he then asked him if there was any thing he could steal in the drawers, and he said he did not like to do that—that, next morning, they got up at four o'clock, went to the kitchen, and Brandon took the watches out—when the prisoners were brought before the Magistrate, Drake said he received the watch from Brandon, and pawned it at Woolwich.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father-in-law, John Trimbey, who keeps the Duke's Head, Putney—Thursday, 29th September, was the day of the rowing-match for the Championship of the Thames—about half-past 4 o'clock on that afternoon, some one, who I believe to be the prisoner, came to our house—I served him with a glass of stout—he gave me a bad shilling—I said "My good man, it is a bad shilling"—he gave me a good one; I gave him change, and he left—I believe Stirling, the police-constable, was in the house at this time, but I did not know it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I ask you for stout? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe you did—I cannot swear to you—there were other persons in front of the bar, but not where you were—the two constables were by you—I was not taking other money then—I did not disfigure the shilling, or bend it—I knew it merely by the feel, but that was quite enough for me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, V</hi> 289). On Thursday afternoon, 29th Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was on duty at the Duke's Head, Putney, where the last witness lives with her father—I was in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner come in—he called for a glass of half-and-half and a pickwick—Mrs. Trimbey served him—I saw him put down a shilling, which she picked up, and directly said, "This is a bad one; if you come here again I will have you locked up"—he directly paid for it with a good shilling, and received his change out of it—I followed him out of the house—he went round to the back of the house, where there are places to sit down—he was not in this garden place two seconds—he merely walked in, turned round, and came out again—he then walked along the main road, till he came opposite Putney church—there was a crowd there—he stood there three or four minutes, looking about him, and then went up into the White Lion, kept by Mr. Kirby—I followed close be<lb></lb>hind him, and stood at the side of two gentlemen that were standing at the side of the bar—he called for a glass of half-and-half, and was served with it by Mrs. Kirby—he gave a shilling into her hand—she directly went to the till to change it—I collared the prisoner, and called out to Mrs. Kirby to look at the shilling, and see whether it was bad or not—she turned round, looked at it, and gave it into Mr. Kirby's hand—it was never out of my sight—he bent it, and gave it to me—I then took the prisoner in custody; took him into the tap-room, searched him, and found on him three sixpences and thirteen pence in copper—he said that he had taken it in the way of a bet—going to the station he said he had received five shillings from a man in London, and he supposed this must be one of them—he did not say any<lb></lb>thing about the railway-station to me—he did not say anything more that I can recollect.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Lion at Putney—on 29th September there was a race there—saw the prisoner at my house—Stirling, who was there in plain clothes, said to my wife, "Look at that shilling"—I was stand<lb></lb>ing close to her—she said, "It is bad"—I said, "Give it to me"—he gave it to me—I looked at it, bent it, and gave it to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you receive the money from me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, from Mrs. Kirby—she gave it to me, not to the barmaid—the constable did not say, "What money did this man give?" I did not bring the money into the tap-room; I gave it to the constable at the bar; there were twenty people, I dare say, there at the time; there are two tills to my counter; I will swear Mrs. Kirby did not give the money to the barmaid—I was standing close to my wife, looking on; I was doing nothing at that moment—the shilling never went into the till—you did not ask for a glass of half and half and a pipe of tobacco—Mrs. Kirby drew the beer for you and received the money—you only had one glass.</p>

When the policeman asked the barmaid what money I had given, she said, "Which man do you mean?" and she turned over the money in her hand, and then one was taken out and given to Mr. Kirby, and then they swore that it was the one I gave them.</p>

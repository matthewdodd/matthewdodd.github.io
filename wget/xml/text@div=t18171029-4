On the 7th of October, she was going to leave me - I had no other female servant; about four o'clock in the afternoon I went out, leaving my cash-box in the parlour cupboard, the door was open; it contained two 10l. and ten 1l. bank-notes, and about 26l. 18s., in gold and silver; I generally keep the box there, the box was locked; the prisoner must have seen me open it; I saw it safe just before I went out; I returned before five o'clock and missed it. I had left the prisoner in the house, and found her there. I asked her if she had seen the cash-box anywhere? she said she had not, nor did she know where it was. In the course of the evening I went to Marlborough-street Office, and got Plank, the officer, I saw him search her box - She was present, and still denied any knowledge of it. Nothing was found there-it was about eight o'clock in the evening; she left about nine o'clock. I paid her her wages, and set a person to watch her home (he is not here). In consequence of information which I received next morning, I got a search-warrant, and went with Plank to execute it, to No. 16, Great Ormond-yard, where her husband,

            , lodges, the prisoner was not at home when we got there - We only found some grocery there; we came down stairs, and went to No.15, the next house, to watch her return. In about an hour I saw her coming across the yard by herself - She had a basket in one hand and a bundle in the other; it was about three o'clock in the afternoon; she came into the room where we were; she put the basket in the cradle, and the bundle on the table; the officer told her what we had come about, searched her person, and found two Investigator's tickets, a bill of parcels, and a bill of exchange, which were mine, and were in the box when I put it in the cupboard - I saw them there half an hour before. Plank opened the bundle, which contained grocery; he asked her if the basket was her's? she said it was; he took a parcel of bank notes out of it, some cash, and a bill of exchange. I cannot speak to the cash (looks at the notes), they are the same I saw taken out of the basket. Here is a 1l. note which has the name of Mr. Thomas, Berwick-street, Soho; and another with the name of Crankwell, Wardour-street, for 1l.; another 10l. note, with the name of Jender, Berwick-street - they were all in my box at the time, and all have my shopman's handwriting on them. There is another 10l. note which has my own hand-writing on it. All the notes found in her possession are mine, and were in the box at the time. We found the box at Hardcastle's, in Berwick-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR, MARSHAM. I have five shopmen. I am certain that all the notes were in the box at the time. The prisoner is a married woman. She remained in the house until nine o'clock that evening. One of the 10l. notes has my own hand-writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q.When you saw her come into the room, you told her you came to search her - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 7th of October, I went to the prosecutor's house to search the prisoner. I made a slight search - I did not search her person; I found nothing in her box. The next day I went with the prosecutor to No.16, Great Ormond-yard, where her husband lived. I found nothing there. I then went to No.15, and waited to watch her in-her husband's mother kept that house. In about an hour we saw her coming towards the house. I went out and called her in; I told her I suspected she knew something of the robbery - She knew I was an officer by seeing me the night before. She had a basket and bundle. She said she knew nothing of it. The bundle contained grocery - She came into the house willingly. I searched her person, and desired her to turn her pockets out. I found two Investigator's tickets, a bill of exchange, and a bill of parcels, all of which the prosecutor claimed. She still said she knew nothing of the robbery. I searched the bundle, and went to the basket - I asked her if it was her's? she said, yes. On opening it I found about 26l. in cash, and the notes now produced. The prosecutor immediately recognized the notes as his. The first I pulled out he said was his property - They were in the basket which she had in her hand. She appeared very sorry, and told me where she had left the cash-box; I neither threatened nor promised her - She said it was in Berwick-street, and told me the house - I went there and received it from the person she told me to apply to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What induced her to tell you where the box was - A. I asked her. I said she must know where it was - She told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you search her slightly - A. I knew the property was not about her, as she would not keep it in her possession, and if I had told her she was suspected, the property would not have been recovered. I told Mr. Booth that some stranger must have crept into the house and taken it out.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it probable she would convey it away - A. Yes. I sent a person to watch her home.</p>

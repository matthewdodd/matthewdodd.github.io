                  </hi>. I deal in birds, and live in Old-street, in the parish of St. Luke—I am the occupier of the house, and dwell there. on Sunday the 25th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, a knock came at the door—my wife and myself were the only persons in the house—my wife went to the door in consequence of my son ringing at the bell—I went down stairs after my wife—my son said he had found the door open, and there was somebody in the shop—I opened the door, and found four of the pens in the shop had been stripped—I went into the back yard, and found the hens and a pair of pigeons which had been removed, in a bag, another bag empty, and a pair of doves, and two bantams loose, as just dropped out of it—they had been in the pens in the shop before—the thieves must have got in by means of a key which had been taken away a few nights before—they could not have got in in any other way but at the street door</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Anderson-buildings, City-road. I went to my father's house about eight o'clock on this evening, and found the street door open—I went into the shop, and found somebody had been there—I called a policeman, and we went into the back yard, and. discovered the birds and things lying about there in different directions—the police<lb></lb>man went round one way, and I got on the wall, and met Wade on the top of the wall, which is fourteen feet high—I secured him—Robinson came up behind Wade on the wall, and the policeman took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw Wade coming along the wall behind Mr. Castang's house, and Robinson was coming along at the time I took them—this key was brought to the station-house by a witness, who is ill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wade's Defence</hi>. I went to Mr. Castang's house about half-past seven o'clock—Mrs. Castang was at the door—she told me thieves were in the house, and they had gone into the yard—knowing Mr. Castang before, having worked for him for three or four years, I went through the passage into the yard, and climbed up the wall, but saw no one—I was there ten minutes when young Mr. Castang caught hold of me and hallooed out, "I have got him."</p>

On Wednesday, the 29th of October; I saw the prisoner there; I had seen him on the Sunday before; he came about half-past three o'clock that day, and took up a telescope; I heard the money-drawer open, and challenged the prisoner with it; I opened the drawer, and missed four shillings -I am quite sure the prisoner took it; there had been four shillings in the till, and three or four sixpences.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.How many persons were in the tap-room? A. My uncle and a young man were sitting in a little recess, playing at cribbage; the prisoner took up a telescope - I had my back to the till; the prisoner was by my side, looking through the telescope; it is a house of pretty much business - it was daylight; I am not the only person who has access to the till; sometimes my uncle goes to it, and sometimes Mr. Biggs, who was in the house them - all money taken from customers is thrown in the usual way, into this till; the till is opened every time money is put in; it never happened to me, in the hurry of business, to leave that till open; I never saw the prisoner till the Sunday before - he was in the bar; he appeared a very respectable man; after I took the money from him, and my uncle had sent for an officer, he said it was his own money - he had a glass of gin before dinner, and paid my uncle for it; when there is about one pound of silver in the till, I take it out; I had taken out change for a sovereign, and left only some sixpences in; I then took 4s. of a gentleman, and put that in - the prisoner was not given in charge then; my uncle could not find an officer, and he turned him out, and told him to go about his business; he was not struck and ill-used, neither in the house nor out of the house, to my knowledge; he returned in the evening, of his own accord, with two officers - I did not hear him desire my uncle, if he had any charge, to give him into custody; my uncle went up stairs with them - I was in the bar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before had you been at the till? A. Ten or twelve minutes; I heard the till open, and took the money from the prisoner's hand.</p>

            . I keep the house; the prisoner came into my bar, took up the telescope, and went to the window, near the till; I was sitting in a recess, in conversation with a young man; I saw my niece rise hastily from her seat, and challenge the prisoner with taking money out of the till - I rose up, and saw my niece take four 4s. 6d. from his hand; I called out, "Send for an officer!" but an officer could not be found - I kept the prisoner some time, and then told him to go about his business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What were you doing? A. I was having a game at cribbage with a person in the recess; my niece sat with her back to the prisoner - she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040043"></xptr>could not see him as she sat; she was sitting partly with her back to the till: after my niece took the money from his hand, he said it was his own; he had paid for a glass of gin and water about one o'clock - he gave me a shilling, and I gave him a sixpence; I did not notice whether he had any more silver in his hand; this took place about three o'clock; he returned with two Police officers in the evening, and said, if I had any charge, to give him into custody - that was not said in the presence of my niece; they went up stairs with me; I did not ill-use the man, and call out to a mob outside that he was a thief - two of the persons who ill-used him have been punished for it; I made my complaint against the prisoner on the 21st of November; I went to the office to answer a charge he made against me - he summoned me up for 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When did you take him before the magistrate? A. On the 21st of November; I knew the whole of this transaction from my niece; I did not make an accusation against him till I came before a magistrate, because I was aware of the expense and trouble of it.</p>

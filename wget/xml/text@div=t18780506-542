               <p>to drink"—I left the van in charge of the boy and went to a public-house at the corner of Queen Street and Cannon Street, which could be seen from the van—a man like Jones was there, but I cannot swear to him, as I only saw his side-face—Smith asked me what I would have to drink—I said "A drop of beer"—he said "Have something short"—I said "I don't drink spirits"—I had half-a-pint of beer—he asked me where Smith was—(we have a man named Smith but not on our floor)—I said that he was out—he asked if he was at Willow Walk—I said "Yes"—that is the London, Brighton, and South Coast goods station—he asked where I was going—I said that I was doing my col<lb></lb>lection—he said "If you can get a case or two we will open them and have ready money down"—(the other man said nothing but he could hear that)—I told him I could not, and returned to my van, leaving them there—I told the boy what had occurred and spoke to Mr. Wood, my foreman, the same night—I next saw the prisoners in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 124, Spa Road, Bermondsey—I first saw the prisoners together about the last day or two of February in Thames Street, and I have seen them almost every day till I gave them in charge, in Southwark Street, Spa Road, Commercial Road, Watling Street, Queen Victoria Street, and close to my office—I have watched them and followed them frequently—I have seen them with men in my employ, who are here as witnesses, Murphy, Beaton, Jenkins, and ten or twelve other servants of mine, sometimes when they had loads and sometimes when they were going for loads—early in March I saw them talking to Jenkins, I think it was near the Crown public-house, where they get their coffee or beer of a morning—my business is receiving valuable goods at railway<lb></lb>stations and conveying them to railway stations—at the beginning of April I spoke to Beaton, my carman, and in consequence of what he told me I cautioned my men about having the prisoners hanging about them, and on 3rd April I saw the prisoners opposite Spa Road for a quarter of an hour, and then gave them in charge, as Jones got on the wheel of my empty van and Smith was alongside it on the pavement—I charged them with inciting my men to rob me—they said that they had not done any<lb></lb>thing—I took them to my yard, and several of the carmen identified them both.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and have been in Mr. Taylor's employ about 12 months—I first saw the prisoners about two months ago at the Crown, in Spa Road, one morning before 7—Jones asked where I was going, I said "To the yard"—he said "I will wait for you to come out"—they remained there and I was in the yard about an hour—when I came out they were waiting outside, and Jones asked me where I was going. I said "To the Bottle Works, Eyre's Quay, to get a load"—he said "You are no use to us this morning"—about the middle of the same week I saw them both again in the street in Spa Road—I was with my van; Jones asked me where I was going, I said "To the Chatham and Dover Line;" he asked me if he could ride with me in my van; I said "No, certainly not"—he said "If we meet you down the road will you let us have one of the cases, and we will open it for you, and take the goods out and do it up again neatly, and no one will know it has been opened?"—I said "No, certainly not, I have heard of too many carmen being in trouble through that sort of case; I cannot do that, certainly not"—Jones could hear what was said, but I don't think he said anything—on another occasion I was going to Horsleydown with my van for some skins—both the prisoners were there, and Smith asked me if I would have something to drink; I said "I do not mind"—a young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> who I knew was with them, Tracey, who works at the firm—Tracey asked me as well to come, and I went with them to a house in Horsleydown and had something to drink—Smith asked where I was going; I said "Over the water for some hides"—he asked if it was any good his waiting for me; I said "No, it will be no use," but he followed me to Davis's Wharf—I had not to get hides, but I told them so to keep them from coming after me—before that day I had seen them both in Thames Street; I was drinking some beer in a public-house, and Jones asked me if I would have some of what he was drinking—I had some of it and went on with my own, and had something to eat and went out—he then asked me what I was going to load, I told him I did not know—he said "Is it any good my waiting for you?" I said "No," and went away—Smith heard what Jones said—I saw them either four or five times, and two or three times were in Spa Road, but I have also seen them hanging about of a morning near the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been Mr. Taylor's carman about 18 months—about two months ago I was driving my van in St. Thomas Street, Borough, and saw the prisoners coming in the opposite direction—one of them whistled to me—I turned round, and not Knowing them, drove on—Smith got on the shaft of the van and asked me to get down—I did so—he called me on one side and asked me to go to a public-house with them—Jones was standing on one side—I said "No," as I was going to the Brighton Railway, but when I returned I would—I unloaded, and stopped there about a quarter of an hour, thinking they would go away—I then trotted out of the Brighton booking-office quite fast because I did not want to have anything to do with them—I went to the South<lb></lb>Eastern Railway booking-office, Tooley Street, and before I got off the shaft I saw Smith outside the office at the tail of the van—he asked what I was frightened of I said "Nothing"—he said "You are frightened of getting <hi rend="italic">sneaked"</hi>—I had told him before that that I was going to the docks, and he said "Let me work a case for you"—I said "No"—Jones heard that—I also met them two days afterwards in Spa Road, and on Saturday in the Commercial Road—I have not seen them speak to other carmen or stop them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I have spoken to Jones four times alto<lb></lb>gether—I have not been in any public-house with them—my master has never seen me in public-houses with them I am certain—it was the first time they spoke that this suggestion was made—I did not drink when they asked me—the conversation about the case took place before I un<lb></lb>loaded, and I had another conversation with Smith when I came out—I did not speak to my master about it before he taxed me with it—he was angry and said he would put me away on suspicion—he warned me two months ago not to speak to anybody, but the prisoners spoke to me.</p>

               <p>to me in Spa Road, and I saw the prisoners standing against a coffee<lb></lb>shop on the same side—Murphy was driving a van—Smith went up to it, and Murphy pulled up—Smith put his foot on the traces and said some<lb></lb>thing—Jones was standing by—I took them in custody—they were taken to Mr. Taylor's yard and then to the station—Jones said to Mr. Taylor "You will have to pay for this"—I do not think I mentioned that before the Magistrate—I found this hammer on Jones, it has a wedge at the end.</p>

It is used for opening egg cases and packing cases—the Crown is about 200 yards from Mr. Taylor's place—Mr. Taylor held his finger up and I went to him—he said "I give these men in charge for tampering with my men"—he did not say "inciting"—Jones said he knew nothing about it.</p>

I never stirred out and the doctor can prove it. It is because I have once been convicted of robbery that I have been charged, but I am not always going to be a thief. If Mr. Taylor had anything against me, why did he not lock me up? My house is not two minutes' walk from his yard. I wish to call Dr. Lloyd, and my landlady, Mrs. Foster. I have been getting an honest living for 18 months. This detective said he would get me 20 years if he could.</p>

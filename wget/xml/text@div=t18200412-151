            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, the 19th of March, I was in company with Dean, and saw the prisoner, Castle, in Bridge-street, opposite Earl-street, about a quarter past seven o'clock, carrying a bundle under his right arm - the other prisoner joined him on the bridge, he had no bundle. They walked together to the other side of the bridge, then Wingar took the bundle from him. They relieved each other till they got to Lambeth-marsh, about thirty yards beyond the Anchor and Hope, then Wingar stopped and I seized Castle, who had the bundle - it was a two-gallon bottle, tied in an apron, and a silk handkerchief over it. Dean collared Wingar. I asked Castle what he had got there? he said,</p>
               <p>"You know what I have got." I said I did not know, and asked him who they worked for? they said they had no employ. We took them both to the Anchor and Hope, into the back parlour. In going along he said he would tell me all about it. When I got into the parlour I put the bottle down, and while I was tying them together Castle said he would give me a 1 l. note, or anything to drink, to let them go, for they should lose their situations. They said they worked for Messrs. Gordons, of Goswell-street. Directly as I secured them, Castle seized the bottle, stamped it on the floor, and broke it all to pieces; the contents were all spilt. They said they had it from their masters' premises, but it was for a sick man. I saw them in possession of it in Middlesex.</p>

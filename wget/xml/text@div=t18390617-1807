                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Bull, a tailor, in White Horse-lane, Stepney. I and my husband left our house on the evening of the 4th of June, as near half-past eight o'clock as possible—I returned about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock—we left every part of the house fast and secure—I found the street door as we had left it—I got a light, and as soon as my husband entered the kitchen I found a pane of glass broken, and the sash taken out of the kitchen window—the kitchen door had been fastened, and bolted top and bottom, when we left—I found it wide open, and a table-cloth, an ironing blanket, and a yard of cloth, were gone, and some towels out of the dresser-drawer in the kitchen—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the property</hi>)—I missed all these articles, and three penny-pieces, off the mantel-piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in John's-court, White Horse-lane, Stepney. About a quarter past nine o'clock in the evening, on the 4th of June, I was in Ben Jonson's-fields, near Mr. Bull's house, and saw the prisoner come by with these things—I had seen him before—he had a bundle under his arm—nobody was with him—he went down the Rope-walk—an officer came, and I gave information—I went with the officer, and saw the prisoner throw the bundle on one side—the officer took—It up—it was all undone when he threw it down, and these things came out—this wrapper is what he carried.</p>

About a quarter past nine o'clock I received information from Greatrex, as I was turning down the Rope-walk—I ran after the prisoner, who threw the bundle from under his arm—I took it up, and secured him—these are the articles which were in it—I found three penny pieces in his hand.</p>

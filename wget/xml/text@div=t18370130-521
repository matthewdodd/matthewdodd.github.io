                  </hi>. I reside in York-place, Walworth. I am a surgeon, but have retired from practice—I am one of the Court of Exa<lb></lb>miners appointed by the Apothecaries' Company—I was present at an examination which took place at Apothecaries-hall, on Thursday the 22nd of December—the prisoner at the bar was one of the candidates for exa<lb></lb>mination—his answers, (such as I heard) were very unsatisfactory—Mr. Este, Mr. Randall, and Mr. Tegart were there at the time I was, and part of the time, Mr. Ridout—the prisoner sat at the end of the table, and these gentle<lb></lb>men sat at the sides—it was not a round table—in reply to some questions asked him, the prisoner said, more than once, I think, but once, certainly—"How the devil can I answer, when I am badgered in this way?"—there was no ground for such an observation whatever—Mr. Este's manner during the examination was exceedingly kind and forbearing, and he endeavoured as far as was consistent (and I thought rather more than was consistent with his duty) to suggest the kind of answers the prisoner ought to have given—at the conclusion of the examination, or towards it, he said he never could answer questions, and when a boy at school he never could answer ques<lb></lb>tions—I was about half an hour at the table—during that time I did not put one question—towards the end of the examination I said to Mr. Este, (seeing that the questions were put in such a manner that it was intended almost what the prisoner should say, and that even then he did not answer them) "If you will excuse the liberty I take, I wish you would put two or three plain questions to the candidate, and let him answer them him<lb></lb>self,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300040"></xptr>
               <p>and then we shall be able to form an opinion whether the gentleman possesses sufficient information, to justify the court in granting him his cer<lb></lb>tificate—in pursuance of that suggestion, Mr. Este continued to examine him—and I offered no further observations—I do not think I remained at the table more than ten minutes after that observation—at the end of which time, I went into another room for the purpose of signing some certificates which were lying there for that purpose—I did not remain in that room five minutes—I returned again to the room in which the examination was going on—I did not sit down, but stood behind the chair in which the prisoners was sitting, for about two inutes—I believe I might possibly lean on it—I believe I did lean on it, but I did not touch the prisoner—I thought he was not aware of my being there, but he looked round immediately and saw me and I withdrew a step or so—I ceased to lean on the chair—when I entered the room in the first instance, before any thing happened, on going up to the table, I had observed what I considered a very extraordinary demeanor on the part of the prisoner—he was taking sarsaparilla which was lying before him, and chewing it with an air of more than indifference—indeed I may say of defiance—and he said more than once—"How the devil can I answer, when lam bad—gered in this way"—he was chewing pieces of sarsaparilla, throwing it from and taking other pieces up—I said to him—"In the many years I have been an examiner, Sir, I never saw a candidate conduct himself in the manner you are doing"—I said nothing else whatever—all this passed before I went into the other room to sign the certificates—after my return from that room, I heard Mr. Este tell the prisoner that he was not capable of passing his examination—that was, as near as I can recollect, about ten minutes after my return to the room—upon the prisoner being told that he could not pass his examina<lb></lb>tion, he said, "I wish you would examine me in anatomy—I have studied that part of my profession—I like anatomy—I have lived in the dead-house"—Mr. Este bowed and remarked to him, that he could not continue the examination—another gentleman made another remark—the prisoner then observed, he was glad he did not depend on his profession entirely for his subsistence, but that he would not be disgraced by rejection, and further that he would rather swing for it—after uttering those words he got up, and stepped back about a couple of feet—I saw the motion of his hand with extreme rapidity—he said, "You were one of those "and I immediately felt myself severely struck on the left side of my forehead, on the frontal bone—this mark on my forehead is the remains of the blow—it did not make me lose my senses—the immediate effect was an excessive flow of blood—I felt my eyes filled with blood, and took hold of the table to support myself—I felt pain from the blow, and felt my face covered with blood—as soon as I recovered from the effect of the blow, I observed some gentle<lb></lb>men near me—I saw Dr. Merriman bleeding very profusely, and Mr. Este bleeding not so profusely—it was a fortnight before I could appear at Guildhall—but I was three weeks confined—I was first attended by Mr. Bacot, and next by Mr. Key, a surgeon of Guy's-hospital.</p>

               <p>I was obliged to pass his chair at a less distance than I am from you—I was obliged to pass close to it, hut not to touch it—I pasted close to his chair, and turned aside to lean on it, to hear the remainder of the examination.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> from his turning back to you in the manner you describe, did not you perceive that you annoyed him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say I perceived it—I have done it often before, and seen it done—I did not conclude that my ob<lb></lb>servations annoyed him—I left suddenly on his turning round—I did not choose to lean any longer on his chair—I thought it better to fall back—I did not intend to annoy him, and did not suppose it would annoy him—he had not complained of being crowded—I considered his conduct in chewing the drugs as he did, a mark of great insolence, connected with hit air of defiance—I thought it was meant as insolence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You thought he purposely meant to insult the examiners who had his interest at stake in their hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I admonished him on his conduct, and it was after that I leant over his chair—I heard no other gentleman admonish him—it was after this insolence that he re<lb></lb>spectfully asked to be examined in anatomy—he is a young man—I never saw him before the examination—he raised his hand with great rapidity—I saw a quick motion, and felt myself wounded immediately—I fancy I saw his hand, I saw a quick motion—I cannot say whether he had his glove on, his movement was so quick, I cannot recollect—I saw it hand move, that is all I do recollect—there it a small mark remaining on my forehead now—it was done six weeks ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the size of the examination room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a large room, not so large as this court—the examiners sit at a table—there are four tables, at each of which three examiners sit—they are placed the corners of the room to be as far from each other as conveniently may be—the prisoner was sitting nearest the door with his back to the door—he sat at the end of the table, and the examiners at the side next to him, each side of the table—I must have approached near him to have me to the other tables—I was intending to go to another table, but turned aside to hear the remainder of his examination—I need not have leant on his chair except I liked—I might have gone past the table with<lb></lb>out stopping, but my duty required that I should stop—I was not one of the three appointed to examine the prisoner—under ordinary circum<lb></lb>nces there are three examiners at each of the four tables; when examin<lb></lb>ation goes on in the regular way, and the candidate is found competent pass, the examiners do not leave their own tables, but if there is a doubt respecting the capability of the candidate to pass, one of the exa<lb></lb>miners at the table calls for examiners from the other tables, because the Act of Parliament requires a majority of the Court, seven, to decide on a rejection—I had been called in by one of my colleagues, Mr. Ridout, who was one of the three examiners of the prisoner, 1 presume, but I had been employed examining a candidate till the moment I was called in, and therefore had not seen the table—when I came I observed Mr. Ridout acting as examiner at the table, for a short time—he then went away, and returned to the table again—one of the three examiners takes on himself the whole, and when any one subject is finished, in chemistry, or</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Finsbury-square, and am a sur<lb></lb>geon—I am one of the Court of Examiners. I was at Apothecaries' Hall on the 22nd of December in the execution of my duty—on that occasion, in order to accommodate the number of pupils coming up, an extra table was put, making five tables in all—I was at the table part of the time while the prisoner was being examined—Mr. Este was the principal ex<lb></lb>aminer—I am not clear who were the others, because I did not attend the table till late—Mr. Tegart was sitting at the table when I came—he arose and desired me to assist in the prisoner's examination—I heard ques<lb></lb>tions put to the prisoner by Mr. Este respecting <hi rend="italic">cubebs,</hi> which is a species of pepper—he first pointed to the article and asked him what it was—the prisoner not knowing, or apparently not knowing, (not answering, I should more correctly say,) Mr. Este said, "Don't you recollect it is a species of pepper?"—the prisoner said, "Oh yes, I know it very well"—that is a drug in common use—I should say a man was not fit to be an apothecary if he did not know it—Mr. Este then said, "Don't you know it is used in a specific mucous discharge?" wishing to bring it to his mind—he said, "Oh yes," but still did not name the article—Mr. Este then said, (the prisoner having told him he had attended St. George's,) "Have you not seen it used in the Lock hospital?"—"Oh yes," he said, but still did not name it—Mr. Este said, "Don't you recollect it is <hi rend="italic">cubebs?"</hi>—he said, "Oh yes, I know it very well"—Mr. Este then asked him How it was to be used, not answering, I said to the prisoner, "The gentleman means, sir, what is the form of preparation you would use," explaining it that he might not be puzzled by the general question, How it is to be used—the prisoner immediately turned to me and said, "How the devil can I answer questions, if you are all badgering me in this kind of way?"—I should think there was nothing in our manner to deserve that term—our conduct was friendly and kind to him, I conceive—Mr. Este taking up the question, said, "Would you give it in the form of pills, powder, or mixture"—after a little hesitation, he said, he would give it in the form of essential oil dropped into a mixture—that is not the common mode of mixture—Mr. Este said, "Don't you know the general form of exhibiting is that of powder?"—he said, "Oh yes, I know that very well, I have often seen it given"—Mr. Este put no more questions on that subject, but pointed to some specimens of bark which were on the tray—after putting several questions, and getting no satisfactory answers, though rather assisting him to answer, I heard Mr. Hardy say, "Pardon me, sir, I think the better plan would be to put to the gentleman two or three simple questions, and let him answer them himself, then we shall be better able to judge whether it is our duty to grant him his certificate"—that was not said in the least offensively—Mr. Hardy very shortly afterwards left the table, and Mr. Este proceeded with some questions relative to the bark, and Mr. Ridout came to the table—I saw Mr. Hardy speak to him and he came—Mr. Este was pursuing some questions relative to intermittent fever, which the prisoner knew nothing about—he returned no satisfactory answers—Mr. Ridout then asked him some specific questions relative to the treatment of the cold stage of an intermittent, but no satisfactory answers</p>

               <p>could be elicited, he simply stated—"I never can answer questions when I asked, I never could do so at school—though I knew every thing as well as any boy at school"—Mr. Ridout, in a kind manner, observed to him that the answers he gave there, were the only test they had of his quail<lb></lb>fications to practise; and although they by no means wished to hurt any young man's feelings, they had an important duty to the public to perform—the prisoner immediately, in a hasty manner, said, "Oh, Sir, you have behaved very gentlemanly, I am sure, and so has that gentleman, "Pointing to Mr. Este—some few questions were put afterwards by Mr. Este, relative to doses of laudanum, but being about to terminate the examination, stating he was sorry, he was not fit to receive his certificate, the prisoner, addressing himself to Mr. Ridout, said, "Pray examine me in anatomy, I love anatomy, I have lived in the dead-house" (it is part of the duty of the Court to examine in anatomy,) Mr. Ridout replied, "That is a science which more decidedly comes under the province of the college of surgeons, and although we expect a gentleman to have sufficient knowledge of it to practise, yet, if he has ever such a knowledge of it, and is ignorant of <hi rend="italic">materia medica</hi>, we could not grant his certificate"—the examination in <hi rend="italic">materia medica</hi> always precedes the examination in anatomy—while Mr. Ridout was terminating his sentence, Mr. Este looked across the table to me and said, "Do you think it worth while to continue this examination, Sir," or something to that effect—I replied, "I certainly think not, espe<lb></lb>dallyss the gentleman himself says he cannot answer any questions"—Mr. Este then addressing himself to the prisoner said, "I am very sorry Sir, but I cannot consider it my duty to recommend you to the court to receive your certificate"—the prisoner then muttered something to himself and suddenly raising his voice, said, "Your certificate is of no consequence to me, in a pecuniary point of view; I am going abroad, and I have good resources, but do you think I am going to be disgraced before my family by such a set as you are—no, be d—d if I will be—I would die first—I would swing for it"—on saying this he rose from his chair, a little behind which was Mr. Hardy—Mr. Hardy had not interfered, or said one word during all this conversation—he had done nothing to annoy him in the least, but was behind his chair, when he started up, the prisoner then stepped back a few paces, put both his hands behind him as though they were in his back coat pocket, fixed his eyes on Mr. Hardy, and suddenly I saw his right arm raised above his head, and a severe blow inflicted on Mr. Hardy—expressing at the same time, "You are one of those that have been hard upon roe, or against me"—I could not see what he struck with—I instantly saw blood proceeding from Mr. Hardy—I saw Dr. Merriman attempt to secure the prisoner, when he received a blow which bled profusely—Mr. Este, in attempting to assist, also received a blow—I then got close to where the prisoner and those two or three gentlemen were, and saw Mr. Tegart with this instrument in his hand—I did not see whether Mr. Tegart got it from him or not—he said in the hearing of the prisoner, "I have just taken that out of the gentleman's hand"—seeing the prisoner was secured, I then sent out for a policeman—I did not examine Mr. Hardy's wound—I took no further notice of it—I merely requested somebody to bring him some water—there was a very considerable flow of blood from him, over his clothes and over mine.</p>

               <p>prisoner's chair—the result of the prisoner's examination was unsatis<lb></lb>jartory—he used the words which have been repeated by Mr. Randall in reference to being examined in anatomy—at the close of the examination he pot up, pushed his chair a few paces back in retiring, and stepped back himself—I saw him put his hands into his coat pocket and take out the weapon which has been exhibited—at the time he was taking it out of his pocket he said to Mr. Hardy, and looking at him, "You are one of those who are hard upon me," or words to that effect—I then saw him raise his hand and give the blow to Mr. Hardy—I saw Mr. Hardy shrink, 'or sink other, and then saw Dr. Merriman rush towards the prisoner and attempt to lay hold of his right hand—he then changed the weapon from his right hand to his left—I ran towards him and seized his left hand, receiving a blow myself—he struck me—on his being secured, I heard him say to Mr. Este, who had been likewise struck, "I am sorry, sir, I beg your pardon for having struck you, I did not intend it; I shall never forgive my<lb></lb>self during the remainder of my life."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Portugal-street, Grosvenor-square. I am chairman of the Court of Examiners—I was there, and was called on to examine Mr. Hardy as soon as the wound was inflicted—he was bleeding from a severe contused wound on the left side of the forehead—he was bleeding copiously, and supporting himself with his hand on the table—he appeared in pain, and rather faintish—I saw him every follow<lb></lb>ing day, till his appearance before the Magistrate, (except on Sunday which was Christmas-day,) the wound itself was not serious, for it had not affected the bone, but its consequences were very much to be apprehended—on the following Monday Mr. Key was called in to assist.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Queen's Head public-house, Brook-green—on 7th December last the prisoner came to my house and called for a pint of beer—he offered in payment a shilling—I did not take particular notice of it, and put it in the till—I then thought he drank the beer rather hastily, and went and looked at the shilling again, and found it was bad—I gave him sixpence, and a fourpenny bit in change, and he went away—I followed him, in company with another person named Lapland, and saw him go into Mr. Fase's at Kennington—he came out again, and I went in and spoke to them, and they followed the prisoner again to the Holland Arms—we went in there, and I asked the barmaid, in his presence, whether he had laid anything down—she said, yes, he had; it was a bad sixpence—the prisoner had his thumb on it—it was doubled up on the counter—I did not see what became of it—a constable was then sent for, and he was given into custody—I gkve the shilling that I had received from the prisoner to the constable at the station.</p>

I keep the post-office and stationer's shop at Mr. Fane's, Edwarde's-terrace, Kennington—I remember a man coming to the shop one Saturday afternoon, between 3 and 4—I don't know whether it was the prisoner—he bought two shillings' worth of postage stamps, and paid me with a shilling and two sixpences—I put the money he gave me in the till—I had other shillings there at the time—the prisoner then left, and I heard some one come in and call out something—a policeman came in that evening and said something to me, and I looked in the till in consequence—I found a bad shilling there, which I gave to him.</p>

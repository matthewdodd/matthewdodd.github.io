                  </hi>. I am a boatman at Pickford's wharf, and live at Foleshill, near Coventry. On the night of the 2nd of September I was at the Windsor Castle, in the City-road—the prisoners came in after I had been sitting there some time, and asked me to treat them with some gin—I did so—we all drank—I was tipsy when I went there—I got sick there, and went out—I had seven sovereigns in a leather purse, and some silver in my pocket at half-past eleven o'clock—Marsh afterwards came and told me something, and I missed my money—I did not see it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boatman, out of employ. I was at the Windsor Castle, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I saw the prosecutor, and the two prisoners drinking together—the prosecutor seemed to be very tipsy—he came out of the Castle, went to the fence, and seemed to be very sick—I saw Chadwick come out, and followed him—she put her hand into his left hand pocket, and took out a purse—I could not tell what it contained—she gave it to Barrowclift—she opened the gate, and went out, was out a few minutes, then came back—Chadwick then said to the prosecutor, "Come and let us have a glass of gin together at the City Arms"—he said yes—Barrowclift came back, and they took him to the middle</p>

                  </hi>. I work for John Williams, a bricklayer. On Monday, the 29th of June I was taking a pair of his boots to where he was at work, and at I crossed Seven-dials, the prisoner and two more came up—I knew the prisoner before—they asked where was I going with them—I said they were my master's—they asked to look at them—I showed them, and had them back again, but the prisoner snatched then out of my hand and went off with them—I followed him, but he went into a public-house, and got away—he was taken in two or three days—I saw the boots at the pawnbroker's.</p>

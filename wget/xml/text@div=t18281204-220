            . I paid the prisoner 4l. 14s. 6d., on the 11th of July, for a mattress; he gave me a receipt, which I gave the person I paid the money for; I am sure I paid the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know of a sale taking place at Mr. Pearson's? A. Yes - but it was before the sale, I believe, but I am not certain; the prisoner was at the sale, and received the money - I was there; it occasioned a great deal of confusion.</p>

            . I did not receive 10l. 4s. 6d. on Mr. Todd's account, nor the 4l. 14s. 6d. on Mr. Nelson's; they should have appeared in the May and July account - the 10l. 4s. 6d. was for goods sent into the country, and I questioned the propriety of sending them; he (the prisoner) said it was a very respectable gentleman, and he had no doubt it would be paid - I asked for it several times, and requested him to write to Mr. Todd for the money, and he declared from time to time he had not been paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are not these two sums inserted in the account delivered to Mrs. Pearson? A. They are; he never before made up an account purporting to be an account of money received at the sale - he had nothing to do with the sale; the auctioneer had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The reason there was no account rendered in July, was, the sale was on the 26th, 27th, and 28th, and they were clearing the lots; Mr. George bought three lots, and I sold several - we had no goods, only some lots which were bought in; I sold one to a friend, who has not paid me yet, thought I paid over the money to Mr. Pearson - Mr. George is here, and you may ask him whether he did not buy the lots from the knowledge he had of me.</p>

            . Immediately after the sale, I bought some lots from the prisoner; he was there, managing the things which remained unsold - I paid him for the lots I bought.</p>
               <p>Mr. PEARSON re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner sell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040109"></xptr>any lots after the sale? A. Yes - but I have not had the money for them; I asked the prisoner for the 10l. 4s. 6d., as I happened to be in want of money.</p>

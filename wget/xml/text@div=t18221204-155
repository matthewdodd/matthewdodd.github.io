               <p>"Now where do you live." I was pointing to the house, and he ran off with the bundle into a Mr. Cuff's gateway, where he is watchman, but before I could get to the gate he shut it; a witness came up, and knocked for eight or ten minutes; he at last came out, and was taken to the watch-house.</p>

            . I live in Newcastle-street. On the 16th of November, about twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner running from Edwards into the gateway; he shut the wicket after him. I saw nothing in his hand. I stood about a quarter of an hour while Edwards knocked at the gate; he poked his head out, and said he had nothing belonging to him. He is a private watchman.</p>

The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, charged with the robbery, and denied all knowledge of it; he said he saw Edwards at the corner of Castle-street, but knew nothing of the cloth; but after he was locked up, he called me, and said he had put the cloth in a little back warehouse. I went to search, but could not find it. Next morning he called me, and said he threw it up into a loop-hole at Mr. Baker's warehouse. Mr. Baker's man found it there.</p>

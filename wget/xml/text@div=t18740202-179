                  </hi>. I was formerly a clerk in the service of Robarts, Lubbock &amp; Co., and I was so in July, 1872—I had been in their service for fourteen years up to July, 1873, when I was discharged—I was employed in the country office—in May, 1871,1 was in want of money, and Mr. McLean, an acquaintance of mine, drew upon me for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I accepted the bill, and Mr. McLean was to get it discounted for me—I did not receive any money upon that bill—it was a three months' bill—before it became due Mr. Tuck called upon me about it, he is a stationer in Union Court, City—when it became due it was presented by the prisoner Templeman—I had never seen him before—he left me his address, No. 1, Aldermanbury Postern, and he said he was a solicitor—the bill was presented to me at the bank, and he asked for the payment of the bill—I said that I had not received any consideration for the amount, and that Mr. McLean would attend to it—nothing further passed at that time—I was afterwards sued in the Mayor's Court upon that acceptance by a person named Brown—my solicitors were Messrs. Peckham, Maitland, &amp; Peckham, of Doctors' Commons, and Mr. Templeman was the solicitor for the plaintiff—the action was not tried—the arrangement was made that I was to pay 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by instalments, and I was to make those payments at Mr. Templeman's office in Aldermanbury Postern—after the compromise I made the monthly payments until the whole of it was paid—I used to pay the money personally, and I received from Templeman these receipts (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) from time to time; they are signed by him—there was also an action by Brown against a person that I knew, relating to another bill, and they were both included in one settlement, so that on the two bills 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Allard and Co., in Paris, and get into a cab, that after following the cab for some little distance, it took a contrary direction to what had been arranged between them, and it was lost sight of—I saw Templeman continually after that, from day to day, and at last he told me that the man had come back to London; that was three or four days after—he told me before that that the</p>

I was to receive he accounted for by commission, exchange—at that time I did not know at all who the man was who had gone to Paris—I knew that a man had gone, but I did not know his name, nor who he was—I knew nothing of Giraud—at the end of the year 1872, I was in want of money again, and I applied to Temple man upon the subject, and he drew a bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I accepted, and he got it discounted for me of a Mr. Pilley—I lodged a bond as security, and this memorandum was signed by Templeman (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "7th December, 1872.—Bond 1,000 dollars, Cincinatti Water Works, deposited with Mr. Pilley as security for the payment of bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for two months.

Peckham &amp; Co., my solicitors, from time to time, and I agreed to give evidence, and I attended at the Mansion House before the Lord Mayor after Templeman was in custody—the 2nd December was the first day I went there, and on that occasion I saw a man named Asselin—I had never seen Asselin up to that time.</p>

               <p>whatever was necessary in the business; that a short time previous to that he had incurred some debts for betting, or in business, which he did not explain to me, and that he wanted to fill up a cheque for a rather larger amount than he usually used to draw, and as the father was very ill he was afraid to cause his death by showing that he was drawing for such a large amount—he never told me the amount, but he said if I was willing to go over to Paris with him and cash the cheque for him, which he could not do, because he was too well known in the Exchange there, and by everybody, that I should be paid a commission, and he added "There is nothing to fear, as I have the clerk of the bank who will let me know if the cheque has been paid, or if they will send a telegram to the father and if the father has said that the cheque is not to be paid, in which case you shall not present it, you shall not go to receive the money"—I was to have 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble—I asked five guineas a day, and Giraud agreed to give me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I agreed to go about three days before I started—we were in Gracechurch Street, and he said "If you go over you must not receive the money in your own name, because if the father does recover (he is very ill, and it is a crisis in his illness that may recover or kill him), he will at once sue against you; and that is why you must not go in your own name, you can take any name, you can call yourself Jones, or Jack, or James, or any name you like"—he told me to take the name of Foster, and I took it—I wrote this slip of paper "Captain J. Foster, 10, Albert Terrace, Clapham"—Giraud suggested that address; he took a piece of paper out of his pocket-book and tore it and said he had no eye-glass, and could not write it himself, and asked me to write it, which I did—he took it away with him and said "In half an hour I shall bring you the cards printed"—he came back in about an hour with the cards printed—he arranged with me to start the same evening, Wednesday, 3rd July—I saw Bonbernard at the London Bridge Railway Station, and Giraud and a woman—I don't know who she was; she was some friend of Giraud's—I had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given me before I started—Giraud got the tickets—Bonbernard left us just a moment before we went into the train—we went to Newhaven, Dieppe, and on to Paris—we arrived at Paris on Thursday, 4th July, and went to the Hotel de Lille et d'Albion, in the Rue St. Honore—I do not know where Giraud stayed, we parted at Paris—we arranged to meet in the Palais Royal, at the Cafe de la Rotonde—I stayed at the hotel as Captain Foster—I met Giraud that same day at the Cafe de Rotonde, and we went together to the Comptoir Escompte, near the Post Office—it is a discount office—Giraud there gave me this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave it me just at the door, and told me to go up stairs and ask one of the clerks if they would send it for cash ment—I went on to the first floor and saw-one of the cashiers—he told me something—I came outside with the cheque, and told Giraud that they told me I had come to the wrong place, that I ought to have gone to a banker's instead of them, that they would send it for cashment if I required, but they would not pay it till twenty-two days after—he said "That will not do at all, then you come with me;" we then went together to Allard's bank—Giraud had the cheque in the meantime—he told me to give it to Mr. Allard, and send it for cashment to London—I left it with Messrs. Allard, and they told me if I came in two or three days that they would have a telegram and would let me know in a couple of days—Giraud had told me to ask for a telegram when it was paid—I left the cheque and gave a card, one of those I had</p>

               <p>received from Giraud, with "Captain Foster" upon it, and I wrote on it the "Hotel de Lille et d'Albion"—this is the card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I left the cheque Messrs. Allard gave me this receipt—I gave it to Giraud when I came out, and told him what had occurred inside—he said that he was expecting his friend, the son of the gentleman who was ill, over on the Sunday with a clerk of the bank, that the clerk of the bank was to meet him late on the Saturday afternoon to sec if any opposition had been put by the father to the payment of the cheque—on the Thursday night I went back to the Hotel de Lille et d'Albion—on Friday I saw Giraud again, and he told me he thought it would be better for me to change my hotel in case they were not coming, to keep my room at the hotel but simply to state that I was going over to Versailles—I did as he told me; I left the Hotel de Lille et d'Albion and went to the Grande Hotel de Paris in the Boulevard de Strasbourg—I knew that house, and had been staying there once before; I then stayed there in my own name of Asselin—on the Sunday I went with Giraud to the railway-station at the Chemin de fer du Nord; he told me he was waiting for his friends to come over; we remained there about three hours but nobody came—we then parted, but he said he knew where to find them if they had come—I saw him next day, Monday, the 8th, in front of my hotel, he said "My friends have arrived, it is all right, you have only to go and receive the money, I shall wait for you at the Cafe Cardinal"—he put me into a cab, gave me a receipt, and I went to Allard's; I there presented the receipt and received the money, 30,000 francs in French notes, thirty notes of 1,000 francs each, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money, notes, and gold, and 19 francs and 60 centimes in French money; the telegram was 6 francs, and the other was only the difference of exchange—I signed my name to the receipt, "J. Foster"—while I was at Allard's I saw two persons there, I think Templeman was one of them; I had never seen him before—I did not know his name, or who ho was—the counter is like a corner counter, those two persons were at one corner whilst I was at the other corner, so one was near me and the other was further from me—they were exchanging some English coins or English notes for French money; one was speaking English and the other French—I came out with the money and got into a cab—I went to Gibus, the hat maker's, and bought a hat there; I had a hat which was paining me very much, and I left it to be put in shape, and went to the hotel in the one I bought instead—after that I met a friend and went with him to the Palais Royale; I remained with him about three-quarters of an hour—I discharged the cab; I left my friend and went to the Cafe Cardinal to meet Giraud and give him the money; he was not there, I waited there about two hours, he did not come; I afterwards went to my hotel—I saw the landlord, M. Chevallier, and he told me something—I remained at the hotel that night and next day; that day, the 9th, I loft for London—at the time I was in Paris I did not know where Giraud or Templeman were staying—I went to Dieppe and stayed there about ten hours—I lost a portmonnaie there, with about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it; with that exception I had all the rest of the money in my possession—I left Dieppe at 8 o'clock that night, and arrived in London on the Wednesday morning—I went first to the City; I went everywhere where 1 could think of meeting Giraud, as 1 did not know his address—I went to the Lombard Rooms and afterwards to Bonbernard's office—I had the money with me, and I gave it to Bonbernard to take care of, not liking to carry it about me—I handed to him 30,000 francs as they were handed</p>

               <p>to me, pinned as Mr. Allard had given them to me, by ten each—I owed Bonbernard about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time and I paid him 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account; the rest of the money I kept, I only handed Bonbernard the notes—I saw Giraud I think the same evening—I told him that I ought not to be the loser of what I had lost at Dieppe, that it was through his own fault in not waiting for me; he wanted mo to be the loser of it, and also to pay back the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had advanced tome—I did not agree to that, I told Bonber<lb></lb>nard not to pay over the money until I gave him my authority to pay it—I got the notes back from him the same evening, and I returned them to him about an hour or two after; that was after I had seen Giraud—on the following day I saw Giraud again in the wino vaults, and went with him to Bonbernard's—I believe it was forty-eight hours after that we came to an arrangement that he was to indemnify me for my loss, and he was to take the 30,000 francs; I was to keep the rest—we went to Bonbernard's together, and Bonbernard produced the notes and gave them to Giraud in my presence that was two days after my arrival, on the Friday—that was the whole of the money at I 'had for my share in this matter—some three or four weeks after this I saw Templeman near my house in Malpas Road, New Cross—a man was with him, who told me that his name was Walker—I recognised Tem<lb></lb>pleman as the man I had seen at Allard's—Walker first spoke to me, Templeman was only a few yards off—I was in a shop, buying something—Walker came to me and said "Mr. Asselin?"—I said "That is my name"—he said "I want to talk to you"—I came out—he said "You have been to Paris, and you have received' 1,242<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Templeman was on the other side of the road at this time—Walker made a statement to me—I did not have any conversation with Templeman on that occasion—about two or three days afterwards Walker called again, Templeman was just by—I would not answer Walker, seeing somebody very near, and he said "Oh, it is no matter, he is a friend of mine"—Templeman then came near, and said "You can say all, because I know all about it"—then I said "Your name must be Mr. Templeman"—he said "That is my name"—he said that Giraud was a scoundrel and a thief, that he believed I had paid over the whole of the money, but that he had kept it, giving them only 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first, and then 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, and keeping the remainder—I said I could prove that I had paid the whole of it, because I deposited it with a merchant in the City, and he handed it over—he said "Will you name the merchant?"—I said "No"—he said "Will you come and meet Mr. Giraud, and then you shall have your share, your share is 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you have not received it"—I said "If I had known that I would not have had anything to do with the matter, because I would have known then that there was something wrong in it"—I said "I am prepared to meet Mr. Giraud"—I told them I had received only about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which I had lost about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then made an appointment with the person who gave the name of Walker for the next day—I did not see Giraud next day, I saw him perhaps six or seven, or eight weeks after—I told him I was quite annoyed at having these people coming and annoying me, I meant Walker and Templeman—I told him they had annoyed me by going about and telling everybody that I had been a thief and robbed them of their money—he said "I don't know thorn at all; the best thing you can do is to give them in charge when they come' to trouble you"—in the following year, 1873. I saw Sergeant Reimers, of the detective police, at Scotland Yard; something passed between us—</p>

               <p>after that I saw Giraud, that was about a fortnight before I was arrested—I was arrested on 24th June—after seeing Giraud, I went with him to Templeman, at his office at Aldermanbury—I told Templeman that I had been met by Sergeant Reimers, who had asked me some questions, and wanted my handwriting, which I had given him, and I said I was sure it was about this business—Templeman said "No, it can't be, they would never employ a Scotland Yard officer for that business, it must be for some other matter"—I told him that could not be, because I had nothing at all except this business—he said "Oh, it can't be, it must be something else, they would employ a City officer for this case; but if you are wanted send for me"—Giraud was waiting down stairs for me at this time—Templeman said that Giraud had been robbing them, there was no mistake about it; then he stopped me not to speak any more, because the clerk or somebody in the office understood French; we were talking in French all the time—he said that there was some other business, a large transaction, that Giraud knew all about it, and he asked me if Giraud had spoken to me about it—Giraud had spoken to me about another transaction—I did not agree to do anything else—I met Giraud down stairs after seeing Templeman, and I told him what Templeman had told me—Giraud said "Will you come up stairs with me, and I shall tell him before you that I gave him the whole of the money"—I said "No, I have had enough of the business"—I would not return—I told him that he had spoken to me about the large business—as to this matter, I said if I was arrested of course I would tell as it had passed—on 24th June, I was arrested, taken before the Lord Mayor, and committed for trial—Mr. Wontner was my solicitor—while I was in Newgate I was visited by a person named Hauzau—I knew him—I afterwards saw Mr. Mullens in Newgate, and made some statement to him; Mr. Wontner, my solicitor, introduced me to him—I was examined as a witness against Templeman before the Lord Mayor in December—up to that time I had never seen Hawkins at all, or heard his name, or knew who he was, until I saw him there—I was afterwards acquitted in this Court of the charge upon which I was sent for trial.</p>

I did not arrange with Mr. Mullens that I was to be acquitted—I never made any terms with him at all—I was taken into custody by Inspector Clark—he told me the charge was going to Paris and uttering a forged cheque, and I said I knew nothing about it—I did not say I had not been to Paris, because I had been to Paris four times that year; I said nothing more than that I knew nothing about it—I think it was about two months after I was in custody that I was introduced to Mr. Mullens—I was not pressed in the least to go to Mr. Mullens—the moment I was taken I gave my statement in full to Mr. Wontner, I mean the day I saw Mr. Wontner, that was three days after I was taken into custody; he had the whole of my statement—my notion was that this was a cheque drawn by a son for his father who was dying, for a larger amount than he ought to draw, so that he would cheat his dying father; but I was told he was the only son, he was only cheating himself—I was helping nobody, I was helping myself, to have my commission—I helped myself to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was told he was an only son, that if his father recovered he would of course make it right with his father, who was very sick, and if he died he was the heir, and he would lose nothing—if the father recovered, I was told he would be very angry, and therefore I was to give a false name</p>

There is no ground for saying that I am not a perfectly honest man—I am honest as much as you are—this money was to be obtained without the father's knowledge because he was too ill, and if he knew so much was obtained it might kill him—if he was to be killed I would have stuck to the money, which I did not, which shows I did not know anything about it; I shared nothing—the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I was robbed of them—I don't know how many people were there, perhaps about forty; the money was in a small portmonnaie, it was a pocket-book and portemonnaie—I had separated that 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the other on purpose, and put it into my portemonnaie, and it was in my pocket—I did not know that I had lost it till I was on board the steamer—I had no bill to pay, I had a return ticket—I was at no hotel, I arrived in the morning and started in the evening—I had some loose silver—I am married—I gave my wife 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that makes 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was only to receive 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a dispute with Giraud—that would be the difference that I had lost; I wanted not to return the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the dispute was about the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed at the time that this was a perfectly fair transaction—I had met Giraud many times before I met him at the wine vaults, without knowing even his name; I had met him at Bonbernard's—you ought to know what a commission agent is; it is an English term, I am a foreigner—I sell and buy for persons, upon which I receive a commission—I have been in that line for the last five or six years in London—I have no shop—I had an office for about a year in Lawrence Pountney Hill—I did not do anything in English races—I keep no books and no clerk, and no banking account; I have nothing at all—I could tell you firms that I did business with, no great firms—I had dealings with Sir Antonio Brady, of the Admiralty—I had a large estate in Australia, and his brother was my partner—I came over here about that estate, Sir Antonio Brady will give you an account of it—I don't want to give any other firms, I think that is enough—I have not gone to Paris before to cash a cheque—I have never been called Foster before—I wrote that name on the cheque at Giraud's suggestion, and he had no spectacles, he could not see—he speaks English as well as I can—I did not think there was anything suspicious about my going over in a false name, or in changing my name when I got there, because it was explained what it was for—I was first apprehended on the 24th June, I think—I met Giraud, and told him that complaints were made about my being a thief, that was very annoying, I did not much like it, and he told me to give them in charge—they said I had stolen the money—I never did give anybody in charge; I</p>

               <p>he wished to sec him as soon as possible—I refused at first to give the address—he asked me to go with him, but I told him I had no time to do so, and then he said he wished only to see him for his own good, and I ultimately gave him Asselin's address—on the following day Giraud came again and told me that he had not seen Asselin—he said he was very sorry to have made the acquaintance of Asselin, because Asselin had robbed him of a large sum of money—I don't think he mentioned the sum at that time, but he may have done so—when he told me that Asselin did not behave honestly, I told him I was surprised at the accusation, and he told me then he had an appointment in Paris at the Cafe Cardinal, and he did wait for Asselin there, but he did not come, and so he did suppose that he had run away with the money entrusted to him—I said that I did not believe it—he said I would be obliged to believe after Asselin did not come back, and he was afraid he would not return—I afterwards went with Giraud to Malpas Road, New Cross, where Asselin was living, to try and find him—I went to the house, and Giraud waited for me at a public-house opposite—Asselin was not at home, and I went to the public-house and told Giraud—he said that Asselin was a thief, and had robbed him of his money—I asked him if he was quite certain that nothing had happened to Asselin at Paris, and he said that he was quite certain that Asselin was very well, and that no accident had happened to him—I knew a person named Walker at this time, but I did not know him before—I also knew Temple<lb></lb>man—I took him for a solicitor—after I had been to New Cross with Giraud he came to me again, and wanted me to go to New Cross again, but I declined to go—Walker came to my office after Giraud came back from Paris, but never before—he came twenty times during the day and wanted Asselin—I saw Templeman outside once when Walker was in the office, but I never saw him in Walker's company—on Wednesday, 10th July, Asselin came to me at the office and made some communication to me, and I communicated to him the fact that Walker had called, and Giraud wanted him—Asselin handed to mo on that day some French notes—I did not notice how many there were—they were 1,000 franc notes; there was a bundle of them—he told me there were 30,000 francs, and they were left for me to take care of—Asselin owed me some money at that time, and he paid me 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—after Asselin had left the money in my charge, Giraud came to my office—he ultimately mot Asselin, and I heard part of the conversation between them—Giraud was very pleased to see Asselin come back, and Asselin said "I am surprised that you accused me before Mr. Bonbernard, my friend, of having robbed you; if you had waited for me in Paris we would have met each other there, and you would not have been in anxiety, and you would have saved my anxiety"—Giraud said that he was waiting at the Hotel Cardinal a certain time, and Asseliu did not come as appointed—Asselin told him it was impossible that he could have waited there, that he had his breakfast and his lunch there—Giraud said that he did wait at the cafe, and afterwards went to the hotel and inquired for him—Asselin said "I can't understand it, because after I left the caft I went to my hotel, I slept there all the night and left Paris the next morning"—there was considerable conversation between them as to how they came to miss each other, and after that Asselin asked me to hand over to him the bank-notes, as he wanted to give them to Giraud—I handed Asselin the notes, and he and Giraud left my office together—Asselin afterwards returned alone, and again handed me the notes to take care of—I afterwards saw</p>

               <p>Giraud in reference to the commission Asselin was to get for his trouble—I told Girand that I was surprised that after accusing the man as he did, that he was disputing the commission—he told me that if the business was in his own hands he would not dispute it at all, but as he had to give account to some other people he could not deal with it—Walker came after that, and on the day following, Giraud and Asselin were together at my office, and I then handed to Giraud the notes that Asselin had handed to me to take care of—I said to Giraud "Now the matter between you and Asselin is settled, I should like to get rid of that man Walker, if he comes again to trouble me at my office, I shall ask a policeman to put him out"—Giraud said "When Walker comes again, tell him that you know that he comes from Mr. Templeman, and he will never trouble you again"—about the commencement of January, 1873, I went with a friend by train from Cannon Street to Charing Cross—I saw Templeman at the Charing Cross platform—he asked me to have a glass, and I did so—I remained with him in conversation two or three hours—we went from the station to a cigar shop, and then to the Alhambra—he mentioned Giraud's name more than once in the course of conversation—he told me that Giraud was not one of my friends, that ho accused me of robbing him of five or six hundred pounds—I said it was perfect nonsense, because if I had robbed him of anything he would have had plenty of means to ask for it—he said that Giraud had told him that out of the 30,000 francs Asselin brought from Paris, he had only received 15,000, saying that I had kept 15,000 myself—I said that it was a perfect lie, and that if I had robbed Giraud of anything he would not have left without asking me for the difference—'when I told Templeman that Giraud had received all the money, he said that Giraud was a very great rogue because he told him that he had only received 15,000 francs, and he took him one-third of it, leaving to Templeman and another person 5,000 francs each—he said that the other person was a banker's clerk; the 15,000 francs had been divided between Templeman, Giraud and the clerk—Templeman said he would not do any more business with. Giraud, because having taken the trouble to bring the business to a certain point, he thought it was a shame of Giraud to rob them afterwards—he said "If I have any more business, I will call upon you instead of going to Giraud"—I said I would not like the business, because I could not understand that the business in which the proceeds were to be divided was an honest one—he said "Oh, you are a child, you don't understand business, there is no fear at all"—I said "You say there is no fear, anyone would have known that the proceeds were to be divided, and in what case would poor Asseliu be"—he said it was all perfectly arranged that nothing could happen to Asselin—he said, through a money lender in Union Court, he knew a clerk of a bank who was in difficulties, and through that clerk he had certain information which enabled him to do the kind of business he was doing, Asselin went over to Paris to cash a cheque there, but there was no danger for him at all, because he did not go to the counter and ask for the money, but he did go and say "Here is a cheque, cash it, and when you have received the news from London that the cheque has been paid, then I will call and fetch the money;" and at the same time that he did so that they were looking out here in London to know from the clerk at the bank if the cheque was paid or not; if it would not have been paid in London, Asselin would have been prevented in Paris from going back to the bank to receive the money—I am not quite certain whether Temple<lb></lb>man told me that he was in Paris with Giraud, but he said that he told</p>

               <p>Giraud when the cheque was paid, and Giraud told Asselin, and he went and fetched the money—I don't know whether he sent a telegram to Giraud, or whether he went to Paris with him—Templeman told me that some one was in the bank when Assclin received the money, that Asselin left the bank and drove off in a cab or carriage, and from that time he was missed in Paris—he also told me that between the time that Asselin presented the cheque at the bank and the time for fetching the money he had changed his hotel—I knew before that that Assclin had gone to Paris to get some money on a certain paper, but I did not know, until that conversation with Templeman, whether it was a cheque or a bill, or what it was—I did not know Hawkins the clerk at all—from the time of the conversation with Templeman to the time of his being taken into custody, I saw Asselin frequently.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. Giraud asked me to go to Paris on some financial transaction—that was not at all in the way of my business; I am a merchant, I was then a commission agent—I was doing business then in my own name, for myself—I did business for nobody but myself—I did not ask him what the nature of the transaction was, because I declined it altogether; I had not the least idea what it was—it was long after that that I went to see them off by the train—I had only known Giraud about six months at that time, I had very seldom seen him—I did not know what ho was—I did not know whether he had got plenty of money, or if he was poor—I had known Asselin for some time—I knew he was not a man of wealth, I knew ho was poor—I was certain that the 30,000 francs was not his, it was merely entrusted to have—if it had been 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should not have been more surprised than at its being 30,000 francs; I thought he was an honest man, it was not his own money, it was only entrusted to him; I knew that from Giraud first and from him afterwards—I did not know at all what Giraud's means were, but I knew perfectly well that Asselin was only acting as an agent for Giraud—he told me it belonged to Giraud—I had seen Giraud at my office an hour or two before, and he said that Asselin had not come back, and he was going to New Cross to see if he was at home, and if he came to my place to tell him he would return and see him there—he said that Asselin was coming with 30,000 francs—he did not say that it belonged to him, he did not say at that time who it belonged to, but an hour or two afterwards he told me that the money did belong to him and somebody else—he afterwards came back in a state of excitement, saying that he had missed Asselin in Paris; I had not then got the 30,000 francs—he did not come to me after I was in possession of the money; if he did it was only for a few minutes—I told him I would not give up the money to him without the presence of Asselin; Asselin told me not to part with it without his presence—I did not find out who the third party was to whom it belonged; I did not wait till he came on the scene; I had the money from Asselin, and I had only to return it to Asselin—I had no share of it, certainly not—I had 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was no share of the 30,000 francs, I got the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Asselin, it was part of his commission, he owed me about 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time—he was ill more than once before, and when he was ill I lent him some money—I was not a bankrupt in 1872, I had money to lend—I got it in my business—when Asseliu gave me the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said "Here is 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the money I owe you"—no I O U passed between us—I did not give him a receipt for the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think he paid me in English money, I don't know—Giraud said, but not to me, that I had</p>

               <p>kept half the 30,000 francs; he charged me with stealing it; he said so to Templeman, if Templeman told me the truth—I had such a little amount of prospect from Giraud, and such a low opinion of him at that time, that whatever he would think or say of me would be quite equal to me—he never accused me of stealing the money, I was told by Templeman that he did—I took no means to put it right, my character was not affected by such a charge—I had heard before that that I was accused of keeping some of the money, and I met Giraud and Asselin together at the corner of Cornhill and said, "What does this rumour mean?" and they said it was all nonsense, they never did say a word of the kind, it was not true—Giraud himself told me so—I could only see him accidentally because I did not know where he was living.</p>

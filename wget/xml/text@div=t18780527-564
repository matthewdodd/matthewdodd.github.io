                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Hornsey Lane, Islington—on Monday afternoon, 13th May, I was going along Hornsey Road; it rained very hard and I had an umbrella up—I saw a man sheltering in the houses, and perhaps two minutes afterwards I heard footsteps behind me and felt a hand over my nose and some mud came into my mouth—I put my hand up to my neck and found that my locket and chain were gone—I had seen the reflection of them in the glass when I posted a letter five minutes before—I screamed "Stop thief" and turned round and saw the same man who I saw sheltering in the houses—it was the prisoner I am quite certain—a man came and ran after him; I lost sight of him, but he was brought back to me and I sent for a policeman—my locket and chain were worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I could see the prisoner when he was under a doorway and he could see me—the locket hung round my neck—it was gold and had a very solid snap—in playing with it it would come off with a very hard pull, and this was a very hard pull, it pulled my jacket to pieces—I saw the prisoner's face when I turned round; he was not trying to kiss me—I had never seen him before—I do not think he was drunk—I was somewhat confused—I looked down at my feet—I did not run after him, I shouted "Stop thief"—the ground was muddy—I looked down, but the locket and chain were not there—I did not make a strict search—no building materials were about—it was an ordinary road, muddy after rain—when the prisoner was brought back he never spoke to me, he just looked at me and then fell down on the ground—this was at Hornsey Rise, opposite the brickfield.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 32, Naylor Street, Caledonian Road—on 13th May, between 4 and 5 p.m., I was near Hornsey Road, taking shelter under a bush; I heard a scream, went round the bush, and saw the lady standing, but no one by her—she had her hand<lb></lb>kerchief up to her face and a little dirt on her face—I saw a man running across a field and ran after him, about 400 yards; he fell into some water and I had to assist him to get out—I gave him in custody—I believe the prisoner is the man, but I cannot swear to him—I did not tell him why I caught him—he said nothing—I believe I said before the Magistrate that he said "Oh, don't; pray don't"—there were half a dozen men in the field—the prisoner was through the hedge when I first saw him—he ran as much like a half-drunken man as I ever saw—when I got him out of the water he could not walk.</p>

I am a bricklayer, of Westfield Road, Hornsey—on 13th May I was in some unfinished houses and heard cries of "Stop thief," about 50 yards off—I saw a man running across the brickfield and ran after him about 400 yards; he fell into some water, and I helped to pull him out—he had not strength to do anything, and did not try to get away—I did not say before the Magistrate that he tried to get away after he got into the water; I said that he was trying to get up the bank and slipped into the water.</p>

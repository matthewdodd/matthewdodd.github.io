            . The prisoner was in my service from Christmas till he was taken; up - he was to receive money, and to give an account of it was as soon as he came home. On the 24th of May I asked if he had received any money from Logan, and he said they owned me nothing - he had not accounted to me for what was paid on the 10th or the 17th.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner: I asked him why he had not paid his master the 5s. he had received on that Sunday - he said that was not all, he had to account for 2l. he owed his master.</p>
               <p>MR. NICHOLLS. I did not allow him to owe me any money - he should account every night, and we took what money we could get of him - sometimes we could not get any.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor was in the habit of debiting him for all beer he carried out, and deducting the amount from his wages, as he frequently gave the customers credit.</p>
               <p>MR. NICHOLLS re-examined. Q. Did you stop his wages? A. I never had an opportunity of doing it - he sold beer, and took the money: some nights we could not get above 3s. or 4s. of him - I was to have given him 4s. a week, but he never applied for it; he was to sell beer on my account.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you dealt with the witness before the prisoner came into your service? A. No; she had not been in the neighbourhood: I knew the prisoner owned me money, and he was scolded for not bringing in his money - we knew he had taken more money every week, and said there were no wages due to him.</p>

            . I was a watchman in Whitecross street. Going up Bowling-alley, about three o'clock that morning, I found the woman's window open. I saw some panes of glass had been broke, and about twenty or thirty yards from the window, I saw this box lying. I took it up, and delivered it to Mr. Clark, the constable of the night: we examined it: there were the things mentioned in the indictment. We could not awake the woman: there was a slim man got in at the window: he awaked her. She came down stairs: we went in: there was a candle stuck to the wood; had it been left alight, it might have set fire to the house.</p>

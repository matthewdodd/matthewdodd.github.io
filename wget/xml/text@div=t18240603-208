            . The prisoner came to lodge in my master's house; on the 22d of May, he was to pay 9 d. for his lodging. I slept in the next room to his; my boots were by the side of my bed, and the coat on a chair. I got up about half-past six o'clock; he got up about half-past seven; directly he went away I went up and missed them, and a sheet was gone from the bed I slept in - he never came to the house again, but was taken in about a fortnight. I have not seen the property since.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 2d of June the prisoner came to the office, and inquired for an officer of the name of Godfrey, and asked what time we left Shoreditch, and said he wanted to speak privately to us. He then said that a lodger had stolen a coat, a pair of boots, and a sheet - and then said,</p>
               <p>"I am the person. I have sold the coat for 8 s., the boots for 4 s., and the sheet for 3 s." I asked him why he did it - he said through distress - and he gave himself up, because he expected to be taken, for he had been at Worship-street a short time before.</p>

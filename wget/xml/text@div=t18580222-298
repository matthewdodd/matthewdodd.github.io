                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of Kennett's Wharf. On 1st Jan., this year, I went into partnership with Mr. Mesnard—the prisoner has been in my employment five or six years—his duty, among other things, before 1st Jan., was to take charge of the cheque book, and he invariably went to the bank for me—I bank at the London Joint Stock Bank—after Jan., Mr. Mesnard was to keep the cheque book, but the prisoner still went to the bank as before, and brought me the pass book occasionally—I have one other clerk, Mr. Poisson; his duties were chiefly to attend to the French correspondence—the prisoner kept the cheque book until Mr. Mesnard was initiated into the business—before 1st Jan., the prisoner filled up the cheques for my signature, and after that, Mr. Mesnard, but sometimes the prisoner—the bank honours my signature alone—I had my pass book on Monday, 18th Jan., and again on 27th Jan.—the prisoner was at business on the 19th, and was in and out all day on business—he left on the 22nd, on a plea of illness—when I looked at the pass book on the 27th, I discovered an entry, "1051, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 19th Jan."—I had not signed a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that day, but I had about that date; I cannot say when, because I have not got my cheque book here, but it was paid on the following day—(<hi rend="italic">The cheque book was sent for</hi>)—the only two cheques for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I had drawn in Jan.,</p>

On 18th Jan., as well as I recollect, I sent the prisoner for the pass book, and again on the 27th, and gave him a cheque to get cashed at the bank—I went out, and he had returned when I came back—my attention was afterwards directed by the prisoner to the pass book, in my office; I asked him if he had brought the pass book, and he pointed to it; I did not take it up immediately—about half an hour after<lb></lb>wards, the prisoner told me that he felt very unwell, and, if I had nothing particular for him to do, he should like to go—I told him he might go, and he went—while he was away, I took up the pass book and examined it; I noticed the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque of the 19th almost immediately—I found a debit of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against me—I examined the pocket of the book, but found no cheque corresponding to that amount; all the other cheques were there—I saw the prisoner next morning, and told him I wanted the return cheque from the bank, corresponding to the amount in the pass book—he looked a little confused, and said, "I have not got it; I know nothing about it"—he made two or three answers—he spoke to me during the day several times about it, and I spoke to him—I had then been to the bank to make inquiries, and I told him that the cheque had been changed for notes; he made no reply, but some time afterwards he told me, that if the cheque had been exchanged for gold, he did not see how we could trace it.</p>

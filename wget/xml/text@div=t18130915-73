               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

On Sunday morning master sent me into the field to see if any body was milking the cows; the mare and colt were there, the colt had her bowels out; a man was sent to let him know; about eight o'clock I let him know; he said I did it; I said I did not; I cannot say whether the cow did or not. One of the cows had lost her calf, it was vicious; she might have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Kimpton. Q. Did you observe the wound - A. Yes, it was cut with a knife; it was not torn as a cow's horn would have ripped it up.</p>

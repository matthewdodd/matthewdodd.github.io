                  </hi> I am a widow, living in paradise-street, St. Mary<lb></lb>lebone; I left lodgings; the prisoner was lodging with me for a fortnight and five days. On the 26th of March I was cleaning the stairs—the prisoner was sitting in her own room—I never left my room from twelve o'clock till two—nobody was in my room but the prisoner—the two rooms open into each other—I had a small trunk in one room, in which I had placed seven sovereigns and three halves to pay my rent—when I went up stairs to do my work the trunk was locked up, and the key in my pocket—I had seen the sovereigns safe between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—they were in a small tin box in the trunk—I do not know that the prisoner knew it, because there was no</p>

The prisoner came on the 16th of February in the evening; two boys came into my shop and told me a man had stolen a cheese; and they told me which way he was gone. I went after him, the boys went with me and shewed me the prisoner: he had the whole Cheshire cheese under his arm and had some pieces in a pocket handkerchief; and their lay a Gloucester cheese at his feet. He was standing against a door near a scuffle that there was in Rose-street. When I came up to him he dropped the Cheshire cheese and ran away; I pursued him and called for assistance. I took him to the office in Litchfield-street before Justice Welch; the boys that informed me of it took the cheese back to my shop.</p>

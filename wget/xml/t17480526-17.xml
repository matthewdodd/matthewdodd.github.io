               <p>Q. What have you to say about the silver tankard?</p>
               <p>Humphrys . On Monday last I went to Honey-lane market; and when I came back, my tankard was taken away; and on Tuesday morning the tankard was advertised.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. About four o'clock, and I returned, I believe, between five and six.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I did not miss it till half an hour after eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the tankard?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I left it upon the dresser about four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you missed it?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I could not do any thing; I asked my housekeeper where the tankard was?</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your tankard?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. Yes, and please your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your tankard?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. The Prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. She confessed it before my Lord Mayor. I had a suspicion of her, and I asked my house-keeper, if such a person had been at my house? My house-keeper told me she had not been there; but my boy told me she had been there. I sent for the Prisoner on Wednesday, and she came to my house, and there she confessed the taking the tankard. My house-keeper told me, she came to borrow a cloak: What! said I, to steal my tankard!</p>
               <p>Q. What were the Prisoner's words when she confessed it?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. She said she had pawned it in East-Smithfield, and she shewed me the house where the tankard was pawned. I went and asked for it, but the tankard was not shewn to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was that?</p>
               <p>Humphrys . Mrs. Heath's .</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mrs. Heath say?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. She is here in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it at Mrs. Heath's?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I did not see it at Mrs. Heath's; I carried the young woman at the bar to Tower-Hill, and there a gentlewoman that is here, and I, and the coachman we went with, saw the tankard.</p>

I went with Mrs. Humphrys to Mrs. Heath's, and she would not own that she had taken the tankard in as a pawn; but she owned at last, that she had bought it outright, and had given 4 l. 18 s. for it; 4 s. 6 d. an ounce; but then Mrs. Heath would not give us the tankard without we paid the money down; and I was obliged to get a warrant from justice Rickards, to take up Mrs. Heath and demand the tankard of her; and the warrant was served upon her, and then she brought the tankard forthcoming, and it was delivered into

               <p>Heath. I gave her 5 l. 18 s. I gave her two guineas and a half, and half a crown. I am not a pawnbroker, I keep a silversmith's shop.</p>

               <p>Heath. She told me a plausible story, and said her husband gave it her to sell to pay her debts. It has been reported in my neighbourhood, that I bought it for forty shillings.</p>

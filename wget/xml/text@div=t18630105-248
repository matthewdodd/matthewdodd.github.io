I am the wife of William Atkins of Charlton—on 18th December, I gave the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at my house to get two third-class railway-tickets from Charlton to Woolwich, to save my crossing the line—I went to the station, and he gave them to me and two others, green ones, which he said would fetch me back again—I took one of my children with me—we returned at four minutes to 10, and I gave up the two third-class tickets the prisoner had given me to Mr. Rastin—I did notice what was on them—they were whole tickets.</p>

I am a police-sergeant attached to the South Eastern Railway Company—I took the prisoner in custody between 12 and 1 o'clock on the day on 18th December, at Mr. Atkins' house, 3, Church-lane—I told him I took him for stealing five third-class railway-tickets; one on the 9th, and four on the 13th, and giving them over to his landlady and her children, for them to use between Woolwich Arsenal and Charlton<lb></lb>station—he said "The only two tickets I obtained for my landlady on Saturday night, were two that I purchased at the booking-office to convey her from Charlton to Woolwich Arsenal"—Caroline Atkins, who was present, said, "Jim, you had much better speak the truth"—I cautioned him that if he made any further answer to the charge, it would be used in evidence before the Magistrate—he said, "I hope you will forgive me this time, as two of the tickets that I took on Saturday night I burnt on Sunday morning, the other two were used by my landlady to convey her and a little girl from the Arsenal to Charlton: I also remember giving the ticket to Mary Ann Atkins on the 9th"—Saturday was the 13th—I took him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station-master at Charlton station, on the North Kent line—the prisoner has been a porter there for about two years—he occasionally assists me in collecting the tickets from the passengers arriving there—as soon as he collects them it is his duty to bring them into the office, and they are put into a box and sent to London—the third-class fare from Charlton to Woolwich is 1d; there are no return tickets between those stations—the up tickets are green, and the down are brown—they cannot take tickets at Charlton station to bring people back from Woolwich Arsenal—on 9th December the prisoner collected from the train due at thirty-four minutes past 5, and after its arrival, about 6 o'clock, I looked at the place where the tickets collected ought to be deposited—the prisoner had not brought them into the office, and I found them placed on the signal-box—I examined them, and there was one missing—I judge of that, because there are consecutive numbers, and 2341, I think it is, was not there—there were the numbers before and after it—Mary Ann Atkins came by the train arriving at Charlton at half-past 7 from Woolwich Arsenal, and I collected from her that identical ticket—the prisoner was employed in the station on 13th December to col<lb></lb>lect tickets, and after the arrival of the 5.34 train, I looked to see if any tickets were missing, and missed Nos. 2661, and 2662, 2663, and 2604—Mrs. Atkins and a child arrived at 10.3—my brother collected the tickets then and I went to him and took out of his hand the tickets 2663 and 2664, which I handed over to the constable—these are the three tickets I speak of—I do do not know what has become of Nos. 2661 and 2662—I commu<lb></lb>nicated with my superiors, and the prisoner was given in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

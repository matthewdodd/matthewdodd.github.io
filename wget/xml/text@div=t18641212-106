                  </hi>. I am a sailor—on 23d November, about 10 o'clock at night, I was in the Boyal Standard public-house, Wells-street—I had a com<lb></lb>panion with me; he has since gone away—I took him in there to give him a glass of ale—two girls followed us in and sat down on my right-hand side—the prisoner came in; I had come over in the same ship with him—he made use of the young man's pipe—I told him to lay it down; it was none of mine, or he would be welcome to a smoke out of it—he then said that I had got his girl alongside of me—I said I had not—he sat down by the side of another coloured man, and the first thing he did was to make a grab at my throat—he then took a knife out of his left trousers-pocket and stabbed me in the right oye—before he did that he said he would have some white-livered son of a b-'s life before he went away, and he was going away on Friday—I was lying across a table at the time I was stabbed—he also kicked me on the left shoulder and on the chest, three kicks—I had not abused him—we had had no quarrel—I shook hands with him when be came into the house—I asked if he had a ship—he said yes—I asked him where he was going—he said to Hong Kong.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The cut he has got over the eye was done crossing the line, coming home. I did not do it. I struck him twice with my fist, not with a knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not meet with any accident crossing the line—I had a cut be<lb></lb>fore this, but not in the same place—the prisoner was about half-drunk—I am quite sure he had a knife, and a sharp one.</p>

I am a surgeon in Whitechapel—on 23d November, I examined Curran—I found a wound of the upper eye-lid of the right eye, about an inch in length, and a smaller one in the inner orbit of the frontal bone of the same eye—they could not have been caused by the blow of a fist—it was a fresh wound—it must have been caused by a knife, or some sharp instrument.</p>

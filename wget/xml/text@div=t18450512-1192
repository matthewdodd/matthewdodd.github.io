                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Shooter's Hul-road—the prisoner was in my service. On Friday morning, the 4th of April, I gave him a gelding, and told him to go to the Catherine Wheel inn with it, and to see the ostler, who would direct him to where I had the gelding from—I had bought it, but did not like it, and wanted to return it—he was to take it to the man, and if he did not take it in, he was to take it back to the ostler at the Catherine Wheel—I saw the prisoner again on the Sunday morning—he said he had left the horse all right at Mr. Adams's, the man I had it of—I said, "Very well"—I had changed another horse away, and was to give 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this one, but it was not sound, and I returned it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Catherine Wheel in the Borough. On Friday morning, 4th of April, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came with a hone—he asked if I knew it—I said "No," hut I looked again, and said I did—he asked if I knew where Mr. Adams lived—I said yes, about 300 yards from the Catherine Wheel, the second public-house on the right hand—he said he should go with tire horse there, and return and give me an answer about it, but he did not return.</p>

The prisoner came to me that morning to sell the horse, as he, said, for the best price he could get for it—it was a glandered horse, and unfit to be about—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and he gave me a receipt.</p>

            . about eleven at Night. My Mistress bid me tell my Master she was gone to Acton. She went away and the Prisoner pack'd up the Goods in the Bed Tick, and carried them to the Coach where my Mistress was.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you offer to stop him?</p>
               <p>Ratsy. No; I might as well stop my Master, for my Mistress liked the Prisoner better than she did my Master, tho' he was a poor shabby Fellow before she run my Master in Debt to maintain him. The Shirt that is now upon his Back, she took up upon Tick, and my Master must be forced to pay for it. The Prisoner and she were frequently a Junketting together at our House in my Master's absence; but my Master coming home one time sooner than was expected the Prisoner run down into the Kitchen and got out thro' the Alley; she used to make me wash his Linnen. She sent me once to pawn forty four Ounces of Plate, where I told her that her extravagant Ways had made my Master very uneasy, and would be the ruin of him, What's that to you? says she, It's none of your business to meddle or make tho' you were to see me play the Whore. And so I had got my answer. And the next Day the Prisoner came into the Market, and shewed a Green Purse of Gold in a Bravado - He was taken up the Day after the Robbery, and I hear that she goes to visit him in Newgate.</p>

He knew it well enough and and has bought Goods for us both.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor - I did buy some Goods for them at first - But when I found how things went. I forbid him my House - The Night that I was robb'd, I heard that he and she lay together at a Night House, tho' he has got a Wife of his own. When I went to enquire for them they were gone to Gravesend, whither I went and found most of my Goods and brought them back; but I left my Wife and other things of little or no value behind me.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called the Prosecutors Wife Elizabeth, and three other Butchers to speak in his Defence. The Wife was not admitted to give her Evidence.

               <p>- CHAPMAN sworn. - Q. How old are you? - A. I was twelve the 2d of last February.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a good or a bad thing to tell a lie? - A. A bad thing.</p>
               <p>Q. If you call God to witness that you speak the truth, and you do not, you will call his vengeance to punish you; therefore if you do not speak the truth, you are liable to be punished both here and hereafter, do you know that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you my dear? - A. I live at home with my father and mother; my father is a messenger's man, he lives in Plumtree-street, at No. 6. I saw both the prisoners standing at Mr. Mardewall's door, I was sitting next door to Mr. Mardewall's; I know them both again, it was on a Saturday between three and four o'clock; I saw the little one (Rose) lay hold of a piece of cotton that was at the door, and pull it down and wrap it up in her apron; I did not see the other touch any thing.</p>
               <p>- PICKERING sworn. - I am a patrol of Bow-street, I live in the neighbourhood; the last witness came and informed me that there were some thieves at the prosecutor's door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, you found them both there? - A. Yes; the little one acknowledged to me that it was those two that did the robbery.</p>
               <p>Shorter's defence. I was going down Rathbone-place; a woman asked me, as I was going by the pawnbroker's, to go of an errand for her; she said, I will give you sixpence to go in and pledge this new gown for me; I did; I was in the shop about five minutes before the pawnbroker could serve me; he was writing the ticket, and just as he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180102"></xptr>going to lay hold of it to measure it, the gentleman came in, and said it was his property; when I came out the woman was gone, I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Rose's defence. I was coming down Drury-lane; a young man tapped me on the shoulder, and said I was the person that he wanted; I had been doing of nothing I told him.</p>

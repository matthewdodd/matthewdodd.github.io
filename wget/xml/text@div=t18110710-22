            . I keep the Weavers Arms public-house in Hay's-court, St. Ann's parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving a quantity of silver at any time of Edwards - A. Yes, on Friday the 6th of June, about half after nine o'clock in the evening; the silver was tied up in a cloth; he counted out the silver on the table before he tied it up; there were eleven pounds worth of silver; there were a good many dollars, I do not know how many. I was to keep it, and his brother was to call for it the next morning; I put it in the till in my bar; at twelve o'clock I told my wife to take it out of the till to take it up stairs; I saw my wife take it out of the till ten minutes after twelve, I looked at the clock at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with it when she took it out of the till - A. She put it on a small box by the side of the fire place, then she went to get some warm water, and forgot the money; I went up before her, and she came up stairs after me; the last time I saw it was in my wife's hands before she put it on the box. Then she and me went to bed about a quarter after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner Macdonald - A. Yes, the prisoner was my servant in the house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she was gone to bed before you went to bed - A. Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning - A. About five minutes before seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether or no she was up before you - A. Yes, she was, and had the tap-room and parlour cleaned out, and the door wide open; my wife did not get up till eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up to bed at a quarter after twelve was the house shut up - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house besides yourselves and the servant maid - A. There were two or three butchers that lodged in the house, they were in bed some time before that, there were nobody else in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the money when you got up - A. No, I did not until Edwards's brother called for it nigh ten o'clock, and then I found it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry about it - 
               <persName id="t18110710-22-person225">A. </persName>
            Yes, my wife said she had left it there; I spoke to the prisoner about it at ten o'clock, I asked her whether she had seen it when she was cleaning out the tap-room, she denied it. She had seen the silver counted out the night before, and given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find out where the money was - A. Yes, the day after I found it out part of it at least; there was a washerwoman that the prisoner recommended; that washerwoman left the house about eight o'clock in the evening, before the money was brought into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the washerwoman lived - A. No, I did not. On the next day I took the prisoner and all the butchers that lodged in the house to Bow-street to be examined; I asked the prisoner where the washerwoman lived, she said she did not know; then she said she lived at Chelsea; two officers went up to Chelsea, they could not find any such person. After they came back she would not tell where she lived. On Saturday morning I found out the washerwoman at 34, Rupert-street; she lived there, I went to Bow street office, got a search warrant, and took two officers with me; we found in a box in the washerwoman's room, a cloth, and six pounds one shilling tied upin the cloth, all silver, and we found twelve shillings and six pence in the washerwoman's pocket. Limbrick the officer has the cloth and the money.</p>
               <p>MARGERET CAMERON. Q. You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the account that he gave, do you recollect taking this cloth with the silver out of the till for the purpose of carrying it up stairs - A I did, and I put it on the box by the fire place intending to take it up stairs; I went to get some hot water out of the boiler, and forgot it and went up stairs without it.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you did not get up till after your husband - A. No, I did not get up till after eight o'clock, it was not discovered till near ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the washerwoman being at your house that day - A. Yes, she went away about eight o'clock in the evening, before the man brought the money. She was not there afterwards.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the Friday the prosecutor brought the prisoner down to the office; I searched her and found nothing on her. She denied having any knowledge of the money. On Saturday I went up to 34, Rupert-street, I asked the woman of the house whether she had any box belonging to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What woman - A. Mrs. Molaney. She told me she had no box there of hers; I found a box belonging to Mrs. Molaney; I shook the box and found a rattling of silver; the box was locked; I went for a smith and had the lock picked; Mrs. Molaney was present at the time; she was bad in bed; in her box I found six pounds one shilling in silver, tied up in this cloth. After I had found the money I went to the prisoner I asked her where this washerwoman lived; before I told her I had got the money; she said she did not know where she lived; I took the towell out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100016"></xptr>pocket, then she began to cry, and begged for mercy; I told her where I had found it, she then said she would tell me all about it; she said the washerman came there very soon that morning, and she told her that she had found some money; she was going to take it up stairs, but the washerwoman called her back, and said it was better for her to keep it, and with that she did; they both went out together, and she gave it to the washerwoman tied up as it was; then when she got to 34. Rupert-street she took the money from the washerwoman, and carried it up stairs, and put it in the box, and locked it, and left the key on the mantle shelf. There was no key to be found.</p>

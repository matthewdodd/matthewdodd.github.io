                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge in Johnson-court Shadwell. I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Success</hi> on 22nd July coming from Port Philip—we were on the high seas—the prisoner was a passenger on board—on 22nd or 23rd July I was on deck playing with some shipmates—the prisoner was on deck—we generally used to call him by the <hi rend="italic">nick-name</hi> of "<hi rend="italic">King John</hi> "—I asked him how he would feel when he got to Kilrush—I did not call him by any name—he said he would have his revenge, and he went down below—I and my shipmates continued to play on the deck; and I happened, while we were <hi rend="italic">larking,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">heave</hi> myself down, and my-left-leg got over the hatchway, and before I could get my foot up again the prisoner stabbed me in the leg with a knife—I saw him do it—I did not say anything to him, but I went away after the doctor, who was dining in the cuddy—he dressed the wound—it went that depth that it cut one artery in the leg—I was bad for three months and twenty days—the inflammation flew up the leg, and I had it opened again—I was only able to work three weeks on the passage home—I think I once asked the prisoner why he did it, and he gave me no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I was mate, on board the <hi rend="italic">Success.</hi> On 22nd or 23rd July, Cato came to me on the quarter-deck with his leg bleeding—as soon as we had bandaged the wound I had him taken to the forecastle—it was a very severe wound, an inch and a half long, about six inches above the ankle—he has never done duty on deck since, only little jobs I have given him to do—I went to the prisoner and took a knife and a razor from him—I asked him why he stabbed the man—he gave me no answer—there was a little blood on the blade of the knife—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have examined the prisoner while he has been in prison, and I come to the conviction that he has been the butt of ridicule to the sailors—he gave me a very clear account of everything—I could not think he is insane—he argued with me well, and said he only defended himself—I think he is of sound mind.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Steadman, who owed Mr. Hunt 3l. 2s. On the 3d of February I took it to Mr. Hunt's warehouse, and paid it to the prisoner. I think I gave him two sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and two shillings. I am sure there was three pounds in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and two shillings. He went up to the desk, and wrote a receipt, which he gave me - this is it(looking at it).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the desk higher than the floor? A. Yes; I saw him writing the receipt; I swear I paid him some sovereigns, and there were two shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNT. The paper produced is in the prisoner's writing; it is a bill for the goods. 3l. 2s. - and at the bottom he has written, "Feb. 3, By Cash, 3l. 2s. Jas. Carroll."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Hunt never sent me for the money.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNT. I sent him for it previous to the 3d of February, and again on the 16th; I found, on the 21st, that it was paid. I am quite certain that he never brought it to account.</p>

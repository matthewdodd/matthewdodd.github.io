I keep the Oakley Arms public house, 22, Hall Street, Goswell Road—on 20th August, the prisoner came there with another man, and asked for two three pennyworth's of brandy—another man came in after that, and had a half-quartern of gin—he drank that, and then had another half-quartern—he paid for the gin and brandy—five others then came in and they had some beer—the prisoner had another half-quartern of gin—he asked me if I could give him a half-sovereign for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of sil<lb></lb>ver—I did so, and gave him a good half-sovereign from the drawer—I then said "The gin is not paid for"—he said "I have halfpence enough for that"—he put down a few halfpence on the counter, but not enough—and said "You must give me my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back again"—he laid down a half-sovereign and I saw at once, it was not the one I had given him—I took it up, and found it was bad—I caught him by the arm, and said "This won't do"—he tore himself away from me, and rushed out of the house—a few minutes after he came into another box, and I called one of the constables, and said, "That is the man"—he was taken, and I charged him with passing the bad half-sovereign—I gave it to the constable.</p>

The two prisoners at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176210200003"></xptr> bar were standing by the side of the street. They called us to come in to the house. Dempsey is the mistress of the house. They said we should have a good fire to dry ourselves. We went in and sat down by the fire, and called for some beer to drink. They told me, I had better stay and sleep there all night. Walker went to bed along with me. At going to-bed she took my buckles and put them under the pillow, and my watch and sleeve buttons into a little paper bag over the head of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this with your consent?</p>
               <p>Ferdinand. It was. I took them out and delivered them to her to take care of them for me while I slept. I waked in the middle of the night, and found no girl, no watch, no buckles, no nothing at all. The door was shut and locked when I went to sleep; Dempsey locked it. I broke the door because it was locked. I made a noise, and Dempsey came with the key. I asked for the girl, and said I had lost my watch and things. After that, I went to sleep again, as I could get no candle. The mistress told me, she knew nothing of the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your messmates?</p>
               <p>Ferdinand. They went away after I was in bed. I never found my things since.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutor when the two prisoners called us in. I cannot tell the day; I believe it is about five weeks ago. We went in, and sent for some beer. Walker told the prosecutor he had better stay in the house along with her all night. He went to-bed with her; I saw them in bed together. I saw her have his buckles, and put them under his pillow, and put the watch and buttons, which he took out of his sleeves, in a paper bag at the head of the bed. I shook hands with him after he was in bed, and bid him a good night, and went away. When I went away I left Dempsey sitting on the bed-side by them. The next morning I went to the same house to him, and found he had lost the things mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Walker?</p>
               <p>Crocket. No; she was then in Newgate: she had a husband or a man that she kept there, and was gone to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give the watch and things to Walker, or how did she come by them?</p>
               <p>Crocket. He delivered them to her, for her to take care of them for him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had a warrant from Justice Berry to take up the prisoners for stealing the things mentioned to in the indictment. I went to Dempsey's house, and asked for Walker. Dempsey said she did not know. I carried Dempsey to Justice Berry; he ordered me to lock her up in the watch house: this was the Saturday, the day after this thing happened. Then I went after Walker; there came a man to me, and told me, she was gone to Newgate. I went and found her there: she swore a great oath, and said, I thought what it was for when the turnkey called me down. She asked where the man was. I then had only said I had a warrant against her; I had not said what it was for: after this, I said it was for taking a man's watch and buckles. I said, if you will tell where the things are you shall not be hurt. She said, if I would carry her to

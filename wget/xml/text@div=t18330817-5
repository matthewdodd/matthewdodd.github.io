               <p>JOSEPH DAY. I live in Kingsland-road. On Sunday, the 23rd of June, between twelve and one o'clock in the night, I was in Norton Falgate, returning from Shoreditch- I was walking along in the road, about a yard from the pavement, with my hands in my pocket, and saw the two prisoners standing on the pavement; I am sure they are the men - I do not know their names - one stepped off the pavement, and knocked my hat over my eyes, and the other put his foot out, and threw me down in the kennel; and as soon as I was down, one of them put his hand into my pocket, and took my money out - I felt his hand in my pocket; I had three shillings there, and some half-pence - they were in my right hand breeches pocket - I called the policeman, who came to me directly - they saw the policeman coming and one said to the other, "We must cut, for the policemen are coming;" he said, "Here is the policeman" - they started off - both ran away, and the policeman laid hold of one of them, and took him to the station-house - I went with him - I swear I saw sufficient of them both to know them again - I had had one glass of rum, and a pint of beer, about twelve o'clock at night - I had been working hard - I had nothing else; I was muddled, having been unwell; I had been under two doctor's hands - I had never seen the prisoners before to my knowledge - I swear they are the men.</p>
               <p>Murphy. Q. What time did you give charge of me? A. Between twelve and one o'clock - only one of them was at the station-house; that was Murphy - the policeman took the other in the morning.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 23rd of June, I was in Norton-falgate; it was Sunday morning, between twelve and one o'clock - I heard the cry of Police, and on looking on the other side of the way, I saw the prosecutor laying on his back on the curb; I ran across - somebody said, "Here is the police" - the men got up from him; one ran towards the City, and the others down the Alley - there were three or four of them ran down the Alley - I saw about six men about him; they all ran away- I followed down the Alley, and took Murphy in the entrance of a little Alley which comes into Norton-falgate - I had not lost sight of him, and am sure he was one of the party that was round him, but I did not see his features - I said, "You have robbed the man;" he declared he had not; I gave him into custody, while I went in pursuit of the others down the Alley, but I did not succeed in taking them; I then came up the Alley, and received him from the other policeman - I took him to the station-house - on searching him, I found 1s. 8 1/2d. on him- on taking him from the station-house to the watch-house, he declared his innocence, and said I had taken the wrong man; I said, "Nonsense, you are one of the party;" and he said it was not him who robbed him, that it was a play-fellow of his - I am quite sure he was one of the party who were round him - the prosecutor appeared very confused, and quite insensible; he appeared frightened, for when I saw him on the ground, one or two were kneeling on him; he appeared as if he had been drinking - when he got to the station-house, he was quite correct in his statement, that was about ten minutes afterwards; the account he gave me was quite consistent with what I saw.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was at the station-house when Murphy was brought there; he had been locked up but a very few minutes before he asked to see the inspector; I asked what he wanted, he said "It is very hard for me to be locked up for nothing;" I said,"If the man is correct, you are here for something;" he said, "It was not me that robbed him, it was a person named Boyle;" that he was standing by, but Boyle was the person that robbed him, and he thought as he stood at the corner, and saw the man robbed, it would be the better way for him to walk away - he gave me a direction where to find Boyle, and a description of him; and I went down on Sunday morning, about five o'clock, to look for Boyle; I found him in a public-house, near where Murphy had said I should find him - the description Murphy gave me of his person and residence was correct; he said he lived in Cock-alley, or Boar's-alley, on the first floor, and he mentioned the number; I found his account correct - I took Boyle, and put him in a separate cell from Murphy, and then called Murphy out, and said, "Is this the man you mean?" he said, "Yes, that is the man who robbed him, it is a hard case for me to be locked up for him" - Boyle made no answer, but went into his cell - I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Boyle. Was I obliged to confess to him when I was taken?</p>
               <p>HENRY BARKER re-examined. There were about six men about the prosecutor - I am certain Murphy was one of the party; they were all round him, two or three standing up and the rest kneeling on him and nobody interfering to prevent it - I cannot say whether the prisoner were kneeling on him; the persons who knelt on him had their backs to me.</p>
               <p>Murphy's Defence. I am quite innocent; I was going home and I saw the prosecutor brought from Shoreditch by the party of men, and knocked down and robbed. I was going down the court when they were hustling about him, and I was going home when I was taken by the policeman, who said, "You must know something about it" - the inspector ordered me to be locked up on a charge of highway robbery, and in a few hours I said, it was a very hard case, and the policeman asked me, what I wanted of the inspector; I told him, and he went to look for Boyle - a young man named Dunnegan sent word to me in prison that he could not come up to speak for me without injuring the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Boyle's Defence. I wish to know when the prosecutor gave me into custody?</p>

            . I never gave him in custody at all - the two prisoner were on the pavement when I first saw them; I could see them distinctly - I did not see the other man; I was down in the kennel - I only saw the two prisoners before that.</p>
               <p>Boyle. I had witnesses here last Sessions, but it is too much trouble for them to come up again, and I have nobody to look after them - at Worship-street I called on Atfield to give me a character which he did; he had stopped me opposite Hoxton church with a quantity of linen, and asked Where I was going to take it to, I said, to Mrs. Hill, and I told him where I had brought it from, and he took me, and found everything correct.</p>

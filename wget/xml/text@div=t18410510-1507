                  </hi>. I am a recruit in the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich, On the 5th of May, about eight o'clock, I was in the Marquis of Granby public-house—the prisoner asked me if I would <hi rend="italic">swap</hi> caps with him—I told him I did not know—there were two or three more soldiers there, and they told me I must, and I did—my cap was not an Artillery cap, but this one, (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>,) which the prisoner brought, was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the Artillery. I left my cap in the barracks about eleven o'clock—the prisoner was in the barracks at the time—I left, and returned in half an hour—the cap was then gone, and the prisoner also—there was no person but him in the room when I was there—he had been in the regiment, but he was not then.</p>

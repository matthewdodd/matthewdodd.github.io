                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 73, Deptford Green—about 12 o'clock on Saturday night, 12th October, I was staying with Mr. and Mrs. Mabbitt—the prisoner is Mr. Mabbitt's brother-in-law—he came into the house and said "I have paid a debt for that Eliza, and if she does not pav</p>

I am a surgeon at 120, High Street, Deptford—I saw Coppin on the night of the 20th—my assistant dressed his wounds—on the Wednesday following I saw him again and examined him—I found several incised wounds, four on the left hand, one over the region of the stomach, a little to the left of the medial line, about half an inch deep; the other was on the left side, about a hand's breadth below the left nipple, near the region of the heart; that was a clean stab, I did not examine the depth of it; there was much blood, the wounds healed very unkindly—there was a wound on the first joint of the little finger of the left hand, one near the second finger, a short cut over the soft part of the hand, and a fourth across the back of the hand; they were all wounds which could have been caused by this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were all incised wounds—they would not have been caused by striking the hand against the wall.</p>

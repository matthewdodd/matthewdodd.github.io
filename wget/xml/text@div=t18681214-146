                  </hi>. I was an able seaman on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Mofussilite</hi>—the prisoner was the captain's son, and was the second mate—a young man named Charles James Dryhurst was a midshipman on board—on 23rd June, this year, the vessel was off Calcutta, and about 4.30 that morning, Dryhurst came up on deck, and was in the act of putting on his coat, when I heard the prisoner speak to him, but he made no answer at all—the prisoner then struck him—the first blow I saw was on the head—I could not see what part of the head, but I know it was not low down—his head was cut, and the blood was running, but he continued to stand—there was thin some scuffling on the hencoops, and there were several blows—while dawn I heard Dryhurst sing out, "Don't sir! don't sir! don't sir!" three times, and then he let out a loud piercing cry; he was partly on the hen<lb></lb>coop and partly against it—I was at the wheel, and did not see what was being done to him while he was crying out, I merely saw him from where I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140092"></xptr>
               <p>was standing—he got several blows from the prisoner while he was down, or in a reclining position, but I cannot state on what part of the body—the prisoner left him about five minutes afterwards, and went towards the bin<lb></lb>nacle to do something to it, and Dryhurst came to me—I then saw that he was bleeding from a cut on the front part of his head, above the temple—there were two more wounds at the back of his head, which were bleeding very slightly, they were not running—we had left Bombay about the latter end of May, or 1st June—Dryhurst's health was then apparently very good, he never complained to me; and he always performed his duty—after 23rd June his health began to decline every day, and he would stop suddenly, and say that he could not see, there was total darkness before him—he was not in a condition to do any work afterwards, he kept his bed until we arrived at Calcutta about 6th July—he then went into the hospital—I afterwards saw him dead in the dead house, he was carried there from the hospital—on the Sunday before the ship left, both me and the sail maker went to try to see the hospital doctor, but failed to do so, though we waited three hours—that was about a week after seeing the body—I also made a communication to a Magistrate in Calcutta on the Monday the ship was about to leave, the day before she was leaving—on the very day the deceased died I wrote a letter to his parents, and on my arrival in town I was met by his father and brother.</p>

SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first join the ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I joined her in Bombay, in December—she went from Bombay to Annesley Bay—she returned to Bombay before she went to Calcutta—I was at Bombay some weeks before our arrival at Calcutta—we left Bombay on the 5th or 6th of June—it is only about three weeks' voyage to Calcutta—we were lying at anchor off Calcutta about a week or ten days before the deceased was taken to the hospital—I do not remember the date of Dryhurst's death, but he had then been about six days in the hospital—the vessel left Calcutta about 28th July—she was a troop ship, of 1008 tons—her crew consisted of about thirty in all, and there were between 200 and 250 troops on board, besides soldiers' wives and children—the troops were conveyed from Bombay—there was illness on board, as usual in troop ships—the crew were bad for a day or two—there was a regimental doctor on board—there were as many as twelve deaths on board in the short voyage of three weeks, from Bombay to Calcutta, but only one man and one woman, all the rest were children—Dryhurst was not laid up with fever at Bombay that I am aware of—he was not, after I joined, occasionally unwell and under the doctor, to my knowledge; I always saw him going about his work, he might have been sick, but he never stated it to me—he was not ill, to my recollec<lb></lb>tion, on the voyage from Bombay to Calcutta—he did not complain of fever before these assaults were inflicted upon him—he may have had toothache, but nothing more—he might have a pain in the bowels—he was not off duty, to my knowledge, in consequence of illness before we left Bombay, but I was not in his watch, and had not much to do with him—I do not know that he was two days laid up, and excused from duty two or three days before the date I fix for this assault—I never heard of it before to-day—I did not state before the Magistrate that this occurred at 6 a.m.—I stated the bells, I stated my relief time—the mistake was made in one bell—it was either at the half hour or the forty-five minutes—I am not certain, because they are not punctual in striking the time—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>: "I was wrong in stating on my oath that it was 6 o'clock, it was</p>

               <p>4.30")—I told the Magistrate that it was 4.30, but they must have made a mistake in the bell—I made an information which was taken down in writing, and which I swore to before the prisoner was arrested—I stated that it was 4.30, or a few minutes after—there was light enough for me to see—I was relieved at 6 o'clock—Mr. Symes, the chief officer under the captain, came up just after this was over, and wanted to know what the row was about—I have not seen him here to-day, but I did yesterday—the prisoner and I were always on good terms—he made a row with me on the passage and in the docks, only twice—I did challenge him to fight, and told him I was no pick-pocket, and would have none of his <hi rend="italic">Yankee</hi> phrases—I do not know when that was, it was before this matter—I had no ill feeling, only just at the time—I was at the wheel when this happened—I cannot tell you how many men were on duty on deck at the time—about nine men would be on duty in the watch between 5 and 6 o'clock—I did not call out from the wheel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were at the wheel, and eight other men would be on duty at the time, and you saw one man inflicting such injuries upon the other that the other was shrieking out with pain and agony, did you not raise the slightest alarm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was paralyzed, and the ship was all aback at the time, she was in the wind—the men were not shifting the sails.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you so paralyzed at seeing this act of brutality committed, that you did not cry out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; if I had troubled myself about it I should probably have got shot—there were not only private soldiers, but officers in command on board the vessel, and a doctor—people were sleeping under the place where the scuffling was going on, only separated by the deck—I was about forty or fifty feet off, I am not certain, because I did not measure it—it did not strike me that, as a mere matter of humanity, I could go and make a statement to one of Her Majesty's officers when I next saw one of them on deck—I did not complain to the captain, the prisoner's father; I waited to see the Magistrate—I did not complain to the chief officer—when the vessel anchored off Calcutta I went on liberty—I did not go on shore almost every day from 28th July, only once or twice a week, and on Sundays generally—the rest of the crew had the same liberty—I went to see this young man lying ill in the hospital, and I attended his funeral with another of the ship's crew, and a midshipman—we all subscribed, except the prisoner, to a monument to Dryhurst—the prisoner did not put his name down—I merely state that he did not give it on paper—the captain instructed me to take a list of those who subscribed—I did not collect the money, I collected the names, and how much each one gave—it made eighty rupees altogether—I will not undertake to say that the prisoner did not subscribe five rupees, but he did not put it on my paper—I got the signatures of the officers—I got the captain, and the mate, and Mr. Jeffery, and the steward—I gave the paper first to the able seamen, then to the petty officers, and then to the officers—we had no doctor on board when we were sailing, except the regimental doctor—there was no doctor to the ship, that I am aware of—I believe the doctor attending the troops gave Dryhurst some sticking plaster—we left the doctor attending the troops in Calcutta—I do not know that Dryhurst was under the treatment of the doctor three or four days before the 23rd June, for bilious fever—there was, of course, a different doctor in the hospital—the doctor in Calcutta resides there—I endeavoured to see him before we sailed—Dryhurst had then been dead about fourteen days—I saw the Magistrate on the Monday, and we sailed on the Tuesday—the vessel is taken down the Hoogley by a steam tug—she was not detained</p>

               <p>from going down the river for six hours while I was ashore—the captain asked me if I had seen the Magistrate—I said, "Yes"—two hours afterwards the prisoner called me up, and asked me what satisfaction I had got—I said, "None"—he said, "God d——your heart, I will give you plenty going home"—I never said a word of this before the Magistrate at Stratford—I was never asked for it—Dryhurst was confined to his bed after 23rd June, but he was brought up to walk about and to do his own needfuls—he was bad in his bowels, and when the captain called him he would have to answer the captain's summons—I wrote a document home on the very evening of the man's death—I would not say that it was 12th July, but I wrote it the very day he was buried, after we came from the funeral, which was the day of his death, and gave it to the bumboatman to post—he delayed it six or eight weeks, but I did not know that till I came home—this model (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is a pretty fair representation of the poop of the ship—I was here at the wheel, on the lower platform, on the grating, the hen coops are here and here, both on the side—the vessel was in full sail, one spanker was set—I have been at sea about nine years—I know that at each of the British ports there are Magistrates to whom seamen may make complaints of ill usage—I know also that the ship's articles, on arrival at a British port, are always deposited at the shipping office, which is a place to which seamen have a right to resort to make any complaint—the shipping master at those ports is the person under whom the engaging and discharging of men takes place.</p>

                  </hi>. I have followed the sea all my life, and have been captain of a ship nearly twenty-two years—my age is forty-nine—I have sailed for the owners of the <hi rend="italic">Mofussilite</hi> nearly twelve years—the prisoner is my son, his age is twenty-one—he has got a certificate as second mate—he has followed the sea six years, and upwards of two years under my eye—he went out as second mate in another ship for the same owners, and came to my ship as second mate at Bombay—from that time to the time of Dryhurst's going to the hospital, his conduct to Dryhurst was I believe good and kind—there was no difference or quarrel between them that I know of—I never heard him threaten anyone—the entry in the official log on 20th June, 1867, was made and signed by me, either that night or next morning—I am sure it was made within twenty-four hours—I saw Dr. Anderson attending Dryhurst—I believe it was for a fever—he went on duty after that—I saw him on deck up to the arrival of the ship—he came to see the doctor every morning—I have asked him if he was getting better or how he was, and he only said that he felt unable to work, and was feverish—I saw no signs of wounds upon him, or any swelling or scratch on his face—Dr. Anderson left us on the disembarcation of the troops at Calcutta—I saw Dryhurst in the hospital, not in the doctor's presence—he made no complaint, and there was no sign of any wound on him—there was a sub<lb></lb>scription for the funeral, and my son subscribed to a tablet—after the burial, there was a certificate of the cause of death—I saw a paper from the hospital; I sent it to the deceased's father—I reported the death at the Shipping Office, and made the usual inventory of his effects—I remember Cook asking permission to go ashore—I gave him leave—he exceeded his time by two hours—I asked him what he wanted to go for, and he said I should find out that soon enough, and if I did not give him permission he would go in spite of me—I saw him that night when I went on board—I was not present at any conversation between him and my son when he came back—I first knew of the charge of wounding against my son when he was taken out of the vessel in London—if I had known it in Calcutta, I could have had the matter investigated there before the authorities, and could have had the evidence of the doctor who attended Dryhurst to June 26th—I had</p>

               <p>the doctor from the shore on the 27th—he would have an opportunity of seeing whether there were any wounds inflicted on him—there was no men<lb></lb>tion of wounds by anybody—these entries are correctly made—there is an entry in the official log—"Illness of Dryhurst"—the chances are that he might have been forty-eight hours at work after that, and I might have omitted to put down the day he was well again, so that it goes on as if he was ill all the time—I did not purposely keep any information out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 20th he was ill, and there is no other entry till he goes to the hospital; does that mean that he con<lb></lb>tinued ill from the 20th to the 26th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Except one day, or perhaps thirty-six hours, when he was on duty on deck—a stranger looking at the log-book now, would gather that he was ill from the 20th to the 26th—it is true that he was at work—I made the entry on the 20th, or the morning of the 21st—I believe he was ill on the 21st—he made no complaint to me—I believe he wrote a letter complaining of being worked too hard in the ship—that was a complaint against the ship; against me—I found fault with him, perhaps, a week before we left Bombay, about making a complaint without first consulting me about it—I do not think I said to him that it was an underhanded thing to write to Captain Trutton, but I felt annoyed that he did not complain to me first—I do not know whether my son knew of his writing the letter—my son did not know all about the complaint—I might have mentioned it to him casually, but I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was a complaint against the ship, as much against the second mate as you; do you mean to say you did not tell your son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mean that I do not recollect</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first mate has got an entry in his own book of his being ill on the 26th and 27th, and you have no entry after the 20th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When there is a continuation of sickness, we only put the day they are taken bad, and the day they get better again—I heard, of Cook going to a Magistrate in Cal<lb></lb>cutta, he told me so himself—he said he would not go home for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until he had seen a Magistrate, and if I did not allow him to go he would go in spite of me—I swear I did not know what he was going for—I did not threaten him about going before a Magistrate—I never said, that if he went to a Magistrate, it would be better for him not to come home with me—I never threatened him in the presence of Bowen, one of the apprentices—I never said anything about making the deceased's head sorer, to the best of my recollection—I never, to the best of my recollection, said to the deceased, in Bowen's or Cornish's presence, or in the presence of both, that if he went to the Magistrate I would make his head sorer—I will swear I did not call the deceased a blood-sucker, a low fellow, or an impostor, in Cornish's pre<lb></lb>sence—I may have said that he was lazy, and that there was no getting him to turn out of his bed in the morning—I do not know that the young man kept a diary—I know that he was ill on the 22nd—I do not think he was at work on the 21st, but he was on the 22nd and I believe on the 23rd—he was not on the 24th, because he was sick—I know that perfectly well—I do not remember the deceased complaining, in the prisoner's presence, of the prisoner ordering him up aloft—I do not remember whether he made any complaint on the 22nd—I never threatened to kick him out of the cabin—I do not remember his being sent up to grease the mast, or, after greasing it, being sent up a second time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose greasing the mast is a necessary act to be performed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—during the whole time the lad was on board</p>

               <p>the vessel, I have never been guilty of any act of unkindness towards him, and have never heard any complaints to the owners about it, except the letter that was written—I have taken him off work because I have seen that he was poorly—I have been twenty-five years master of a ship, and, during my whole life, I have never had any complaint made in respect to my conduct as captain towards man or boy.</p>

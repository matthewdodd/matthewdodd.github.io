                  </hi>. I live at High-street, Chatham. On Saturday, 29th June, I was in Cheapside, looking at the procession of Mr. Braidwood's funeral, about half-past 2 o'clock—Miss Whiteman, a friend, was with me—while there, I felt a sharp pull at my watch chain, which was round my neck, with a gold watch on to it—when I felt the pull I turned round and saw the prisoner with my watch in his hand—I am sure he is the man—I had an opportunity of seeing his face—he was breaking my watch from the chain—he gave it a violent pull, and broke the swivel—I saw the watch in his hand—I caught his hand and he pulled it away from me, put the watch into his other hand and passed it over the heads of some people in the crowd—Miss Whiteman went forward immediately and seized him by the collar, and held him securely until we gave him in charge of the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Miss Muirhead in Cheapside—she called out "My watch is gone, that man has it," meaning the prisoner—he was then bringing down his hand from putting it over the heads of some persons in the crowd—I caught hold of his arm; he struggled and shook me off, and was making away and I caught him by the collar, and held him till an officer came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you also engaged in looking at the funeral? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—there was a great crowd—I did not see the prisoner pass any<lb></lb>thing—I only saw him bring his hand back.</p>

I was at the corner of Queen-street, Cheapside, in the middle of the road, regulating the traffic—I heard the cries of police, went into the crowd, and found the last witness holding the prisoner by the coat collar—the prosecutrix said, "That man has taken my watch, I saw it in his hand"—I took him in custody and told him he must go to the station—he said it would be very hard to be taken away; that he had not had the watch—I took him to the station, where he was charged—he gave the name of John Griff, but refused his address—I searched him—there was no property found on him.</p>

The prisoner lives at No. 10 in the same buildings—on the evening of the 2nd of Nov., between eight and nine o'clock, I went to the coal shed for some coals—I was going up stairs for a coal<lb></lb>bag—when I was on the stairs I was pulled back by somebody behind me—she called me a b—greyhound, and asked what did I want up stairs—I said nothing—I never opened my lips—I had not power, for I was pulled back, and the prisoner took the poker and made a blow at me, but did not hit me the first time—the second blow she cut me on the forehead—I bled very much—I was fainting—I had no senses—Margaret Smith caught me.</p>

I am a coal-porter, at Shadwell—Mrs. Murray came to my house for two quarters of coals, on the night of the 2nd of Nov.—she went up stairs for me to fetch a coal-bag down from up stairs—the prisoner lived in the house, but she was to fetch the bag from an<lb></lb>other room—I waited at the door for this bag—I saw Murray going up stairs—when she was on the stairs I saw the prisoner pull her down, pull her back, and make some expression, I cannot say exactly what—after I came away, I heard a scream, and cries of "Murder"—I came away with my coal-bag, to go to my business, and left them to fight it out.</p>

I was near this place on this night—I went into No. 10, and found the prisoner there—she was given into my custody, for striking Mrs. Murray with a piece of iron—I found this piece of iron in one corner of the room—I asked why she did it—she owned that she struck her with it, but she said she stood in her own defence, that Mrs. Murray had struck her, and tore her hair out of her head—I saw some hair in her hand, and a cap, but I did not see it torn off her head—Mrs. Murray was nearly exhausted at the time, and nearly in<lb></lb>sensible.</p>

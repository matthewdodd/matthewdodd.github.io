               <p>Humphrey. I was going along the passage; he asked me what trade I was; I told him we dealt in all sorts of oil; he asked me to give him a drop of oil to oil his fire-lock; I did; then he asked me to get him a bottle, I did; he sold it for twelve shillings and gave me six; that was five gallons; then he asked me to get him another, and he said he would make away with it; I said I was afraid my master would find it out; he told me he would give me a pair of silver buckles; I did get him a bottle, and he gave me the buckles; he told me he had a gentleman that would take all I could get; he came down to me again, and asked me to get him some more; I told him I would keep company with him no more; he came down to me again on Sunday morning, and said, d - n you, get me some more, never mind your master, he will not find it out. I got him another; the two large ones held forty-six pounds, the others five gallons each; I got him six in all; he said if I would get him another he would give me a silver breast-buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first begin this business with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Humphrey. I lived a twelvemonth with my master: this was after I had been there about half a year.</p>

Humphreys said he could get me a great deal; he said it was his perquisites out of the cleanings of the jars; I was drawn into it innocently.</p>

               <p>- Doughty. I am a serjeant in the third Regiment of Guards; I have known the prisoner ever since April last; I never heard any thing of his behaving amiss till since this affair, now I hear he has done a bad thing in the army, by endeavouring to make his escape, and enlist into the first Regiment of Guards. I know nothing of his private character.</p>

            You are one of the officers of the Police, at Shadwell? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information that you received, you went to what place? - A. To a house in Suffolk-street, Pentonville, on Saturday, the 26th of June, where I had a view of the prisoner's house, No. 4, Charlotte-place; the prisoner's, Rodgers, himself told me he rented it.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020714-8-person125">Q. </persName>
            Describe what you observed? - A. A little after eight o'clock, I went to the house in Suffolk-street; there were only two rooms in the house; I noticed that the windows of the upper story had cloths before them, about half way up, and the upper part of the windows were exceedingly dirty, so that I could have no view whatever of any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140008"></xptr>that was done in the upper part of the house, but any person that went up stairs I had a full view of; I was waiting from half past eight till two o'clock, no person went in or came out of the house during that time; about two o'clock, the prisoner, Mary Rodgers, came down stairs; a little after I saw her wipe her hands and arms with a cloth; she then went out, and in a few minutes returned with a pot, which, I suppose, contained beer; she looked very much about her when she came out, and also when she returned; she instantly went up stairs, and no person went in or came out of the house till four o'clock; about four o'clock, the prisoner, Horn, came to the house; how he opened the door I do not know, but it was opened instantly, and he went up stairs; no person went in or came out till after five, then

             came down stairs; she staid a little while below, and then went out again, and shut the door after her; she looked very much about her, at the top of the place, as before; she returned in a few minutes with a loaf and some butter; the door was then shut, and it appeared to me she had no key, for she called out, and somebody opened the door, which was a man, but I could not see who; then she went up stairs; no person went in or out of the house then till half past six o'clock; in the mean time I spoke to Mr. Springall, a clerk to the Solicitor of the Mint, that, in case Horn should come out, they should watch him; about half past six, Horn came out, and I sent Springall after him to watch him, and I followed; Horn went into a wine-vault the corner of Suffolk-street; he returned, and looked very much about him; before this, I sent Daniel Holland to the office to get some more assistance and a search-warrant; when Horn returned, he went up stairs as usual; I saw no person come out again till half past seven; Horn then came out, and looked very much about him; by this time Holland returned to me with a warrant; Horn, after having looked about him, turned into the house again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see Holland return? - A. No, he did not; then we concluded that was the time to get into the house; I desired Holland to rap at the door, because the maid knew me;

             opened the door, and endeavoured to shut it again when she saw us; I then started in; Horn and Mary Rodgers were below; she called out, here they are; I ran up stairs, and desired Holland to take Horn and Mary Rodgers; I caught Rodgers upon the window endeavouring to get out; upon which Holland brought the other two up stairs, and we secured all the three; there was a half teaster bed in the room, rather inclining towards the window; the first thing that struck my attention, was a furnace made of brick in the chimney-place; that furnace had a fire in it of coke, and also a quantity of coke lying in the fire-place; there were a number of crucibles, some lying upon the side of the furnace, some upon the mantle-piece, and some upon the floor; some had the remains of metal in them; here is one of them new, that has never been used,(produces it;) the next thing I observed, was a little bench fixed under one of the windows, so that a person could sit at work at it; it was fixed to the wall, and upon the bench I found these sciffars, files, and plyers, (produces them;) there was also this child's hat, containing these blanks, which adhere together, (producing them;) there are some of different coin; I found these things, with some metal upon the point of them; from the appearance of them, they are used for the purpose or lifting the melting pots off the fire; the next thing that struck my attention, was a flask, which is used in coining, and a sort of trough, in the corner of the room, containing a quantity of sounder's earth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been used to these sort of things, so as to know the common use of them? - A. I have been very much; in my hurry in taking up the flask, I found the founder's earth coming out of the flask; the earth is put into these frames, and beat with a mallet till it is a pretty hard substance; the oil and lamp black are put over it to harden the earth, in order to receive the fresh metal more easy; the impression is generally taken from good coin; the metal is poured in, and takes the impression without the assistance of a dye or press, and they can take the impression of the coin of different kingdoms all at once; I found some founder's earth where I found the flask; close by that trough was hanging these two sieves, (produces them,) which are used for sitting the earth, and putting it in a proper state to be used; the room was exceedingly black, so black that there was the mark of the sieves where they hung up; here is a composition for hardening the day, which is made of black lead, and lamp black and oil, which is burnt; I found that in the same room, in a cupboard; this is a piece of coke that was found by the fire-side; I found a quantity of sand-paper, some used, and some not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gleed. 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person128">Q. </persName>
            What is the use of the sandpaper? - A. To take off the rough edges after the sciffars had been used to cut them apart; they are taken with a small pair of players, and filed, and then the sand-paper is used to take off the rough edges; I found this pipkin, (produces it,) with some oil and some cotton, which is used to burn this compositioin, which is put into the flask to harden the earth, and make it fit to receive the impression; the next thing I found was, on the bed, this dirty apron, which contained this money and this piece of cork; the cork is used for smoothing the money;(produces a large quantity of unfinished coin;) here is a remarkable piece adhering together, they have J. S. upon them; I found that in the child's hat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140009"></xptr>upon the bed; here is another, in a more finished state, with 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person129">J. S. </persName>
            upon it, which I found upon the bed; a person could sit upon the bed working at the bench, and place the money, some on the bench and some on the bed; here is one that was in a state sit for circulation at the time I found it, and so were these three shillings and a sixpence, (produces them,) but they are discoloured since; they are all copper; it is but a common wash, and is very soon discoloured; the utteres generally keep them in papers separately.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020714-8-person130">Q. </persName>
            You mixed that shilling with the others? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020714-8-person131">Q. </persName>
            Would that mixing it with the others tenders take off the colouring? - A. Yes; I also found on the mantle-piece this paper, containing white vitriol, (produce it,) which is used to give a sort of dimness to the silver; I also found a paper, containing white arsenic, which is for mixing with the copper; it is in consequence of the white arsenic being put in the crucible with the copper, that it comes out quite white; I also found this apron by the bed-side, which smelt very strong of aquafortis; I also found these pieces of copper cut into pieces, to put into the surnace. (Producing them.)</p>

                  <persName id="t18020714-8-person132">Q. </persName>
            Were all the prisoners in the room at the time you found those things? - A. Yes, they were present when every thing was found, and I desire the to take particular notice; this was on the Saturday evening; on the Sunday morning, I went to the house to make farther search; Mr. Springall had the key, and, in the back shed, I found this brush, (produces it,) which smelt very strong of aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That shed was not locked up? - A. No, it was belonging to the house; you could not get at the shed without passing through the house; we found, on the Sunday, also a quantity of black ing and black lead, and things mixed up for burning, and other things.</p>
               <p>

            Persons, in the habit of coming, make use of all.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find their persons? A. At the time I went up stairs, Joseph Rodgers was on the window with his waistcoat on, but no shirt, and this old apron. I could see his arms all the way up, they were yellow, green, and black; at the time that Horn and

             were brought up, I looked at their hands; they were both of them very duty, with some sort of dirt, but only about the palm of the hand and the fingers; I desired Holland to take particular notice of the prisoner's hands; I said, they had been at work; they said, they had not; Horn said, he had only been in a few minutes, that he came to see them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person136">Q. </persName>
            Would aqua-fortis give that appearance? - A. It would; Horn afterwards acknowledged that he had been there from four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were his hands dirty when he came to the door at four o'clock? - A. I cannot tell, I was at such a distance; he then had an apron of the colour of this upon him; on the table below there was a bason with some water, which some person had washed their hands in.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me aqua-fortis was a necessary ingredient in the colouring of base metal? - A. Yes, it is a very material ingredient.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q. In cases where silver is put into the composition, in order to throw the silver on the outside, aqua-fortis must be used; but here there is no silver in the composition? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person137">A. </persName>
            Aqua-fortis is necessary in every process that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. As to this shilling upon which the indictment is framed, did you, at any time, shew it to any persons belonging to the Mint? - A. I shewed it to Mr. Powell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you got that shilling from the house of the prisoner before you shewed it to Mr. Powell? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person138">A. </persName>
            At the examination, on the Thursday following; I had them locked up in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thursday were they in the same state as when you found them? - A. No, they were much discoloured; they appeared many of them passable, but on Thursday much discoloured.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the last process through which they pass, is to have them dulled? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this appear to you to have passed through that process? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person139">A. </persName>
            It was in that state, that a man, who was not a good judge of silver, would have taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say any common tradesman would have taken it? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person140">A. </persName>
            Many common tradesmen would have taken it.</p>

               <persName id="t18020714-8-person141">A. </persName>
            It was very much dulled.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you, that on Thursday it was passable when it was seen by Mr. Powell? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-8-person142">A. </persName>
            In my opinion.</p>

               <p>Q. And that was true, because he had been out just before - how far was the house where you were concealed from the house where the prisoner lived? - A. I suppose fifteen or sixteen yards; the windows up stairs were half blinded, and a large blanket hung up, so that it was impossible to see any thing that was going on.</p>

I saw the prisoner, Horn, come out of the house, and I followed him; upon his first coming out, he looked in a very suspicious manner about him, as if he was looking to see if any body was about; I saw him go into a wine-vaults; I went in after him, and saw him having some gin put into a bottle; there were two doors to the house; I thought it very singular that he passed one door, and went in at the farthest door, and he came back the same way; he looked about, as he had done before, and then he went into the house from which he had first come; Rodgers then followed me into the house where we were watching; after waiting about half an hour, the prisoner, Horn, came out again, and looked about him in the same way; he returned in a short timet, and looked each way again, and then went into the houset; in about ten minutes after, he came out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Rodgers and Holland came up? - A. Yes; I saw the prisoner, Rodgers, lift up the fash, and throw two bags out of the window, which fell over into the garden; he was going out too, till I told him to retire, or I should knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in point of fact, get out? - A. No, he came in; I then went into the garden, and found these two bags, (produces them,) one of them containing a number of good pattern shillings, and the other pattern six-pences.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any one in particular? - A. Yes; here is one which exactly corresponds with the impression on the counterfeit. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. By pattern shillings, you mean shillings to cast from? - A. Yes.</p>

            Did you see the shillings that were found on the bed at the time they were found? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them that day? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them on the Thursday following? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you particularly attend to the shilling which is the subject of this indictment? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sufficiently conversant with the good coin and counterfeit coin to know one from the other? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>DANIEL HOLLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. You are an officer of the Police? - A. I am an extra constable.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020714-8-person149">Q. </persName>
            Can you explain the use of these implements? - A. I can give no further explanation than Rodgers has given; he has given a very correct explanation. I can only say, that the whole of the apparatus is such as is used for the process that seems to have been adopted on this occasion, except the aqua-fortis, which is necessary to the colouring; these blanks contain no particle of silver whatever in them; I have tried them, therefore the mode of colouring them would be by doing them with a solution of silver in aqua-fortis; I have one in my pocket, which is one of the blanks found at the house of the prisoner, and which I had coloured myself. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean that you have not found in this house that by which this process must have been compleated? - A. There was no solution of silver found.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020714-8-person150">Q. </persName>
            But there was an apron and a brush found, which smelt of aqua-fortis? - A. Yes; the brush, I take it, has been used for stirring the pickle; there are no materials found that they could colour with.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no solution nor any vessel with the remains found? - A. No, but there is not one instance in twenty in which we do find them; they only prepare so much of the pickle, or of the solution of silver, as they immediately want.</p>

            Were you present at the Magistrate's on the Thursday? - A. Yes, I attended the examination.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe, on that day, the shilling which is the subject matter of this inquiry? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you observe it? - A. I was confident it had been coloured, and an incautious person certainly might have taken it; I am positive it had been coloured; it had lost part of its colour, but even then an incautious person might have taken it.</p>

            What do you mean by an incautious person? - A. It might be passed to a tradesman, but a person who is skilled in silver would not have taken it certainly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q. That pattern, I believe, is from the dye of the year 1758? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You consider that as the pattern of this shilling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the graining at the edges is very full? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of that dye so worn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140011"></xptr>as to lose the grain? - A. I cannot say; here are two letters upon it, which makes it more remarkable, J.S.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the edge of that any thing like a resemblance to the pattern one? - A. No, and I can explain to you why.</p>
               <p>Q. If you will look at the counterfeit one, you will see that it is not round? - A. It is not.</p>

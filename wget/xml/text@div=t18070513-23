            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On Sunday morning the 12th of April I was going across Hatton Wall. Mr. Barber told me the place had been broken open. From his information I found Mrs. Brand in company with another woman, walking very fast; I took Brand in custody. From information from her son, I believe it is, it was a little boy, I traced out Hobbs near Queen-square, she was servant to a gentleman. I searched her box; not finding any thing that led to the charge I went away; I returned back and took Broomfield to the same place; I directed her to stand at the door till she saw Mrs. Hobbs open the door; she challenged her to be one of the women that came to her along with the other prisoner. I took her in custody; Hobbs told me where the gown was pledged. I and my brother officer searched Brand's room, which was underneath the room that was broken open in the same house. I found this bed-winch; I thought by the marks upon the door post it had been used to force the door open. I fitted it to it, and it fitted exactly. There were two instruments used; Chapman holds another that fits the other mark.</p>

            . I produce a chopper. This was found in Brand's drawer. As I was taking Hobbs to prison she told me that the gown was pledged, and she thought a great deal more property, in Wardour-street. In consequence I took the prosecutrix to the pawnbroker's; there was nothing more found than what is produced.</p>
               <p>Brand left her defence to her counsel; called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

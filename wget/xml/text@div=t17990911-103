               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess; did you hold out any threat or any favour, if he did or did not make any discovery? - A.Neither one nor the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Nothing that he could construe in that way? - A.Nothing; after I had found the duplicate, I took him to Bow-street on the Wednesday after; I took stock, and missed two quantities of two yards each.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the pawnbroker here? - A. Yes.</p>

             M'CARTY sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Collins, a pawnbroker, in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110128"></xptr>Q. Did you know the prisoner? - A. I never saw him but once, but I am sure he is the same man; he pledged with me four yards of cloth, on the 16th of July, sometime in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Warberton). When was it you found the duplicate? - A. On Thursday the 3d of August, about eleven o'clock, probably.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty). Look at that duplicate, is that the one you gave the prisoner? - A. It is the same, it was pledged for two guineas; I asked him if it was his own property, he told me, yes; he pledged it in the name of John Jackson.</p>
               <p>Warberton. I have no doubt but they are the same, but I cannot very well tell by candle-light; I have patterns in my pocket of both (produces them), that quantity was just deficient, and I have the same cloth now in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I take it the same maker will make two pieces exactly like? - A. So I suppose, very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q.Both in colour and cut, and every thing else? - A. I agree with you perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then supposing you had not found any deficiency in your stock, but had been shewn these two pieces of cloth, could you have stated that this cloth came out of your shop? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost two pieces which corresponded with the quantity you missed? - A. Yes, both in list and colour, and every thing else.</p>
               <p>Q.This young man comes from Cumberland, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did the prisoner come to live with you? - A. On the 18th of February last.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called Mr. Edward Sutherland, a wine-merchant, who had known him from his infancy, and deposed that no man could have a better character.</p>

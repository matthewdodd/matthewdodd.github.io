I am a carpenter, and live at 31, New Kent Road—on 17th January, about 12.30 at night, I was coming up the Old Kent Road; at the corner of Albany Road, somebody clapped a hand over my mouth, put their hand in my trowsers pocket and took out 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there—I was regularly paralyzed; they clenched me in that sort of way (<hi rend="italic">by the throat</hi>)—I was dashed down; I got up again as well as I could, and called out "Police!"—I am not able to identify the person who attacked me—I had my money safe not five minutes before; it was all I had in the world.</p>

About 12.30 on the night of 17th, I was on duty in Albany Road—I heard cries of "Police!" on the opposite side, and saw the prisoner and two others running away from the direction where the prosecutor was—I followed the prisoner for about 200 yards, and took him into custody—I waited for the prosecutor to come up; he said he had been knocked down and robbed of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I turned round to the prisoner, and asked him how much money he had about him—he said, "If you take me to the station I will let you see"—I asked him a second time, and he pre<lb></lb>sented 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his right-hand—I am certain he did not take them out of his pocket; he had them in his hand.</p>

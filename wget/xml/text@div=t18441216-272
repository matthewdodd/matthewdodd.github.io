                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Thomas Pope, of Kid<lb></lb>brook, near Blackheath—the prisoner was employed to thrash red wheat in his barn—I have been in the corn trade—I have compared some wheat produced by the officer with a sample of wheat from the barn of Mr. Pope—in my judgment the qualities correspond, and appear to have formed part of the same bulk—it is rather an inferior description of wheat, and rather foul—I find the same seeds of weeds in it as are in the sample.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live in the Lower-road, Deptford—the prisoner first came to me about three months since, with some gleaned corn—he came to me again, a day or two before the 12th of Nov., and said he was about to have a sack of wheat from his brother in the coun<lb></lb>try, and asked if I would buy it of him—I said I would; and on or about the 12th of Nov., he brought five bushels of red wheat in the evening, and I bought it of him for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave the name of Hilder—I gave about five pecks of the same wheat to the officer—I live nearly three miles from Kidbrook—the sack was brought in a truck.</p>

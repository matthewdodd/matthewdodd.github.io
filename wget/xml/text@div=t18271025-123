In consequence of seeing an advertisement in the paper, I came to town, and saw my property at Bow-street - I never saw the prisoner till them.</p>

            . I am an officer of the City. I went with Forrester to get a warrant backed, and then we went with Morris, of Bow-street, to the prisoner's house, in Monmouth-street, on the 18th of September; the prisoner was at home; I told him to open his drawers, and he did so; they were in the back room; a gentleman said that he wanted to find some broad cloth; we did not find any, but I found some silver of different descriptions - there were some watches and other things; he said they were his own property; we took the prisoner and plate to Bow-street, and Sir Richard Birnie remanded him; the prisoner is a general-dealer, in the clothes line.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you demanded the key of the drawer, did he put his hand into his pocket and take it out without hesitation? A. Yes; I understand the Magistrates have given him back the principal part of the plate; I said, when I saw the plate, "This looks suspicious;" I took the prisoner into custody at the time - he could not have run away if he liked - he made no such attempt - but I had my eye on him; Sir Richard Birnie said he would admit him to bail - very little of the plate was claimed: I know the manner of the Jews very well; I believe that the 22d of September is their new year's day - I know that on holydays they like to make a great display of plate; I never saw any thing more fair and honest than the prisoner's conduct on the occasion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the plate exposed for sale? A. No; there were a great many new clothes in the shop; some of the plate was marked, and some not.</p>

            . I am a carver and gilder, and live at No. 19, Plumtree-street, Bloomsbury. I have known the prisoner five or six years; during the time he has lived in Monmouth-street, I have had dealings with him, and always found him an upright man; I have dealt with him for clothes, blankets, and sheets, and on one occasion I bought six silver spoons of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is he? A. He is a general-dealer; he exposed only clothes for sale - I never saw any spoons exposed for sale in the shop, except when I bought mine, and they laid on the counter.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you had a shop in Monmouth-street, should you like to expose spoons in it? A. No.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and live at No. 48, Duke-street, St. James'. I have known the prisoner sixteen years; he has been in the habit of purchasing articles at my room - plate, apparel, and other things; I always understood him to be a respectable man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of property do you sell? A. When I sell the property of a lady or gentleman deceased, there is plate, linen, and other things; whoever purchases them pay for them before they are taken away; I sell plate at so much per ounce. I sold the prisoner some in Clark's rooms, in Hollis-street, four years ago.</p>

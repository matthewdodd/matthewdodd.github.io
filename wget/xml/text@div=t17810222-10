               <p>Where did you fall into her company? - Between Long-acre and the north part of Drury-lane, at about seven o'clock at night; I was going home, she asked me to go along with her.</p>
               <p>You complied did you? - I was unwilling at first, but at last I went along with her to her lodgings as she called it in King-street, the end of it went down towards Bloomsbury; it was the end of Drury-lane, near Holbourn.</p>
               <p>After you came there how long did you stay with her? - About five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>What happened? - Nothing till that time was over about five minutes, she then picked my pocket of my money.</p>
               <p>Did you feel her take it from you? - Yes; she got the purse in her right hand and the money in her left. I saw her give the money to another girl; there was a candle in the room and I saw it.</p>
               <p>How much money was in your purse? - Six guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>How came the other girl into the room? - She was in the other room; she lived just by; I seised this girl (the prisoner) immediately, and held her fast by the wrist; she called me bouger and said she would send for her husband, and she said she would stab me; she went and clapped her hand to a drawer for a knife; the other girl bid her send for her husband.</p>
               <p>Did you hold her fast? - She shut the door against me and I let her go, but I forced the door open again, and insisted upon securing her; then she took up a poker; I got it from her; then there was another came to her assistance; then I could not keep her. I went down stairs to fetch a constable, no body would come; there were some decent people lived over the way, they said they were afraid they should be knocked on the head if they gave me any assistance. I went to the Rotation-office and got

               <p>I am an headborough. Emms came to me the night he was robbed and said he had been robbed of six guineas and a half, by a short girl, describing the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What time of the night did he come to you? - About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did he tell the story as he had done now? - Yes he did; I went and searched for the girl that night at the lodgings he described, but could not find her. Two days after I was in Earl-street, near Monmouth-street, and saw the prisoner coming along with a new red cloak on. I knew her before by the description; I said you are the very girl I want; I stopped her and took her to the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street. I fetched Emms and he swore positively to her person.</p>
               <p>Did you find any money upon her? - Nothing but a few halfpence. She said she would give me a guinea to let her go.</p>

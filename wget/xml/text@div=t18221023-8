             in the house; I returned about half-past eight; Isaacs was not there - she returned in quarter of an hour; I then got in, as she had the key. I found my husband's large chest broken open, and a large drab great coat and the rest of the property stated in the indictment gone. There were three half-crowns and one crown among the silver. I have found nothing since. I found a milk kettle left on the table in the kitchen, which was not there before. When I went out that morning, I saw the two prisoners standing in the street against a post opposite, at the corner, four or five doors from each other. Hennington stood at the post, with the same sort of kettle in his hand as that I found in the kitchen. I had seen them waiting about there three mornings before, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday; they were dressed like milkmen; Croucher had a blue apron, the other had a dark blue coat, and a smart orange-coloured handkerchief on; I took particular notice of him being so smart. My daughter called my attention to them on the Monday morning, and as I was going round with my milk on Wednesday, about a quarter of an hour after I left home (about half-past seven o'clock) I saw Hennington running down Hemming's-row, with a light great coat on, like the one missed. I did not see Croucher then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Croucher had a blue apron on, that is all that made him look like a milkman - A. Yes; we called them the dandy milkmen. Hennington was dressed genteelly, and stood about twelve yards off, with a kettle in his hand, of the same size as that I found in the room; there are many kettles of that size. I afterwards saw him running with the coat on, and am sure of his person, for I particularly noticed him; it was a large drab old-fashioned coat, and too big for him; I saw his face, and also saw that he had the same orange-coloured handkerchief on, and knew him again. The kitchen has a door leading into the passage, communicating with the rest of the house; Mrs. Smith and her two children were in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the value of the coat? A. My husband gave three guineas and a half for it; it is worth 2 l. - he had worn it very little. The other things are worth 65 s.</p>

            . I am the daughter-in-law of Mrs. O'Brien. I went out on Wednesday morning, about a quarter past seven o'clock, about two minutes after my mother; I locked the back door twice, and left the key inside; the front door was latched - I left it fast; I returned about half-past seven o'clock; I looked down the cellar, to see if there was any customer - I saw two men open the street door of the house and come out; I looked very hard at them - the prisoners are the men. Croucher had a black waistcoat, black silk handkerchief, and dark blue coat and blue trowsers; Hennington had a darkish brown old fashioned great coat on. They said nothing to me. I watched them up the street, and went down into the kitchen directly, and found the back door wide open, and a strange milk can on the table. My father-in-law's chest was broken open. I immediately missed his coat, also my own shawl out of my box. I went and met my mother and told her. I did not suspect the men then. The great coat one had on was like my father-in-law's. I have seen the prisoners several times before - I saw Croucher on the Monday morning before the robbery with a milk kettle in his hand - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230012"></xptr>saw him several times in the course of Monday, and many times on the Tuesday. I saw Hennington also on the Tuesday; he had a coloured silk handkerchief on. I saw them together several times on the Monday and Tuesday - I did not know where they lived, or their names.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was an old great coat - A. No, an old fashioned one - he never wore it since I have been with him, which is two years. I saw Croucher on Monday, going along with the milk can in his hand, and Hennington following him - I do not say they were together then. The back door leads to the kitchen stairs.</p>

On the 3d of October. in consequence of information, I apprehended both the prisoners about three o'clock in the afternoon, in Vine-street, Chandos-street, in the street; they were in company with a third person; both had black silk handkerchiefs. I searched them, and on Hennington I found an orange-coloured silk handkerchief. I got the milk can from the premises. I was fetched directly, and saw it found.</p>

            . My husband rents the house in Blue-cross-street. On the morning before the robbery (Tuesday) I saw two men come up the back way from the kitchen; I looked at them - they were respectably dressed, and not knowing but they belonged to the people in the kitchen, I took no further notice; they appeared to be exactly like the prisoners. Next morning I went to the shop door to look after my son, who was gone on an errand, and saw the same two men going down the front way into the kitchen down the cellar stairs, and about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I heard of the robbery. I cannot swear positively to the prisoners - they were very much like them; neither had a great coat on; I did not notice their dresses particularly, only they appeared well dressed.</p>

He was with him nearly seven years - they separated four or five months ago, having some altercation; he has chiefly lived me since. On Wednesday morning, the 2d of October, he came home about half-past six o'clock - he had not slept at home. I sat in his company from that time till twenty minutes before seven o'clock. I live in Castle-court, Strand. He then went out, and returned about ten minutes before eight o'clock. He was dressed in a blue coat and round hat. I have seen Hennington before, but never knew my son to be acquainted with him. My son sometimes worked with me, and at times had jobs of his own. I am a mangler and porter. He was with me on Tuesday, till twelve or one o'clock, all the morning. He did not get up till eight, and was at home on Monday till twelve o'clock. He slept at home on Sunday and Monday nights.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Spring-street, Shadwell. I knew the deceased Robert Pounceby—he was about thirteen or fourteen years old—he was bigger than the prisoners—I heard him challenge to fight the pri<lb></lb>soners, "one down and the other come on—they said" You challenged to fight us both at once"—he said, "Well, come on"—they had three rounds, and Pounceby then said he would not fight both any more—he would fight either one of them—Sullivan said, "I will have a round with you"—a man named Pearce came up and picked Pounceby up as he fell down—Sullivan and Pounceby generally fell together—Pearce said to Pounceby, "Strike up, Bob, don't let him have any wind"—in the second round Sul<lb></lb>livan was giving Pounceby a fall, but Pearce saved him from falling by putting his knee under him—a boy named Murphy said he ought to be ashamed of himself for preventing him from falling—Pearce slapped Mur<lb></lb>phy in the face and made a kick at him, but he did not receive the kick—at the third round, a gentleman came up and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> Pounceby against the wall, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> Sullivan on his knees in the road—Pounceby did not seem to be hurt—the gentleman did it to part them, and both got a violent fall—Pounceby's father came up at the time, and Pounceby ran after Sul<lb></lb>livan and pointed him out to his father as the boy he had been fighting with—he was able to run—he did not seem hurt—only his nose was bleeding.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman.

                  </hi>. I live at Shadwell. I saw the first blows that were given—Pounceby got the worst of it when he fought the two, and he gave in, and said, he would fight them singly, either of them—Sullivan said, "I will have a round with you myself," and they fought—Pearce came up just as the first round began, and picked Pounceby up when he fell—in the second round Sullivan was giving the deceased a fall, when Pearce put his knee under him and saved him from falling—I do not think he hurt him in doing that—I said he ought to be ashamed of himself for doing so, and then he made a kick at me—at the third round a gentleman came up and parted them—he said he was an officer, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> one one way and one another—Sullivan fell on his knees in the road, and the deceased went against the wall—he did not seem to be hurt—his father then came up, and he went to show him the boy he had been fighting with—he pointed out Sullivan—Stanton was gone—Pounceby seemed able to run.</p>

               <p>seemed to be the worst fall he had—he was more hurt by that blow than by any of the fighting—the fight happened on a Thursday, and he died on the Monday following—I saw him just after he was dead—after the fight was over Pounceby's, father hit him over the head with the coat he had taken off, and took him home and made him wash himself.</p>

                  </hi>. The deceased Robert Pounceby was my son. Pearoe came and told me the fight was going on, and when I got there it was over—I hit my boy over the head, and attempted to kick his backside, and he ran home before me—next day he came down stairs on his backside, stair by stair, and said, "Father, I have great pain in my left breast;" and on the top of his knee was a black spot like a sixpence—he said he had fallen on his knee—I do not know whether he fell on his knee when he fell against the gas-pipe—he did not fall when I struck him—next day I sent for Mr. Sage, the doctor, and he attended him all day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased—I discovered a slight contusion on the lower part of the knee-bone, the cap of the knee, there was excessive inflammation proceeding about one-third up the mus<lb></lb>cles of the thigh—there was a slight contusion over the right eye; and the now evening erysipelas took place, which was followed by inflammation of the brain and lungs—that was from the concussion acting upon the nerves—I consider the blow on the knee would produce excitement to came that effect—I think the blow on the knee brought on erysipelas, and that, inflam<lb></lb>mation of the brain—I attribute the blow on the knee to be the original cause—there was fluid on the back of the head, but there was no contusion there—I do not think his falling with the back part of his head against a gas-pipe would account for the appearance on the back of his head.</p>

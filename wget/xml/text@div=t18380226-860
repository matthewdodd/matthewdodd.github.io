                  </hi>. I am a ballast-heaver. On the 1st of March I met the prisoner in company with a friend of mine, a ballast-heaver between one and two o'clock in the day—we stopped and talked together—I had been receiving my money, and had a pound of steaks in my hand, which I had bought for my dinner—I said, "I must go and cook them"—he said, "You may come to our place"—I went with him to Twince court, Shadwell, which was just opposite where we were talking—we all went into the lower room—there was a good fire, and we cooked the steaks and ate them together—I said to my mate, "I must go and get some sleep"—I was fatigued through heavy labour—the landlady said "There is a good bed up stairs, you may go and sleep as long as you please"—I went up, and left the man and this woman sitting by the fire in the lower room—I took off my coat, and spread it on the bed-clothes—I put my trowsers under my head—before I got to sleep, a lady came in and said she would take part of my bed—I declined it—I said I wanted to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 7, Rope Yard Rails, Woolwich—on Sunday, 15th December, I was with Regan from 1.30 till a few minutes to 10 o'clock—I left him in company with eight or nine other young fellows who work at Mr. Henley's telegraph works, the same as I do—Regan lives at the same house that I do, in the room under mine—I had to go to work the next day, because I was on the day shift, and he was on the night shift, so I bid him "Good night," and went home—I can't say what time it was he came indoors, but he came up to ask me for the key of his room, which his mother had left with me—I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> afterwards, and said "Who is there?"—they said "Police"—the police came and took Regan, and looked him up on the charge of assaulting a man who keeps a pie<lb></lb>shop at the corner of Giles Street.</p>

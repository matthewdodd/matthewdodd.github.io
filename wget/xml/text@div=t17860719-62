               <p>I keep a pork shop; I lost the pork on the 27th of June; I met the prisoner coming down the one pair of stairs where I live; I thought she did not belong to any of my lodgers; I followed her out of my back door, and asked her, if she had been at my house, and she said, yes; and I asked her, if she knew any of my lodgers, she said, she knew the people in the one pair of stairs; I asked what she had in her apron, she said, nothing belonging to me; she let me look in her apron, and there was twenty-seven pounds of pickled pork; I took it away from her; I knew it was mine, by missing it out of the kitchen; I do not know how much there was before she went into the kitchen; that went all out of one tub; the pork was almost all gone; there were four loins, and a piece in the tub in the morning; I had not been in the kitchen since.</p>

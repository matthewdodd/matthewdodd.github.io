               <p>defendant standing at the corner of the court between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I went up to her and asked her the reason they hit me in Whitecross-street—she went up the court some short distance and I followed her, her mother and aunt were with her—I asked them the reason, and they beat me again—the prisoner struck me first, and then her aunt knocked me down, and her mother also gave me a blow while I was lying in the gutter—the prisoner got my thumb in her mouth, and took it off at the first joint—it was hanging by the skin when I got up—I had not struck her—I went to the hospital for five days, mortification took place and I had to have the thumb amputated at the socket—I am still an out patient.</p>

I am single, and live at 3, Sun-court, Golden-lane—I followed Mrs. Downey across the road, and saw the defendant's aunt and mother beating her—I then saw her underneath them, and saw the pro secutrix's right thumb in the defendant's mouth—the defendant then got up and spat the blood out of her mouth—I did not see the prosecutrix strike the prisoner, and I must have seen it if she did.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on Easter Tuesday the prosecutrix was brought there—I examined her thumb, and there was a compound dislocation of the lower joint—the thumb was about half severed—that might have been produced by a severe bite—mortification set in, she became an in-patient, and I took her thumb out of the socket.</p>

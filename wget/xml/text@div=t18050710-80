               <p>Q. When did you first see the prisoner? - A. On the 24th of May, at the King's Head, at Twickenham.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that passed between you and him, did he go home with you that night? - A. Yes, he slept along with my fellow-servant at Lady Holland's house; we had a dance.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go out in the morning? - A. About a quarter before seven in the morning; we went then to the Horse and Groom at <placeName id="t18050710-80-crimeloc447">Twickenham</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. You asked him to look at the watch? - A. I will not be sure whether he asked me, or I him; he put the watch in his pocket after looking at it, it was engraved on both cases; I said to him, Gardner, what do you put it in your pocket for, why do not you give it me, it is nonsense to put it in your pocket; he said, I will give it to you, do you think I want to keep it; then we walked up the garden, and went to the Three Tuns; I called for a pint of beer, and paid for a glass of gin a-piece, it was fair-time; he got up, and said, I shall go out, I will be in again in a minute; he never returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How long after that was it before you saw him? - A. The next morning, his master brought him to me about eleven o'clock; I said, Gardner, where is my watch; he said to me, I do not know, if I had it I lost it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you find it again? - A. No, I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you both drunk then, or only one of you? - A. We had had only sixpennyworth of liquor in gin and porter at the Three Tuns, that would not make any body drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you at the Horse and Groom? - A. We did not drink any thing there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return to Lady Holland's house? - A. At half after two; she was out when we had the dance, and gave us leave to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get leave of the Lady to bring home people to sleep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did very wrong; I think you deserve to lose your watch - whether this man is guilty, or no, that is another thing - was it a silver watch, or a gold watch? - A. A silver watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came out of Mrs. Dyner's house, did I not give you the watch in the lane - I am conscious that I gave you the watch again? - A. No; I asked you for it at the public-house before you went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you come over to me, and say, if I would sign a paper, you would not take any further notice - you said if I would only put my own initials to pay you at six months? - A. That was when you came to me on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What night was it when you had the dance? - A. On Friday night the 24th of May; on the Saturday I lost my watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why did not you take him up when he came to you on the Sunday? - A. I did not wish to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him, or were you drunk at the time? - A. No, it was on account of my fellow servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man known to any of your fellow servants? - A. I do not know that he is known by any of them, he was partner to one of the young men in the house that night.</p>

On the Monday following the prisoner returned to work; he said it quite cut him up, as this young man (Addison) had lost his watch, he was very sorry for it, as he had the blame of the affair; the next day he said (whether he was joking, or no, I cannot say) that he had made away with it, and got 22 s. 6 d. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that he said it to you in a joke? - A. I cannot say; he worked for me, and so far as I ever observed his character, he was a very honest man.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. The prosecutor applied to me to recover his watch on the 5th of June; I was engaged at the time, and could do nothing for him till the 10th of June; I went to his lodgings, I found him at home; the prosecutor was with me; I took him to a neighbouring public-house; we had agreed to go there to see Mr. Minitt, as the prisoner said he would agree to settle every thing as Mr. Minitt should settle the affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Addison charge him with having taken the watch? - A. Yes, the prisoner denied it; he said if he had the watch, he must have lost it, - after he left the Three Tuns, he fell asleep somewhere, he did not know where. The prosecutor told him he was perfectly sober, and insisted that he had taken it away, and the prisoner insisted that he had not made away with his watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor called on me two or three times, and wanted me to pay for the watch, or if I would sign a bond for four pounds, he would be satisfied; I would not do it, as I knew that I had not made away with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

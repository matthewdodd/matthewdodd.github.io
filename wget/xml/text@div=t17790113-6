               <p>On the 22 d of November I happened to to be in a public-house where the prisoner and two more were drinking. I joined company with them; afterwards they took an opportunity to jostle me. I sat down with them in the same box. I catched the prisoner's hand in my right hand waistcoat pocket; I had a half guinea and three shillings or more in that pocket. He took it out under a pretence of inlisting me for a soldier; and afterwards used violence to drag me out of the house. He was then in a plaisterer's dress; he was not in his uniform. They did not appear to be soldiers. I charged him with taking the money; he damned me, and opened his hand, and asked me if that was my money? There was a half guinea and three shillings, or more in his hand. I told him I positively believed it was. They then used force to take me out of the house; they pretended they had trepanned me. The landlord came in at the time, and said, you villains, do you mean to rob the man? and turned them out. They went immediately to the Savoy, and brought the serjeant of the guards, who demanded the door to be opened, and insisted on my going with him, or he would use force. I went with them to an officer of the Savoy; I told the officer I had been robbed; he said it was not his business, he could not decide it, I must go before a justice, or words to that purpose; immediately they dragged me by force along the Strand. I begged to stop at a house where I lived, they would not let me stop, but dragged me before another officer, Colonel Thornton, near Carnaby-market; I told him my story; he said it was not his business, I must go before a justice, and he discharged me on my giving him my word that I would appear with him before Justice Elliott in the morning. I went according to my promise, about ten o'clock, he came about eleven, and the justice granted me a warrant, and the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>At what time did you get into their company in the public-house? - I went to the public-house about four in the morning. I had been out in the evening, and staying late, was locked out of my lodging. I went to this public-house, and joined company with them between six and seven.</p>
               <p>How long had you joined with them before you found his hand in your pocket? - About twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>What had you been talking about? - I cannot recollect; I apprehend there was nothing material.</p>
               <p>What subject did you talk about? - No further than they accosted me, and said how do you do, sir, I think I have some knowledge of you; and they asked me to drink with them.</p>
               <p>Was you sober or not? - I had been drinking, but was as perfectly in my senses as I am now. I had had sixpenny-worth of rum and water at that house.</p>
               <p>Where is the house? - In King's-head-court, New Russel-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Do you usually put your money in your waistcoat pocket? - In company I frequently put it in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>What occasion had you to take your money out? - To pay my dividend. I did not like the company, and wanted to get out of it. I threw down a half crown, they gave me but a shilling out of it, which I thought was an imposition.</p>
               <p>If no conversation passed but common civility, what was done to give you a dislike to the company? - They seemed to be of the sky-larking order, in the vulgar phrase, that is, wanting to take all advantages; they wanted me to pay more than my share. I threw my money down to pay my dividend.</p>
               <p>There was no behaviour that gave you offence before you threw your money down to pay the reckoning. The sky-larking conduct was after you threw down the money? - I wanted to get rid of them.</p>
               <p>What had you drank with them? - They had a pot of hot, I believe brandy and rum together. I drank but little to my share. I do not fancy strong liquor in a morning.</p>
               <p>Had any thing been said to you about going into the army, or inlisting? - They said I was a proper person to serve his majesty, and such like; they did not direct that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130009"></xptr> discourse to me, they whispered it among themselves. I saw their behaviour; that was the conduct I did not like.</p>
               <p>What more did the man say to you when he opened his hand with the money in it upon the subject of inlisting? - He d - d me, and said if it was my money, he would insist upon my going with him.</p>
               <p>Had any thing been said about your having taken any inlisting money before? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>Do you think he took the money out of your pocket with a design to inlist you with it? - I believe if he wanted me to inlist, he meant to trepan me with my own money. I believe he had but little of his own.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he did not put it into your pocket? - I am very positive he did not, because I had it in my pocket before.</p>
               <p>Then you imagine that he took this money out of your pocket in order to trepan you to be inlisted? - If I had been foolish enough to take it of him again, I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Then he did not mean to take your money to keep himself, but to give it to you to trepan you for a soldier? - Whatever might be his intent, he kept the money, he did not return it.</p>
               <p>Did you ask for your money again? - No; he said I should know more of it when I had had two or three hundred lashes; and spoke to me with indignation and scorn.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had the money again? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you the man of the house here? - No; he was not present when he took my money.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am foreman to a French trimming shop, No. 34, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I belong to the first regiment of Guards. The officer lets me throw up my pay and go to work. This Sunday morning I was coming from my duty and wanted something to refresh me. I met with two young fellows, plaisterers, who worked with me; I asked them to drink, and we went into this house, where this gentleman and another man were drinking together. When we came in they called for a pot of hot, we called for three penny worth of crank; when the pot of hot came in, he threw down half a crown to pay for it, the waiter took fourteen pence, and he gave the waiter four-pence; the other man took up the shilling and put it in his pocket; he called for another pot of hot, which the other man would not pay for; the waiter then asked the prosecutor for it; he said he had no money; the waiter said he would take any thing he would leave for it; he replied he would not leave any thing. I then said I must go to my duty, upon which he asked me if I was a <rs id="t17790113-6-deflabel33" type="occupation">soldier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17790113-6-defend94 t17790113-6-deflabel33"></join>; I told him I was; he said will you take me? I said, sir, you are joking; he answered no, he was not, he was willing to go; I told him if he was willing to go, I would give him a shilling; I held up the shilling and said, if you take this shilling it is to serve his majesty; he then took the shilling from me. I asked him again if he was willing to go with me before the officer. As we were going out, somebody informed the landlord he was inlisted, and he came and shut me out, and said we should not have him, and threatened me with a constable. I went and got an officer, and took him to the colonel; he then only charged me with taking a shilling off the table to inlist him; he said nothing about this money till he was before the justice; then he said I had robbed him.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This man aided and assisted the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Lee. I was at the King's-head on Sunday morning the 22d of November. The prisoner and I, and several more were in company; Harris was in the same box.</p>
               <p>What passed on the subject of inlisting? - Harris talked of going for a soldier.</p>
               <p>Did Harris propose going for a soldier, or did the prisoner propose it to him? - I cannot rightly say how that was. I saw the prisoner give Harris a shilling.</p>
               <p>Did he take the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the shilling given for? - He said it was to serve his majesty.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the prisoner's putting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130010"></xptr> his hand in Harris's pocket and taking any money out? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Harris charging him with taking his money? - Yes; a good many hours after. When the prisoner gave him the shilling he was on one side of the table, and Harris on the other.</p>
               <p>Did they continue on different sides of the table the whole time they staid there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did he charge the prisoner with taking the money from him? - I believe about seven o'clock; he disputed, and would not go with him; and then charged him with having taken his money.</p>
               <p>Did you see any money pass between the one or the other, or held in either of their hands, except the shilling? - No.</p>

               <p>Was you at the King's-head on Sunday morning the 22d of November? - I believe I was; I do not know the sign; I was at the place where this fray was.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing passing between the prisoner and Harris upon the subject of inlisting? - Yes; but whether it was the prisoner that asked him, or he the prisoner, I cannot say; but there was a shilling passed between them. The prisoner said to Harris, will you inlist? - He said I will. Then the prisoner said here is a shilling to serve his majesty. Harris took the shilling, put it down on the table, and then gave it to the landlord.</p>
               <p>Was there any dispute about the reckoning before that time? - Yes; there was some dispute about the reckoning, and then he paid the shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other money pass between the prisoner and Harris? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Did they sit on the same side of the table or on different sides? - Harris sat down, the prisoner stood up on the opposite side, leaning on the table, and gave him a shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you see any half guinea between them? - I did not see any half guinea, nor any gold in the company.</p>
               <p>Had there been a dispute between Harris and the landlord about the reckoning? - Yes; about a pot of hot. The waiter bid him pay the reckoning; he said he could not he had no money; the waiter said if he would pay the shilling he would pay the twopence for him; Harris gave him the shilling.</p>

When we came into the house Harris was lying on the table seemingly very drunk; we could make nothing of him; the serjeant said, come, my lad, go with me as you have taken a shilling, as the prisoner said he had; if you have not taken a shilling go and see yourself righted; he said they had used him very ill; I asked him if they had robbed him; he said no, but he had spent some money upon them.</p>

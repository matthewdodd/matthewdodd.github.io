                  </hi>. I am in the service of George William Lenox, of Angler's-lane, Tottenham. On Sunday, the 29th of July, I saw his bay gelding safe about half-past three o'clock, in the field adjoining the house—the field also joins the highway—it was loose except haying a log its leg—there is a gate to the field leading to the highway—it was fastened with a chain and wooden peg, but not locked—I missed the gelding on Monday, at half-past seven o'clock—I found the log partly in a pond at the bottom of the field-not near the highway—I know the prisoner by his being employed at hay-making with us the previous week—he was working</p>

               <p>in the same field, one part of which is parted off with hurdles for cattle—we saw marks in the field as if the horse had been dodged about—it was a difficult horse to catch without corn—I saw it again on Monday the 30th at Hatton Garden—I am sure it was the same horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner in Upper-street, Islington, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, on Sunday night, the 29th of July, riding on a gelding—I suspected it did not belong to him, and asked him to whom it belonged—he told me, it belonged to Mr. Rhodes, of the Green-lanes, Tottenham, and he was taking it to Smithfield—he afterwards said it belonged to himself—I said I should detain him—he said he had bought it at Smithfield for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was going to take it there again—I detained him, and took him to Hatton Garden-next day Kent identified it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was coming along the road a man overtook me, riding a horse, and he had this horse in his hand—he asked me to take this to Smithfield for him, I told him "Yes"—he said he would give me half-a-crown to take him to the Ram, Smithfield—he said he had to go another road, and would meet me there, and of course it was my horse, while I was paid for taking it there.</p>

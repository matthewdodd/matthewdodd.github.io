On Saturday evening, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw my father's geese safe—there were some in the goose-house inside the barn—I could not see how many there were—the door was pinned inside—I went in the morning, but not till after my father.</p>

I was not quite fifteen years old—in August last I lived with Mr. Baldwin—he accused me of being concerned in this—on Satur<lb></lb>day the 4th of August, I saw the prisoner—I had known him nearly all my life—between eight and nine o'clock that evening, he asked whether I would open the door for him to take two geese of Mr. Baldwin's—I said, "Yes"—nothing more was said—I went in-doors—in about an hour he came in and called for a pint of beer at Mr. Baldwin's—he asked me to go and open the back barn-door for him—that would take him to where the geese were—I opened the door—I came out and went in the house again—he then came in again, and said he had <hi rend="italic">nicked</hi> one and he would <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> another—he was talking about geese—I went that night and slept where the geese were kept—the next morning I saw some blood about—on the Monday my master charged me and I was taken up—that is all the truth.</p>

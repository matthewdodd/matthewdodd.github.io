On the day charged in the indictment I was in the shop, I saw the prisoner come in, she was served by Mr. Young; he jumped over the counter, I saw him lay hold of the prisoner; he said, you may as well leave what you have got; she hesitated, he brought her in; she pulled out eighteen yards of green and yellow ribbon, that was my property, it had my private mark. Young desired her to pull out what she had got besides, she pulled out a piece of lavender and pink, that was my property. I then desired Young to go for a constable; he said, she has your property on her now. She went down to the privy, a young person in my shop went with her; she was not searched till she was taken to the watchhouse, I was not there.</p>

The prisoner came into the shop and purchased some odd bits of ribbon; I took out three drawers full of ribbon; I saw her put a piece of black ribbon in her pocket; I jumped over the counter, and told her to leave what she had got; she hesitated, and then pulled out two pieces that I did not see her take, one was green and yellow, and the other lavender and pink; they are my master's property, they have his mark on them: they were in the drawers that I exposed to the prisoner, and they are worth thirteen shillings.</p>

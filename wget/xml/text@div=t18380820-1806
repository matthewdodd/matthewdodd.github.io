                  </hi>. I live at Lower Clapton. At half-past five o'clock on the afternoon of the 19th of July I was going along Hack-key-road—I heard a slight noise behind me—I turned, and felt my handker<lb></lb>chief was gone—I saw the two prisoners running across the road—I pur<lb></lb>chased them-Geils fell down—I caught him, and on him was this handker<lb></lb>chief, which is mine-Harding was caught by a witness—they were running together.</p>

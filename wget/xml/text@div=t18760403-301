At 1.35 on the morning of the 20th February I was in company with Constable S 323, in Charles Street, Portland Town—I saw the prisoner spring from a wall—I caught him and asked him the meaning of coming over that wall, he said "You did not see me come over"—I said "My eyes deceived me if you did not"—I took him back, and he said he went in the door—I said "If you did go in the door, why did not you come out that way"—he then said he had been to see a man, a. friend of his—after all he said "To tell the truth I have been there to see a young woman and did not want to get her into trouble"—I told him he would have to explain the reason in coming out in such a manner—in taking him back from where he came I noticed something sticking out of his pocket, and I found all round his waist these tools, and I also found on him this card case, in which were six duplicates relating to new property—he said at the station had he known what we were going to do he would have made a run for it."</p>

I live at 79, Avenue Road—I was called up at 6.30 on the morning of the 5th February, and found the house had been entered—I can identify this card case as my property—there are hundreds like it—I have compared the marks made on the window, by which the entry has been effected, with these tools, and they exactly fit—a box of matches or more were burnt; the matches do not correspond with the <hi rend="italic">box</hi> left behind.</p>

I did not steal them; the woman that is locked up has got a card case, the same as that one, and she was to come here with it, and get some one to defend me.</p>

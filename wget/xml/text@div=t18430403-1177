                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Little Ormond-street. On the 18th of March, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, at night, the pri<lb></lb>soner came and asked for a piece of cheese for a lady at No. 13, in the square—she said she was cook to the lady—we had occasionally served them with cheese—I served her with 3lbs. 7oz. weight, and she went away—I followed her—she went as far as No. 8, and sat in the recess of a door for a minute—she afterwards arose, looked round, and went to the further end of the square, near Guildford-street—I went round and saw her by No. 32—I asked if she had delivered the cheese at No. 13—she stood back, and said, what cheese she had had she had bought elsewhere, and denied having had any of me—I gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge—she said she had bought the cheese and paid for it—she had it under her arm—she said she lived at No. 12, Upper Rathbone-place—I went there to inquire, and no such name was known—I was present when she was ex<lb></lb>amined before the Magistrate—this is Mr. Greenwood's signature—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner says, I don't know the family, I never was at No. 13, Queen-square; a woman asked me to go in and order a piece of cheese, 2lbs. or 3lbs., of mild, kitchen-cheese; I never saw the woman before; I don't know her name."</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she was requested by a woman to order the cheese, and to have it sent to No. 13, Queen-square, and that the never represented herself as the servant.</hi>)</p>

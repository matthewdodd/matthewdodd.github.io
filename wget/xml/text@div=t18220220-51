            's house. On Friday, the 25th of January, between two and three o'clock, I left the house; my desk was safe. I returned at ten at night. The property stated in the indictment was in the desk; it was locked, and was in the back parlour. I missed it about nine the following morning; and have found two of the bank-notes, which have a private mark on them; it was G. C. and Co., my agents, and my own initials. I had parted with none of them since I received them. I saw them in the desk when I locked it; the numbers of them were 20789, and 90. I stopped them at the Bank; and on the 8th of February I saw one of them at the Bank. The outer door of the house is always shut.</p>

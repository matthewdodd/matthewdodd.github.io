               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you hold the bag yourself? - A. Yes; he then asked me to lift it up upon his shoulder, accordingly I did; he then immediately walked out to the stable-door where he entered in at. He was taken in a very few minutes afterwards, for my master did not let him get above ten yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given a hint to any persons to watch him at this time? - A. Yes, my master, Mr. Lonsdale, and one of the men, came up and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ground sugar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in quantity do you think there might be? - A. I cannot say, there might be about eighty pounds.</p>

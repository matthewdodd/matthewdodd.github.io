            . I deal in pigeons, and live at No. 10, Slater-street, Bethnal-green. Mr. Church lives about a mile from me - I know that he kept pigeons, because I had dealt with him; on Monday, the 30th of April, the prisoner Palace came to me with two pigeons, which he offered to sell for 2s. 9d., and said that he had had them four months; I told him he had not had them any such time, for I know the gentleman who had lost them; the prosecutor had previously told me of his loss; I said if he would go with me to the gentleman I would liberate him- we set out to go, but when we got to Back-lane he ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. When he brought the pigeons where were they? A. One was in his hat, and one in his hand.</p>

            . I keep a pigeon shop in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. I have known Mr. Church some time - he came and told me of his loss, and asked me to stop the pigeons if they were brought - Bailey came about eight o'clock on Sunday morning and brought five, and said he had two more - he said they were worth 12s. - I said they were worth 9s.; I asked if he could give me change for a sovereign - he said he could not - I said he must stop till I got change - I said they were very clean, and he replied that they belonged to his brother, who had a good place for them to fly in; I told him to call in about ten minutes; I went to Gooding and told him I thought they had been stolen; I am a pigeon fancier - if pigeons get out, and other people get them we then buy them - if they are let out, and are decoyed away it is considered fair game - that is the custom of the trade.</p>

At eight o'clock on Saturday, the 29th of April, they were all safe - the pigeon-house stands upon four posts, twelve feet high - they cannot get out unless I let them out - at seven o'clock the next morning I missed twenty-eight; I went to the two witnesses and informed them of it; I can swear to these pigeons from having attending them - the two white ones are about two years and six months old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How many white pigeons had you? A. I had seven old, and eleven young ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not many white pigeons about London? A. There are, but I can swear to these - I would pick them out from one hundred - I put no mark upon them - I know them by their faces; there is considerable difference in their faces, and it is by their countenances that I know them - a hundred pigeons probably alter at times by getting fatter and stouter - there is a difference in their noses - we call them models; there are two old ones, a cock and hen - the other three white ones are hens; I am in the habit of minding them when young.</p>
               <p>BAILEY's Defence. I met a young man, and he asked if I would take and sell them for him - he said he would give me sixpence for my trouble.</p>

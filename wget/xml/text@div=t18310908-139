            . I lived as porter with Messrs. Easts, in Leicester-square. I left them on the 20th of March - the prisoner Robinson was in their employ with me; I slept in the shop - Robinson generally came between six and seven o'clock in the morning; Mr. East generally came into the shop to business about nine - he occasionally came into the shop before nine, but not to continue; Robinson employed me three or four times to take out parcels before eight o'clock in the morning; I took one or two to a coffee-shop in St. Martin's-lane, by his direction - I am not certain whether they had a direction on them - I think one of them had "James Robinson" written on it; he sometimes told me the parcels were linen, or his dirty shirts - I tore a bit of the brown-paper off one of them, which I was to leave at a baker's-shop, in Bear-street, St. James', and saw it contained what looked to me like brown kerseymere - I told him that was not his linen as he had told me, and he said it was a cut which he had brought with him out of the City; I have observed him go out with parcels himself of a morning, before Mr. East came down - I have asked him about them; he generally said they were his clothes going to be mended, or his linen going to be washed - John King was the porter who succeeded me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You never looked into more than one parcel? A. No; I undid one corner as well as tore the paper; whether there was linen under the kerseymere I cannot tell; nor do I know what was in the parcels he took out - if I had supposed property of large value was being taken away, I should have mentioned it.</p>

On the 17th of August, in consequence of information, I called in Clements, and we had Robinson into the counting-house - I said to him, "Where do you live?" he hesitated considerably, and said, "What do you say?" I said, "Where do you live, sir?" he said, "No. 3, Upper St. Martin's-lane;" I sent one of my shopmen to inquire if it was true - he came into the counting-house, and said, in the prisoner's presence, that no such person lived there; I again asked where he lived - he replied, "I have done nothing wrong, I shall not tell you;" I then said, "Now, James, I have been seriously robbed, and I am determined to find out the thief;" he then said, "I have never robbed you of 6d.;" I said, "You are resolved then not to tell me where you live?" he said, "Come with me to my brother's, and I will tell you;" I said, "Why not tell me here?" and after he was given in charge he gave me his address, No. 12, Blenheim-street - I saw him searched, and among other things a bunch of keys taken from him; in consequence of some inquiries we made I went to No. 48, Han's-place, Sloane-street, with an officer; I saw the prisoner Martin there, and asked him to show us Robinson's room; he said it was locked - he took us up to the back attic; I found the door wide open - we went in, and with the keys found on Robinson, Clements opened some boxes, trunks, and closets - in the boxes I found several articles of my own wearing-apparel, some account-books, and banker's cheques; the account-books are mine, but not the writing that was in them; the cheque-book was mine - I found in the closets silks, kerseymeres, cloths, umbrellas, and a variety of things; immediately I saw the cloths and silks I knew them to be ours - Martin was with us; we went down stairs, and as we were leaving the room I said,"Have you bought any goods of Robinson?" he said Yes, that he had had considerable dealings with him, and believed he owed Robinson between 400l. and 500l.; I said,"Have the goodness to show me the articles you bought of him;" he said, "All that I have bought of Robinson have tickets on them;" he was at that time showing us his stock - I said, "You appear to me to have an immense sized stock, pray what sized trade have you?" (he is a master tailor) - he said, "I keep from two to three men;" I said, "Have you been aware that this young man is in my service?" he replied, "Most certainly I am;" I said,"Pray when did you expect to pay for these goods you have bought so extensively?" he said, "Perhaps in two or three years' time;" that money was no object to Robinson, and that was the only way he had of investing his property - he said that he (Martin) had had dealings with Mr. Bousfield; we know that name in our trade - the property was in a room on the ground floor; I know it to be ours by the marks - the value of the property he stated to have bought of Robinson was about 300l., besides which there was about 200l. worth in Robinson's room; Martin had no shop - it was a private room; the name of "Martin, Tailor," is on the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Has your father any share in the business? A. He has not; we succeeded him, and pay him a fixed income - Robinson did not give me the information, which led me to Martin; I only know it to be Robinson's room, by what Martin said; we had not missed any of these goods - my brother sold in the shop, also William Landon and Robinson - these goods have not been sold; I can tell that by my books - it is our invariable custom to take off the marks when they are sold, and several of those found both in Robinson's and Martin's rooms have marks attached to them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q.Then the marks were plainly visible to any body who opened the cloth? A. Yes; they still remain fixed to the goods - I cannot be certain that the marks remain on those sold to Martin, till I look at them - I know they are on those found in Robinson's room; our stock mark is made with red pencil and not easily removed; they could be cut off - Clements was with me at Martin's, and heard all that was said; he said that Robinson himself attached the tickets to the goods, to distinguish them from the property he had purchased of other persons - I was violently agitated, and said, "You all deserve to be hanged;" he pointed out 2l. or 3l. worth of goods, which he said, he purchased of Bousfield: Martin's son was present at the latter part of the conversation - two coaches were sent for, and the property put into them, but I do not know whether Martin's son fetched the coaches - it was some part of his household undoubtedly; he did not say he had a book in which an account of the transactions between him and Robinson were kept - we brought a book away, which we took out of Robinson's box; Martin did not produce a book - this is the book we took from Robinson's box; Martin wished his son to accompany him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not a voluntary act on the part of the prisoner and his son, that they went to the office? A.The officer told them they must go to the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this the book (producing one)? A. Yes, it is; Clement's was present at the conversation with Martin - he knew he was an officer.</p>

            . I am an officer, of Marlborough-street. On the 17th of August I saw Robinson at Mr. East's shop; the first address he gave was No. 3, Upper St. Martin's-lane; he then said No. 12, Blenheim-street, and afterwards, No. 8, College-street, Fulham-road - I went to Blenheim-street with a search-warrant, and they said they did not know him, and to No. 8, College-street, but he did not live there - I asked where his brother lived, he said in Yorkshire; I asked where there; he again said in Yorkshire - I ultimately found his brother lived at Mr. Dalston's, in Regent-street; I saw his brother there - I took some keys from the prisoner's possession, and went to No. 48, Han's-place, with Mr. East, and applied the keys to the cupboard, boxes, and drawers in the back attic; they fitted and opened them - a considerable quantity of property was found in Martin's room on the ground floor, as well as in Robinson's - in his parlour and a back room, which appeared a cutting room; they were both on the ground floor - Mr. East asked Martin, if he knew where Robinson lived; he said he knew he lived at Messrs. East's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Do you remember a coach being sent for? A. Yes, two; I think Martin's son went for them - the property produced was brought away in them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Has it been in your possession ever since? A. It has been locked in a room in my house.</p>
               <p>MR. EAST.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you mean to say the goods which are not marked are yours? A. I do; some have neither marks nor tickets, but I should say they are ours.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q.Did not your father openly and fairly disclose what he knew of the transaction? A. I fetched the coach to take away the goods; I did not expect my father would be taken into custody; my father and I both walked to the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Clements go with you? A. He was sometimes before, and sometimes behind - Robinson lodged in my father's back attic.</p>
               <p>MR. EAST. I sleep in the house in Leicester-square; the rent is paid out of the business; we do not both live in it - it is leased to my father, and transferred by him to us; I pay a greater portion of the rent than my brother; the porter belonging to the firm lives in the house; the goods could not have been carried away all at once - I cannot say what portion was carried away at one time; the house is in the parish of St. Anne, Soho.</p>

               <p>Martin put in a written Defence, stating that he had known Robinson upwards of seven years, and from the opportunity he had of observing him, he considered him an honest industrious man, and entitled to confidence; that he let him a room in his house last July; a few days after which, he observed, that as he was frequently in the City, he could match patterns for him, and afterwards stated he could purchase goods for him, representing that he had various opportunities of procuring them, and having property himself, he could afford to give long credit; that he had purchased the goods of him at a regular and fair price, which was entered in a book now in the prosecutors' possession; that he understood he had property left him by his father, and he had no suspicion of the goods having been improperly obtained; he frequently discounted bills for him; and that upon the prosecutors and officer coming, he had made a full disclosure, and afforded every facility to the search. Twenty witnesses gave him an excellent character.</p>

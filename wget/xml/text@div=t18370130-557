On the 8th of December I was directed to take two pairs of boots for Mr. Zouch, 10, Market-street, (there is no Market-place,) at Mr. Abbott's, a tailor—I took them there, and delivered them to Mrs. Abbott—I told her I had brought two pairs of boots for the prisoner—I said they were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not to leave them without the money—she took them up stairs, and came down and said he was shaving—it was between half-past nine and ten o'clock—I waited ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner came down—I asked him for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not make any answer, but closed the door in the middle of the passage, and then said he must trouble me to</p>

               <p>go with him to Charles-street to get the money—I told him I received no orders to leave the goods without the money—he did not say to what house—I refused at first, but then consented—he said if I did not get the money, I should have the goods back—I said, "I understand you, if I don't get the money I shall have the goods back," and he said, "Yes"—he offered me a note first which I was to take to get this money, and asked me to go to Charles-street to get the money—I told him I received no orders to take any notes, that I was to have the money when I delivered the goods—he said that they had all his property there, and that they paid his bills—he wanted me to take the note, and he wanted to return; but I refused unless he went with me—he said, "You know where Charles-street is, you can go on with the note, I am going back to breakfast"—he was then nearly facing Conduit-street or Regent-street—I said, "No; you pro<lb></lb>mised to go along with me, and I will not go without you do"—we walked up Conduit-street as far as Bruton-street, and then he said he did not like to be dragged about the streets by me, and that he had written that letter to Mr. Kettle for the purpose of his paying me; if I took that to Mr. Kettle, at Lord Lonsdale's, I should be paid—I told him again I received no orders to go—he said, "Has not your master sent there before?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Was he not paid?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You will be paid too if you take this letter"(the letter was sealed)—I said I wished to know what was in the letter—he said there was no occasion, he had written to Mr. Kettle for this to be paid—I went on and saw a gentleman with his arm in a sling—I said, "Are you Mr. Kettle?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I brought this letter"—in consequence of what he said I then ran back, but I could not find the prisoner—I saw the mistress of the house where the prisoner lodged—I went to Marlborough street, and gave notice—the next day a letter came, which I have here—I do not know whose writing it is, but we compared it with the letter he gave me—he had left the boots in his room, and said he would go with me to Charles-street to get the mo<lb></lb>ney—I did not know he meant to cheat me out of the money—this thing has greatly injured my character, it being supposed that I wanted to extract money from Lord Lonsdale.</p>

               <p>Hounslow, a coffee-stall keeper—the prisoner lodged in our house; he is a carpenter—on 20th July we gave him a week's notice to leave—I was in the habit of putting his little girl to bed, and on 2nd August I called her to go to bed—she did not come, but the prisoner came and said that he was going to take her away to-morrow—I said that he might have told me, and that I would not let him have another thing out of my house until he paid me my rent which was due—he said that if we both came out to the kitchen door, he would pay us what was due—I went out at the kitchen door, and my husband followed—the prisoner took up this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and struck my husband on the skull—he then struck me with the thin end of the hammer and threatened our lives—I ran into the kitchen and fastened the door—he said he would do for us all, and he burst the door open, and broke off this catch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I ran to the front door and called Mr. Clark.</p>

Q.</hi> Previous to your giving me notice to leave, did you find that I was going to leave? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; your child was always properly treated; you came in with her, and she was quite <hi rend="italic">tight</hi>, and she told me she had been drinking—you put her to bed yourself that night, but I was in the house—there was another female in the house; she is not here; she was the only witness to the assault; she is not to be found—she went with me to the station to prefer the charge—I have not kept her away—a subpoena was sent to her address, but she was not to be found—you owed me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—you were repairing your child's boots with this hammer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-stall keeper at Hounslow Barracks—on 2nd August my wife was in the front kitchen and I was in the back—my wife called the girl three times to put her to bed, and the prisoner said "I am going to take her away to-night"—my wife said "You never told me that; mind you don't take anything out of my house till you have settled with me"—he said "Come out and I will settle with you in a minute"—I went out, and before a word was out of my mouth he gave me a blow on the head with the hammer—I was knocked senseless, and have not been able to do anything since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 308). On 2nd August I toot the prisoner in custody—on the way to the station he said I did it in self-defence—I did not, do it with the hammer, but with this "iron-hook" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you had any conversation with any one about this prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One man spoke to me, and I told him that you said you could produce witnesses—he said if you wanted him. he would be 200 or 300 miles away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did it in self-defence. My intention was to take the child where she would get properly treated and made clean, to go away on the following Sunday. I was mending her boots, and the woman wanted to put her to bed. I said "Don't put her to bed, I am going to take her away to-night"—(the woman had given me notice to quit, because she had found out that I had taken another lodging). The prosecutor said "Are you, you b—, you shall not go away without a broken head, that is what I will let you have; I have an iron-arm here that will do it; I have let many a man have it." I had this iron hook in my hand, and threw it to keep them from me, and it caught him on the side of the head. I was not going away myself that night, but I wanted to take the child away because she was not properly treated. The prosecutor and his wife were the real cause of it. I never thought of doing such a thing. If the prosecutor had not commenced the attack upon me it never would have happened. The hammer was never in my hand.</p>

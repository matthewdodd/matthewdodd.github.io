                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer of 3, Princes Street; Leicester Square, in partnership with my mother—in November, 1874, I gave an order to remove some furniture from 260, Tottenham Court Road, to our sale-rooms, and it was brought to our place and lotted for sale on 26th and 27th November—they formed thirty-three lots from 265 to 288 inclusive; lot 285 was a pianoforte, and 286 was a music stool—I do not bow whether there was an harmonium—the gross amount realised was 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the pianoforte and music stool were booked to Budget for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they were removed from my rooms—the balance was paid to Mr. Budget—I did not see the prisoner in the transaction.</p>

I am employed by Mr. Oxford, the carman—in November, 1874, I went to, I believe, 260, Tottenham Court Road, and—took some furniture from there to Mr. Bonham's—I saw a fair gentleman and a dark gentleman while I was loading the furniture, but I don't think I saw the prisoner.</p>

I carry on business at 38, Southampton Buildings—in January, 1876, the prisoner applied to me to purchase a piano, a harp, and an harmonium—I went with him to Brixton to see the pianoforte, and then to Magdala Terrace, Dulwich, where I saw an harmonium and a harp those three articles were afterwards delivered at my place, and next day the prisoner came there and I gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was an absolute purchase Mr. Leatherdale, the trustee, brought an action against me, and I gave up the goods after I found that I had no proper right to hold them.</p>

I am manager to George Attenborough, a pawnbroker, of the Strand—on 14th November, 1874, I received some silver spoons and forks and advanced 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—this is the entry—they, were pledged by the defendant—it was a small service of silver in a case—it was renewed on 14th January, 1875, when Mrs. Appleby came and paid the interest, and the pledge was renewed—on 26th June, 1875, the interest</p>

               <p>again became due, and the prisoner paid it, but I cannot tell how much it was—he renewed it for three months—no further payments were made—I afterwards sold the articles, and I think they realised the principal and interest as near as could be, including the expenses.</p>

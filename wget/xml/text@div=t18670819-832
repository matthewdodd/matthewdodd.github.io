                  </hi> I am a watchman of vessels, and live at 36, Union Street, Woolwich—on Thursday night, the 11th July, I was on the look-out—I heard a noise, and went in the direction of it, towards the flag<lb></lb>staff, and saw a boat shoving off towards the shore about twenty-five yards from the flagstaff—when he got out into the river he pulled alongside a barge, and remained there about five minutes—I came down close to the shore—he went aboard the barge, and remained there about five minutes—just then I saw the sergeant and another constable, and called their atten<lb></lb>tion to it—the barge lay alongside the pier—he came ashore about thirty yards above the pier—there were no other rowing boats about.</p>

On the 11th July I was on duty, at about half-past eleven, near the pier at North Woolwich—I saw some one in a boat go to a barge which was about a hundred yards from the pier—there was no other boat about—about six minutes afterwards the last witness came up—I had no suspicion—I was on duty at the time—I saw the boat coming from the barge—I waited till the prisoner came ashore, when I and another constable asked him if he had any one, aboard his barge—he took me to the barge in his little boat—I sent the con<lb></lb>stable on board the barge, and told him to search while I remained in the boat with the prisoner—when the constable brought the flags from the</p>

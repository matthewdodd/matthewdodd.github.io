                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Orchard-row, in the parish of Step<lb></lb>ney, in the house of my brother Robert; the prisoner is my brother's grandson, and lived in the house. My brother told him to leave last Mon<lb></lb>day fortnight—I slept in the back room—I got up a little after five o'clock on Thursday morning, the 19th of Feb., and found the bed-room door and the back door open—the room window was open—it was shut and fastened the night before with three nails, which had been drawn—it is about a yard from the ground, and sufficiently open for him to get in—I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment from a box in that room—the box stood endways, and a pickaxe close to it, which appeared to have broken it open—we kept a dog in the yard, which will not let strangers come in—I did not hear it bark that night.</p>

I received information, and went to Walker's house, and found three nails drawn from the back room window—the box appeared to have been opened with a knife and pickaxe—I went to the Hutchinson's Arms, Devonshire-street, and found the prisoner—I told him I wanted him for breaking into his grandfathers or uncle's house—he said he knew nothing about it—on the way to the station he said, "It serves him right, he had no business to turn me of</p>

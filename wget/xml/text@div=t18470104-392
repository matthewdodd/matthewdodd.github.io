                  </hi> I am a linen-draper, and live at Nos. 210, 211, and 212, Whitechapel-road—my brother is my partner. The prisoner was in our service as a porter—he came some time in August, and he was discharged on the 7th of Nov.—I did not see him again till he was taken into custody, but he had been on our premises—on the evening of the 27th of Nov. I was the last person up—I bolted and locked all the doors before I went to bed—on the following morning I came down stairs at half-past seven o'clock—I found the street-door opened, and stuck to, with a piece of shoemaker's wax only—the box of the lock was taken off the street-door, and the box-lock as well as the patent padlock, broken off the inner shop-door—there were a good many things broken, which a screw-driver would have done—from the appearance of the outer door, the person had broken out—a person who was well ac<lb></lb>quainted with the premises could very easily have got on the premises and concealed himself—when I went into the shop I found that the till of the cashier's desk had been broken open—that was where the cash was always kept, which was known quite well to the prisoner—the slide that the till slides on was broken down with violence, so that the till was taken down—the slide appeared to have been taken out with a screw-driver and a chisel, and a hammer had been used—there were two marks of a hammer—about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in small change was taken from the cashier's till—I found a square of glass had been broken from the counting-house door—there is a desk in the counting-house—the bottom of the desk was cut out, and the cash-box taken from the desk—the cash-box contained from ninety to ninety-five sove<lb></lb>reigns, and from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in I O U's, which I O U's were found in the cellar afterwards—I went into the cellar, and found a pepper-box, which had been used as a dark-lantern—this is it—I found this screw-driver, which I know, it belonged to our firm—I have known the prisoner to use it several times—he used it only two or three days before he left—I know it was miss<lb></lb>ing after he left, and it was sought for all over the premises, and not found—I did not seek for it myself, I gave orders for it to be sought for—the porters sought for it—it appeared that an instrument had been used to break the window of the counting-house, and the marks correspond with the point of this screw-driver—I and the policeman tried it—I have seen this penknife in the prisoner's possession before he left the firm—I have not the least doubt about this being the knife I have seen in his possession—on one occasion he lent it to me—I had it in my possession, using it for a few minutes—I have looked at the blade of it, I know it perfectly—no other places were broken open but the desk in the counting-house, and the cashier's desk—other places might have been broken, but not which contained money—those are the only places which a person acquainted with the premises would have broken to find money—the person happened to hit on the only two places where money was.</p>

I am a clothier in the service of Mr. Loveredge—I was at his house that Friday evening—the prisoner was there—I left him there when I left at half-past nine o'clock—I found him there as usual the next day when I got there, about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Swinstead, a straw-bonnet manufacturer on Ludgate-hill, and Ann Donner, at whose house the prisoner had lodged, gave him a good character.)</p>

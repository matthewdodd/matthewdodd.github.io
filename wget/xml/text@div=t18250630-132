            . I am in the employ of Mr. Turner, a builder, whose premises are in Moorfields. On the 20th of May the prisoners came to the yard together, and said Mr. Jones sent them for some slates: Jones works for a person who finds slates and he labour; they said they wanted twenty-five slates, and that they worked for Jones, and were going to take these to No. 22, Finsbury-square, to finish a job for him: I believed their story, and they took them. In about an hour and a half, I had reason to think I was deceived, and next morning I saw them in the new North road - they were secured and denied the charge, but afterwards owned it.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Bull. Turner brought these slates to our yard in Worship-street, for sale, in May - I was not present, but he came again in the evening for the money - master was not at home; he had received 1 s. before; I told him to take the slates away and return the shilling, because I thought he had not come honestly by them; he said he was a master and came from Kentish or Somers' town; I would not let him have them without the shilling - he never returned.</p>

I apprehended the prisoners in the North road - Jenkins was with me, and told them the charge - they denied it, and said they could account for themselves the whole of the day - but as we went to the Mansion-house they acknowledged obtaining them, and said they had sold them to Bull - I went there and found them.</p>

On the 25th of January, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the stable. I told him it was a D - n pretty time to muck out the stable; he said it was. He was going to dinner - his coat was buttoned. I did not see him again until the 28th of January, when he was in custody. I missed the saddle and bridle when I returned from dinner.</p>

            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner in Panton-street, Haymarket, on the 25th of January; I saw he had a bridle under his coat; I followed him into a saddler's shop, and waited outside the door - he came out without the bridle. They informed me at the shop that he was to call again in a quarter of an hour. I waited, and when he came I represented the master, and asked him what he wanted; he said he called about the bridle he left there, that he wanted to sell it, and asked 9 s. for it; he said it was his own. I told him I doubted it, and should take him to Marlborough-street. He said he bought it of a servant of Mr. Smith's, at a mews near Park-lane. I found he was not known there.</p>

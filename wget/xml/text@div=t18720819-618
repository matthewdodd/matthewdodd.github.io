                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 12, St. George's Road, Pimlico—I was taking care of the prosecutrix's house—the prisoner married my. niece, but Know very little of him—on the Thursday previous to 8th July, the prisoner and my niece called on me at the house; I let them in through the area door, and they went out the same way; they stopped a very short time—on the Saturday after, about dusk, I saw two men outside the house, one of them was a tall man, the other I could not identify—the tall man came to the street door; I spoke to him through the window—about 7.15 on the Sunday morning, I came down to look at the time by the clock in the hall, and saw some letters and papers lying open on the hall table; they</p>

               <p>had been in the letter-box over night—I saw the dining-room door a little way open, and said "Who's there?" and the same tall man who I had seen on the Saturday, came to the door; he put out his hand and said "Go up stairs"—I was frightened, and went up; I put on my gown and boots; about ten minutes afterwards I heard the door shut; I then came down and gave an alarm, and the police came; this clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was on the dining-room mantel-piece the night before, was then on the sideboard, wrapped up in newspaper—there was no one in the house but me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the tall man told me to go upstairs he said "I am Mrs. Deering's nephew," or something of the sort—I was very much frightened—I know very little of the prisoner—I don't know where he had been living.</p>

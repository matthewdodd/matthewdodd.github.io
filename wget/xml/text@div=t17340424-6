When the Reckoning came to be paid, I pulled out some Money and this Medal among it. She asked me to let her look on it, and so She took it out of my Hand; and put it into her Mouth; and then told me she had swallow'd it. Mrs Jones the Landlady, let her out at the back Door. I desir'd Mrs Jones to call the Watch; but She bid me do it my self. I ran out and catch'd the Prisoner; and getting Assistance, carried her to St. Martin's Round-house, Mrs Jones came, and said, if I'd take her Word, the Prisoner should be forthcoming on the Morrow, and I shou'd have the Medal in 3 Days, if I would give the Prisoner the Value of it in Silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you with other Whores in Windsor-Court, where you drank 5 or 6 Quarterns of Brandy with them, and then they beat you?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. But was not you a fighting with them? and did not I come and take your part, when they were a beating of you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was a little of a Debate - but no Fighting as I remember.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You was drunk, and don't know what there was - I am sure you begg'd of me to see you safe out of the Court, for you was afraid they'd quite demolish you; and when we came into the Lane, you invited me to drink a Glass of Wine for my Civility.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. And so he did about 2 in the Morning. And the Woman of the House knows it; for she was in the Room all the while - but she is not here, because they want to prosecute her for keeping a Baudy-house.</p>

The prisoner purchased a bit of meat of me on Saturday, the 10th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; it came to 8d. or 9d. - she offered a very bad shilling; I stopped her, and would not let her have the shilling back - Hopkins looked at it, said it was very bad, and gave it to the officer - I am sure the prisoner is the woman: she was taken to be examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Burn; we live in Bluegate-fields. On the 2nd of September, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to lodge there—he sent the girl out on an errand, and then the other man who was with him wanted to wash himself—I went up stairs to show him the soap and water, and when I returned to the room I saw the prisoner had his hand in my tea-caddy, in which I had two sixpences and two penny pieces—I was frightened, and let the prisoner go to bed—I then went to the caddy, and the two sixpences were gone—I sent for a policeman.</p>

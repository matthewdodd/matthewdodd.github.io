                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 225). About 1 o'clock on Sunday, 28th February, I was on duty near Ebury Square—I saw the prisoner there, Standing at the corner of Racquet's Buildings—he afterwards passed on towards Elizabeth Street—I saw him again about 2.45—I was then stand<lb></lb>ing at the corner of Ebury Square—he came and looked at me, and went black—I heard a noise of broken glass—I went up to where the smash came from, and I saw the prisoner come out of Racquet's Buildings—he went half-way down Flask Lane, which runs out of Ebury Square—he stood there some few minutes, and then went back—he went back to the window of 8, Flask Lane—he appeared to be fiddling something about, and I heard something drop—it appeared to be a loaf of bread—I saw him putting something under his coat—I was standing round a corner—I went up to him, and he was then buttoning his coat up—he saw me coming, and let his coat loose, and something dropped from it—he ran away, and I followed him—he bolted through an empty house, No. 1, Flask Lane, and escaped—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I afterwards went back to the place, and found 17lbs. of bacon, and some loaves of bread.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stone polisher, of 8, Old Pye-street, Westminster—on Thursday evening, 29th March, I was going home, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner's wife and her sister-in-law ill-using my sister—the prisoner came down afterwards, took his wife away, and then he began ill-usiug my sister—I said that he was a cowardly fellow, and asked him whether he would fight me—he said that he had something in doors which would fight me, and ran in; I ran away home—next evening about 6 o'clock, I was coming from my work, and saw the prisoner standing by my door; there were about twenty or thirty people there—I heard the prisoner say, that he would have my b—liver—I was stopped from going into my house, but the prisouer was taken away by some of his friends—I then went in and had my tea, after which I went out and spoke to a policeman on the beat, telling him that I was in danger of my life—about 9 o'clock I saw a crowd pass near the corner of Strutton-ground, Westminster—a man was being pursued by a constable—I ran about ten yards to the corner of Grey-coat-place, where I stopped, and all of a sudden I had a tremendous blow on the forehead; I fell to the ground, looked at the prisoner and said, "For God's sake, Ingram, do not kill me"—he said, "I will do for you, you b—"—I do not remember a second blow, I fell to the ground and became insensible—I came to myself as they took me towards the police-station—I was taken from there to the hospital—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner except on the previous night, about his acting in a cowardly way—I had this cap on when I was struck (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), here are two marks on my forehead.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of 30th March, I saw a mob at the corner of Strutton-ground; the prisoner and prosecutor were there—I saw the prisoner take this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his breast pocket and strike the prosecutor on the forehead; he was knocked down; he said. "For God's sake, Jack Ingram, do not kill me"—the prisoner then struck him again on the forehead and ran away—I took Howe to the Hospital.</p>

I went in search of the prisoner and found him on the roof of a house in Duck-lane; two other officers were with me—when we got about three feet from him he said we need not trouble ourselves any further, and came down very quietly with us—I had this poker in my hand on the way to the station—I mentioned nothing about it, but the prisoner said he knew nothing of it—I got this cap from Howtf, in this condition.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there not other people given in charge by the prosecutor first of all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; that is ft mistaken idea—a man named Adams was taken first of all for some other offence which occurred in Peter-street, and when he got in he said, "I am charged with cutting Howe's head open"—I said, "No, you are not"—another policeman preferred a charge against him next morning; he was not given in charge for this offence—the prisoner keeps pigeons, but not the house where he was found; he was six houses away from his own house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Westminster Hospital—Howe was brought there on 30th March bleeding from two contused wounds on the forehead, one in the centre and one over the left eye—the longest one laid the bone bare to the extent of a sixpence; it was not bleeding much, but it had been from the appearance of his clothes—he was under my care about a month, and those wounds might have been produced by this poker, and I should think it would also produce the cut in this cap; I hate placed the cap over the wound and the cut appears to correspond exactly.</p>

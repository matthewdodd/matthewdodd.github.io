            . I am a constable, I went with a warrant in company with Hanfleet, Mr. Wallis's foreman, and Fell, to No. 14, opposite of the Thatched House, Islington, where I saw the prisoner; there was a saw stood there, Hanfleet said this saw belongs to my master; this square was found in the same room; he said he had taken them for the use, he meaned to bring the saw and the square back to his master's promises at night. I took him in custody. After he was committed I went to his lodgings, No. 31, Great Earl-street, Seven Dials; from there I brought away two planes, a copper glue pot, and a till.</p>

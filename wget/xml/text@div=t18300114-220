S. Pratt" - The 2nd of January was on a Saturday; the bristles were lying at Botolph wharf; an invoice was made out on Saturday respecting the delivery-order; an order was given for weighing the goods off on Saturday - I gave that order to his clerk; he had said he would send some body for the order to have the goods weighed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any arrangement made between you and the prisoner respecting the delivery-order and the payment? A. The cash was to be paid directly, because he wanted the goods immediately, as he wished two casks to send directly to Birmingham; when his clerk called for the order, he had not got the money - I said I could not give him the order for the delivery without the money, but I said I would send somebody with him to see them weighed, and would send our clerk on Monday with the delivery-order, and to receive the money - I sent Brown on Monday; he returned about twelve oapos;clock with the delivery-order, and without the money, and about half an hour after he returned the prisoner came to the counting-house, and said, "

You have sent the delivery-order for the money" - I said Yes; he said "Well, I will pay you directly" - the clerk had brought the delivery-order back, and it was on the desk in the counting-house; he said, "I have not got a cheque now in my pocket, but I will pay you directly, may I not have the delivery-order?" I said, "If you wish to pay me directly, I have no objection to give you the delivery-order" - I gave it to him; he went away with it - I went to Botolph-wharf directly after; I followed him immediately; and on getting there he had arrived, and was busy in removing the bristles away, putting them in a cart, loading them - I said, "You cannot have the bristles without first paying for them;" he said Why - I told him I did not know him and the reference he had given me was one which I could not trust; he said he would pay for them as soon as he had got them to his house - the cart was at this time standing on the wharf, and the carter with him; he said nothing about my accompanying the cart - he said he would pay as soon as they were at his house - as I did not trust him; he had no business to trust me, and he would not pay before the bristles were at his house, he mentioned, that he would pay for them at two oapos;clock, which was about the time they would be at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hour of two mentioned? A. Yes; it was mentioned by Mr. Pratt - this was about one oapos;clock; I consented to their being carted to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they to be delivered when they got there without his paying for them? A. Why, I expected he would pay for them; I had no authority to deliver them without being paid for, but I sold him the bristles, but my intention was not to let them go without the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have delivered them to him unless he was to pay for them on their arrival in Crispin-street? A. No, I would not have delivered them; Brown, the clerk of Botolph-wharf was present at part of the conversation - I then went home, intending to send another clerk to Crispin-street which I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your master sever appeared at all in the transaction? A. No, I did what I thought proper; there is a dealing in our trade called prompt - by that I understand cash down; so many days prompt means so many days credit - prompt without naming any days, I should think does not mean fourteen days; I should not understand it so; I gave the weighing order on Saturday - I sent the delivery order first on Monday; I afterwards gave it to the prisoner, and went soon after to the wharf - he had not got the bristles in the cart; he was busy when I came, but I stopped them - we then had a conversation, and he was to pay when they got to his house, which would be about two oapos;clock; I let him go on that, and hearing Brown, the warehouseman at the wharf, say he had known him several times receiving goods in a regular way before.</p>
               <p>Q. On those considerations you let the goods go, to be paid for when they got to his house, which you understood to be at two oapos;clock? A. Yes; I did not send anybody with the cart - I intended to send somebody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In consequence of what he said, did you let them go on condition that they should be paid for when they got to his house? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go to the prisoner's house afterwards? A. Not myself; I sent Brown, our clerk, to his house a little before two o'clock to receive the money, and I called on the 5th but not for the money - I called to get the money, or to see Mr. Pratt about the bristles - this invoice (looking at it) was written in our counting-house by one of our clerks; it is headed "Plaw and Co." which is the firm, but I do not know of any partner - the prisoner had written down references; I went to them, but was not satisfied with them at all - I did not state so before the Alderman I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the use of the reference, if he was to pay ready money? A. Because he might have brought more; we wish to know with whom we deal, and always have a reference.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Does prompt on delivery. mean fourteen days after? A. No; the four casks weighed about 20 cwt., and were worth 198l. odd.</p>
               <p>HUTCHINSON BROWN. I am clerk to Mr. Plaw. On the 4th of January, the last witness sent me to the prisoner's residence, No. 40, Crispin-street, to obtain the money for the bristles, before they were delivered out of the cart - I arrived there a little before two o'clock; the prisoner was not at home - the cart and the bristles did not come there; I remained there till five minutes past three, and left in consequence of being informed it was not likely he would return - there was abundance of time, from one till three o'clock, to carry the goods from the wharf, to that place again and again; I returned and told my employer what had occurred, and Henry Crump was sent there - he returned almost directly; I saw the bristles in the same casks as they were weighed in, at Mr. Kentapos;s in Falcon-square, on Tuesday, the 5th, about half-past three oapos;clock - he is a respectable gentleman, and deals largely.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140102"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.They were to be paid for at Crispin-street? A. My directions were to receive the money - the wharf is about a mile and a quarter from Crispin-street; I found he resided at the address he gave, and saw some females there.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you go on the Monday with the delivery-ticket? A. Yes, previously, and not seeing him there, and not receiving the money, I brought it back - I was told he was gone out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time would it take to convey the bristles from Botolph-wharf to Paucras-lane? A. About twenty minutes - that is not in the way to Crispin-street, but quite out of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did not Spaeth agree to let them go, provided he would pay him next day? A. I heard no such conversation between them -I am rather deaf, but if there had been a conversation of that sort in my presence, I should have heard it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q.Upon what understanding did he agree that they should go? A.They were to be paid for immediately on delivery.</p>

On the 4th of January I took four casks of bristles out of a cart into my own, and took them to Pancras-lane, Queen-street, Cheapside - the prisoner directed me to go there, and came after me: he was there when I delivered them, and told me if I was asked where I delivered them, to say I delivered them into a waggon at Smithfield - they were housed in a warehouse on the left-hand side of Pancras-lane.</p>

Kents would be in the way.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HIGGINS. I am foreman to Messrs. Kents. On the 5th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to the counting-house; I did not know he had been there before - in consequence of what passed I accompanied him to Pancras-lane, by order of Messrs. Kents, to examine four casks of bristles, which I found there - there was nothing else whatever; the place was quite empty - while I was examining the bristles he said he hoped I should report them as an article Messrs. Kents would purchase, as he had taken them for a bad debt; he asked what I thought they were worth - I said it was not a fair question to ask me; when I reported them to Mr. Kent, he would know how to deal with him - he then said,"My reason for asking is, because I don't know whether they may be worth 1d. a pound, or 20s.," (I think) - they were then brought in a cart to our warehouse; the prisoner followed them - an officer was waiting at our house, and took him into custody with the same bristles; "Brown's warehouse" was written over the door in Pancras-lane -I have seen a Mr. Brown, who I understand belongs to the premises; he went with us to see the bristles - he was waiting outside our premises, and the prisoner represented him as a friend of his, who had lost a great deal of money, and as we went along Brown said, "You may depend on it they are a good article, Sir, and I am only sorry for Mr. Pratt, for he has lost a good deal of money" - he gave the same account as the prisoner did, of having taken them for a bad debt, that it was all Pratt could get, and he had been a very great sufferer; I have not seen Brown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140103"></xptr>since - I did not hear from him in the prisoner's presence that they were his premises, and did not know but they were the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>GUILTY, believing he purchased with a fraudulent intention, and never intended to become a real purchaser. Aged 28.</p>

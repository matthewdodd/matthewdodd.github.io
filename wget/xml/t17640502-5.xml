He said, Your money: I told him I had but a very little, but I would give him all I had. I put my hand in my pocket, and gave him sixpence, and three farthings, and said, this is all: He said, a very little indeed: He returned me the three farthings, saying, it was of no use to him: He put the sixpence in his pocket, and said, it was a very small matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell who that man was?</p>
               <p>Lawford. He had a great coat on, buttoned up almost to his nose. I was sent for, two or three days after that, to know if I knew the man; there was the prisoner, I said, before the justice; I believed he was the man that robbed me; I saw the mare in the stable where the prisoner was taken; she was a poor looking thing; I believe it to be the same the man rode that robbed me; it is the same colour and size; but I did not know, when I was robbed, whether it was a horse or a mare.</p>

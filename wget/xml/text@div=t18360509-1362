                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live in Carlisle-place Lambeth. On Monday night, the 10th of May, I had been cut to spead the evening at the King's Arms, in Horsemonger-lane—I was sober—I had been there about three hours—I was walking home with John Chopman, between twelve and one o'clock, at the side of the pin manufacturers, leading to the Borough-rond—I was suddenly knocked down by one of the prisoners—I had not observed any body before they struck me on my head—it was done with the fist, I suppose—I fell on the ground, and grazed my face, and my friend left me—before I got up my hat fell off, and when I re<lb></lb>covered myself, I found Edward Nunn upon me—I was a little stunned—after he left me, I saw him pick my hat up and run away with it—there was a handkerchief in it—I only saw on person there at that time, but after I got up the other prisoner came up, and we had a scuffle together—I should thing that was not a minute after the other prisoner was gone—we both fell, and I called "Murder" and "Police"—Cowline, the policeman, then came up—my finger and thumb were hart a good deal—the con<lb></lb>stable took hold of us both, and parted us—my hat was brought back in three or four minutes by another policeman—the handkerchief was not it it—I did not see the person who knocked me down, but I should know him again if I were to see him—I did not see the man who gave me the first blow, but Edward is the man who lay on me—I saw my handkerchief at Union-hall.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with the prosecutor at the King's Arms—we had been there three hours and a half or four hours—we had ale to drink—I do not think we had any thing else—I paid half-a-crown for the drink—as we proceeded along a street leading into the Borough-road, we were not by two persons—they were together—I could see there were some persons in the street, but not so as distinguish them—they came up towards us, and both attacked my friend—I ran away, and cannot tell what happened afterwards—I did not see my friend on the ground—they were both strug<lb></lb>gling together when I quitted the spot—they had not got him on the ground when I left—I passed on when they attacked me—it was in the horse way I rather think; it was by the side of the pin manufactory—it was not on the flag-stones—I cannot say what they were scuffling about when I ran off—I cannot say whether anything was said when they came up—I did not call "Murder"—it was put down as such before the Magistrate, but I did not assert it—this is my signature—I do not think it was read over to me—I was sworn.</p>

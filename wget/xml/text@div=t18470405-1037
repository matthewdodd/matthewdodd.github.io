                  </hi> I am master of the workhouse of St. Luke, Chelsea; Brunsden was an inmate there; she had the care of the lying-in ward. On the 27th of March a sheet was brought to me by O'Keefe, who said she be<lb></lb>lieved it belonged to us—I found it was so—on the afternoon of the 30th of March I went to Brown's house with an officer—Brown was not at home—she! came to me about seven or eight o'clock the same evening, and said, "You called at my house about a sheet"—I told her I had a sheet brought to me, and I asked her to account for the possesaion✗ of it, and said "I bought it of Brunsden, one of your nurses; I bought a shift and a shawl from the same person"—on the morning on the 31st I charged Brunsden with having sold these things—she denied it—I told her Brown had told me so—she still denied it—I took her to the station, and she then said she did sell them.</p>

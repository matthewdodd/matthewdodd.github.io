                  </hi>. I belong to the <hi rend="italic">Sherlock, lying</hi> in the Thames. On Friday morning, the 1st of Dec, I went home with Stephens, and went to bed with her—I put my trowsers, which contained eight or ten shillings, and two half-crowns, under my pillow—I had been in bed about three quarters of an hour, when I awoke, and found the prisoner gone, and my trowsers also—I went on the staircase in about five minutes, and called Claridge, who is the landlady—I had not seen her before—I said nothing to her—I saw Stephens come up with my trowsers, and Claridge was close behind her—I asked Stephens where my trowsers were—she said she knew nothing about them—they came up stairs, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me into the room, and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> my trowsers under the bed—a light was fetched—I put my hand into the pocket, and found only sixpenny worth of copper—I had had no copper there before—I put on my clothes, went down, and found the prisoners in the kitchen—I asked them where my money was, and asked if they would deliver it up—Stephens said they would not, they had not got it—I called a policeman, and gave them in charge.</p>

            . Q. On Saturday, the 13th of February last, were you at the Royal Oak public-house - A. Yes, in Back Hill, Clerkenwell I there met Herbert, Matthews, and Hancock, police officers. Herbert gave me two shillings, and a three-shilling bank token, to purchase a poundsworth of bad money of the prisoner, Jacobs. I afterwards went to Petticoat-lane, and went into the Red Lion public-house, and enquired for Jacobs, of a Jew that was there. I was directed to an opposite public-house, the sign I don't know. I there found Jacob Jacobs. I told Jacobs what I wanted. He told me to go to another public-house. I told him I come for five shillings worth more money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any previous transaction with him - A. I had seen him before, and bought of him twice. I mentioned the name of flats to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are flats - A. Bad shillings. I asked him for five shillingsworth of flats. That is a score. He told me that he would go and fetch them. I had had a score of him before, and I had the same quantity again. He desired me to go to another public-house, and he would come to me and bring them. He said, the public-house the left hand side of Petticoat-lane, the corner of a gateway. He had taken me to that public-house before, which made me know it again. I went there. He came to me in about ten minutes after I was there. He gave me wrapped up in a bit of paper twenty bad shillings. I gave him a three-shilling bank token, new coin, and two shillings. The three-shilling bank token, and the two shillings had been marked by Herbert. Herbert came into the public-house immediately almost after the money was given into my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the score of money - A. The twenty shillings were taken from me by Mr. Matthews.</p>
               <p>JOHN HERBERT. Q. Did you go with the last witness on the 13th of February - A. I did. I delivered to her one three-shilling bank token, the last coin, and two shillings. They were good, and marked. I marked the token with an X. I gave her the money to go and purchase bad money of the prisoner, which she had done before. She went first of all to the Red Lion, Petticoat-lane, on the right hand side going up out of Bishopsgate-street. The Jews directed her to a public-house across the lane, on the left hand side. I do not recollect the sign. There she went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in - A. I did not at that house. She came out and said, all is right. I saw her go in another public-house. (I think it is the Flying Horse; it is just out of the City, in Middlesex), and the prisoner followed her. I went in and called for a pint of porter, and pulled down my hat. I saw the prisoner put into Jackson's hand, a paper. I saw her give him something. After seeing that, I turned upon my heels, and came out instantly. The prisoner came out of the door. I catched hold of him directly, and secured him. Matthews searched the prisoner, and found the two shillings, and the three-shilling token that I had marked.</p>

            . I went in company with the first witness to Petticoat-lane, and I was present when this money was marked. The moment the prisoner came out of the public-house, I catched hold of his collar. In his left hand waistcoat pocket, I took out the money that I had formerly marked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Cosmorama, in Re<lb></lb>gent-street, and live in Alfred-place, Bedford-square. On the 25th of September, 1889, I saw this advertisement in the "Morning Herald"—(reads)—"Situation of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, besides rent, coals, and candles, may be obtained by any respectable man who can write a good hand, keep accounts, and refer to two respectable housekeepers as to honesty and sober habits. None need apply who cannot command 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Address, post paid, to Mr. James Barlow, 23, Alfred-street, Bedford-square, with right name and address."—In consequence of that advertisement I went to the address referred to on the same day—I found the name of Barlow on the door—I was introduced to the prisoner Shelford as the advertiser—he was in the first-floor front-room, alone, and I went alone—(there were four or five persons waiting in the passage)—he had several papers and letters before him—I told him that I called respecting the situation—he asked me how I knew of it—I told him I had seen it in the paper that morn<lb></lb>ing—he asked which paper—I told him in the "Morning Herald"—he asked what was my situation in life—I told him that I was a clerk in the service of a gentleman in Regent-street—he said, "Well, you know the particulars of the advertisement; are you prepared with a sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I told him I could be—he said, "The situation is on a rail-road;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184002030129"></xptr>
               <p>have you any objection to leave London?"—I told him that I had not—he said, "In this stage of the proceeding I shall not say at which rail-road, but it is one of the best in the country, and you may guess which"—he said, "Now, don't deceive yourself and me; have you the sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at your command, or shall you have to go from friend to friend to raise it? that will not do; you are aware that in these cases the utmost secrecy is requisite; you ought not even to tell your own wife; a man may be a friend to-day and your enemy to-morrow"—I told him that I could be prepared with 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a given time, if I was satisfied that he could obtain me the situation—he said that he had the influence of a director, whose turn it was to nominate to an appointment, and the person that he recommended would have the situation—he said, "If I select you, the transaction will be between you and me"—he said that I should have to receive the money paid by the passengers, and to forward it to London—he said he had several applications for the situation, and if he selected me, I should hear from him on the following Saturday—I then left the house—he was dressed in a black frock coat, a double-breasted waistcoat, black trowsers, a black curly wig, no whiskers, and a white cravat—I saw him again on the following Saturday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, at my own house—he called on me—he was dressed as before—he said, "I am happy, sir, to say I have obtained the appointment for you, and in fact, I should have had the appointment made out for you, but you forgot to give me your Christian names in full, and also the name of the parish you reside in"—I wrote down those particulars, and gave them to him—he then asked me if I was prepared with the money—I told him that I had it in the house, but I expected, before I paid it to him, that he would introduce me to the secretary or the board of directors—he said, "Sir, if you have any doubt of me, matters are at an end between us, and I can fill up the situation not a hundred yards from this house; you are not aware how these matters are managed; if a man obtains a situation under government, he does not see the party who introduces him to it; and the same in the India House, except that there a man is sworn to the performance of certain duties"—he said, "What more satisfaction can you have? I will give you a printed document, headed by the name of the rail-road, and under Act of Parliament; it will be filled up with your name, and the particulars of the situation, signed by four directors, and countersigned by an eminent banker; I don't want to touch a farthing of your money till I give you the appointment"—he was to bring it to me on the following Monday, which he did, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—my wife was then in the room—he said, "I am happy, sir, to say that I have your appointment, are you prepared with the money?"—I said I was, and be gave the appointment into my hands—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said it was on the Birmingham railway—after I had read it I said, "It seems all right, I will go and get you the money"—I left the room, and returned with a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I opened the note, and said, "Here is a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note," and gave it into his bands—he then said, "Your station will be at Birmingham—there will be another clerk with you—your regular duty will be six hours a day each, but by one doing duty for the other, you may be absent at any time"—he then asked me when I should be prepared to commence duty—I told him that day week, the following Monday—he said he would meet me on the following morning at the Euston-square station, that he would introduce me to the secretary,</p>

               <p>and go with me to my station at Birmingham—my wife asked if the might accompany us—he said, yes, it was an understood thing that the ser<lb></lb>vants of the Company could travel on the rail-road free of expense—he then left with my 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and left me this paper—(<hi rend="italic">Thomas Phillips, a clerk in the Bank of England, here produced a</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">note</hi>)—that is the note I gave the prisoner—I parted with it in consequence of bis giving me that ap<lb></lb>point ment to the situation—I believed that it was a genuine one, and believed his representations to be true—I went the same day to the Eus<lb></lb>ton-square station, and made inquiries—I saw the chief clerk—I also went the following day, but did not see Shelford—I had no idea of meeting him, from what I had learnt there—I did not see him again till the 6th of De<lb></lb>cember, when I gave him into custody, in Holborn—his hair was then something the same as it is now—he had no wig on, and he wore whiskers—he was taken before the Magistrate, and remanded, several times—I gave notice to the Bank respecting the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note the same day that I paid it, and on Friday, the 4th of October, I received a communication from the Bank, which led me to the house of Holland, a cheesemonger, in Drury-lane—I made inquiries of him, in consequence of which I went with Shaw and Thornton, the officers, to the house of the prisoner Rickaby, on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 5th of October, at No. 1, Bridgehouse-place, Newington-causeway—it is a broker's shop—the name of Rickards was on the side of the house—we found Rickaby there, and asked him how he became possessed of a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that he had changed at Mr. Holland's, in Drury-lane—he said that he was standing at his door last Monday afternoon, about three o'clock, (that would be Monday, the 80th of September, the day on which I parted with the note;) that a tall thin man came up to him, who was a stranger to him, and asked him if he could give him change for a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Rickaby said that he told him he could not; that the man then said to Rickaby, "You know Mr. Gullen, do you not? he owes you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., does he not?" he said he did; the man said, "Well, I have called to pay those 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you will give me change for a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—Rickaby said that he took the note from the man's hands, examined it, looked at the water-mark, and thought it was a good one—he then asked us if it was a forgery—we gave him no answer—we asked him again to describe the man, and he said it was a stout man, with a pale face, black hair, and no whiskers—he repeated two or three times the fact of his having no whiskers—we then asked him how he was dressed—he said he had a black frock-coat, a double-breasted waistcoat, black trowsers, and, he thought, a black cravat—we asked him if he went to any of his neighbours to try to get the change—he said he did not; that he told the man he would go to the Bank to get it changed; that the man objected to that, and said he was going westward; he told the man he was going that way also, and he would get him the change—he said the man went with him to Waterloo-bridge, and that he (Rickaby) went to Hol<lb></lb>land's, in Drury-lane, to purchase some goods, and got change there—we asked him if he then came back to Waterloo-bridge to give the man the change—he said he did not, because the man went with him to Holland's, and he gave him the change in the street—we asked him how he gave him the change, if in gold or notes—he said, in gold and notes—we asked him if he knew the numbers of the notes—he said he did not—we asked him if there were any fives or tens, or was one of them a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said, "I gave him twenty-eight sovereigns and a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—we asked him if he knew the number of that note—he said he did not—we asked him if he</p>

               <p>knew Mr. Gullen well—he said, "Very well—we asked what he was—he said that he was a solicitor; that he was living at Sunbury; that he had had several transactions with him in the way of business—we asked him what the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing for—he said, for business done for Mr. Gullen—we asked him for what specific business, and he said, "For a valuation"—we asked him when the valuation was made—he said, about eight months back—we asked him if he had given the strange man any acknowledg<lb></lb>ment for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had paid on account of Mr. Gullen—he said he had not—we asked him what day it was that he changed the note, if he was positive it was on the Monday, and He said he was—we asked him what goods he had purchased at Holland's—he said he could not say exactly, but they were articles in cheesemongery—we asked him if he could not name any particular article—he said be could not—we asked if he could say to what amount the goods were—he said he could not—we asked him again if he knew Mr. Gullen well—he said, "Very well," that he was living at Sunbury—I asked him, "Do you say Sunbury or Sudbury?"—he said, "Sunbury, in Middlesex"—I took out my pencil, he spelt the name and address letter by letter, and I took it down, and also wrote his name under it—we asked what address the man had given with the note—he said, "John Brown, No. 22, Grafton-street"—he asked us if we did not see that address on the note—we told him we did—we then left the house, but without losing sight of the shop-front where we had been talking—we went about two or three hundred yards from the house, and from something which occurred to us we went back again—Rickaby was not then at home—there is a side-door to his house which leads into an adjoining street, and he might have gone out that way—on finding he was not there, we went to the nearest coo-stand, took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went at a good pace to Holland's, in Drury-lane, where we found Rickaby, in conversation with Holland—Rickaby said that Holland was his brother-in-law—we asked Holland, in Rickaby's presence, how he gave the change to Rickaby—he said, "In gold and notes"—Rickaby said, "You gave me twenty-eight sovereigns and a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, did you not, Mr. Holland?"—Holland said, "Yes, I did"—we then asked Rickaby what goods he had purchased at Mr. Holland's when he got the change—he said "Half a side of bacon, a Dutch cheese, six pounds of butter, and some eggs; did I not, Mr. Holland?" and Holland said, "You did"—Rickaby then left the shop, and we followed him to an adjoining street—we then entered into conversation again, and Rickaby said, "I do not know who you are, gents., or on what authority you are asking me these questions" Thornton then told him that he was a constable, showed him his staff, and explained to him that 1 bad been defrauded of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that that was the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that had been traced to him—he said, "Now that I know there is something wrong, if I can meet with the man I will give him into custody, so help me G—d!"—he then asked Thornton for his address, which be gave him—we hen went to a public-house, and had something to drink, which I paid for—we again asked him if he knew Mr. Gullen well, and Shaw wrote down Gullen's name and address from his spelling—we then parted from him—I saw Rickaby two or three times afterwards, previous to the 6th of December last, but nothing passed between us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living at present in Castle-street, Leicester-square, but I belong to Brighton. I went to a house in Alfred-street re<lb></lb>specting this advertisement in the "Morning Herald," and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner Shelford, who went by the name of J. Barlow—I talked to him on the subject of the advertisement—I was with him about ten minutes—his appearance was very different to what it is now—he wore a black wig, and had no whiskers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended Shelford on the 6th of December, in Holborn, and went the same morning to No. 8, Union-court, Holborn, where I had seen Shelford come out of, and searched the house—I found some letters and papers—on the evening of the 13th of December I was with Thornton, at the corner of Southwark-bridge-place, Newington-causeway, and apprehended Rickaby by his own house—his house is a corner one, and we took him at the corner—I searched his house, and found these memorandums, this letter, and some duplicates—Thornton found some memorandums and duplicates, and three wigs, but only brought one away—I was with M'Cowell and Thornton at Rickaby's house, and heard the conversation between them—I also went to Holland's, and found Rickaby there with Holland—I also heard the conversation there—we went straight from Rickaby's to Holland's, in a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

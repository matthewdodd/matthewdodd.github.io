On Saturday night, 8th July, I received information, and went to 20, Old King Street, Deptford, about 8 o'clock, where I found Dennis Griffln lying on the ground in a pool of blood with several wounds on his head—I broke into a room on the same floor where I found the prisoner, I told him I should take him into custody for wounding Griffin, he made no answer, he had been drinking a little.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife, we live at 20, Old King Street—on the night of 8th July, the prisoner and my husband came to the door of our house—some children wore about the door, and the prisoner said that he had something which he had used before, and he would use it to the children—my husband said that the children must bo in some place—the prisoner said "You are not on to your children, you are on to me"—there were some words, and the prisoner went in and brought out this reap<lb></lb>ing hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and struck my husband on the head with it—I think he struck him five strokes, because there were five wounds, he fell, and I sent for a policeman—the prisoner then went indoors, and threw down the hook in the passage, where I had to pass to go upstairs—I sent the policeman there for it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 8th July, I was at my own door, and some children wore in the doorway—the prisoner came up as soon as I did, and told them that if they did not get out of the way he had something that would cut their heads off; and he said "You are not on to the children, you are on to me," and he went in and brought out this sickle, undid the hay-band which was round it, and struck me with it, and I did not recover consciousness till I was in the hospital—on the Tuesday night before, he said that he had something indoors, and that he had done it once before, and would do it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon, at the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich—Griffin was admitted there on the 8th, and I came on the 23rd after which I attended him—he had five incised wounds, two of which had not closed up—four of them were very severe, and one went down to the skull—they might have been inflicted by this sickle—ho was in danger for some time—some of the bones of the skull died, and had to be removed.</p>

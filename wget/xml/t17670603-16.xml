            . On the 4th of May in the afternoon, I was drinking tea with my spouse; my boy came and said, a man had gone out with something; I ran out, and overtook the prisoner in three or four yards from the door; I went a little way behind them to hear what they said to each other; I rapped the prisoner on the shoulder, and said, friend, you have got something of mine there; he had his hands behind him under his coat; he swore a great oath, and shifted the apron out of one hand into the other; he then took his left-hand out, then he swore again; I said, I will see what you have got; then he shifted it into his left-hand by putting that behind him, and gave me a blow on my temple with his right; I said, for all that I will see what you have got; he went to give me another blow; I stooped down to save the blow, and catched hold of the string of the apron, and got it from under his coat; it went to the ground immediately.</p>

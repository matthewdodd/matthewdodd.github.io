            . I am a Police-serjeant. In consequence of information I went to the prisoner; she delivered her keys to me, and told me she lodged at No. 1, Twine-court; I went with the prosecutor there; I opened a box with a key the prisoner gave me; some articles there were claimed by the prosecutor - I brought them away; I told the prisoner what I had found; she said at first there was nothing belonging to her master, and then she said they were what her mistress gave her - here are four pairs of stockings, a petticoat, one pair of gloves, some wristbands, and some ribbon.</p>
               <p>MRS. RIDDLE. These came from the wash while I was in the country, and I believe she took them only till they were owned - they are my property, and I never gave them to her; there is no mark on them - this petticoat I can swear to: it was sent to wash while I was in the country - I had returned four months when she was apprehended - here is a pair of gloves, but no mark on them; I have never found my necklace.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mistress may forget, but she gave me that old petticoat before she went into the country.</p>
               <p>MRS. RIDDLE. I do not remember it, but I could not swear I did not - she was not in the country with me.</p>

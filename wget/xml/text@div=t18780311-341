                  </hi>. I live at 105, Regency Street, Westminster—on Thursday, 24th January, about 6.30, I was walking with my father, Michael Duggan, at the top of Lupus Street, about 12 or 13 yards from the Stanley Arms—my father was sober and able to walk—he was not deaf—he was 52 years of age—we had crossed three parts of the road,</p>

               <p>when I saw a cab come from Effingham Street—it was coming fast, I could not tell the rate—the horse seemed to go at a very furious rate—as soon as I saw it I halloed out to my father—before I had time to get out of the road the horse kicked me in the leg and I fell backward in the road, and the wheel went over my stomach—after the cab went over me I turned and saw my father 3 or 4 yards away from me—I halloed "Murder"—some people came and lifted me up and put me on a doorstep—there was another cab behind the one that ran over me—I spoke to that cabman; he did not drive after the other, he went in the other direction—I did not hear any one call out before I was knocked down—the horse was about a yard from me when I first saw it; the driver could see us perfectly well, there was a very good light from the public-house—we were taken to the hospital—I left the hospital that evening, I left my father there, he was insensible; he died on the 29th, Tuesday—I did not see the driver's face, only his back—the prisoner appears to be about the size of the man.</p>

I am 12 years of age, and live at 19, Effingham Street with my father and mother—on Thursday night, 24th January, I was playing about with some other boys at the corner of Effingham Street by the Stanley public-house—little Asbury was one of us—I saw Duggan and his father after they had been run over at the corner of Effingham Street and Lupus Street—I saw two Hansom cabs by the Stanley; one of them went towards 21, Effingham Street; it stopped there and the cabman got down; he got up on the cab again and drove towards the Stanley, and after the men were run over the cab went straight up Sussex Street—the prisoner was the driver—I knew him before, I have seen him a great many times, I have known him by sight about two years—he was driving very fast—I heard the cry out "Oh," and I directly ran over the road and saw one in the road and one on the doorstep, and the cab was just going</p>

I gave this evidence on 6th February, a fortnight after the accident—Lupus Street turns to the right—Sussex Street is straight on—I am quite sure that the cab that ran over the men went up Sussex Street, I am quite sure he did not drive down Lupus Street—I was asked by Inspector Knight, and Buckstone the detective, whether it was not young Jarvis who ran over the man, and I said "Yes;" that was the first I said about it—I had said something about it to Shellock and Asbury.</p>

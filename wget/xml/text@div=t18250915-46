I was going to my brother's, and saw this man following me - there were some more boys on before me, and I could not pass; they made a bit of a push, and I was about to pass, when the prosecutor turned round, and said I had robbed him; I said, "Me, Sir - no it was not me," and some gentleman there said it was not me, but some boys on the other side; he said he would hit the gentleman if he did not hold his tongue; he took hold of me, and tore my jacket. I was then taken back a few yards, and the handkerchief was on the ground.</p>

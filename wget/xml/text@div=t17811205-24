The shop parts off with sliding-shutters. She came round with a candle to see if any body was there, and opened the compting-house door to see if any body was there; he did not see her go in there but heard the door open; she went to the street door and opened it, and the other prisoner at the bar came in, he saw them through the crevice of the sliding shutters pass along, they went through the yard backwards, came to the back stairs and rubbed their shoes, this was near ten, they staid till near twelve; they came down stairs then, and I heard them pulling down some paper bags that were hanging over a butt of currants that were in the shop; he heard them begin to fill the currants into the bags, and there was a sheet of paper in the way, and what fell over rapped upon the sheet of paper, which he heard very plain. That something of a sudden made a great noise, and they went to the street door which they locked and bolted, what disturbed them he did not know; they came back and began at the currants in the same manner as before, and the same noise came against the shutters again, and he immediately then went to open the door to go out, he was frightened; that he (the prosecutor) immediately run and opened the sliding shutter door and took him within two doors of his own house, and brought him back; that his maid asked him to come in the afternoon again, as he was going out, I did not hear him make any answer; he rather wrestled with him a little, but some gentlemen coming by he desired their assistance, one of them went with him and the man into the shop, upon examining the prisoner, who had two or three coats on, every one of the pockets were filled with something or other of the provisions of the house.

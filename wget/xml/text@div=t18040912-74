               <p>Q. Where is the Repulse? - A. Off Rochelle.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is she commanded by? - A. By the Hon. Capt. Leadbetter.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner go on board the Repulse? - A. The latter end of November, or the beginning of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he from that time to the 15th of March? - A. At the Nore; and from there we went to Yarmouth, and from there we went to the North Seas; we came off the Texel on the 5th of December, and never left the Texel for seven weeks; and the man was never out of the ship from the day he came into the ship till the 16th of March; I informed Mr. Pearson of this circumstance; he desired me to come down immediately; I know he was in the ship on the 16th; I was discharged then, as disabled; on the 18th, the purser called on me, and paid me the extra-money that was due to me; I asked him about Johnson, as Johnson took the place; I can swear he was on board the ship the time I said; he was on board the Zealand, and from thence he was turned over to the Repulse, at the Nore; I was at the Nore at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is admiral of that fleet? - A. Admiral Thornborough.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this man was on board a ship, from September, October, or November, till you left it in the middle of March, 1804; and in that time the man was never out of the ship? - A. He acted as a midshipman's steward, and by my being discharged, they recommended him to be lieutenant's steward, which was the 11th of March. (The witness produced a paper, shewing his discharge from the Repulse; and a paper, the hand-writing of Capt. Lake.)</p>

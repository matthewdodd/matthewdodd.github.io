On the 17th of January I lost a tea chest full of tea, in which was a 36 s. piece, three crown pieces, a silver groat, and a silver three-pence; but was not at home when it was taken away. I had lost some trifling things before, upon which I ordered the prisoner to be turned away. I having known her some time, and had a good character with her, my wife let her be at our house, to lie with my daughter. She having been at our house the day the things were lost, for some linen of her own, and I having a suspicion of her, took her up. She confessed the fact, and carried me to the place where she had broke the tea-chest open, and threw it into a horse-pond, and the people of the place had taken it out, returned it to me, and a guinea that stuck in a crack, which the prisoner did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own the taking the money out of the chest?</p>
               <p>Day. She did. (The tea-chest produced in court broken, and deposed to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Paradise—row, Bermondsey. I saw Mr. Taylor on the Friday night, and arranged with him, and on the Saturday morning I marked two shillings—I sent them by Garth to Mr. Taylor's to purchase a pint of gin—he brought me back a pint of gin, and a sixpence, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in half—pence—I went in a few minutes to Mr. Taylor's—I got there about twenty minutes before seven o'clock in the morning—Mr. Taylor was not up—I sent his servant for him—the prisoner was behind the bar—Mr. Taylor came down—he examined the till in my presence—I did not see what was in it—I then examined the till—I found two or three sixpences in it, and one shilling, but it was not one that I had marked—I asked the prisoner if that was all he had taken that morning—he said all he had taken was in the till—I asked if he had sold a pint of gin to Mr. Garth—he said, "I have served him with a pint of gin"—I asked if the two shillings he had taken for it were in the till—he said he put them there, and if they were gone Mr. Taylor must nave taken them out—I told him Mr. Taylor had not taken them out—he had produced to me what money he said he had, not the two shillings</p>

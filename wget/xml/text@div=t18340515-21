             (police-constable R 141). I was on duty about eleven o'clock - I saw the prisoner and another following the prosecutor - I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from his pocket, and put it into his own trousers pocket - I took him into custody, and took it from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking from Bishopsgate Church, where I had been to seek for a place. I saw a lad attempt several gentlemen's pockets, and at last he took this handkerchief and threw it on the ground; the gentleman took hold of him first, and then came and took hold of me; I was full twenty yards from him; I took up the handkerchief to give to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>JAMES WILD. I saw the prisoner pick the pocket - the other was with him.</p>

            . Amey Reader was my daughter-in-law - She had cohabited with the prisoner as her husband for two years. On the <rs id="t18180909-35-cd194" type="crimeDate">29th of June</rs>

They had words and quarrelled-the prisoner wanted to get away, she would not let him, she collared him and threw him down, tore his shirt and waistcoat. He then struck her somewhere about the belly, she fell down-how she got down I cannot say. I saw him strike her once after she was down; there was a heap of bricks where she fell, she might have fallen on them and hurt herself. She was lifted up, she was in liquor, and carried to the sand-house and put to bed. Next morning we sent for the doctor, he bled her.</p>
               <p>ANNE FISHER. I am the deceased's mother - She went into the field and told the prisoner to bring some money, at half-past twelve o'clock he brought her 1s.; about four o'clock they left off work, he had a can of beer - She asked him for half a pint about seven o'clock, he said she should have no more; they had drank a great deal before and were both drunk, but she was not so far gone as he - He said if she drank any more he would knock her down; they got quarreling, she told him to be off with his barrow - He was going away, and said he would give her a good hiding as soon as he got hold of her; she then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090015"></xptr>got hold of him by the jacket and shirt - I told her to let go, which she did, he took his barrow. I got between them - I went away, returned in five minutes, and found her on the ground, just by the bricks; he was by her, and striking as hard as he could - I saw him strike her four or five very violent blows about her body. I told him to leave off - He said he would not; we parted them, he left. I took her to the sand-house - She died on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not she strike him first - A. I told her to get out of his way, she would not.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you if she did not strike him before he struck her - A. I never saw it before she was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Coroner you was quite sure before he struck her she struck him, and tore his waistcoat and shirt - A. I said she got hold of him and tore his waistcoat and shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. See that you do not make any mistake - You say that you did not say before the Coroner that before he struck her she struck him - A. Yes, I did not see her strike him.</p>
               <p>Mr. JAMES PARKINSON. I am a surgeon. On the 2d of July, I examined the body of the deceased, and could observe no external mark of violence; but on opening the body, I discovered that the bladder had been ruptured and the urine effused through the bowels, which were in a high degree of inflammation, in consequence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say what caused the rupture - A. I am not. I believe it was from external violence, either a blow or fall might have produced it. I think it right to say, that when the bladder is so highly extended a much less degree of violence might have occasioned the injury than could be supposed. Her death was in consequence of the rupture of the bladder; her falling on an unequal surface, with her bladder in that state, is very likely of itself to have occasioned the mischief. She was in an unhealthy state at the time. She had applied to me the morning before the injury was received for a complaint in her bowels, which would make the rupture more probable.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FISHER. I was there all the while. I did not see him strike her more than once.</p>
               <p>JAMES CROCKWELL. I was before the Magistrate when

             was examined - I saw her mark her deposition; it was read over to her, (looking at it) this is it(reads). They were both addicted to drinking; I am quite sure before he struck her she struck him, and tore his waistcoat and shirt.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Clarendon Place, and am a tin plate worker—I am the prisoner's brother—I was present, about ten months ago, when a conversation took place between my two brothers—I was at my brother Thomas's—I had been there about ten minutes when Mark came in—that was when he first commemced to sell the purses for Mark—I asked Mark where he got the purses from, and he said he had ordered them of the makers, that he had got Thomas to travel for him, and paid him 10 per cent, commission, and he could get a small profit for himself—I have seen Thomas pay him money from time to time—on two or three occasions they have settled the account, and deducted 10 per cent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there any bills or invoices on either of these occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My brother Thomas generally booked it on a slate that he had on the mantelshelf—if he sold two or three dozen he would book them and give Mark the money—I did not see any invoices or bills brought with the purses—Mark is about eighteen—we thought he had more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at Mr. Rosenfeld's—he said he had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he got 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the makers when they brought the goods—my brother Thomas gave him the money to get the purses for him—I was frequently at my brother's house, and in his company—I knew that he was buying these purses from my younger brother, but we were all deceived as far as anything being wrong—previous to this my brother Thomas had saved some money, which he had in the bank—when he first had business with Mark he had a boot and shoe shop in the City Road—he continued to keep the shop open; I can't say how long—he only cleared his rent by it—he found it would not pay and gave it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Gerrard, and keep a fancy repository, at 31, Camberwell Road—I am the prisoner's sister—Mark lived in my house—I have heard him say that he was allowed by his employers to have purses of the makers, and I believed it was the truth—the makers themselves have been to my shop with goods.</p>

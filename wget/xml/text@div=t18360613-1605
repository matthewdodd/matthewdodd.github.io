                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, living at Woolwich, On the 16th of May, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop and asked me for some striped shirting—while I turned my back to reach some down, I observed her take a piece of linen from the counter, and conceal it in her apron—she had a shawl on—she objected to the pattern of the shirting—I then reached her down another piece—she said that would do, and ordered me to cut her off half-a-yard, which came to 5 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I wrapped the half-yard up in paper—she gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave her change and she left—I followed and took hold of her, and said she had stolen a piece of linen—she had not got five steps from the door—she said she had not—I took hold of her, shoved her inside the door, and saw her drop it—I took it up, and at the same time a print dress dropped from her apron, but that did not belong to me.</p>

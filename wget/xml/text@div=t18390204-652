                  </hi>. I am an optician, and live in Broad-street, St. Giles's. On 29th of November, the prisoner came to my shop, handed a gold watch-case to my son, and asked if it was gold—my son handed it to me—I looked at the inner part which was metal gilt, and said, "I do not think it is," but on turning to the outside, I said, "I think it is, but to remove any doubt, I will try it for you"—the prisoner said he had made a bet of, I think, one shilling—I said, "Who with?"—he said, a jeweller, living at the corner of Stephen-street, Tottenham-court-road—on trying it, I told him it was gold, and asked where he obtained it—he said he found it—I said that the day was wet and stormy, and it ap<lb></lb>peared perfectly free from wet or dirt—he said, it was covered with paper—I said, "What do you purpose doing with it?"—he said, "To</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040103"></xptr>
               <p>sell it"—I said, "I must prevent that, if what you have said is true, you have no right to sell it"—he said, "You intend to detain it"—I said, "Yes; believing what you have said to be true, I will take your name and address, and advertise it, and if there is any reward, I will pay it to you—but" I said, "I don't know why I should give myself any trouble about it, walk over to the station-house with me, and I will hand it over to them?"—I turned to get my bat, and on turning round he was gone—I have no doubt whatever of his being the man—I gave information within two minutes, and described him at two station-houses—the watch? case remained in my possession till the Sunday morning—I at last gate it to Inspector Rawley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you always been positive of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I believed him to be the man in the first instance—I said before the Magistrate that it was a man very much, like the prisoner—my me<lb></lb>mory is refreshed since then, for before I signed my deposition the prisoner forced his conversation on me, and that forcibly recalled my recollection of him, and I said to the clerk, "I have no hesitation in saying it was the prisoner"—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—I do not deal in watches—I have nothing of the kind in my window—there were three persons present when he came—Mr. Paulson was there—the prisoner was close to me during the whole conversation—I decidedly swear to him—I hive no hesitation in saying he is the man—I have said to-day that I be<lb></lb>lieved him to be the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil-man, and live in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. I was in Mr. Chamberlain's shop when a person came in with a watch-case—I believe the prisoner to be the man—I have not a doubt of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the E division of po<lb></lb>lice.

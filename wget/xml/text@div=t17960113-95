            ; all that I know of it is, that the prisoner had that pepper, and that it is Mr. Thwaites's property; I had it in my hand before it went out in the bag that it is in now; the constable has got it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PERRY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; last Friday I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I asked him where he got it from; he said, he bought it at a porter's pitching-block, near London-bridge; that he gave sixpence for it. Mr. Rose gave it to me, and charged the prisoner with stealing it out of the cellar; it has been in my custody ever since, (produces it).</p>
               <p>Rose. This is the prosecutor's property; there is a hole at one corner of the bag, and it is tore.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had it that hole before it went out? - A. Yes, it had.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Can you swear to the pepper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means? - A. I compared it with what we have at home, and I am equailly certain to the pepper as to the bag; I had it in my hand in the bag for upwards of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Perry.) Q. Did you write upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Wilson put that mark upon it after he took it from me.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Rose.) Q. How long did you see that bag before it was taken from the prisoner? - A. It might be half an hour before, in the cellar; there was a hole at the bottom of the bag, and I was afraid the pepper would be lost; and I turned the bag underneath, that it might not be lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that pepper; can you identify it? - A. I cannot; it was a confirmation of it, that when it was compared with my other pepper, it was like it; there are different qualities of pepper and different colours.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say any thing to the bag? - A. No; I know nothing of it; the prisoner had been with me about three weeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, the cellar that this Mr. Rose says he saw that bag in, lies at the back of the shop, and there is ten or eleven men go backwards and forwards into it; Mr. Rose ordered me to take a hamper to the George Inn, in the Borough; I pitched it at the bulk at London-bridge, and a man came up with that bag of pepper, and asked me if I would buy it; I told him I did not want pepper; he asked me 3s. 9d.; I told him I had not so much; I would give him 3s. 6d. which I did, and I lapped it up in my apron; then I went on the George Inn with my hamper, and as I was coming away, I met Wilson; he said I had got sugar in my apron; No, Sir, says I, I have not, it is pepper; he said he met our Frank upon the Hill, and he was sure he gave it me; we went on, and, upon Fish-street Hill, he said, I must give him the pepper; I said, if he would give me what I gave for it, he should have it; he said, I was his prisoner, and I gave him the pepper out of my apron; when I came back, Mr. Thwaites said, I will have every one of you to the Compter. I am sure that neither Mr. Rose, nor any body in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130154"></xptr>shop, can say they ever saw me touch a halfpennyworth in the shop, or in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rose.) Did you see him go down into the cellar? - A. I did myself.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time? - A. A little past twelve.</p>

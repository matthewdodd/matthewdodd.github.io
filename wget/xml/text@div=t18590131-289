                  </hi>. I live at the Bank beer-shop, in High-street, Wool-wich—on Monday evening, 3d January, about 8 o'clock, the prisoner Harris came in the tap-room and called for a pint of porter, and gave me a shilling—as I was going to the bar I saw a marine coming along the passage—he told me to bring him a pot of beer—I went to my mistress and gave her the shilling that Harris had given me, she told me to go and take it back—I took it back to Harris, and he showed it to the marine, Nicholson, who was there—he said he thought it was good—Harris gave me another shilling which was good.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Standard public-house—on Monday evening, 3d January, Nicholson, the marine, came into my house about half-past nine o'clock—he asked for half a pint of beer—I supplied him with it, and he put down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had it in my hand to examine it, and Harris came in in a bustle, and asked for two halfpence for a penny piece—he was attended by a woman with a basket, and he appeared to want to give the woman a halfpenny—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901310081"></xptr>
               <p>took up the penny—I still had the shilling in my hand—I tried it in the detector and bent it—it was bad—I told Nicholson so—he wished to have it back, but I refused to give it him—I did not give Harris the two half-pence for the penny, but I kept the penny piece in my hand—Harris advised Nicholson to have the shilling back again—I refused to give it, and sent for a policeman—the result was that Harris disappeared as fast as he could, and Nicholson also went out before the policeman came—I went out to see which way they went, and I saw them running in the same direction; at least I heard footsteps in the distance of more than one person running—they escaped at that time—I marked the shilling, and gave it to the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harris. Q.</hi> On the morning after I was taken, you were sent for to the station, and did you not say that you did not know either of us? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I said you were the persons; my pot boy said that he did not recognise either of you—on the first examination I was in the Court—I did not come forward—the more I look at you, the more I am satisfied that you are the men.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Nicholson. Q.</hi> You came to the police-station to recognise me—you looked at me, and were in doubt that I was the person; and you said you would go home and see your pot boy. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I don't remember saying that in your presence—I said it to the policeman—that was not to assist my own recollection at all, but to make it more sure—the pot boy did say, "That is not the marine; I should know the marine if I saw him twelve months hence"—I appeared the first day, but I did not give my evidence.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Green, who keeps the Mitre tavern—on the 3d January, Nicholson, the marine, came in between nine and ten o'clock—he asked for half-a-pint of porter—he appeared very tipsy—I did not want to serve him—he said, "I will relieve you of my presence if you will serve me"—I served him to get rid of him—he put down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took it up, and told him it was bad—he said he could pay me for what he had, and he gave me a penny—he asked for the shilling back again, and I said, "Come another time, and I will give it you"—I put the shilling on the marble slab at the back of the counter, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint—this shil<lb></lb>ling taken from Harris, and the one found in front of him, are both bad—one is of the date of 1838, and the other 1858—these shillings received from Payne and Gordon are bad—one is of the date 1838, and the other is 1858—and they are from the same moulds as the other two.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901310083"></xptr>
               <p>—he could not identify me then, but in the morning he said he could know me—I know nothing of the other prisoner—I went to the Bank public-house and sat there, perhaps, for hours—there were two young women in the tap room—Harris introduced himself to me as a mechanic working in the Arsenal—he asked me about some young men in our barracks, and I said I knew them—he said to those young women that be would give them some best beer—I went to the door and stood outside—I said I could not go with him, I could not leave the company I was with—he went away, and I saw no more of him till the next morning—I have no doubt it was a marine who passed this bad money, and the case is very suspicious, but I am as innocent as a child—if this man gets his living in this way, I know nothing of it—the inhabitants of Woolwich cannot Bay that a marine ever offered a bad shilling—I had been a long time in the hospital, and only been four days out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Harris's Defence.</hi>—This prisoner and I were seen in conversation, but does that sufficiently establish a connexion?—how often does it occur that two persons meet, one intending to commit a felony, and the other innocent—one may go with another into a public-house, and they may sit down together, but that is not sufficient to establish a connexion—when I was taken, I was putting two shillings in my pocket, and one fell down; now, if I had two shillings, and knew they were bad, why did not I drop both the shillings in the paper?—I must have known it if I had dropped it intentionally—on the morning after I was apprehended, Mr. Payne came to identify me—there was a doubt on his mind, and at the expiration of seven days he said that I was the man—now, if a man cannot recognise another immediately after an occurring circumstance, how can he conscien<lb></lb>tiously do it at the expiration of seven days?—why did he not do it the first morning I—his answer would be, if he told the truth, because the policeman had not had time to give him instructions—I dropped a shilling on the flags, and the policeman by the side of me. Now, gentlemen, how I became in possession of this money I will mention to you. On the day in question I sold my coat to a man in Beresford-street, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on the Thursday I pawned my waistcoat for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the policeman has got my ticket—there is a ticket of mine with 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it.</p>

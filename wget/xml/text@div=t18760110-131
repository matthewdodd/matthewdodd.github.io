                  <hi rend="italic">for the prosecution</hi>, Mr. Besley, on <hi rend="italic">behalf of the prisoner, contended that the indictment could not be sustained. A post-office order was sent from the country to the prisoner in London, to be received by him and applied to a certain purpose; he received the money and did not apply it as desired. He was charged as a bailee of the post-office order; the order was payable to himself; no one but himself had a right to be paid by the post-office order, and the particular coins in which it was paid must have been perfectly indifferent to the sender. The case of "</hi> Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hassall," 8, Cox, Criminal Cases, 491, <hi rend="italic">was conclusive upon this point. There was no bailment here; it was physically impossible that the prisoner could pay the specific coins handed to the postmaster by the sended of the order, he must pay it with other monies received by him upon the order in London. The order was never to be returned to the sender, it was simply an order from the postmaster in the</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">country to the postmaster in London, and when that order was obeyed by pay<lb></lb>ment to the payee, all was done that the bailment required. It was not a negotiable instrument, and no action would lie against the postmaster for refusal to pay any other than the payee.</hi> Mr. Cole <hi rend="italic">relied upon the case of "Reg. v.</hi> Aden," 12, Cox, Criminal Cases, 512, <hi rend="italic">which he contended was precisely on all fours with the present case. That case shewed that there was no necessity for the specific coins being received, if a man had money holding for another, it did not matter what the coins were, he would be liable under the section upon which this indictment was framed, it was a matter for the Jury whether at the time the prisoner cashed the order he intended to appropriate the money, and if so he would be guilty of larceny.</hi> The Common* Serjeant: "<hi rend="italic">This indictment consists of two counts, both counts charge the prisoner as a bailee; the first count charges him with stealing the post-office order. Now that was not a bailment to the prisoner, it was sent to him, and he was to cash it. The second count charges him as a bailee with stealing the money. The money never was the money of the sender, the money paid in at the post-office in the country was one thing, the money received in London was another; therefore on both counts the case fails in point of law, and the prisoner must be acquitted."</hi>

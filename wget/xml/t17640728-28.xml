            . I let the prisoner a ready furnished room, at 2 s. a week; the things mentioned were part of the furniture: I missed all these goods, some of them twelve months ago; and she acknowledged to me, she had pawn'd them: the last time she owned it, was on Monday night. I desired she would go with me to fetch them out; I would have paid, with my own money, for them, and not prosecuted her; but she would not: I fetched a constable, and desired him to threaten her if she would not: she would not; then I was exasperated, and went and got a warrant against her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give her authority to pawn your goods?</p>
               <p>Miller. No; when we were very near New Prison, there she discovered every article; and what they were pawned for, and where: the constable has wrote the particulars on the back of the warrant.</p>

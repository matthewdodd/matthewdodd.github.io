               <p>WALTER JENKINS sworn. - I am a watchman; between two and three o'clock last Saturday was a fortnight, the 16th, in the morning, the prisoner passed my box; I asked he what she had got there, she said, washing-tubs; she said, she had brought them from Mookwell-street, and was going to take them to one Mrs. Hart, a dealer, in Spitalfields-market; I told her to go along, and she turned down Horshoe-alley, and I went after her; I told her, that was not her way to Spitalfields-market, and then I suspected her, and took her to the watch-house. (Produces the tub.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Walford. I had this tub made for me, and the cooper put me on a hoop that came only halfway down, I wanted an iron hoop, but he refused to put one on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mrs. Hart gave them to me, she was very much intoxicated, and I told her, I would take them home for her the next morning; I know nothing of where they came from, any more than the child unborn.</p>

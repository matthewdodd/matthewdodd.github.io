                  </hi>. I am a pensioned first-class engineer under the old Engineers' Act, and live at 4, Garden Row, Deptford—I went to market with my wife on Saturday evening, the 10th Novem<lb></lb>ber, between 8 and 9 o'clock—we went into one or two public-houses, one of them being the Fountain, where I made some complaint of the beer—I saw the prisoner there—there was some hustling at the bar, and my wife said to the prisoner "Mind where you are pushing to, young man," and he made use of a very foul name and said he would smash her on the b—nose—I took my wife by the shoulders, seeing where we were, and pushed her out—we went on to the Bank, where the prisoner came up to us—I told him to go away as he was a blackguard, and we went across to the Castle—the prisoner followed us in—we had a pint of ale, and the prisoner ordered a glass of the same—he said he had come to apologise for insulting my wife—I said he had done so before at the Bank—he asked me if I would give him a glass of ale—there were two glasses of ale on the counter and I gave him one and told him to be off—he came back and asked me if I would give him something to take a bit of bread home to his wife and children—I said it was a poor place to be look<lb></lb>ing for bread where he came out of, and I gave him a two-shilling piece—as I drank my beer he said "You have got some beer or black on your mous<lb></lb>tache," and he rubbed me down with a handkerchief which he took from his pocket—my wife and I left the Castle—the prisoner followed us into King Street—he drew the handkerchief out again, and my wife said "He means no good; he means thieving," and she struck him off—he drew the handkerchief like that (<hi rend="italic">across his face</hi>)—he went across the road—I went to my own doorstep and the prisoner was there as soon as I got there—on the way I felt a curious sensation coming over me, and my wife had to take my arm through the street—I felt a pain up my nostrils—I have been in India, and on two occasions have been under the influence of chloroform, and this was a similar sensation, a stupefaction—the prisoner said in a most threatening manner "Give me a couple of shil<lb></lb>lings"—my wife said "No, I will lock you up"—he said "You b—wh—," and he struck my wife and splintered two of her teeth—a scuffle ensued—he tore my coat open and my wife said "He is robbing you," and I said "My God, I am robbed," and I ran after him and caught him some 30 yards off—he caught hold of me and bent me over the railings and got fair away—I caught him again by the Fox public-house—another struggle ensued, and I offered 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to any one to fetch a policeman, but he got away—my wife had given me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and some silver, on that night, which I had put in my waistcoat pocket—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket before, and I missed over 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went home and was very unwell, and remained so until the 20th November—I went out</p>

               <p>with my wife a couple of times, but was just like a man rising from a fever—I went to the police-station and gave information, and on the 20th November I saw the prisoner in the Broadway, Deptford—he said "Good evening, sir"—I said "Good evening, you vagabond," and caught him by the sleeve of the coat—he said "I know all about your case, sir, I will take you to the party who robbed you"—I didn't feel prepared for a struggle with him—he wreuched himself away, and I next saw him in the custody of the police.</p>

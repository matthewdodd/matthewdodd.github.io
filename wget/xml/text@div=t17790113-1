               <p>Where was that screaming? - In the house. There are five rooms on the first floor;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130003"></xptr> I was in one of them. I ran out, and the first thing I saw was the prisoner coming down stairs. I was satisfied he was a thief. I said, you scoundrel, what do you do here? The maid called out and said he was a thief. He said he wanted Mr. Cook, who lived up three-pair-of-stairs; the maid persisted in his being a thief. I delivered him into the custody of a servant, and went to see if there were any more of them. I went up into the garret, and found a pane of glass taken out of a transom window. I concluded he came over the leads of some other houses and came in there.</p>
               <p>Do you apprehend he could have come in at that window? - He could have come in, and did come in; he said he was a good man and did not mean to steal.</p>
               <p>Who are the people that have any business in that room? - The servant maid has lodged in that room seven months. When he said he wanted a Mr. Cook, he spoke very good English; he would not speak English afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked for a French cook, not for a Mr. Cook; the gentleman ill-used me and took me by the collar.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did take him by the collar. When I wanted him to speak English, he laughed in my face. I said, you scoundrel, if you laugh at me I will knock your teeth out.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Harriott; I sleep in this room; it is three-pair-of-stairs backwards. There is a communication between the window of that room and the leads of the houses. I took notice of the window about eleven in the morning; there was no glass out then.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was whole? - Yes; when I made my bed about eleven the window was fast. About half after six in the evening I went up, took the key out of my pocket, and unlocked the door; then the prisoner came out. I always keep the door locked. I am sure I locked the door that morning.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the person that came out of the room could not get in through the door? - Yes. When I saw him I screamed out, ran down one-pair-of-stairs before him, and called for several persons who were in the house to come up; he followed me down.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - First I called to my master, then to my fellow servants, and said there were thieves in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you see your master on the stairs as you came down? - I do not know that I did, I was so frightened. I went into my mistress's room and sat down; the prisoner was taken immediately. I am certain the prisoner is the person that came out of the room. I went up afterwards into the room, and saw a pane of glass was taken out of the window and laid in the gutter. The window was fastened again on the inside.</p>
               <p>Was that pane of glass so near to the fastening of the window that a man could put his hand in and open it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could he get in at the window? - Yes, any body might; I could get in myself. It is a casement fastened with an iron handle in the inside. I have lain in the room about seven months; nobody lay there but myself.</p>
               <p>Was it dark then? - Yes; we had a candle; it was about half after six o'clock to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming up stairs, and was at the door just as she was, to ask for the man.</p>
               <p>Phips. When I opened the door he came out of the room.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Harriott. What do you mean by a transom? - It is an iron transom casement; he took a pane of glass out of the casement.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to enquire for that person; he was to have taken a post chaise to Bath, and knowing a milliner at Bath I wanted this cook to call upon her to get acquainted with her; this cook gave me his direction to this house. I went up into the three-pair-of-stairs after this girl; the girl upon seeing me immediately screamed out; the family being alarmed, about thirty people came up and took hold of me, and would not hear what I had to say. I am quite ignorant of the customs and ways of this country, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130004"></xptr> thinking myself innocent I have called no witnesses.</p>

Full two months she told me that the lower part of the house was over run with rats, and for a fortnight back; she repeatedly requested me to send for poison for them. I sent for it at last.</p>
               <p>Q. What poison was it - A. I wrote for poison, not knowing what I was to have.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you write - A. to Mr. Midgley, in the strand, chemist and druggist. I received the poison; the prisoner took a note and brought back the poison.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the poison - A. I ordered her to put it into the desk, which she did; a few minutes afterwards I put it into the back locker, the division of a large writing-desk. I did not lock it. Soon after that; I told her to settle the parlour and bring up tea. She brought up tea in two teapots. I then gave her some halfpence to fetch some mortar to put over the rat-holes after the poison was put into the holes. I then cut bread and butter for the children, and poured out the tea; my own cup of tea stood till it was quite cold. I then poured out some for the children. It appeared as usual at the time it was at my mouth. I took the cup of tea at one draught, it being cold. As soon as I took the cup away, I found a great heat in my throat, and said, oh! there is pepper in this tea. I sat still for some time, then I poured out a cup of tea; I was going to take it to allay the heat of the throat, I recollected myself, that it was wrong to take that tea, as it might be all alike. The children were taking their tea. I sat still. It run all down me, searching me to the lower part of my stomach. It soon searched round me, and met me at my back bone. I then wished the girl would come in; she was gone for the mortar, she had not returned. I thought I never felt any pepper search me as that did. It then shot into my thighs. I then began to think that the girl sure had not played tricks with the packet of poison. I did not think she had. I looked at the packet; I satisfied myself that it had never been opened. I then sat down: I had not sat many minutes, before one of the children, the last<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190024"></xptr>tea that went down his throat, it flew all over the table.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was that child - A. Five years old. I was angry with the child, and hit him two pats over the head, I thought he had eaten more than his stomach could bear, and I turned him away from the table. I walked across the parlour to get a cloth to wipe up the tea that the child had cast up. I then was seized with a trembling. At the time I was wiping it up, the child brought up more. I was then frightened, and thought it was not an overfilled stomach, and wished the girl would return. The other child was then taken sick in the same way. The girl returned in a few minutes after the second child was taken ill. I then said, Eliza, what have you put into the teapot, my tea tasted as if there was pepper in it, but I never tasted any pepper that searched me like that. She said, nothing, madam, I have not put any thing in. I said, Eliza, tell me the truth, if you have been playing any tricks with the pocket, tell me, I can go to the chemist's in Southampton-street, he will give me something it shall be of no consequence whatever. She said, no, indeed, madam. She still denied it, and said, if you will please to look at the parcel, you will see it is as the gentleman gave me, tied up, I dare say in half a dozen knots. I then said, there is no time to be lost, give me my hat and pelleise, I must go to the gentleman and ask him how the packet was tied where it was bought. I ran as fast as my trembling limbs would let me go. In the middle of Southampton-street I was taken sick, and at the bottom, by the straw shop, I was taken sick again; between that corner, and forty-nine, in the Strand I was taken sick again. I thought I should never be able to get to the shop, I should die, and the children would die.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did examine the pot, did you - A. No, not at any time. I went to Mr. Midgley, Mr. Midgley mixed up medicine for the two children, and went to my house and gave it to one of the children. I went to Mr. Moore, of Great Russel-street; I went to his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you recover - A. A fortnight, all but a day, I recovered myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the girl - A. She calls herself fourteen last February; she has lived in my service a twelve month last May.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to correct her for misbehaviour - A. She had behaved exceeding well; I never corrected her but for dirt and filth only, I repeatedly corrected her for that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before that had you corrected her for dirt and filth - A. I was making her a new gown the day she gave me this. About three days before, I had been angry with her for wearing dirty linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever perceive any rats in the house yourself - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who put the tea into the teapots - A. I put the tea into the two teapots myself. I gave them to her, she took the two teapots down stairs and put the waser in, and brought it up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you had poison in the house before that - A. Yes, in January before, there were none of it left, not the least in the world; and there was no person in the family that could have gone to the desk but the girl and me.</p>
               <p>MR. MIDGLEY. I am a chemist and druggist in the Strand. On the 16th of August, I received a note from Mrs. Parker, the prisoner brought it; she says, I will be obliged to you to favour me with some more poison to kill the rats, as I am overrun. Upon which I put up a parcel of two ounces of arsenic. The prisoner requested to have more than the usual quantity, as they were dreadfully overrun. I put up two ounces in one parcel, that was all that she had; it was marked on the outside, poison, on the outer paper, and the inside paper, arsenic, poison.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the effect of arsenic as to the human body - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what the prosecutrix said, was that the operation of arsenic - A. It operates different, according to the quantity. As it operated as an emetic, which is not the effect of poison, it could not poison; her symptons, that she has described, are the effect of metallic poison; it will have that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Arsenic generally makes the tea black - A. I believe it was not Chinese tea; it was a tea of English herbs.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It was British herb tea, I always buy the herbs ready prepared.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Midgley. Did you look at the parcel afterwards - A. I did; it had been opened, it was lesser in quantity, about a quarter of an ounce, I weighed it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Parker. When this girl told you to look at the parcel, you did not look at the parcel, did you - A. I had looked at it before; I was convinced, in my judgment, that it had not been opened, there was not an extra rumple on the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Midgley. You made up the parcel yourself - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it altered - A. The knot was twisted when it was returned by Mrs. Parker; it was tied in my usual way, a double knot, not twisted. When I arrived at Mrs. Parker's, the child Stanley was very sick. I tasted the tea, it had a strong metallic taste, I boiled some arsenic in the same herbs, which I bought of Mr. Butler, the appearance of the tea is not altered by the infusion of arsenic.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Have you any lodgers - A. Yes; they have a place to themselves, they never go into the kitchen, or into my apartments.</p>

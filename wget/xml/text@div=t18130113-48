               <p>Q. Did you miss an ass in December last - A. Yes, the 18th.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it - A. I had seen it on the Friday. I missed it before seven, out of the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since - A. Yes, on the 4th of January. I saw it at Marlborough-street. I knew it to be my ass; there is a particular mark on it, on the off side, under the saddle, and on the off ear.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he lived about a mile off me. I live in Easter-green, in Tring parish.</p>

            . I am a dealer in animals. I live in Rupert-street, Piccadilly. On the 19th of December, about three in the afternoon, the prisoner brought me some pheasants to sell; they were in hampers. He had an ass with him. I bought twelve pheasants of him, and I paid him for them. On the 31st, I saw him again; he had some pheasants with him. They were in hampers, upon an ass. He said he was come before his time.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen him before - A. On the 19th. He then said, he should see me that day fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where he came from - A. Yes; he said he came from Chesham Bottom. When he said he had come before his time, I told him, it did not make any difference about that; I was quite prepared for him. We went into a two pair of stairs room. I made an excuse to go down stairs to get a wire to fastern the window, to prevent the birds from flying away; instead of getting the wire to fasten the window, I went to get a person to keep the prisoner in conversation, while I sent a person to Marlborough-street office, as I had a suspicion the pheasants were stolen. The officer came and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. To whose custody was the ass delivered - A. To Bennet the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I took the prisoner into custody. He had an ass with him, the ass was delivered into my charge. The ass was claimed by Parsons. The ass that I took from the prisoner, is the ass that Parsons saw and claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Parsons. Do you know Chesham Bottom - A. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from where the prisoner lived - A. About five miles.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the ass at Uxbridge. You have taken me at non plus; my friends will not be here till Monday.</p>

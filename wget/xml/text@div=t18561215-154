                  </hi>. I am a coffee house keeper, of 50, Carnab-street, St. James's. In the beginning of July I had occasion to take proceedings against John Anderson, relative to a warrant of a watch which I had bought of him, and was introduced to the prisoner by a friend of his to carry on the action; he told me that he could do it for me, and it would be much cheaper than taking it to the County Court; and that if I sued him in person, and lost the action, they could come upon me for expenses—I retained him to take these proceedings, and on 4th July paid him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the issue of the writ, and on the 7th, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to have the writ resealed, as it was issued in the wrong Christian name; on the 9th he applied to me for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in addition, saying that he could not always tell what a thing would come to; on the 10th I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as he said he had been down to the Court to stop the defendant from preventing the issue of the writ, which cost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on the 6th Aug. I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for examining the defendant's plea, and he showed me a paper which he called a plea—he read it to me in the presence of Mr. Pigot, a butcher, who is one of the witnesses, and said that it was the defendant's answer to my declaration, but was not a sufficient answer, and he would try and see if he could not get the case put</p>

               <p>down as undefended, because there was not a sufficient answer to the declara<lb></lb>tion—I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as he said that it would cost that to put it down as undefended—I have got no witness to that payment, but I have to all the others—I also paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 9th Sept to fix the trial; he said that he had had it put down on the top of the list as an undefended case, and it would come off on the 25th in the Sheriffs Court, Bed Lion Square—I went down on the Wednesday, and found that there was no such name entered—if I got 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages, the defendant was to have 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I got 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he was to have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never brought an action before, and hope I never shall again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, of No. 47, Carnaby-street. I know the prisoner and Skingsley—I have seen them together at my house, at various times, from last summer—they were there in the beginning of July—I saw several sums paid by Skingsley to the prisoner—16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the issue of a writ, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for re-sealing writ, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in addition for the same purpose, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for stopping the issue of the writ by the defendant, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for examining the defendant's plea; Jarvis had a little bit of paper in his hand, which he told me was the plea, but not at that interview.</p>
               <p>

            . I had a shawl in Mrs. Stevens's front closet, I had the key of it; I saw it on the 22d of September, I left Mr. Stevens's house on the 23d, I speak to it from the appearance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There is no mark on it - A. No; nor any of my work on it. It is an uncommon pattern; the prisoner boarded at the house, my husband does not live with me. Mrs. Stevens keeps a boarding-house for ladies, a single woman lodged there besides us - I do not know that the prisoner was distressed.</p>
               <p>MRS. STEVENS. I know this to be Mrs. Thorn's shawl, I could tell it from a thousand. The prisoner paid me one guinea per week for the first six months; somebody hired it for her, she was afterwards left destitute and quite forlorn - I did what I could for her, I did not know where she went on leaving me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. George Clark and his partner, of Howford-buildings, Eenchurch-street. The prisoner was our warehouseman for about seven months, but had left our employ a week previous to this—after paying the men their wages on Saturday evening, the 7th of November, I put the overplus into my desk, and locked it up—there were six sovereigns, one half-sovereign, two half-crowns, sixteen shilings and sixpence, in a bag in my desk, with sevenpence in copper—I</p>

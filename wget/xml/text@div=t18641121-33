Simpson came round and said to Wilson, "If you had got two b——coats on, I would not be long in pulling them off"—Wilson said, "Would you?"—he said, "Yes, I would," and struck Wilson twice with his fist and knocked him against a lamp post—Wilson went away to get up in the High-street, and asked a policeman to go and take Simpson in charge—the policeman said no, he must summon Simpson—Simpson used very bad language to me, and said that he would serve me the same—he then went after the prisoner and gave him in charge, but did not strike him—he fell against the lamp post when Simpson struck him—I saw no knife—I was near enough to see if one was used—I saw nothing after that, it was between 6 and 7 o'clock.</p>

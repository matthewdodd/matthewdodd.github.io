On the night of Saturday, 28th June, I went to bed at 12 o'clock—I shut the house door myself with a lock—a few minutes before 5 o'clock I was alarmed—I heard some noise as I was in bed—I got up, and saw the back of a man in the passage, just going out of the door—I went into the kitchen, and there is a table there—I found some drawers open, which had been closed when I went to bed—nothing was taken from my house.</p>

I am in the service of the last witness, and live in his house—I sleep in the fourth floor—on Sunday morning, 29th June, about 5 o'clock, I was in bed—I was awoke—I heard some noise at the door, somebody moving it—I got out of bed, went to the chamber door, and saw the prisoner, with his boots in his hand, and no boots on his feet—he went down stairs—I went after him—he ran out of the door into the street—I was not dressed—I called a policeman—he came in two or three minutes afterwards.</p>

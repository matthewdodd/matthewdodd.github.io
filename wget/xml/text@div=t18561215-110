                  </hi>. On 21st Nov. last, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it was contained in this envelope—I received it through the post—to the best of my belief, the letter is in the handwriting of the defendant—Captain Brooke was married to a natural daughter of the late Sir Thomas Mostyn.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has there been more than a sum of 2001. paid to him, or his wife, or child, or any one belonging to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; on one occasion there was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Captain Brooke, independent of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I understand that he went out to the Crimea, or Constantinople—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to fit him out—when I saw him on the subject of the non-payment, or withholding of this legacy, I told him that I should do the utmost in my power—I acted under the advice of my solicitor—I expressed my hopes that the defendant would for-bear to take any further means, I had taken the thing voluntarily on my<lb></lb>self—I do not believe I urged him, at the interview, to release the estates from the charge of the legacy, and to take my personal bond for the money—the estate was released, and a bond given—I never made him a promise that if he would do that, when my son became twenty-one years of age, I would pay him the money, and I could not exact such a thing from my son; all I said was, that I would do everything to the utmost of my power, and what is going on now will evince that feeling—my son became of age in 1851—I do not think I was afterwards sued on this bond; these matters</p>

               <p>are entirely in the hands of my solicitors—I really do not recollect being sued on that bond, and instructing my solicitors to defend the action—I do not know whether I put Captain Brook, on that occasion, to the expense of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs in defending the action—I was told that I had got a verdict, and judgment against me for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I rather think that was just after my son came of age, but am not positive—I promised to do everything in my power, but no more—the Plashen estate is worth rather upwards of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—my son is in possession of other property which I received through Sir Thomas Mostyn's will; he has the Mostyn property, it was settled on him at his marriage—supposing that property to be unincumbered it would be worth about 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I reside at Mostyn-hall, that is Sir Thomas Mostyn's mansion; and in town, I reside in a town house—I know nothing about the defendant's child by this lady, being unable to receive a fitting education of account of the poverty of his father—I cannot tell you how old the child is—the young lady never lived with Sir Thomas Mostyn; I never knew that such a person was in existence until after his death—I can<lb></lb>not state the sum I have raised on Sir Thomas Mostyn's property, or whether it is near 400,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—am I bound to answer what the amount of my debts are?—you must ask Mr. Westmacott—I do not say that I do not know something like the amount of my debts, but I cannot tell you the amount.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Westma<lb></lb>cott and Blake, solicitors. We have acted as solicitors for Lord Mostyn and the Hon. Thomas Mostyn, the son—the solicitors were Messrs. M'Cloud and Co.—we received all the papers, and have them—there are pro<lb></lb>ceedings at this moment in Vice-Chancellor Wood's office for the purpose of arranging this legacy for the benefit of the child—I know that Mr. Brook has made over his life interest in it, and that it is by reason of his insol<lb></lb>vency that the assignee claims an interest, because I have lately had to pay the official assignee under the insolvency, in respect of a portion of the interest, for which proceedings were taken on a bill given to Captain Brook—the whole of that inquiry was only for the benefit of the child—the encumbrances on Lord Mostyn's estates are very large, from which a diffi<lb></lb>culty arises in his meeting this claim—he took those voluntarily upon him—I have received two letters from Mr. Brook, and have written once in answer to the first—I received a reply, in which was an allusion to my letter—I have no doubt that this letter is his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand that you have received letters, you have never acted upon them in conjunction with Captain Brook, you have never seen him or spoken to him upon them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have done something in consequence of the receipt of these letters, but I never saw him till to-day—the Flashen estate has been sold—I really do not know what it fetched—it was before I became concerned, some years—I have mastered the subject of Lord Mostyn's affairs so far as regards the estates of which I have had the management, the Mostyn estate, the Corsysegoddon estate—I know that that estate fetched a very large sum—I do not know that the encumbrances were only 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was first of all an Act of Parliament, obtained under which other estates were substituted for the Corsysegeddon estate—a suit was then instituted under Sir Thomas Mostyn's will, by which all the parti<lb></lb>culars of all the estates were taken, and all the encumbrances ascertained—I do not know that the estate realized 144,0001.; I have not heard it, nor has it been communicated to me—I have heard that it was upwards of 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but have not heard that it was 144,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know from any Master's report, or any document in my possession—I have not heard of the encumbrances on this particular estate—I believe the Corrysegeddon estate to be worth upwards of 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lord Mostyn never stated, in my presence, that these two estates were only worth 150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I say that it is worth more than 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that does not include the encumbrances—there were certainly more than 45,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. encumbrances on that estate; I cannot tell you the amount; I cannot answer you whether there was 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because of the debts; when they were created there was a great deal more on the Corrysegeddon, but do not know whether more than 54,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was existing on the death of Sir Thomas Mostyn—the Corryse<lb></lb>geddon, in common with other estates, is mortgaged to more than its value in conjunction with other estates—I am aware of a personal bond of Lord Mostyn's being substituted; it was a deed of covenant, I think—I was not concerned in that action—Captain Brook, by his trustees under the settle<lb></lb>ment, obtained judgment for 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were Mr. Rochford Clark and Mr. Hyde Clark—I do not know whether the action was defended, or that the costs incurred by Captain Brook have never been paid to this hour—I have not seen the papers relating to this action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what the consideration was for the settlement of the property on Lord Mostyn's son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I throw myself upon his Lordship—I am solicitor for the Hon. Thomas Mostyn, and in all these arrangements I was concerned for the son, and not for Lord Mostyn, on the settlement that was made on his marriage—I have no objection to state anything which his Lordship thinks ought to be divulged of the affairs of the Hon. Thomas Mostyn—I do not know the amount of the debts for which Captain Brook was in the Insolvent Court; I believe it to be considerably more than 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I only know it from his schedule—I have his schedule in my hand, which you are very welcome to—I think Lord Mostyn's debts are about 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., since this bond which he took voluntarily on himself—I was not his solicitor at that time, and had nothing to do with it—a sum of 400,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has certainly not been raised on the whole property which he took, except by the accumulation of mortgages—sums have been raised to pay off the former debts—all the estates were encumbered with numerous mortgages, and my first duty was to get rid of them all, and put them in a single mortgage.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to all this amount of encumbrance. Lord Mostyn has not added to it at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Scarcely any<lb></lb>thing—he,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185612150020"></xptr>
               <p>unfortunately, has taken upon himself 150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the late Sir Thomas Mostyn, very imprudently, believing that the estates were amply sufficient to pay; his personal estate was deficient, and all that kept Lord Mostyn in a state of embarrassment—that has been, in my judgment the cause of his present embarrassment—that was the primary cause of his inability to meet this present debt, and I may say that Mr. Thomas Mostyn is now raising a very large sum on his estates, more than 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for the purpose of liquidating the debts of Lord Mostyn, and among others this present debt of Captain Brook; but Sir Thomas Mostyn is not liable for a single shilling of it, and in the event of his succeeding in doing that, cer<lb></lb>tainly a very large dividend will be paid—6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has been offered, but not secured—that is on the estates.</p>

One would suppose that the deep obligations you are under to me would cause you to act differently, but as you seem perfectly callous in mind, I shall now make proof of your body, and shall kick you, in the most public place in which I can find you; be<lb></lb>sides this, it is my intention to appeal to your brother peers as to whether the conduct of which I can prove you guilty, will not cause your ejection from your seat in their house. You may rest assured that if we both live, I will make you repent your villany; you shall not rob me, as you have done others, with impunity.")</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLE</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">on the same side) urged, that this was not an indictable offence; here was a sealed letter, sent to a certain indivi<lb></lb>dual; and although it might contain such language as would induce that person to commit a breach of the peace, which would be an indictable offence; this case was charged simply as a libel; there was no publication to the world, and therefore nothing to bring it within the law.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">that the indictment should contain an allegation of an intent to commit a breach of the peace, and referred to Rex. v. Wegnia, 2 Starkey, 245, as an authority to that effort. The</hi>

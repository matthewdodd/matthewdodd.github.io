            . I live on Clerkenwell-green. On the 20th of June, I met the prisoner in Chiswell-street, carrying these two bundles, one tied in a red, and one in a blue handkerchief - there were two men walking behind her - I followed her to Whitecross-street - I saw her give the bundles to a man who went under an archway - she went up the street, and returned in about three minutes with another female - each of the women then took a bundle from the man and went up the street, the two men walking behind them - I met a policeman, and told him - he went after them - the two men then kept back, and the policeman spoke to the prisoner and to Hubbard, the other woman - the prisoner said she was going to take them to the top of the street, but she did not know to whom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. About twelve o'clock at noon - it was in open day - I knew the men, who went away, by sight - I believe them to be bad characters - I believe the name of one of them is James Reynolds - he had been charged at Hatton-garden - I do not know that the other had been charged with any thing, and do not know his name - I might have seen him four or five times - I had seen him once in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell, about six weeks ago - I believe he is a reputed thief.</p>

             (police-constable G 125). I went up to the prisoner and another woman, and asked what they had got - the prisoner said, "You can see" - I looked at them, and the prisoner said a man gave them to her to carry to a shop at the top of the street - Hubbard, the other woman, said, "O my God, What have you brought me to? there is something wrong" - the prisoner said, "Never mind, I will see you through it" - in going to the station-house the prisoner said, "Do not take her; she knows nothing about it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you heard the witness state that there were two men who kept back, and went away? A. Yes - I did not tell the prisoner she would have fourteen years - she was examined twice before the magistrate - I did not say I knew both the men, and could take them any day - Colliss said he saw two men follow the prisoner, and one was

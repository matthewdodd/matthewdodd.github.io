                  </hi>. I am a clerk, living in Charlotte-street, Fitsroy-square. On 24th July I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, that a young man of respectability was wanted as clerk, to fill a mercantile situ<lb></lb>ation, at a salary of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, and that good security was required to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—In consequence of that, I sent a letter to the address stated, and got an answer, which I have lost—in consequence of that answer, I went to 3, Pancras-lane—I saw over the door, "Edward Stannard, wine<lb></lb>merchant"—I saw the prisoner—I told him I had called respecting the adver<lb></lb>tisement, and my note was produced—he said he liked the appearance of the writing, and he thought I should suit him—he asked if I was a married man, as the salary was so small—I said, no, I was not, but I was in hopes it</p>

               <p>might lead to something better eventually—I had stated in my letter that I had been engaged on the London and Brighton Railway, and gave him a reference to Mr. Buckland, the secretary—he said he would write to him, and he made an appointment for Thursday, 27th July—I called on that day—he said he had had a very pretty note from Mr. Buckland, and was perfectly satisfied—I had stated that, if it were necessary, I could lodge railway shares to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the shares I had were of the Reading, Reigate, and Guildford Railway—on 27th July the prisoner said he knew nothing of rail<lb></lb>way shares—I told him the security was equal to money—(the shares were what they call guarantee stock)—he made an appointment for me on the following Monday, and I was to take my shares with me, but I forgot them, and I was to bring them on the following Monday—he gave me two or three cards, and said I was to present them to my friends—this is one of them—I went on the following Monday, and entered on my business—I am not certain, but I think I was sent down to the Docks to inquire if certain vessels had arrived—I think one of the ships did come in, but there was nothing in it for him—I did not see any wines in wood or bottles on his premises—I took my shares to him on the 9th of Aug.—I could have got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, or perhaps a pound or two more at the market price—they are negotiable by transfer—I gave them to the prisoner as security for integrity—he had no authority whatever to dispose of them, or to raise money on them—I conti<lb></lb>nued as his clerk for three weeks—I never saw any wines bought or sold—on the 29th Aug. I went to the warehouse as usual, and I found a van at the door, with empty bottles and hampers—I went down into the cellar, and there was not the slightest appearance of any wine having been there—I stopped the van, and went to Mr. Exley's—on my return home I found this letter, by post, in the prisoner's writing—he did not call on me again—I went to Mr. Exley's office, and saw the prisoner there—he had given me an I O U about a week before, and he offered to meet me at Mr. Exley's—I never got my shares back—I had before ascertained from the prisoner that they were in the hands of Mr. Exley—the prisoner got me to sign a memorandum—he pressed me very much to allow him a week to settle the matter, and after a little con<lb></lb>sideration I consented—his wife was there, and she importuned me as well—that was on the Monday, I believe, and on the Wednesday I was to meet him at Mr. Exley's, and he was to arrange with Mr. Exley that the shares were to be given up to me—on the 9th Sept. I was to have 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for salary given up to me, and on this consideration I said I would not take any pro<lb></lb>ceedings against him—I never got my shares, nor the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., salary—I do not know what became of the prisoner, I lost sight of him then.</p>

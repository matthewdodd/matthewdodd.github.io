                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Richard Robinson, who keeps the Crown public-house in Thornbugh-street, Bloomsbury. The prisoner came in last Sunday night for two-pennyworth of rum—I served him, and he offered me a bad sixpence—I refused it—he wanted it back from me, but he had drank part of the rum, and I told him I would not re<lb></lb>turn it nor give him the change, until he brought me another sixpence—he began to abuse me—my husband heard the noise, and came from the parlour—he looked at the sixpence, and saw it was bad—he told the pri<lb></lb>soner he should detain the sixpence, unless he paid for the rum—he put it on a shelf in the bar, and I put a glass over it.</p>

I was present on the Sunday night—I went and discovered the prisoner—he had been passing a bad sixpence—he wanted it back again—it was refused—I took it from my wife, and placed it on a shelf—my wife put the glass over it—after some abuse, the prisoner went away—I am sure he is the person—he came again on the Tuesday evening, about five o'clock—he called for half-a-pint of porter, and offered a sixpence, which I told him was bad—I recognised him to be the person who had been there on Sunday—I told him so—he denied it—</p>

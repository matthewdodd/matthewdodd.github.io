                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jacob Fobstein, and live at 34, Fashion Street—on the morning of the 24th October I had locked all up, and gone to bed at 1 o'clock—at 3 o'clock I saw the prisoner holding on by the window sill, and jump down into the yard—I went out into the yard, and told a policeman—I saw something in the prisoner's hand when he was on the window-ledge—the clothes in the room were safe when I went to bed—a policeman afterwards brought something back.</p>

On the 20th October, at 3 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Fashion Street—I heard screams from last witness—I ran towards the screams, and when I turned the corner I saw the prisoner come out of the garden of 34, followed by another man—the prisoner had a coat with him—he threw it away—the other man was close behind him—he had a coat and three petticoats—he threw them down just before me—they turned sharp round the corner, and I turned sharp, and being a slippery morning, I fell and broke my arm—I saw them go into Flower and Dean Street—I picked up the coat and three petticoats on my way back, and the coat which the prisoner threw away—a woman was standing at the door of 34, and I showed her the things I had picked up—those are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I examined the room—one square of glass had been broken in a window at the back of the house, and in that way an entrance had been effected—a man could hare put his hand in—he could not have got in him<lb></lb>self—I made a communication to another constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have to say he is speaking false when he says he saw me running out of the house—the reason he says it is me is he has seen me several times already about the streets. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I have known him some time—I saw him that morning with these things—they must have lifted the window up to get in—the window was not open.</p>

On the morning of 20th October I was called to the house of the prosecutor—I examined the square of glass spoken of—it was in such a position that a man could unfasten the bolt and get into the room where the prosecutrix was lying—I afterwards saw the prisoner in Flower and Dean Street, about half an hour after the bur<lb></lb>glary was committed—I said "Did you hear of a man breaking his arm?"—he said "No"—I said he had better go to bed—from further information I went with <hi rend="italic">H</hi> 119 and apprehended the prisoner the same morning at 8 o'clock—Francis had given me a description of the prisoner before I saw him in Flower and Dean Street.</p>

On the 2nd of March, about half past twelve o'clock in the day, the prisoner came into the shop; the woman that was with her asked for a pair of black stockings; I shewed her some at two shillings a pair; while the woman was looking at the stockings, I perceived the prisoner stoop down and pick up something and was putting it under her clothes; the woman that was looking at the stockings offered me twenty-pence; I told her I could not take it. The prisoner laid hold of the child that was with her, and said come my dear, and went out, and the woman that was looking at the stockings immediately followed her out; one turned down the street and the other up the street; I followed the prisoner and asked her what she had got under her cloak; she said only this; I found it was three pair of pantaloons. I sent for a constable and gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

On this day I was going along; a woman met me she said do not you get your living by charing; I said yes; she said will you go along with me and do half a day's work; I said yes. Turning up Sun street she said come in here with me, I want to buy a pair of stockings; I went in with her; that gentleman shewed her a pair of stockings, my little child was running about the shop; I took the child and said come, and went out of the shop; the woman came out with me, she gave me these things; the gentleman came up and said what have you got; I said these, the woman gave them me. I am entirely innocent of this theft.</p>

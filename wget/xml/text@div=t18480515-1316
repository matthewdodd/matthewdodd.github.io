On Sunday afternoon, 2nd April, at four o'clock, I went out, and fastened the house up, leaving no one in it—I shut the door and locked it—I returned, with my daughter, a little before ten, and found the door unlocked; it was on the latch—we went in—the parlour-door and table-drawers were open—we missed some pen-cases, blankets, spoons a watch, brooches, and rings, from a drawer in my bed-room—they were all any property.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Pratt-street, Camden-town. On 2nd April, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoners together in Stanmore-street—I knew them before—one had a cap, and the other a hat—they changed the hat and cap, and crossed over, one on each side of the street—they crossed back again, and went up to Mrs. Ginger's street door—(I did not then know whose house it was)—Johnson seemed to be putting a key in the door—Cummings was behind him, touching him—it did not open—they came down, and afterwards went back again—Johnson opened the door with something—they went in, put something in their pockets, and shut the door—I did not say anything about it till Monday night; I did not like to—I did not hear of the robbery till the next afternoon—I had no other reason—I did not say they went in, because their companions threatened that they would stab me.</p>

            , silk manufacturers, in Foster-lane, Cheapside: On the 27th of January, the prisoner came in and produced a card of Mr. John-Olney Beckley's, which we cannot find any where; this is precisely the same card; Mr. Beckley then resided in Union-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Beckley was recently come into this partnership? - A. Yes, a very short time before; Hart produced the card, and said he was recommended by Mr. John Beckley, to purchase of us silk handkerchiefs, Bandana silk handkerchiefs, and black Barcelonas; he looked out such as he liked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it to be a ready money bargain? - A. He said he wanted to pay ready money, and should be a good customer.</p>
               <p>Q. In ready money contracts you deduct a discount? - A. Yes; we took him off two and a half per cent for ready money.</p>
               <p>Q. After having deducted that discount, what was the amount of the goods that he chose? - A. Twenty-seven pounds nineteen shillings; when I told him the amount, he looked in his pocket-book, and said, he had but fifteen pounds in Bank-notes, and therefore he should be obliged to us to send these to No. 22, New-street, Bishopsgate-street, agreeable to a written direction which he gave me,(produces it); he desired them to be taken precisely at seven o'clock in the evening; I took them within a few minutes of the hour appointed; I found the prisoner there, and delivered the goods,</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about his person? - A. I am certain of his person; I delivered the goods upon the table; I directly opened the parcel of goods, and desired him to see if they corresponded with the bill of parcels, which I presented him at the same time.

(The bill produced by Mr. Beckley).</p>
               <p>Mackereth. This is the bill; which I took; it is drawn for twenty-seven pounds ten shillings; he made up the difference, by giving me nine shillings in money; after some conversation, I asked him who Mr. Elvy was, that it appeared to be drawn upon; he told me he was clerk in the house of Moreau and Company, merchants in Barking church-yard; he gave me a great many assurances of the certainty of its being paid: under these circumstances I was induced to take it; I went home, I shewed the bill to Mr. Kirkby, and he was dissatisfied with the bill; in consequence of which, I was sent to make enquiries about Moreau and Company, and also Robert Elvy, whom it was drawn upon; I went into the neighbourhood of Barking church-yard, and Tower-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go to Barkin churchyard? - A. I looked round the church-yard, and found Maurier and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find such a person as Robert Elvy at Moreau's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make diligent enquiries all over that neighbourhood? - A. I did; when the bill became due, I enquired of Henry Hart, No. 22, New-street; I went several times after the bill was presented, but he was always denied; I called, I dare say, twenty times, but could not find him; I left word that I had called, and my business.</p>
               <p>Q.How and where did you at last find him? - A. I think the 24th of February, in a house with which the back-door of No 22 communicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When you enquired at this house in Barking Church-yard, did you not hear of Mr. Robert Elvy coming there? - A. I never could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of such a person as Robert Elvy there? - A. I enquired of the servantmaid, and she said she believed there was such a person, but she had nothing to do in the accompting-house, there was no such person then in the way, but if I would call the next morning, I might be informed about it in the accomting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you enquired at New-street for the prisoner, were you not told that he was upon his ordinary business at Gravesend? - A. Yes, or Chatham, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you call afterwards at the accompting-house, and did you then hear of such a person as Robert Elvy? - A. I never could find any body in the accompting-house.</p>

               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you if you ever gave him any of your cards? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this; did you ever present that bill for payment at Barking church-yard? - A. I presented it the day it was due, the 30th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. At the house where it is directed? - A. No; at the house of Maurier and Company; when I enquired, they told me there was a man put in only to give answers; he told me if I would leave the address where it laid, it would be taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask of him if there was any house of Morean and Co. in that church-yard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make enquiries of any body else? - A. I made no such enquiries: Mr. Mackereth had been before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When a bill is made payable to a particular place, and the person not at home, the usage is to leave the address where it lies, is not that the course of fair trade? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you get either money or goods? - A. No; the reason assigned to me was, that he was gone to Gravesend the preceding night; I was once informed he was at Gravesend, another time at Chatham, and another time they believed he would come to town; but I never could find him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in company one evening with two silk-weavers, at the Catherinewheel, in Bishopsgate-street; I mentioned that I wanted some articles of this sort; they said, if I would go to Mr. Beckley's, in Union-street, I should get some as reasonable as any where; I went and enquired for Mr. Beckley; he was not at home; the warehouseman desired to know my business; I told him my business, and he put the direction upon the back of the card; I went to Foster-lane, and I told them that I had been to Union-street; I told them I wanted some handkerchiefs to go into the country, and I looked out the goods, and they were to be delivered about seven in the evening; I did not intend to pay the bill away till it was due; I went in the mean time over the water to Mr. Elvy, to get some money of him on account; his house was at Walworth; he was not at home, and I was obliged to pay away the bill; I said, if your gentlemen have any objection to the bill, let me know to-night, for I am going off to Gravesend to-morrow morning with the goods; I heard nothing from them that night, and the next morning I went to Gravesend and Chatham; I was gone four days, I believe; when I came back nobody made any demand upon me for the bill till I was taken to the Mansion-house; there were large bills stuck about, which made these people go out of the way, or else I have no doubt but the bill would have been paid when it became due.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Where does Elvy live? - A. I do not know where he lived, but the bill was addressed, Barking church-yard; I have endeavoured to find him out, but have not been able.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the seafaring line, what are you now? - A. I live upon what I got when I was at sea, and I am looking out for a situation.</p>
               <p>Q. What ship were you on board of? - A. I have been on board several; I came home last, just before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. May I trouble you to tell me how you spell your name? - A. Baddan.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any bill transactions with Mr. Hart? - A. I never had in my life-time.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, as you never had any dealings with Hart, you never gave him a bill? - A. I gave him a bill, for which I was to have stops, which this very Elvy accepted.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was this? - A. It might be some time last January, I am not certain to a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold Hart goods? - A. No; I sold him some Spanish dollars and foreign coin, making altogether 15l. 10s. 9d.; he agreed to give me 4s. 9d. a piece for the dollars.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the bill drawn for that amount? - A. I do not know certainly, but I believe about that sum; it was within less than a pound.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200050"></xptr>Court. I will trouble you to write your name.(The witness wrote his name, and it was handed to the Bench).</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. It was drawn for more than 14l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you are sure it was within a pound? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you waver about it, are you sure it was within two pounds of 151. 10s. 9d.? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you not to take the bill from him for the exact amount of the dollars? - A.Elvy told me to call upon him in Barking church-yard, and he would pay me for them the next day, at twelve o'clock; I called there, and he was there, but came with me out of the house, and said, I will meet you at the George, in George-yard, this evening, at nine o'clock, and I will pay you, or give you a bill, and when he came there, he gave me this bill.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Hart to indorse it? - A. Hart was to give me slops for it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get these slops? - A. I did not get them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you to have them? - A. As soon as he could go to market.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a given time mentioned? - A. No, there was no limited time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many months did you suffer to elapse before you called upon Hart to supply you with the slops? - A. Not one; he was in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that one month after the date of this bill, Hart was in confinement? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have been two months? - A. No, I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not more than three months after this bill was so drawn, that Hart was taken into custody? - A. Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Price wrote the body of this bill, did he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill? - A. This is the very bill.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was within a month? - A. I was not certain to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your custom to pay for slops before you get them? - A. No; it is time enough to pay for them when you do get them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Since you have returned the last time from on board ship, have you had any regular way of life? - A. I have not; because I had some money when I came from sea, and I have had enough, thank God, to support me since.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write? - A. Yes, often; I have seen a great deal of his writing; this appears to me to be like his writing; I don't mean to swear positively to his writing, but it is like it.</p>

               <persName id="t18010520-62-person505">
                  Robert 
                  Elvy
               <interp inst="t18010520-62-person505" type="surname" value="Elvy"></interp>
                     <interp inst="t18010520-62-person505" type="given" value="Robert"></interp>
                     <interp inst="t18010520-62-person505" type="gender" value="male"></interp>
                  </persName>
            , knowing the same to have been forged: therefore, it is of the effence of this prosecution that you should be perfectly satisfied that the name of Robert Elvy is actually forged. I should have been perfectly prepared, as the evidence on the part of the prosecution stood, to state, that 
               <persName id="t18010520-62-person506">
                  Robert 
                  Elvy
               <interp inst="t18010520-62-person506" type="surname" value="Elvy"></interp>
                     <interp inst="t18010520-62-person506" type="given" value="Robert"></interp>
                     <interp inst="t18010520-62-person506" type="gender" value="male"></interp>
                  </persName>
             was a man of straw, who never existed, and that the prisoner, or some person with his connivance, had put that name upon the bill. I should have been prepared to tell you, that that species of fraud did come within that higher species of offence, which constitutes forgery; but still, though this man has been in bad company, it appears that there is a man, perhaps, deeply particeps rimonis, a vagabond, that is at one moment at Walworth, and at another in Barking Church-yard, who has no visible place of abode; and this witness says, it is the hand-writing of Elvy, and he is corroborated by two other witnesses, that there is such a man in existence. Under these circumstances, I am quite satisfied that men of your understandings will not feel yourselves justified in saying that this is the forged acceptance of a person not existing, or of a person existing, whose name the prisoner has assumed without his consent.</p>

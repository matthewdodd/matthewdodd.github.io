            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, I went to Messrs. Walker and Maltby, Commercial-road, Lambeth, and took some lead from there; there were 813 lbs. - I got it from the foreman, Bolland, on the 26th of April; I went to the prisoner on the same day, and saw him at his house in Strutton-ground - I asked if he had sold a quantity of lead to Messrs. Walker and Co - he said he had, about eight cwt., but could not exactly tell the weight of it. I asked where he got it - he said from his houses in Shoe-lane. I ordered him to attend the Magistrate the next day, and he did so; he said his houses in Shoe-lane had been under repair, and the lead had come from there. On the 29th of April, I took some of the lead to the house of Mr. Storr, at the corner of <placeName id="t18240603-216-crimeloc1124">New-street, Westminster</placeName>

I went to the top of the house, and found the tops of the three dormers or garrets stripped of their lead; they have windows that project out, and they are covered with lead; I took some of the lead in my possession to the top of the house, and found part of it to fit one of the tops of the garret windows; it consisted of three pieces, and they made a complete covering for that dormer; a nail left in the lead exactly fitted a nail-hole in the top of the dormer; and a nail on the dormer exactly fitted a nail-hole in the lead; there was no nail-hole but what fitted; I found the wood of a sink in the wash-house, and a piece of lead I had fitted it; the lead of that sink was missing; the pipe from the water-butt was gone; I had two pieces of lead with me which corresponded with the size of the pipe; the wash-house had been recently white-washed, and the pipe I had was white-washed; this lead had been torn away; part on the dormer had been cut into three pieces to get it off the top, and there were the nails where it was torn off. On the 30th I saw Gamble and Coney at Shoe-lane; Coney is a plumber, who lives next door to Gamble - they took me to the top of a house to point out where the lead had come from; I did not see any place where such lead had come from; Gamble said, then it must have come from his house in Strutton-ground; he had not on the former occasion said any thing about houses in Srutton-ground; I made an appointment to meet him next day to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030077"></xptr>look at his house there; my brother officer examined the house in Strutton-ground.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Did you find Mr. Gamble to be a man who keeps a respectable shop, and likely to have many houses - A. Yes; I have heard since that he had been a warrant officer in the navy; my first question was, whether he had taken any lead to Messrs. Walker and Co.; he said he had, but did not say for whom, but from his houses in Shoe-lane; and when he and Coney went there, he also mentioned about houses in Strutton-ground; his plumber went with him to point out where the lead had come from; but he did not state that the lead had come from him; Coney was supposed to be his plumber, and that he could show best where it had come from; he is his brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What weight of lead might there have been taken from Storr's house - A. From two to three cwt.; the whole of the lead was torn from the dormer tops - when we went to Shoe-lane he said he had been repairing that house, and pointed out the gutters - I said it was not gutter lead that I had got; but there was no part of the house from which it was possible that it could have been taken.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went over the water to the prisoner, and asked him if he had sold some lead to Walker and Maltby, as they had got some which I suspected to be stolen; he said he had sold about 8 cwt. Mitchel asked where he got it from, he said from his house in Shoe-lane, and he had had it in his cellar in Strutton-ground for sometime; he was ordered to attend the Magistrates next day, which he did; we afterwards met him at Shoe-lane to point out the place where it had come from. I was on the roof, and told him I could see no part that appeared to have been lately new leaded; he said I might say so if I pleased. There are no dormers, nor did I see any place from which it could have come. I afterwards discovered that the prosecutors house had been stripped; all the lead taken from the three dormers; the lead taken there exactly fitted with the dormers, cistern, or sink, and the pipe. I examined the dormers particularly, and can speak with certainty of them. In the middle dormer there was a narrow piece gone about six inches wide, that we could not find; the others were completely covered with the lead we brought; and as far as we could conscientiously and honestly judge, it had come from there; we went into the kitchen, and the lead exactly fitted the cistern and pipe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Mitchel with you during all the conversations with Gamble - A. I believe he was, and Gamble's wife was there, and I believe there might be somebody else, but I cannot say who, or whether they heard the conversation - he attended the office according to his promise.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you fit the lead on the dormers particularly - A. Yes; and there were several nail holes that exactly fitted; there was one nail in the lead which fitted a hole on the dormer exactly; there was another which had remained on the top of the dormer.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Walker and Co. I received this 8 cwt of lead from the prisoner on the 26th of April; it came in a cart in baskets, such as butter dealers use. I believe twenty-one shillings per cwt. was paid for it, but I did not pay it. I have seen Mr. Gamble before, but had no acquaintance with him. It was brought about eleven o'clock in the morning, and taken away by the officers afterwards.</p>

            . I am a plumber. I live at No. 273, Strand, and No. 50, Strutton-ground. I am the prisoner's wife's brother. I had been doing some plumbing work for him in Shoe-lane; he lives in Strutton-ground. In April last I made application to him about some lead. I had sent down a lot of lead from the house in Shoe-lane, with some wood to burn; and I had also bought a lot of lead of a man named Turpin, who keeps a broker's shop in Peter-street, Westminster. Not having conveyance myself to carry it to Walker and Maltby's, and as I was then indebted a trifle to them, I asked Gamble to take it in his cart, and I would lend him mine in the mean time; he objected to it; I dont know why he objected, but his wife however prevailed upon him - this was on the Monday morning. It was then taken in some baskets to Mr. Gamble's stable; he went with it himself, and my boy

             with him. My wife received the money for it. My reason for asking him to take it was this - I was about changing some lead for my own use some time before, and sent some lead to Walker's and Co. to make up a quantity, and it was stopped by some officers, who asked what I had got in the cart, and I was ordered to attend at the Thames Police Office for it; and if I had taken it, the officers might have stopped me, as I had been up to the office once before; and as I owed Messrs. Walker and Co. 6 l., and could not spare the money just then. I begged of him to take it; he had nothing to do with it but to carry it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you here yesterday - A. No; I was not here yesterday when my brother was tried. I had to go to Pentonville, and I went; and it was understood from the solicitor that my attendance was not necessary. I came to see if I should be wanted - he was tried for stealing a part of the same lead. I had told the attorney that I would give any evidence, but I left the place and went to Islington before the trial was over. I attended at the Thames Police Office; I did not give the same account there. I was not sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not sworn by the Magistrates to tell the truth - A. No; they asked me to swear to the lead, and I said I could not - it was the same lead that was then inquired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030078"></xptr>about; but they only asked me if I could swear to the lead. I was not called upon to account for my brother's possession of the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, did you not tell the Magistrate that the lead in question was taken from a house in Shoe-lane - A. I did not, Sir; I was not asked the question. I went to Shoe-lane with the officers to point out where part of the lead came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you had not told the Magistrate that it came from there, how came you to go to Shoe-lane. A. I had not told them; but Mr. Gamble had told them that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you bought part of the lead of a man in Westminster - A. No; I said I sent some old lead and some wood to Westminster; and that lead, with some I took from No. 7, Shoe-lane, was what Mr. Gamble took for me. I pointed out to the officers where a quantity of lead came from on that house - it was sent to Mr. Gamble's on the 26th - it was put in the baskets on the same day, and sent to Messrs. Walker and Co. - it could not have been in his stables for some days before, nor any part of it. I think the money received for the lead was seven or eight pounds; but I cannot, nor will not, swear it. I had a returned bill of about fifteen pounds the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no bill of parcels of the lead - A. There might have been one, but I never saw it - the boy is here, and can tell you more than I can; it was signed in Messrs. Walker and Co.'s books.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you again solemnly affirm that you did not tell the Magistrates that she lead came from the house in Shoe-lane - A. No; I did not; they asked if I could swear to any part of the lead, and I said I could not.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What part of the house in Shoe-lane did you point out to the officers - A. I pointed out a quantity of new lead that had been laid in a gutter, and a quantity from a dormer window that had been replaced with slates - it had been taken away by my man, and sent to Westminster. I superintended the work, and know that it was done. I could not swear to the lead when I saw it; it is impossible, when lead is taken, by other persons, to swear where it came from, unless it was re-laid. I know of no lead from a cistern or a pipe; but I have no doubt the whole of it was in my possession, as I bought a quantity. I had no idea of its being stolen. I got the cistern lead, and pipe, from Turpin; he brought it in a barrow. I did not tell the Magistrates I knew of that lead, because I could not safely swear to it. I knew Gamble was charged with having lead in his possession; but I did not notice the sink; there was a quantity of lead.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Coney. I took some lead from his house to Mr. Gamble's about nine or ten o'clock in the morning, and then I went with the same lead to Messrs. Walker and Maltby's, and signed my name on the book. I went with Mr. Gamble in his cart. I received seven or eight pounds. I think this paper is my writing - it is for 8 l. 4 s. 5 d.; this was for the lead. I brought the money home, and gave it to Mr. Coney.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Look again at that paper, and tell me if it is your writing - A. No; I see now that it is not my writing. I signed my name to what was down in the book. I do not know what it was; but they told me to put my name.</p>

            . I have lived with Mr. Gamble eleven months. I see the cellar several times every day - there never was any lead there; if there had I must have seen it. Mr. Coney's house is next door; but there is no private way of getting there, without you get over the wall. I heard my master say to his wife,</p>
               <p>"Coney wants me to take some lead; I don't like it; but being one of your family I suppose I must do it, or the whole fat will be in the fire." I did not see the lead come in the morning, but I saw the cart waiting for it. I have now left Mr. Gamble's; Mr. Coney engaged me yesterday after I had been here. I was Gamble's servant yesterday, but I am not now. I believe Mr. Coney keeps a horse and cart such as plumber's use. Coney first asked for the cart on Sunday evening, the 26th of April.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Gamble. Coney came to me on the 26th of April, and said</p>
               <p>"Tom, I want you to take a load of lead for me." I did not tell my master of it that night, because I did not see him. I went out early in the morning, and did not say any thing about it. I never saw any lead on my master's premises.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NEW. I am in Mr. Gamble's employ. Coney came on the 26th of April, and told my fellow-servant he wanted him to take a load of lead for him in the morning, and he said,</p>
               <p>"I am sure I can't; for I must go to Wandsworth - you must speak to my master."</p>

               <p>- JONES. I have been a workman for Mr. Coney. I saw some lead put into a cart in Shoe-lane; it might be 5 or 6 cwt.; it was in February, as near as I can guess - there was a sink and a gutter, and some strippings from a ridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Maze Hill, Greenwich, and am a mechanic—on Saturday night, 14th June, I met the prisoner near Greenwich Hospital, about 11 o'clock—we went into a public-house—I could not get clear of her—it was getting near 12 o'clock, and she asked me to see her part of the way home—I went to her house—I had a watch in my pocket, which I missed a little while after I got into the room, and on that account I stopped there till morning—I had not been to the water-closet, and the prisoner had not left the room till two hours after I accused her—when I missed it, I said "You have got my watch"—she said that she had not, and if she took one she would take the best one—another female was in the room, and. I asked her if she would do me the favour to go and fetch a policeman—she said that she would not, and the prisoner told me to go and fetch one—I said that I would not go before daybreak, when I could identify where I was—the other woman was there all the while, and she was there when I left to find a policeman—I saw my watch at the station, also my handkerchief—I had not given them to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 8, Little Marsland Street, Greenwich—I do not know the prisoner, I have only seen her five or six weeks frequenting this house—I got up very early on Sunday morning, 15th June, because one of my children wanted to go to the water-closet, and as soon as I opened my door I saw a watch in the closet on the floor—there</p>

On Sunday morning, 15th June, about 4 o'clock in the morning, Scott made a communication to me, and I went to the house and received the watch from Mrs. Connolly—the prisoner was in the house, No. 6, partly undressed—Scott charged her with stealing his watch—she said "I never saw your watch"—there was another woman up stairs—the prisoner was searched at the station, and this handkerchief was found on her, which she said Scott gave her in the public-house.</p>

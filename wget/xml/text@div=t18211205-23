               <p>SOHPIA BRAIN. I live in Hampshire. On the 9th of November, I was in London - I had a gold neck-chain on with a reading glass attached to it; about half-past twelve o'clock I was in company with Mrs. Aust, at Mr. Baker's, a mercer, on <placeName id="t18211205-23-crimeloc140">Ludgate-hill</placeName>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I was about twenty yards from Mr. Baker's shop, I saw a great crowd, and saw something go from the lady's neck - I went in among the crowd near the door and saw a great many people together, I caught hold of the prisoner as he was nearest to me - I saw a chain drop from some of them in the crowd, but cannot say whether it was from him, I think not, but it was dropped very near him, nor can I say that the persons round were his companions; it was picked up and given me by Miller, in Bridge-street - Mr. Baker's is two doors from Bridge-street.</p>

I was one before the prisoner, and Smith was behind him; there was a great crowd; I heard a lady had lost a chain, I turned round immediately, the prisoner was within one or two, I seized him, and Smith laid hold of him - the chain was delivered to me. There was thirty or forty boys and men round.</p>

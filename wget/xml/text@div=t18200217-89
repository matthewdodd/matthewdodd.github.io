I sleep in the house over the brewhouse - my bedroom joins the dwelling-house. I fastened up the house between six and seven o'clock at night; all the doors and windows were secured. At two o'clock in the morning the watchman gave an alarm, I awoke, came down, and saw two men in the wash-house and brewhouse; they could not have got in without breaking the fastenings of the house - three doors were broken open. Dalton secured both the men - one was standing up, and the other lying down; we kept them in the house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170040"></xptr>- the prisoner was one whom we kept in custody; I never saw him before. The other was named Lucy.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Lucy - A. They both broke out of the round-house - the prisoner has since been taken.</p>
               <p>Q. After you secured the prisoner, did you discover how the house had been entered - A. The door leading from the cow-house into the yard was entirely forced down - they had broken another door before they could get into the brewhouse, where we secured them. I found a bundle, which was left on the copper the over-night, was moved into the brewhouse; a collar, and hames and traces were moved - they hung up over a door which leads from the cowhouse to the brewhouse; that door was nailed up; they had broken the boards down, and took the collar and harness off the peg. My jacket hung at the foot of the ladder where I go up to bed - I found it lying on the floor in the same room, about three yards from where it hung. Mr. Baily's drawers were moved off the copper.</p>

            . I live in Wilsden parish and rent the house. Herridge fastened the doors. I was called up in the night; I went with Herridge, and found the prisoner in the middle of the wash-house - he could not have got there a without breaking three boards, which was originally a doorway - they were pulled down between the cowhouse and brewhouse - they were safe overnight; it would take considerable force to remove them. I struck a light, as it was quite dark; I then asked the prisoner, Bolton, where his companion was? he said he was lying in one corner of the room - I found him lying there, and kept them in custody there till seven o'clock, then sent for the constable, and conveyed them to the round-house. The collar, traces, and drawers were moved from where they were the over-night. The cow-house joins the dwelling-house, and is part of it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Wilsden; I go round these premises every half hour. At half-past eleven o'clock every door was safe and fast. I went again rather before two, having seen two men of suspicious appearance go in a direction towards Baily's. When I went into the yard I found the boards pulled flat down to the ground where the doorway was. I went round to the other door, which goes into the house, and found that open - they could not get at that without forcing the boards down. I sprang my rattle, went in, and found the prisoner there; I kept him in custody till the servant came down. I found a tall young man lying by the side of a truss of hay - I secured him, and took them both to the round-house at seven o'clock in the morning, and the same night I heard they had escaped; I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody at Bow-street, and am certain he is the man. They were both sober.</p>

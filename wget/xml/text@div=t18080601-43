               <p>Q. On the 16th of April last, had you occasion to leave your house for a short time - A. Yes, for a few minutes, between the hours of twelve and one o'clock; when I left my house, I locked my shop door, and left the key in the door; I left my wife in the house up stairs, my workmen were in the back shop in the yard; it is detached from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you locked your shop door, where did you go to - A. I went to the end of the street; and I returned in a few minutes, and when I entered the passage; I saw the prisoner at the shop door which was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever known the prisoner before - A. Yes; he is a sadler and harness maker by trade; he had often been in my shop; I saw him pulling my door to as if to lock it; he had hold of the key; I asked him what he wanted, his answer was, that he wished to know if I had heard of a situation for him; I answered that I knew of nothing for him; I then asked him how he could take the liberty of opening the shop door, saying that I knew he had been in; which he denied; I then asked him if he would walk in the shop; he went in with me; at the same time one of my men came in; when I went into the shop, I looked at that part of the shop where I had frequently missed goods before; I observed some things had been taken away; on turning to the prisoner, I saw his countenance very much change; I then looked into his outside pocket and observed a brown paper parcel in it; I then asked him how he could have the impudence to ask me for a situation when he came to rob me; he turned the goods out of his pocket; my servant assisted him in so doing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon him - A. I found four paper parcels of nails, such as sadlers use; the four papers contain four thousand; we sell them at one shilling and ninepence a thousand; one paper containing twelve plated trace buckles, and one paper containing eight plated territs; I knew the things when I saw them, I looked at the place where we kept them; I missed them.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: on the 30th of January I met the prisoner, just by Bagnigge-Wells, about six o'clock; he had a bundle under his coat; I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; I told him not to be alarmed, I was an officer, and insisted on knowing what he had; in the mean time, a gentleman was coming by; I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he said he did; I then asked him where he worked; he told me that he worked in Britannia-street, for one Mr. Webb; I then took him back to Battle-bridge, and left him in custody of another officer, while I went to Mr. Webb's house with the property that I had taken from him; he told me, after the gentleman came, for whom he worked; I took him, by the desire of Mr. Webb, to Bow-street; after that, I searched his cupboard, and found a great quantity of old iron, the property of Mr. Webb.</p>
               <p>(The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.(To Webb.) There are a thousand of them nails, Mr. Webb? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a mark on them; a shop-mark? - A. Yes; it is the shop-mark that we have to sell by; this mark we put on ourselves; sometimes my wife or my son; and I mark some.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell them in papers with that mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have dealt in that article a considerable time; how can you tell but that you may have sold those very articles? - A. I cannot say any thing to that; but these hooks which are not in the indictment were made but a week ago, and the screws.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There is some old iron; what are these? - A. It is nut iron; waste iron that is cut off, after working it; we pack it up to send in the country to the mills.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. With respect to the hooks, they are your man's work? - A. They are; I am well acquainted with his work.</p>
               <p>- ALEXANDER sworn. - I am an officer; as I was on regular duty just by Bagnigge-Wells, we met the prisoner; we asked him what he had got there; in the mean time, a gentleman coming by, he said he knew the man; he worked for Mr. Webb.

He received the money from Elizabeth Walker, for nine weeks' beer, at 4 s. per week. I repeatedly asked, if he had received her money, he said, she would settle it, from time to time; but he never accounted to me for the money he received from her. He came into my service in April: he was always to pay when he received it. Walker came to my house one day, and the prisoner went away immediately, without giving me notice. He was apprehended on the Thursday following.</p>

            . I live in Cross-lane, Long-acre. I have beer from Langston. The prisoner generally brought the beer to my house. I do not owe Mr. Langston any money: I always paid it regularly to the prisoner once a week. The last time I paid him was at the end of January. There never was more than 4 s. a week due. My general way of paying it was a sixpence, a shilling, and a half-a-crown, to make the parcel as small as possible, which I generally wrapped up in paper. I think the last time I paid him was in that way.</p>

I was afraid of telling my master; and, on the Monday following, I meant to ask him for my wages, to replace the money which I had lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City officer. From information, I went on Saturday, 14th May, to Mr. Bryer's shop—I found the prisoner there—I took her into a back room, and told her I was a policeman, and asked her how she accounted for the possession of this plate, which was the produce of a burglary committed the night before or on that morning—she said a person higher up the street had given it her to bring there—I asked her what her name was—she said Sarah Smith—I asked if she was married, she said no, she was a prostitute—I asked her her address, and she refused to give it—I took her to the station—nothing was found on her—I asked her to describe the person she got the plate from—she said a man about her own height, and dressed in black, and wearing a moustache, and she was to have a sovereign for bringing it—I went and looked about—I could see no man of that description—this is the plate; here are 3 caddies, an ink-stand, and this model.</p>

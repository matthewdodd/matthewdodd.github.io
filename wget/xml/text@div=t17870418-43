               <p>In January last, I was robbed of upwards of five pounds; there was sixteen half crowns, three half guineas in gold, and the rest in shillings and sixpences; I was brought to bed but two days; the girl that I had came to my bed side, and took my pocket from under my head, and run down stairs, that was the prisoner; I saw her do it; I screamed out; I could not run after her; I did not know her till my husband hired her in Spital-fields, as a weekly servant; she was taken a month after she went away, on the 25th of February; I never recovered any of my money.</p>
               <p>How came you to keep all your money in your pocket? - The man that worked for me was coming in and out, and I was obliged to give change; I was obliged to keep my money in my pocket; it was all the money I had in the world; I saw her take this and I screamed out; I could not follow her; I am sure the money was in my pocket; I had it not a quarter of an hour before; I had it in my hand, and put it in my pocket, and the prisoner saw me with the money in my hand; I set up during the time; I keep two men to hawk my mats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived with that woman three months; I never took away her money, nor robbed her of any thing; and I went away of a Friday, and they came to me and said I had robbed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am travelling inspector of the missing-letter branch in the General Post Office—from information I received, on Friday, 5th October, I made up a letter directed to Mrs. Tucker, Smith Street, Chelsea, and enclosed in it a cheque for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn on the National Bank, Oxford Street branch, payable to Mrs. Mary Tucker or bearer—it was a genuine check, drawn on purpose for this letter—I have an account with that bank—I also enclosed a directed envelope with four penny postage stamps affixed to it—I securely fastened the letter, and handed it to Smee, one of the constables, the same evening to post—I knew that Smith Street was in Sale's delivery—I went to Chelsea next morning, and saw Sale in the Queen's Road, about ten o'clock—I was standing near the post-office—I saw him go across the road and shake hands with the prisoner—they went across the road together to Parkinson's public-house, and remained there about five minutes—Sale came out first, and a few minutes afterwards the prisoner came out—Sale went towards the Brompton post-office—I went there too—on my way there I got some information about the letter—I saw Sale again on his delivery about half-past eleven, in the Queen's Road, and saw him go into Chelsea Hospital, which is the last place in his delivery—when he came out from there it was just about twelve, and he went across the road into the "Royal Hospital" tavern—a few minutes afterwards I passed the door of the tavern, and saw Sale and the prisoner at the bar of the tavern—I got several police officers, went in, and had them both searched—I was probably ten or</p>

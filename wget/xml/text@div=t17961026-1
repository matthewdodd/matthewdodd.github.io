               <p>CHARLES HILL sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On the 11th of September, did any thing happen to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Budd previous to that? - A. I knew his name was Robert, I don't know much of him; we made an agreement, and supped at Mr. William's, the Bayswater coffee-house, and I paid for the supper; when I came out, thirty-five minutes after eight, I looked at my watch, it was a moonlight night; I wished to go along the road home, but he said there were only two fields to go over before we got to <placeName id="t17961026-1-crimeloc3">Paddington</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did he turn it round with? - A.With his hand; after that I jumped over the stile, but with the agony I cried out greatly, and said to him, I am very much obliged to you for what you have done; give me my hat; and he said, damn your eyes I will cut your throat; and he attempted to cut my throat, I don't know what it was with; and having a stiffener in my handkerchief, it did not got through; which you will see by and by, Gentlemen, and the blood flew from my head and face, over his frill, and he went away; and then I went to the Bayswater coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to see the countenance of the person that did this? - A. Yes; that tall man Harris, with the flaxen hair.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you quite sure? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light sufficient to enable you to speak with certainty to his features? - A. Yes; I then went to Dr. Davis's, in Oxford-road; they were taken that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them afterwards? - A. On Thursday, at Bow street, I saw him among a great many other bakers there; and I said that is the man over yonder, I could just see his head.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not in a condition to see him before that? - A. No; I was not; the robbery was on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was only moonlight, the light had closed at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a person coming out of the ditch, and Budd, the moment he called out to deliver the money, ran away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I therefore take it you were a great deal frightened by loosing your companion, and the man coming to rob you? - A. I seemed rather alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this continue do you think? - A. I cannot justly say to a minute, it might be about four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your fright was not lessened by this treatment of the person? - A. My arm was very painful undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say now at Bow-street, that it was a person who had very much the appearance of a gentleman, that robbed you, but that you could not swear that Harris was the man? - A. No, I did not; I said, at Bow-street, that that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you were positive to him then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you were under very considerable alarm that the man attacked you, who did attack you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson, for Budd. Q. All that you know of Budd was, that his name was Robert? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And all that you have said is as true as that: How long have you been acquainted with Budd? - A. A few weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? - A. It might be four.</p>
               <p>Q. Not longer? - A. I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it six weeks, do you think? - A. I don't think it was so long as that; I dare say it was about four or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.And during that four or six weeks, how often might you have been in his company? - A.When my business called me that way, I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260004"></xptr>Q.Were you not very frequently together, and very intimate; you know the lad's master is here, and twenty other people? - A. Yes; we used to drink together, but not very frequently; when I used to go up to Paddington, I used to see him, and drink together.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with him three times a week upon an average, during that six weeks? - A. I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go so constantly, that his master chid you, and wanted to know what you wanted? - A. No; I never called upon him but once in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him so often then? - A. I have met with him going out with his bread.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet all that you know about him is, that his name is Robert; I think it has been stated, that you made some appointment upon the Friday before, how you should meet on the Sunday evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was proposed jocosely between you, that you were to meet under the forfeiture of half-a-crown, or a guinea? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You proposed to him, that if he did not meet you according to the then appointment, he should forfeit half-a-crown, or a guinea? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the house first proposed to meet at? - A. At the Red-lion, in Oxford-road; I went, but did not find him, and I went again, and he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank there? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you proposed to go to the Yorkshire-stingo? - A. No, Chalk-Farm; but, says he, no; I don't know any thing about going so far as that, says I, then we will go down to Bayswater.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did not you propose to spend the remainder of the evening at the Yorkshire-stingo? - A. No, it was one evening before.</p>
               <p>Q. But, upon the present occasion, he proposed going to Chalk Farm, and you did not like to go there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if you had accepted of this man's invitation to go to Chalk-Farm, this scheme could not have taken place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You proposed going to Bayswater as a nearer place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. YOu called for some supper, and treated the young man? - A. Yes; I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. So that all these little invitations, the Yorkshire-stingo, a few days before, and the Red-lion, and all this, and yet all that you knew of him was, that his name was Robert? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw a servant attending? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you drink? - A. One pot of beer, and I believe, a shillingsworth of punch, and half a pint of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not it a pint? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were pretty liberal in pushing the bottle about? - A. I asked him to drink, and he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl did not happen to say, that if you pushed about the liquor so, you would make the boy drunk? - A. She might say I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not Jane Smart say, if you pushed about the liquor so, you would make the lad drunk? - A. She might say so, very likely, but I don't remember it.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not venture to swear she did not say so to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were disposed to depart, you asked this young woman, if it was not a shorter cut over the fields? - A. She came out to the door with Robert; she said to me, you fool, I dare say you know how far it is to Paddington, so often as you go that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you ask Jane Smart, if you could go over the fields to Paddington? - A. I would not wish to say any thing but what I know; if I did, it has slipped my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. The lad was tipsey then, was not he, he had been drinking with you all day? - A. No; we did not meet till thirty five minutes past seven.</p>
               <p>Q. And then this other man said, damn your eyes stop? - A. He said, damn your eyes, deliver your money.</p>
               <p>Q. You were extremely frightened? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.By the same rule, your companion might be extremely frightened too? - A. As he left me, I suppose, so I cannot tell any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q.He was on one side of the stile, and you on the other when you were stopped? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he took to his heels and ran away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went from the Red-lion in a coach, to Bayswater? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was you that pulled the string, and told the man to go to Bayswater? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Arnold? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you happened to say to him that you did not want to hurt Budd, for Budd had not hurt you? - A. I don't know Mr. Arnold.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you ever said that to anybody? - A.If I was to see the man, I could tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. But have not you said so to any person, that you did not want to hurt Budd, for Budd never hurt you? - A. If I was to see the man, I could tell you.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prosecutor and Budd supping at your house on Sunday evening? - A. I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. That evening did you see Harris at your house? - A. About a quarter before nine, Harris came to my house and ordered sixpennyworth of rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sit down in the tap-room? - A. He was offered a candle to go into a room, but he would not, he sat down at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place while you were there? - A. Yes; he had two sixpennyworths of rum and water, and while drinking, he produced a stick, which I claimed to be my stick; he said, there was his fellow-servant, and he must go, and he went off directly; he had called for a third sixpennyworth, but did not stop to drink it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lent that stick? - A. Yes; to a baker that he was journeyman to, Mr. Bourne, baker, in King's-street, but from the circumstance of his bringing a leg of mutton to be dressed at my house, I recollected it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they had ever lived together as fellow-servants? - A. Harris told me, he lived at Mr. Hester's; Budd I know nothing at all of.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a stick was this? - A. It is here, a painted stick.</p>
               <p>Q. A large or small one? - A. A middling size stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Soon after Harris went out, did the prosecutor, Hill, come back to you? - A. Yes; very much in blood, with his arm broke; upon that I ordered the man to cut his hair off, and wash him with brandy; our people all knew Budd.</p>
               <p>Q.After that, did you go or send any body in pursuit of the person? - A. I sent my waiters, I did not go myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Harris sat down at the bar; he told you where he lived, at Mr. Hester's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the truth, was not it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He paid, of course, for the rum and water that he had? - A. He paid two sixpennyworths.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.That was all he had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. How many fields are there between Paddington and Bayswater? - A. I believe there may be four or five fields; but there are two or three ways, the way they were going four or five fields.</p>
               <p>Q. This place is about half-way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When the prosecutor and Budd were at your house, where were they? - A. In the taproom; five or six of the waiters were at supper at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Harris was in the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you observe any conversation between them? - A. No; only from information, the bar is open to the tap-room.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the house of Harris's master? - A. Yes; I waited there sometime, and he was not come home; he came home, I suppose, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you at the time you were there? - A. Three more that went to join me, and one of the constables of Paddington; when he came home he passed through the shop, and came backward with this stick in his hand, and a hat in his hand tied up in a handkerchief; he went through the shop as quick as a dart; it was in the dark, and we went to look after him and found him in the necessary; we found this stick among the wood that was for lighting the oven in the morning; when I found the stick I took Harris by the collar and told him he was my prisoner, upon strong suspicion of robbing a man near Bayswater; and he said, he had not been at Bayswater at all; after we had lodged him at a watch-house, we went back to Mr. Hester's to see if we could find the hat and watch, and we found the hat thrown over a wall; the man is here that found it the next day; we found the watch thrown into a shed among the shavings that were there for the use of the oven; I was present when Baker, the patrol, found them.</p>
               <p>Q.Has Baker got them now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present at the apprehension of Budd? - A. Yes, the same night about two o'clock in the morning, at his master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in bed? - A. No; in his master's shop; the patroles went back with him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260006"></xptr>what passed pretty well; I told him we wanted his man Robert.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you and Budd? - A. No, no conversation at all; the patroles searched him, but I was not present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. At the time you took Harris was he in liquor or not? - A. I imagined he had been cheerful.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he appear to be drunk? - A. I cannot say he was drunk; he had been drinking certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. YOu found nothing upon Harris, no watch, or any thing of that kind? - A. We found the watch in the shed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. You found Budd at work? - A. He was not at home when we first went.</p>
               <p>Q.When you did find him he was at work? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What was the hat tied up in? - A. An handkerchief with a stain of port wine or damsontart, or something of that sort; I believe it was the prisoner's handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. When was it you first went to Budd's master, when he was not at home? - A. It might be a little after ten.</p>

I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner Budd at his master's house; I told him it was on suspicion of a robbery committed that night; he desired me to let him go up stairs and put on his clothes he had just pulled off; in his box, there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260007"></xptr>some money lying upon the clothes. I searched Harris at the watch-house, after Pole had taken him there, and found upon him a watch belonging to a publican in Oxford-street, a new guinea, and five shillings and threepence-halfpenny; in his coat pocket. I found a handkerchief stained with red wine, I went into the yard and desired Cooke to go up into the shed, and I handed him a candle, and desired him to look about to see if he could find any thing, and I saw him bring out a handkerchief.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Gurney. I was present when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260009"></xptr>Arnold and several others made offers to the prosecutor for Budd; I saw their friends, I think, five different days; I saw them that Hill should not see them; I would not enter into any treaty with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Arnold make any offer? - A.They wished me to come to some terms, as I had a pretty considerable influence over Hill, they wished me to persuade Hill to receive money for him not to appear against the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Arnold was one of the persons that made an offer? - A. Yes; he was in company at the same time, at the public-house in Red-cross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum was offered? - A. The morning the trial was to have come on last session, a man, in company with Arnold, came and said he would give one hundred guineas; and as Hill might not be able to do his work again, it was likewise in his power to put him into something that might be of service to him during his life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Arnold appeared to be the friend of Budd? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. You say they and they, which of the theys do you mean? - A. Arnold was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the precise words that Arnold used? - A. They wanted me to come to some terms.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they? - A. Mr. Arnold was one; he wished me to come to some treaty.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words that he used? - A. I cannot tell the words he used, because I told them justice must take place.</p>
               <p>Q. There were five or six people present? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that five or six times during the course of the same day? - A. Yes; some of them; not altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there five or six people present each time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you see Arnold, during that day? - A.Twice, if not three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Now state the positive words that he used to you, and who was by when he used them? - A. There was another man, but his name I don't know: on the Wednesday the trial was to have come on, I met Arnold and another man by accident, near St. Bartholomew's hospital; he wished to see Mr. Hill, and to come to where he lodged, to enter into some treaty with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, upon your oath, he used these words-I want to come into some treaty with him? - A. Yes; that he might do something for him not to appear against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Arnold again? - A.They were to come to Red-cross-street; they met at the public-house, Mr. Arnold was one, and another of the name of King, I believe; there were five or six in all.</p>
               <p>Q.They were not all friends of Budd? - A. No; some friends of Harris's.</p>
               <p>Q. And some strangers perhaps? - A. No; they were all friends of the two.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Arnold say to you, then? - A. Arnold did not say any thing particular more than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, what Arnold said upon that occasion? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you? - A. Yes; but I cannot recollect his words.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it this person talked of giving 100 guineas? - A. He came to me to the Jerusalem coffee-house; I keep the Jerusalem coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you alone? - A. Yes; I believe he was Harris's friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know, that Arnold is as poor as a church mouse? - A. He may be, there was no money mentioned by Arnold.</p>

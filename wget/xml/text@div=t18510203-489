On Sunday night, 26th Jan., about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another boy go from a gateway across to the opposite side of the road, with a bag, with something in it, as if they came from Mr. Nathan's—they went on under a gateway, where the prisoner occupies a stable—I do not know what he is—he used to work for Mr. Nathan some time ago—I made a communication to my husband.</p>

On Sunday evening, 26th Jan., about seven o'clock, I left four sacks of fat in my slaughter-house—the prisoner was in my employ some time ago, and knew my premises perfectly well, and that I kept fat there—Howard gave me some information—about eight o'clock I went to the slaughter-house, and found it broken into—I missed about half of one of the sacks of fat—I went with the policeman to the prisoner's stable—he has got a pig there, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he pays 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the stable—I saw a bag in the stable with some hot fat in it—it had not been out of the bullock more than an hour—it was in the same state in which I left it at seven o'clock—I have not the least doubt it was the same fat—it was worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

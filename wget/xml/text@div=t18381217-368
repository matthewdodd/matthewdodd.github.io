                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Laurence, solicitor, No. 25, Old Fish-street. On Monday, the 10th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my master's door, and said she had a parcel for Mr. John Laurence, but he was not at home—I said, "No, he is not"—she said, "Are you the housekeeper?"—I said, "I am not"—I took the parcel, and she said there was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay—I said I had no money, and did not know what I should do—she then said, Mr. Laurence said, if the housekeeper was not at home, there would be a person there, and that I was to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to Mr. Cockburn and ask him the loan of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. till the morning—I went to Mr. Cockburn, who is a neighbour, and saw him pay the money to the prisoner—I took the parcel, believing it to be a valuable one, for my master—I did not see it opened afterwards—the prisoner was an entire stranger to me—I delivered the parcel to M'Lintoch.</p>

               <p>and the prisoner came in front of my bar—I asked her where she brought the parcel from—she said, "From Mrs. Evans, 33, Farringdon-market"—she assured me it was all right, and after that I gave the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I parted with the money, conceiving her story was true, and that it was a valuable parcel for Mr. Laurence—I am positive the prisoner is the person.</p>

            . Upon the 27th of March I went to Mr. Adams's shop to look at some silk; the prisoner was in the shop; I was at one counter and she at the other; she looked confused and by her motion I thought she wanted to conceal something, but I did not see her take any thing; she went out in a suspicious manner; I asked the shopman if he had lost any thing; he looked on the counter, and said he missed a piece of lutestring, and went after her.</p>

Major Martin paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per yard for the last piece.")—in compliance with that order I caused to be sent two pieces of damask, directed to Major Martin—I afterwards saw those two pieces at Mr. Lawley's, the pawn<lb></lb>broker's, in South Street, Manchester Square, on 30th Nov.—I also saw the prisoner Clarkson there—he came into the room, and Mr. Jones, the pawn<lb></lb>broker's assistant, said that he had pawned the goods—he said no, he had not pawned them for himself, but for a friend of his named Powell—I sent the invoice of the goods by post to Major Martin.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, E</hi>). On 30th Nov., I went with Mr. Shoolbred to Mr. Lawley's—I there saw Clarkson in the shop—I went out to him from the room I was in, and said, "Step in here"—the damasks were then lying open on the table; and, pointing to them, I said to Clark<lb></lb>son, "You pledged them?"—he said, "I did"—I said, "I am an Inspector of police, they have been stolen from Shoolbreds', and unless you account for the possession of them, I shall take you into custody"—he hesitated a few moments, and then said, "A man named Powell, who I met in the street, gave them to me to pledge"—not being satisfied with that answer, I took him into custody—on the way to the station, he said, "If you go to Mr. Collier, the landlord of the Bolt-in-Tun tap, Fleet Street, he will tell you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185801040019"></xptr>
               <p>that a man named Griffiths gave them to me to pledge in front of the bar, at 12 o'clock at night on 8th Dec."—I afterwards apprehended Griffiths in Chiswell Street, on 12th Dec.—I said to him, "Griffiths, I wank you for stealing damasks from Shoolbreds'; you took them from the Bolt-in-Tun tap"—heanswered, "I took them, but for Clarkson"—I said, "Clarkeon!"—hesaid, "Yes, Powell was not present"—I had not mentioned Powell's name—I have seen the three prisoners together—when first Clarkson was taken into custody, Mr. Shoolbred said, "I think we will take him down to Mr. Chamberlain's office;" and I think Clarkson remarked, "Oh, I kmew Mr. Chamberlain"—we went there, and I heard Mr. Chamberlain say to him, "I do not know you"—but I did not take much notice of what passed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> Mr. Chamberlain is my solicitor—we took Clarkson there—Mr. Chamberlain was not then presentent—Clarkson said, "Oh, Mr. Chamberlain knows me well; I was a witness in Mrs. Salmon's case—he knows I am a respectable man"—Mr. Chamberlain soon after came in, and did not appear to recognise him at all—he said, "You must remem<lb></lb>ber me, Mr. Chamberlain, I was a witness in Mrs. Salmon's case"—he said, "If you were a witness in that case, they were all a very bad lot."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Griffiths's statement before the Magistrate was read, as follows:</hi> "On the day mentioned I was employed by Mr. Powell here, to take these goods with Mr. Clarkson, which I did; and when we got into the Blackfriars Road we took a cab, Powell, Clarkson, and myself; I rode outside and they inside; we went to a pawnbroker's in the Newington Causeway; I took the goods in, and Clarkson asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them; he bid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Clarksen said, "That won't do," and he told Powell; and Powell said, "That won't do;" Powell was outside; we then took the cab, I riding outside, and they went, as they said, to Mr. Marden's in the Minories; I stayed in the cab for them, in the Minories, till they came back, and they went in the cab again, I being outside; and at Barbican I left them, and did not see them any more, and do not know where they went to."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). The way in which the two other pri<lb></lb>soners acted with me was as follows: Clarkson was employed as an agent; he was asked if he could dispose of the goods; he said that he could, and took them away, not knowing how they were come by; he proceeded to the Dover Road, where he could not get sufficient, and a message was sent to me to that effect, and, through the messenger, I sent him a message not to dis<lb></lb>pose of them; I then accompanied him to the Minories; I do not know the name of the person we saw there, but the Inspector knows; he refused to purchase them, saying that they were of no use; it was by me and another person that he was instructed to dispose of them; I was present when he re<lb></lb>ceived his instructions, and joined therein; I became acquainted with Clarkson just before 24th Nov.; he was living at the Bolt-in-Tun, Fleet Street; neither he or I had any private room in that establishment for our exclusive use; I know nothing of Griffiths, except his being a customer at the house, and saying "Good morning," and so on, and he was occasionally employed to carry their parcels; I know that they were both paid, and I am positive that Griffiths received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his day's work in carrying the parcels about; I went with Clarkson to pawn the damask at Mr. Lawless; the money was given to him, and the goods pledged by him; there was no reason why I did not pledge them, but virtually they were in his possession; he took them away in the morning, and that was the reason of his pledging them; I be<lb></lb>lieve the whole of the money was handed to me shortly after we left Lawley's;</p>

               <p>neither Clarkson nor Griffiths had anything to do in conjunction with me in obtaining these goods from Messrs. Shoolbreds.</p>

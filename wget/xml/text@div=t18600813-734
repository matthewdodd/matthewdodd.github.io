I cried out, "Yes, come on"—I said, "Won't you come below?" meaning the place he had appointed to meet—he said, "No, give it me here;" I said, "Very well"—I took out the pocket-book, and had the parcel in my hand ready to give to him, and a gentleman came up and laid hold of me—the prisoner was then taken into custody.</p>

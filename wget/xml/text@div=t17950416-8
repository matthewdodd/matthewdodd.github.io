               <p>Prisoner Russell. The Sunday evening before this happened, this man and me went into the public house to get a pint of beer, and we were drinking the pint of of beer, and this man came in, and one of the company drank to this man, and he drank to him, and he sat down, and the Sunday night before this old man Murphy, and he had some dispute; and they began to jaw one another about it, and this Callaghan took hold of Murphy by his breast, and pulled out the table and struck him, and they were parted first then after that, and he was going home along with one of the men, and his brother, Callaghan's brother, met him just at the door, and he told him how he was disputing, and said he had been robbed, and his brother made him turn back again and strike this old man; and when I see him going to strike the old man, I entreated him, and then he struck me, and knocked me down, and then we left him there, and we were carried home by the company that was backwards, he said he would stay all night in the public house; and the next day as I was coming home to my dinner from work, he had a constable in his house waiting for me, and he took me just facing his own door, in New Tower-lane, and he led me down to Bow-street, and then he went after Murphy, and then he brought Murphy to me, and then we went and had a hearing, and then we were ordered up for the Thursday following, for the second hearing; and between Thursday he took four guineas from Murphy's wife, in order to make it up, and he kept it till yesterday, when he went for two more, and she could not give it, and he went to day and had the bill found; he was with us yesterday and had some beer from us. There were two watchmen at the same time the now happened, and he never said a word about any money, and I am sure that was his time to cry out in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Were there any watchmen in the house at the time? - No, they came in when they went away.</p>

               <p>Q. What other people were there in the house at the time, besides Murphy and Russell? - Yes, there were two or three other people in the house, the man who keeps the house, one Carol, but the man was not up, he was in bed, but the wife was there.</p>

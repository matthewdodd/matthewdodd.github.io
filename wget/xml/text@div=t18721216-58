                  </hi>. I am an iron merchant and hardware factor, of 203, Upper Thames Street, City—I know the prisoner—on 11th May last he brought me this bill of exchange—he said it was a good commercial bill, drawn, as I understood, upon a customer of his, and he asked me to discount it—I hesitated at first, but I ultimately did it as he pressed me so much, saying that he was a little pressed for money, but in all probability he would pay me before the bill was at maturity—I handed him a cheque for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is my cheque, payable to order, endorsed by him—I subse<lb></lb>quently found that the acceptance was a forgery—it was not paid—he endorsed the bill in my presence—I had had one small transaction pre<lb></lb>viously with the prisoner—I had lent him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he had paid me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not find out that it was a forgery till a day or two after it became due—I did not know Mr. Cox at the time I advanced the money—I never had any business transaction with him—the prisoner told me he was in communication with Messrs. Carritt &amp; Son, solicitors, about some money on a mortgage—that was after the dishonour of the bill—I did not take any proceedings until after the proceedings in bankruptcy against him—I should have done so I admit; I can tell you why I did not—I dare say he filed his petition in November—there was an advertisement of the meeting which I attended on 12th December—I received no notice—I did not prove on this bill—I don't know that it was proved for me—don't know that this bill was included in my proof; I don't think it was—I did not attend to it myself—I handed it over to my solicitor, and told him to do what was necessary under the circumstances—I gave the prisoner into custody the same evening after the meeting at the Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy Courts—Mr. Arnold, the solicitor for the prosecution, may very possibly be the solicitor to the trustee under the bankruptcy—I know that he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> The reason I did not take proceedings till after the bank<lb></lb>auptcy proceedings was this: I thought my first loss would, perhaps, be the least, and although I knew it to be my duty to do it, I hesitated, thinking, perhaps, it might not be a forgery after all, and not liking to press the man on account of his wife and family; but at the meeting of creditors I met a great many larger creditors than myself, and they thought it my duty to do it and to expose it—I had not the least idea it was a forgery till after it became due.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 222, Portobello Road, Notting Hill, and am a furniture broker and dealer, upholsterer, and decorator—in April last I had other places of business, one of them was at 112, Finborough Road, Brompton—I have known the prisoner about four or five year—I had lost sight of him for about four years until about eight months ago—I then met him accidentally at Brompton—the acceptance to this bill is not my writing—I never authorised the prisoner to sign for me in any way—we had no bill transactions together whatever to the best of my belief—the acceptance is the prisoner's writing, and the body of the bill I believe to be his wife's—the acceptance does not at all resemble my handwriting—I always sign either "W. J.," or "William Joseph," and this is "William," and in no case do I sign so—I first learnt that the bill was in circulation when it was</p>

               <p>presented to me, the day it was due—I at once discovered it to be a forgery—I told the man who presented it that I had no bill due at that date—I give bills in my business—I had had no transaction with the prisoner previous to that that I am aware of—I had lent him money at different times and he had lent me money—this is an I O U which I gave him—I borrowed 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him, and before being due I gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—the I O U is my writing—the prisoner was acquainted with my hand<lb></lb>writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should fancy he was well acquainted with my signa<lb></lb>ture—he saw me write this I O U—I had no transaction with him up to March last—I lent him some 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he lent me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one occasion; that was on the 1st of March this year—I was once fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for an excessive distress on a tenant of mine—I was not fined on any other occasion that I am aware of—I believe not; nothing more than for having goods on the pavement—I was summoned to a Police Court—I was never charged on any other occasion with excessive distress—I should suppose the prisoner knew my handwriting—this I O U was given to me in this condition, very dirty, by the prisoner or his wife—I gave it to the prisoner on the 1st of March—if you will read on the back you will see a receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid him the balance very soon after; I don't exactly remember the date—some was paid in goods and some in cash, I believe about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me back the I O U when I gave him the balance—he told me he was engaged in building transactions—I had no other receipt for the balance except the handing back of the I O U—either he or his wife gave it me—I believe both of them were present—I can't say exactly which; it was at his place at West Brompton—I don't recollect the date exactly, about that time—I paid the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 21st March—I can't exactly remember when it was that I paid back the balance; but I believe it was within the time of its being due; from memory within two or three days—it was payable within twenty-one days—that would be on 22nd March—it is dated 1st March—the prisoner has not called on me constantly for weeks, and been paid pound by pound—I paid the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all in a lump at my place in Portobello Road, I believe in gold—there is his wife's signature there acknowledging it on the 21st, and I got the I O U book the same as a bill when I paid the rest, that was all I wanted—I believe the prisoner wrote this at the bottom in my presence—I have seen him about twelve times since he lent me the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know a Mrs. Howell—I knew a Mrs. Burrell, she is dead—no conversation ever took place between me and the prisoner in her presence about accommo<lb></lb>dating him with a loan—I believe he owed me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time the bill was written—we had settled the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan before that—I had lent him money between his giving me back the I O U and the time of this forged bill being drawn—I took no acknowledgment of it—it was about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he came to me for it.</p>

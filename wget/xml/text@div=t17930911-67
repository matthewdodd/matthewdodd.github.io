             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the parish you live in? - In the parish of Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in the parish of St. Botolph without Aldgate? - I don't know. There were four guineas taken out of the box; I saw it in my husband's box, in the one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your lodging room? - Yes. I did not lodge in it, but other lodgers did. The box stood between a lodging bed and the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the box been locked? - Yes. I saw these four guineas the day before I missed them, between eight and nine the next day; there was four guineas, and four shillings worth of halfpence all but a penny, and five shillings and six-pence in silver, a silk handkerchief cost me five shillings and nine-pence, which I did not miss at the time he was before the justice, and my husband's silver watch was taken. I asked this man about them, which I thought there was nobody else to take them but him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the house at the time? - He was. When I asked him the next morning, he denied them, that he knew nothing about them. I said that he must know about them, both he and his wife, and I bolted the door on them to keep them in doors till my husband came in at twelve o'clock, because there was nobody in the house but them, his child and me, and then I whipped out to send somebody for my husband, who was at work at the Rotation office, and when I came back I saw him helping his wife over the wall, out of my yard into Mr. Shoebard's yard, a publican. They took the bolt off the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get out? - They unbolted the door; there are two doors; I went out at the front door and they at the back door. Then he asked me did I see his wife; I said I see him helping her over the wall: he ran out of the street from me; and I ran after him, and cried stop thief! and other people catched him for me, who, I don't know; he delivered some of the money to me, a little after he was catched, at the Crooked Billet, that was where I saw him, because he was in dread, and he said he would give me the money so as I would let him go, he delivered me one guinea and two half guineas in gold, and two shillings and one penny; he had the things released with the rest of the money, and then he went and pawned them again for three half guineas and a half crown, and gave me that. The watch was laid on the chamber window, in the one pair of stairs; when I pursued after him, I did not find the watch on him, it was laid on the chamber window; the watch which was in the box was in the one pair of stairs chamber window, where the box was, that was where I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the handkerchief? - I found the gown piece, which he released himself from pawn; he had a bundle at the Three Crowns, nigh the Mansion House, and my cotton was in that bundle; I heard him say so, that he sent it there; he gave me my gown piece out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110118"></xptr>of that bundle; it was six yards of printed cotton, it cost me half a crown a yard, it is worth fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a woman that used to come to see me that gave me these four guineas.</p>

               <p>There was an irruption in the street, and this man happened to be running, and I took the man in the minories; he was running; I stopped the man, and he told me that he would go along with me; he saw the woman, and on seeing the woman he denied that he had any of her property; in the course of their speaking some time he delivered two guineas to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to deliver her two guineas? - I don't know. Some words happened between them; I went to send for an officer, and one of the neighbours went for an officer, and they would not give the charge to this officer; they went from thence to where the man had his clothes; I went to the place with them, it was not an hundred yards from the Minories, in the City, and out of that bundle of clothes he gave the gown piece belonging to this woman, I saw him; then he declared that he had no more property of her's; he proffered to pawn all his clothes if there was any thing amiss respecting him; then he pawned his clothes, and told the woman he would make her recompence, and a gold ring that did not belong to him, belonging to a cousin or sister; he paid her four guineas all but three shillings and five-pence; and then she owned that was all right except the three shillings and five-pence; Then her husband went for an officer, (the gentleman is present) and took him before a justice, and there the woman swore the watch against him; and the watch was in her husband's possession at the same time, and her husband and herself declared the watch was on the window, in their own house.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Terry. Was the printed cotton in the box? - The printed cotton was pawned at Mrs. Morris's. I lent him the printed cotton to pawn before that, and he would not give me the money, so I asked him for the duplicate, and he took the duplicate out of the box, and released the gown piece from pawn, and had it in his bundle.</p>

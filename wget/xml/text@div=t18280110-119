I never saw Sexley till the 4th of January; we waited till she came in - she lives at the corner of Angel-court, Glass-house-yard: the officer said we had come about some property which I had lost; she keeps a lodging-house - she said she knew nothing about them: she opened a chest, and there I found this handkerchief; I said Joyee had stolen it; she said it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100076"></xptr>her husband's - that he died at sea about four years ago, and left it her.

On the 4th of January I met Joyce on Tower-hill, and asked if he would go with me to Sheldrake's; he said he would - he came as far as Houndsditch, and then said if I would go to his lodging in Blue Anchor-yard we could take the things; I said, "No, I will go to Sheldrake's:" I took him to Neal's, where Sheldrake works, and then we sent for an officer; we then went to Sexley's, and found the handkerchief in a chest, with twenty-seven duplicates: he had these boots on when I took him.</p>

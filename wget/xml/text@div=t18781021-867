I carry on business at 157, Fenchurch Street—on 14th June, 1877, 1 handed to Mr. Coombes, my agent, these two warrants; they are endorsed by me deliverable to Henry Layland or order for 450 and 45 barrels of resin lying at Mellish's Wharf—I drew this bill on Layland for 899<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at two months from 12th June, which came back accepted by Henry Layland—I don't know his writing, it purports to be for resin, <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Rhine from New York—when the bill fell due the defendant had gone into liquidation—up to that time I had not heard of Charles Devereux Robinson—I have proved for that amount in the defendants liquidation—I have not received any dividend at present.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I conducted the transaction entirely through Mr. Coombes, I believe he was offering the resin to Layland in February, 1877, and I think at a higher price, it is an article that varies in price like other things—I am not prosecuting in this matter, I declined to do so, the great majority of the creditors and of the committee of inspection are of my mind; they wished the estate wound up for the benefit of the creditors, the trustee does not join in the prosecution; it is chiefly, almost entirely, Mr. Kauffman and Mr. Roberts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

               <p>—out of the money I received for the resin I paid altogether about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the prisoner's account, exculsive of some money that I had paid to get rid of an execution—I drew cheques for it—the last part of the money was paid to Mr. Wright, the Sheriff's officer, about the 11th July—a day or two after I had given the prisoner the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said in order to make the matter look like a business transaction I must give him accommodation bills for the amount of the resin, to pass through his books, and he sent his clerk out for two blank forms, and he drew the bills out to make up the amount—he had previously made an invoice of the resin to me, to make it appear as if Robinbson and Co. had actually bought the resin—he drew out the invoice to the amount of 882<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I put a receipt stamp upon it—no correspondence had passed between us in reference to the resin, but he asked me to write out two or three emorandums, purporting to come from Robinson and Co., asking his price for the resin—I did that, and the papers were put into his pigeon-holes—a day or two after I had given him the bills he told me that he had been served with a writ that day—he showed it to me and said he was about stopping payment—the writ was for an amount of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on some action that had been brought against him by some company—he explained the matter to me at the time, but I forget it now—I got rather afraid that they might come down upon me, especially being a bankrupt—he laughed at the idea, and said "You have nothing to be afraid of, you will hear nothing about it; I will invent some means to make matters very pleasant to both of us"—I bothered him a good deal about it at the time, and he told me of a plan which he had of meeting the bills—he said "I have given the bills to my trustees, and have told them they are first-class assets; first of all you must take larger offices." and eventually I took some on the second floor of Gresham House—the person who lets the rooms resides on the ground floor—I agreed to buy the furniture for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Layland was present at the interview with Holmes, the clerk—he advised me what to pay for the furniture and all that—I bought the furniture from the first and second floor—Layland said as he had not got offices, he would give me samples of goods from places, and there were a lot of boxes which he told me to put round the room to make it look as if it was an old firm, and he gave me a lot of calicoes from his own office, which were put about the private room—on the same or the next day he said he would introduce me to people who would introduce me to merchants, and he did introduce me to serveral gentleman—he said "I will tell you the people to whom to apply for goods, give you specification of the class of goods to buy for the different markets, and how to write the different description of the goods, how to order them, and that he would let Mr. Lusk, his buyer or his clerk, go and buy goods in the country—I told him I had better give him some money to go into the country with—I first gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other money afterwards—he had another cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., after that—the goods that Mr. Lusk bought were to come up to London to me, and Layland said he knew how to get the money to pay the accommodation bills, for Robinson and Co., would pay those bills, and no reference would be wanted, because they would see that it was a good firm, having paid all that 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in fact, I was to be Robinson and Co., but he was to be the factotum, and when the liquidation was got through, and he had obtained his discharge, he was to be my clerk—he also mentioned that he would put 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the business—I wrote to a lot of people whose names he gave me—I concluded</p>

I am undergoing my sentence of 18 months in Holloway Prison—I do not appear in my prison dress, but I think it is sufficient disgrace to appear at all; a man may have his feelings—I made a statement before I was convicted, not with a hope of diminishing my sentence; I never said so; my sentence was respited from session to session—I had no hope, but I knew if the Judge knew the whole of the matter it would be of some benefit to me—I do not know how many charges there were against me; I never saw the indictment—I was not charged with the white lead—the case of stealing 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was one which Layland introduced to me—as to the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of paper, they had that back—that was charged, also the 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is all through Layland, and paper to the value of 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 6th November—on the 20th Novembers quantity of wine to the value of 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 30th November wines to the value of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 16th November a quantity of spades, shovels, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>; the spades were in Jackson's case—I did not say that I was innocent—I was taken into custody on the 30th November—I do not remember the amount of goods that I was charged with obtaining during September, October, and November—Layland did not wish his name to appear in the resin transaction; I do not know the reason—my impression was that he was a money<lb></lb>lender; I did not know for certain that he shipped goods to Australia and India; I did not know the nature of his business—I must have known that he shipped goods because he shipped some for me once—in the white lead transaction he appeared to be raising money for Robinson; he was acting for Robinson and Co., and there his name would appear as a</p>

Layland would not know that I had a cheque from Wilson and Co., unless he looked at my book, or I had told him—it was Bouquet who introduced me to Layland to get an advance—he was on very intimate terms with Layland, but he was not very friendly with me—I cannot say what Bouquet got out of the transaction—he was always having money, and he had apartments in my house and never paid me—as fast as I got money he came to know of it somehow—I was like a spider sucked all round—Miller and Co. wrote to me first of all saying that my first bill had been returned—I was away at the time and Layland went up to the office and inquired of Jackson whether the first bill would be paid—in consequence of most of those goods that Layland was buying at Manchester not coming up on account of the reference of Kohinson and Co. not being satisfactory, people would not send up their goods, and the bill of course was returned, and Miller and Co. wrote to Robinson and Co. the same night, saying that the bill had been returned and that they wanted to. see me, and I went to see them with Layland, Layland fetched me—the object of going was to tide over this time and for the purpose of making some arrangement about the bill—Layland said that I was to say that I was in a good position, and if they would allow me a certain time the bills would be met, and I promised to pay them a certain sum of money—the white lead was got and Layland got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not bring it back to me—he got the cheque cashed in some manner or other and paid the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Miller and Co.—Layland sent me the account Which shows it—this is the account (dated 2nd Nov., 1877)—it was sent to my office—Layland kept 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. discount on his own acceptance and charged a further 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his com<lb></lb>mission and liability—the account shows it—I only say it to show you that I of the 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I take it for granted Layland knew all this as well as I—if the articles were not good for the Indian market we should not have advanced money upon them—we refused several parcels of goods on the ground of their unfitness—we shipped the 46 casks of resin for Layland, not for Robinson and Co.—I have seen some of Mears's letters to Layland con<lb></lb>taining remonstrances with regard to overdrafts and goods sent contrary to directions—I do not remember the complaint as to leather—that was a fairish account—I remember some, thick leather going out—there was then a prospect of a war with Russia which would have caused a demand for it for saddles.</p>

I have known instances where goods have been con<lb></lb>demned by the Indian consignees, and where they were subsequently bought and sent out, but I have known also when, Mears's judgment having been incorrect, goods have realised a greater profit when goods have fallen here, and in the face of advice they have made a profit—Layland did not act against Mears's advice, but we had no check upon him, for if he did not like to send them through us he had plenty of others to send them through.</p>

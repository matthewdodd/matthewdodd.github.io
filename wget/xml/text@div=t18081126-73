In consequence of information I examined the gutters of the five houses, and found the lead cut away from the two sides of the gutter, about fifty pounds weight from one house; it had the appearance of being fresh cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. Yes, they were both my workmen.</p>
               <p>Q. When the lead was missing, did you say any thing to these men about it - A. I said little, till I saw the evidence which I thought was sufficient, then did, his name is Charles Gates, he was a workman of mine; I then got an officer and had them apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you employed to do any repairs to Mr. Hill's house - A. Yes; the two prisoners were employed with me, and two labourers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any lead taken away - A. Yes, it was cut with a knife from under the tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. Who cut it - A. I cannot say who cut it most; they were all concerned in it except the two labourers, they knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much lead did you take in all - A. I cannot say; I suppose it was taken from five, if not six houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you got as much as fifty pounds weight of it - A. Yes. The lead was sold to an old iron shop, for three halfpence a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received the money for it - A. Sometimes one and sometimes another; it was all spent in beer and gin.</p>
               <p>Q. You shared in the gin and beer it produced - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the discovery first - A. No; when Mr. Cummings came to our house I told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not the honesty to tell your employer of it till he came about it - A. No.</p>

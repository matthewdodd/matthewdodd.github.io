On the 12th of May, I heard her husband go out in the morning; I heard nothing uncomfortable between them. I have the parlour and shop, and they have the one pair - I could hear all that passed in their room. I saw the prisoner about a quarter before eleven o'clock; she rapped loudly at my room door; I opened it, and saw her in a kind of frantic manner; she repeated many times,</p>
               <p>"I have done it! I have done it! Send for an officer; I want to be hung; I must be hung; I have done it to be hung;" I said</p>
               <p>"What have you done?" she said,</p>
               <p>"I have killed my child, I have cut its head off." Seeing her in that frantic state, and throwing herself about, and pulling her clothes about in a wild manner, and foaming at the mouth (froth came out of her mouth) I said,</p>
               <p>"Poor thing you are agitated, I will send for a doctor;" she repeated</p>
               <p>"Send for an officer," and shewed me her hands, which were all bloody, and she kept licking the blood off, saying,</p>
               <p>"Send for an officer." She asked for a cloth to wipe the blood off her hands. Her manner was wild all this time; she was stamping. I gave her a dry cloth; she looked about as if looking for water, and forced by me into my room - she then took the lid off a saucepan, which was on the fire, and then wiped her hands with the cloth; the steam of the water was then ascending over her head. I immediately went into the room, and she said,</p>
               <p>"Send for an officer; now the blood is off me, take me - hang me;" she was still throwing herself about, and pulling he clothes, and stamping - she looked so wild that I was afraid of her. I ran out of the room, and she followed me, and called for an officer again. When I went to the front door, Cranch the officer was there - she kept calling in the same wild manner, saying,</p>
               <p>"Take me away, and hang me;" she said to the officer,</p>
               <p>"I have done it, take me away." When the officer laid hold of her arm, she said,</p>
               <p>"I don't run away, I did it to be taken." She was taken away in about five minutes. She was a kind, and good mother to all her family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you the least doubt of her being insane at the time - A. I am positive she must be insane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed that she was fond of that child - A. She was kind to them all; it was rather a delicate child - she suckled it at this time. I had thought for five or six weeks before, that she seemed to walk in a low, desponding state. She went to a place of worship every Sunday, and was rather of a religious turn - she was sober; she appeared deranged. Nothing occurred to put her out of humour that morning - if there had been words in her family, I must have heard it. She had been attempting to wean the child for three weeks - it often happens that at that time women have a milk fever. She said she had taught it to eat a little, but still gave it the breast at times. I had advised her to wean it as she looked poorly, and about a fortnight before she said it was such a delicate thing she could not bear to wean it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she suffered it to prey on her strength rather than hurt the child's health - A. Yes. She spoke very affectionately. Giving the milk now and then would cause the milk to flow into the breast, and keep it fuller than if she suckled it entirely. The fever would be more or less violent according to the quantity of milk - I told her I thought she was hurting herself, by suckling it; she said it was such a delicate little creature, she could not go on with weaning it.</p>

            . I am a special constable of Bethnal-green. I was sent for, and got to the house about eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of a man in the passage - the man said,</p>
               <p>"I want an officer;" I said</p>
               <p>"I am one" - he said</p>
               <p>"Then I give you charge of this woman, she has committed Murder!" she said,</p>
               <p>"I have done it! I have committed wilful Murder!" Dudley came in in the interval, and I gave her in his charge. I went up stairs to the two pair, which was a weaver's loom-room, and at the top of the stairs I saw a child laying with its head severed from its body; the head laid about a foot from the body; and several streams of blood had flown from the body; a razor laid in one of the streams, which I produce - I immediately returned to the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"You must go to the watch-house;" I took her there, and at the watch-house; I asked the cause of her committing so rash an act - she said she had been very uncomfortable in her mind for a long time; that she had received the good things of the Lord, but had lost them - that she had attempted to hang herself three weeks ago, but she could not. I asked if she had attempted to kill her child three weeks ago; she said she had thought of it, and attempted to hang herself that morning to the loom beam. I asked why she committed this act on the youngest in particular; she said she took the youngest because she could do it the easiest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not obliged to put her on a strait-waistcoat that night or next morning - A. Next morning, she was quite outrageous - she had much more strength than I should have expected from a woman of her appearance.</p>

            . I live opposite the prisoner. I got to the house about a quarter to eleven o'clock, and saw her in the passage. Some people were with her - I was flurried, and did not take particular notice. She said</p>
               <p>"I have cut my child's head off;" she caught hold of my coat, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't you go up, I have cut it right off, and don't you go up," still holding me - I rushed from her, and ran up stairs, and saw the body about a quarter of a yard from stairs. I came down and she was in custody. Before I went up she said,</p>

               <p>"I have done it!" her eyes were continually rolling about. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Mountford what have you done!" she said,</p>
               <p>"I have done it and want to be taken;" she repeated this over and over again, in a very wild manner; quite different to what I had seen her before. I went to her at the watch-house afterwards, she then looked very wild; this was between three and four o'clock. Her father-in-law, two of her brothers-in-law, and her sister-in-law were with her; I took her hand, and said.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Mountford, how came you to commit this rash act on your child;" she said,</p>
               <p>"I want to be hung." Her hands and eyes kept moving about; she said,</p>
               <p>"I want to be hung, for I am tired of my life." She spoke in an agitated way, and repeated it once or twice. I asked if she would not sooner go home to her family than be hung; she said,</p>
               <p>"No." I asked if she had any particular dislike to that child than to any of the others; she said,</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have no doubt of her derangement - A. I am positive she could not be in her right mind; she was a kind and humane mother as ever lived, and has nine children now. I believe every sense of recollection had left her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed her conduct to that child - No, she was kind to all; she was of a religious turn for the last ten years; she has been in the habit of going to Meeting; and, I believe, religion and her heavy family have caused this.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother; when she was about ten years old an accident happened to me, and in consequence of her seeing me she went out of her mind, and was deranged for nearly a month. My mother was deranged in her younger days, and in the latter part of her life, at different intervals. I met the prisoner in the street about eight months ago, and had not seen her since, till she was at the watch-house. When I met her she said she was very well; I saw her twisting and looking back in a deranged manner, I asked what was the matter, she said, she was very poorly and did not know where she was going; it struck me that she was a little deranged.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn fields - I attended the prisoner two years and a half ago for a bodily disorder; I perceived her to be a woman of melancholy temper. She had symptoms which indicate a predisposition to insanity, it was a species of insanity which is at times hereditary in families, it is very susceptible to break out at particular intervals. I have known an attempt to wean a child and not accomplishing it, produce insanity; if it was lurking in the habit it would be more likely to break out at that time. When I attended her in 1819, she repeatedly made use of the words,</p>
               <p>"I have no peace at all," and in notes which I have of her case, those words repeatedly occur. I was not at all surprised when I heard she was the subject of insanity. At the time of weaning, the breast remains extremely full of milk, which always produces a degree of irritation. I believe she was an affectionate wife, and had correct parental feelings.</p>

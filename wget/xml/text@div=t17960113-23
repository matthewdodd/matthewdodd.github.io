               <p>Q. At that building? - A. He had worked at that building, but my master had sent him to a different job, at a different part of the town; we let our master know, and we heard that he was in the town of Hampstead; he came out of Hertfordshire, and we thought he was gone that way towards home. I, and another, went all over Highgate; we heard that two of our partners were gone to London; we sat down very contentedly and had some dinner, then we went to London, and found him; he was taken up and carried to Bow-street; the Justice granted me the saw; it was found at Mr. Dobson's, in Chiswell-street; the rabbit-plane was given to me from the tools that he had taken and carried to a person's house; my partners fetched them, and gave them me; they are not here.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter; I worked at Hampstead at Mr. Collins's; I lost a sash-saw, and a smoothing-place, on Tuesday the 1st of December; I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130040"></xptr>the sash-saw at Mr. Dobree's shop, and the plane, and some other things, at a woman's house that he cohabited with; the prisoner acknowledged every thing before Mr. Justice Addington.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - A. I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Couthbertson. This is my saw: I never saw any of the same man's making before; and it happened to fall off my bench and broke a piece off the handle, and I know it by that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. These men took all those things out of pawn, and worked them, and brought them back again, and swore they were the same tools; and they swore I was the man that took them.</p>

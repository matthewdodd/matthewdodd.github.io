            . I am the mother of the child. On the 13th of January I was at home, and she and her sister went down stairs, between five and six o'clock - they then had bonnets on, which were nearly new; they were playing for some time in the passage, when I missed them by not hearing them talk - I thought they were gone into the shop, but soon after the eldest, who is about eight years old, came up crying, and saying the woman had taken Caroline away; I missed her for about two hours, and was very much distressed - I then received a message, and went to Lancaster-court, New Bond-street, where I found the child, but she had neither bonnet nor boots on; I know nothing of the prisoner - I never saw her till she was apprehended on suspicion of taking the child; I have found the bonnet, at Mrs. Lomax's shop, in Monmouth-street.</p>

I believe, on the 13th of January, and asked if I would buy two bonnets - I asked what she wanted, she said 6d. for one, and 4d. for the other; I said I would give her 6d. for one, but I could only give her 3d. for this one - she left them, and afterwards she came with another, which she sold me for 4d.; the Policeman came, and asked if I had bought such a bonnet - I said I had, and took it down from the nail; the prisoner is the woman I bought it of - she had a very black eye when she came to me, and so she had at the office.</p>

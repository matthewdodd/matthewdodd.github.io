                  </hi>. I am managing director of the Florence Sewing Machine Company, 97, Cheapside—I first employed the prisoner in January last—his duties were to receive cash, pay accounts, and keep the books—he usually paid the advertisement accounts as they were presented, and he did on one occasion give an order for an advertisement—I have the books</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170030"></xptr>
               <p>here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the book where we enter our orders for advertise<lb></lb>ments—on 28th March I find an order to the <hi rend="italic">Nonconformist</hi> newspaper—that is in the handwriting of a former book-keeper—here is the book in which the receipts are filed—I find here a receipt for some money for advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Nonconformist</hi>—here is the prisoner's cash-book—after the receipt is filed the amount is carried out in the order book—it is for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is also entered as a payment in the cash-book—they are both in the prisoner's writing—the company is debited with that amount—it would appear by these entries that the prisoner had paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Nonconformist</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the receipt book open to anybody in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is usually kept in the office, in the safe—the book-keeper has charge of the safe, although it is not always locked—Mr. Roberts is the present book-keeper, he is here—no doubt other persons could get to it; I can do so at any time—the receipts may not be filed im<lb></lb>mediately they are given, it would depend upon how prompt the book-keeper was in his duties—the prisoner was book-keeper at this time—considerable amounts passed through his hands, perhaps 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—that would be made up of several items, usually of sums not less than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he would also have to pay out the expenditure of the week; that would be, perhaps, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—it would be his duty to pay the balance into the bank, or hand it to me—all cheques were paid into the bank, and sometimes cash—when I wanted cash I asked him for it, and he entered it in the cash-book, and I initialed it, and what was not required he paid into the bank—I think the whole of this cash-book is in his handwriting—I cannot tell by looking at the cash-book whether the entries were made on the day on which they purport to be entered; they should be made the same day as the money is received—these are not copies from any other books, they are original entries—these entries, on the 28th, may have been made at different times, or he may have put his pen into a different inkstand—I am not in the habit of examining the cash-book every day—I don't think it is balanced every day—there might be two or three days elapse without any entries being made in the cash-book, if there were no receipts, or if the book-keeper did not do his duty—the prisoner's duties did not take him out a good deal—I never knew him go out for orders, although he may have done—his duties were to remain in the office, receive moneys, and pay out—he went to the bank—if money was paid during his absence it was handed over to him on his return—I or Mr. Martin, my salesman, might attend to his duties during his absence, or the females in attendance might; if they sold a dozen needles they would receive the money—I don't know that they have ever received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Martin would usually be in attendance—money has often been received in the prisoner's absence—I could not say what sums—in his absence Mr. Martin might pay on account, or I might—I don't know that any one else would—I think no one has ever made a payment for adver<lb></lb>tisements except the prisoner and myself—I have made most of them, usually when he was present—I usually gave cheques for them—it would be his duty invariably to make the entry in the cash-book—any pay<lb></lb>ing money would probably report it to him and hand him over the vouchers—that is supposing everything done correctly—he would put the voucher in the book, which we call filing it, and from that he would make the entry in the cash-book—I cannot tell by looking at the order book what sum was due to the <hi rend="italic">Nonconformist</hi> on 28th April, because I cannot tell</p>

               <p>how many times they inserted the advertisement—I have no other way of finding out than getting the file of papers and ascertaining how many times the advertisement appeared—I am not able to say that less than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due; that may have been due, for aught I know—the figures carried out in the order book are the prisoner's—the next figures, " July 24th, paid balance of account, " I should think are Mr. Roberts's, the present book-keeper—the prisoner was then in custody.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

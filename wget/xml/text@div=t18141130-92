            . Q. Did you on the 26th of November, see the prisoner - A. I was coming past the chandler's shop; I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with a loaf under each arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner, did you see his face - A. He was dressed as the prisoner is; they were two quartern loaves. I looked through the window; I went in, and asked Mr. Roberts if he had sold two loaves to a sailor; he said no. When I looked in the window, I saw nobody in the shop; I went and gave the information. I saw the prisoner again at Hatton Garden office; I knew him to be the same man, only by his clothes, he was of the size, height, figure and shape, I can swear to the clothes, not to the man; they were the same clothes he has on now.</p>

               <p>Q. to Roberts Q. You pursued after the man, and lost him - A. He went to Mrs. Gibbon's shop to sell the bread.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gibbons. I keep a chandler's shop directly opposite of Mr. Roberts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 26th of November, see the prisoner - A. Yes, he came to my door between five and six.</p>
               <p>Roberts. That is the time I got my information.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gibbons. The prisoner asked me if I would buy the two loaves of him; I asked him how he came by them; he said, a gentleman had given them him, he asked ten-pence for them. I said I would buy them, but I thought he had stolen them. Mr. Roberts came over to me. The man owned that he had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Roberts. Are you able to swear to bread - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I leave myself to your mercy, and the gentlemen of the jury.</p>

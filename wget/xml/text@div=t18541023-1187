                  </hi>. On the 15th Oct. I was in the London-road, I think it was about 10 o'clock, and saw three men standing at the corner of the London-road—I passed by; they followed me—the prisoner was one—I passed on; they followed me—I saw the prisoner at my back again as one passed by—two or three had turned round—I felt a blow at my chest, and at the same time my watch went from me—the prisoner was not a yard from me when I felt the blow on my chest—I fell to the ground—the other two ran to the Elephant and Castle; the prisoner ran to the London-road—I felt the watch dragged from me; it was secured with a guard round my neck—I believe the guard is broken—upon getting up, I saw the man that struck me, going along the London-road—the prisoner is the man that struck me—he was running—I got up, ran after him, and sang out, "Stop thief!"—I saw a policeman catch him—he had escaped from the first—I got near him when he was in the policeman's hands—I said to the first policeman, that the man had knocked me down, and I had lost my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He got away, and was afterwards taken by Seckter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw him stop him, and have no doubt that he was the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How can you swear that the man who struck you was the one that ran over the road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because my eyes were on him all the time—I was not rolled over; I was on my side—I had my eyes on him; I did not keep my eyes on the other men as well—that was the man that struck me; he was the man that came in front, and I felt the blow in the chest—that man struck me—it was not likely a man behind me would strike me in the chest—he did it—I fell on my side directly I was struck—it frightened me so much that I wanted to get the man that knocked me down, when I felt my watch going from me.</p>

Neale's-place is 1,200 or 1,300 yards from the London-road—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor running—the first time they were twenty or thirty yards: off—the prosecutor was calling out "Stop thief!"—I stopped the prisoner; the prosecutor gave him into custody for stealing his watch—he escaped—it was at night—I was coming on duty; I was putting on my cape with my right hand; that was how he so easily escaped—I have not the least doubt he is the man—I saw him taken by Seckter—when he ran away I pursued him—before he was captured by Seckter, he had gone the length of two</p>

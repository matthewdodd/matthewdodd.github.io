                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, in Red Lion-street, Holborn. On the Thursday evening, before I was before the Magistrate, about half-past five o'clock, I sent a coal-wagon from the Royal George Wharf to my house, and also to Queen-square Church—I saw the first twenty sacks weighed—there I marked with chalk, and sixteen more were put into the tail of the wagon—those were not marked—Tribe was the driver—the wharf-clerk directed him in my presence, and gave him a ticket for twenty sacks, to deliver a the church, leaving sixteen to be left at my shed, in Red Lion-street—I went there, found the wagon at my door, and Tribe de<lb></lb>livering the sixteen sacks, and Beddle assisting him—Tribe was the wharf<lb></lb>inger's servant—they left my door to go to the church—on Saturday morning I received information from Craske, and gave Tribe into custody for stealing three sacks of coals—he said he was innocent, and that he delivered them at the church—I gave Beddle and Anthony into custody that night—Anthony keeps a coal-shed in Eagle-street—I charged him with buying three sacks of coal from a wagon about six o'clock, and said that at the price he bought them the men could not have come honestly by them—he said he bought</p>

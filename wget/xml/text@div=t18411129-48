                  </hi>. I am porter in the service of Robert Debenham and William Storr, auctioneers, King-street, Covent-garden, On the afternoon of the 8th of November, I was in the auction-room—I saw the prisoner there first about three o'clock—there was a coat hanging up at the further end of the room—the prisoner was near it—I watched him for an hour—I had occasion to go to the other end of the room, to put out three beds, and as I was coming back in a hurry, to keep watch on him, I saw him come along with the coat doubled up under his arm—I allowed him to go out into the street, then collared him, brought him into the office, and asked him about the coat—he said he had bought it for 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him the number of the lot—he pulled a catalogue out of his pocket, but he could not tell the lot—I said, "You have cut this coat down"—he said he had—I gave him in charge, went back to where the coat had been hanging, and picked up the ticket, and the string the coat was hang<lb></lb>ing by.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where did you first see me with the coat in my posses<lb></lb>ion?</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just by the fire-place, coming out towards the door, I met you; when I collared you, you were some three or four yards from the premises, in the street; you were walking leisurely along; you said at once that you bought the coat—I was about twenty minutes before I came to the station, I could not leave the business before—in the interim I looked round the room, and found we had lost a coat—I had this coat in my hand before I went to put out the beds—I suspected you, and went round the room to see if all the coats were safe—as soon as you were in custody, I went direct to the coat I suspected you were after, and found the ticket and string on the ground—the coat is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sale clerk to Debenham and Storr—this coat was lot 41—the prisoner did not purchase or pay for it—it was sold to a person named Poseley for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., previous to the prisoner taking it—a deposit had been paid for it—we were answerable for it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I came by the coat honestly—the second witness says a number of dealers frequent the room—I bought the coat of one of them—Wix said I carried the coat openly under my arm without any attempt at concealment, and stood near the person who had charge of the room—if I had stolen it, I should have avoided them, and I had time to make my escape, but walked quietly and leisurely along—the dealer I bought it of was an utter stranger to me, and I am unable to produce him to substantiate the truth of what I am now saying.</p>

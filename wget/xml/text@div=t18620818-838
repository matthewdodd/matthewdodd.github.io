On 10th July, about a quarter to 3 in the morning, I was on duty in Langham-place, and saw the prisoner go to 2, Dudley-street, and try the door there; he then went to 12, Charlotte-street, opened the door there with a key, and put his hand inside—he then pulled the door fast—he was disturbed by two dogs, and left, and went to No. 10—I did not hear the dogs—I afterwards took him in custody, and, took him to the station-house where I searched him, and found these eight keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and a knife, two boxes of silent matches, a large black bag round his waist, and a pair of gutta percha goloshes—I have gone to No. 12 with the keys and found that this one will open the door there—a person with these goloshes on can walk without making any noise.</p>

I live at 12, charlotte-street, Marylebone, and am a plumber—I remember the policeman coming there on 10th July with some keys—I have a rough terrier dog in my house—it was sleeping in the passage, outside the back parlour door—it could come to the door directly, if it was opened—I did not hear it bark that night; it was, not in the habit of barking—I closed my door on the night of the 9th—I never saw the prisoner at all until he was at the police-court—he had no business at my house—I had closed my door that night before I went to bed—I do so every night—mine is a Bramah lock—there is a bolt on the inside; but the door was left on the latch that night for one of my lodgers to come in; that was why the dog was there—there is also a chain, but it was not up.</p>

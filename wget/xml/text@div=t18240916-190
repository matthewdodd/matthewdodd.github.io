            . I live with Mrs. Douce, at Colneyhatch. I saw this gelding safe in the field on a Thursday night: I do not know the day of the month. I saw it at Smithfield four or five weeks after. I know it to be the same.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MARTIN. I am an officer. On the 20th of August, in the afternoon, I was in Smithfield-market about half past five o'clock, and was informed a man was offering a horse for sale, for less than half its value. I turned round, and saw the prisoner with a horse-dealer, and heard the horse-dealer say,</p>
               <p>"I will give you all the money you ask for the horse, if you will go with me to the book, and bring some person who knows you." He then said, that a young man lived close by, who knew him, and he would fetch him. He was asked where he got the horse, and said his master sent him to sell it; that his master was

            , Esq. of Islington hall, Hoston. I asked him where Hoston was; he said it was out at the West End of the Town. I said I should take it into my possession, as I thought it was stolen. He then went to fetch the person who knew him. Marchant, my brother officer, watched him. I met him and Marchant in St. John-street, about half-past eight o'clock, and he still gave the same account. I offered to go Islington-hall: but he said nobody knew him there. I locked him up. He was remanded to give him an opportunity of writing to his master, and at the next examination, he said a man, who he had met in the street, was to give him half-a-guinea to sell it. It was advertised, and owned on the 3d of September by Hart.</p>

            . I am an officer. I followed the prisoner. He went into the Ram and put on a long blue coat; he came out, and the hostler collared him in the pig-market, and demanded 1 s. I told him to let him go, and followed him to the Angel public-house at Islington. I then asked him where he was going; he said to Mr. Wilson's, a little farther on. I followed him to Highburybarn. I enquired, and found Mr. Wilson lived there. I rang the bell, and told him to ask what he liked, and instead of asking for Mr. Wilson, he asked for a servant who did not live there.</p>

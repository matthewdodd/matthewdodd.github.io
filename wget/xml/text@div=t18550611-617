                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a confectioner at No. 103, Holborn-hill—I have known the prisoner for eight years—he was in partnership with me four years ago—the first partnership was dissolved in 1851—the second partnership was dissolved in April this year—there was some dispute about the young man in the employment—I paid the prisoner sixty odd sovereigns at the dissolution, and everything was settled on both sides—after that, for about a month, the prisoner continued to come to my shop, and gave me good day as a friend—on Friday, 25th May, I received a package by post, about 12 o'clock in the day—my nephew opened it in my presence; it contained about four ounces of powder and twelve phosphorus matches, six at each side of the box; they were on some sand paper, and were attached to a piece of ribbon, which protruded from each side of the box—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took it from the postman, and examined it—the inscription was "Ferrario"—there were two addresses—inside was "Joseph Ferrario"—at the time I received it, my nephew was out, and</p>

               <p>when he came home I delivered it to him, because it was directed to him—I believe this to be the prisoner's writing—the writing inside is on a piece of leather; it is "Signor Giuseppe Ferrario;" I believe that to be the same handwriting—during nine months of the partnership, I used to see the prisoner's writing every week—the matches were upon the sand paper—if they had ignited, it would have communicated with the powder.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 28th May—I told him he was charged with sending this packet—he said he was innocent, and he would go along with me anywhere—I searched him, but found nothing that had reference to this matter—I went to his house next morning, and on the mantel shelf I found three or four matches corresponding with those in the case; they are common matches—in an earthenware pan in the room I found this brad awl, which just corresponds with two holes in the lid of the case.</p>

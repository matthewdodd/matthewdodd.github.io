               <p>TIMOTHY CANNON. I lodge in Henry-street, Hampstead-road. On the 3rd of March, I went to the Admiral Nagle public-house, in Bainbridge-street, St. Giles' - I went out, and the prisoner followed me; I sat down, and fell asleep - I had felt my watch safe before I went to sleep; the prisoner had been about me at that time, and no other person - when I awoke my pocket was cut off, and my watch gone.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HUSON (Police-constable E 94). On the 3rd of March, I saw the prisoner in a public-house, nearly asleep - I took him; in going along he put his hand into his pocket - I took hold of his hand and found the watch in it; he said the prosecutor gave it to him.</p>

             (Police-constable E 24). The prisoner's mother came to see him at the station - he told her he had the watch from a person who took it from the prosecutor, and then he said the prosecutor gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the watch to mind.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY CANNON. This is my watch - I did not give it to him; I found the fob, which had been cut off, in my coat pocket - the seal and key have been cut off the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a long written Defence, stating that the prosecutor, who was intoxicated, had met him at a public-house; that they went to several other houses, when he finally gave him his watch to take care of, stating that a girl had stolen it from him that night.</p>

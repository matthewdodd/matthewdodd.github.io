I went after the prisoner, and found her in a quarter of an hour, at the top of Windfield-street, I took her to the watch-house, and in the way, she was rather obstinate, I laid hold of her left arm, and saw her put her right hand into her breast; as she pulled it out, I heard something fall, and picked up the watch; when I got to the watch-house I found the case was gone; my brother watchman brought it in; the prosecutor was sober; it must have dropped from her.</p>

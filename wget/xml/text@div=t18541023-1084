I was cashier in part of July—I resumed my situation on 10th July, having been absent for a fortnight for a holiday—sums received on 8th July would not be paid to me, but to Mr. M'Burney, whose duty it was, assisted by Mr. Grant, to receive money in my absence—the course of business is for the ledger keeper to make out six lists from the ledger, for collection, of the customers' names and amounts, which were distributed among the clerks on Friday nights, for collection on Saturdays—the prisoner was ledger keeper in July—he took one list himself, and if he received money it was his duty to hand me on Saturday the cash he received—I have not received either of these three sums—I was not there on 24th June—I was not there at the time the money wag received from Phillips.</p>

Phillips, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," which ought to be in the prisoner's collecting list, No. 6; but it does not appear there—if he received the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Mr. Phillips's, it was his duty to pay it over on that Saturday—its not appearing in the list, would prevent the cashier from requiring the money of the prisoner; the cashier would not call upon him for any amounts which were not in the list—this is Phillips's receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is in the prisoner's writing, and is for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 24th June—11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is run through' in the ledger.</p>

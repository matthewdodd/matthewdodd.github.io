I live at Tring station, Oldbury, and keep the Royal Hotel—on Sunday night, August 6th, I went to bed about 10 o'clock or soon after—I went round and saw the windows and doors fast—I was roused at about 1 o'clock in the morning by the bell ringing—I went downstairs and opened the door—on going into the bar I found the window open—we let in the police—then I looked round and saw the till was broken open and the money gone—the till is a drawer, but there being a slab on the top of it it was with some difficulty a chisel could be got under to break it open; it had been forced in three or four places—I saw the marks—there were some plants in the window, one had been moved sufficient to pass between them; that was the bar window—there is another window; he had thrown that open, and that is where he went through into the passage; it was an inner window into the passage and passed into the waiter's room—the bottom side went very hard, the drop down was about 8 feet—I saw how the till had been broken, there were marks—I missed nothing else but money—there was some bread and cheese about and I found a portion had been broken off and tied in a handkerchief—the constable was admitted; the waiter opened the door, he did not go out—I sent to Tring for other police—Sergeant Aldridge pointed out the footmarks—I had not seen the prisoner on my premises before—I saw him on 16th July on a Sunday afternoon lying on my form—I saw this chisel found by the policeman, he showed it me directly he picked it up—I saw it applied to the marks on the till drawer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable, at Oldbury—on the day of the robbery, I was in the station yard about 12.40—the station adjoins the Royal Hotel—I heard a noise in the house as if someone were wrenching open a drawer—I walked round the house until.I found the bar window open on the opposite side—I listened for a moment, and I could hear glasses moved inside, and someone walking about the room—I then con<lb></lb>cealed myself near the open window, expecting to see someone come out—I heard a window open on the opposite side—I ran round in that direction—I heard someone drop from the window to the ground—I saw a man cross the garden—he ran a few yards to the left, and then he took a circle to the right, back into a path leading down the garden to the meadow, and ran towards the canal—the garden gate and an iron fence were between the garden and the meadow, he got through the gate and over the fence—the nearest I got to him was about 18 yards—I was about that distance from the window when I heard someone drop from it—I had a garden fence to spring over, and in doing so I ran an iron spike through my hand, that prevented me from getting to him as soon as I should have done——I followed him across the meadow, and saw he took the canal—there is a footpath, and the meadow leads to the towing path, which goes towards Watford and London—when I found he was gaining ground so fast, I turned back to the house and roused Mr. Brown—I saw the state of the till—it had been broken open and was empty—I went to the inspector and informed him of the robbery—I did not go with Aldridge till after I had been to Bourne End—I went to the spot where the chisel was found—it was about 2 yards from the window—I did not see it found—the man was dressed in light jacket and trowsers, and low black hat—he was about 5 feet 7 inches or 7 1/2 inches in height—I did not see his face.</p>

I am one of the heads of the county police at Berk<lb></lb>hampstead—on the morning of the 7th August from information I went with the last witness, in a cart, to Bourne Hill, that is 6 1/2 miles from Tring—I left the cart and went on the towing path along the canal towards Berkhampstead—that was at 2.45—I heard footsteps coming—I then stepped behind the hedge until the prisoner came up—I said "Good morning. You are in a hurry "—he said "Yes; I want to catch the early train at Watford to go to Covent Garden Market"—I said "How far have you come?"—" From Berkhampstead," he said—I said "Where did yon—lodge last night"—he said "At Vincent's, the confectioner's"—I said "It must have been Vincent's, in Castle Street, Berkhampstead. Well! you will have to go back along with me to see if it is correct"—he said "Why?"—I said "Because you answer the description of the man I am looking after," and he said "Very well"—he went on a few yards and then said he should not go—I said he would have to go back, and was about to lay hold of him—he said "Oh! if that's what you mean I'll go back "—I took him back to Mr. Vincent's, confectioner, and asked him if he knew anything of him—the prisoner was there—he said "No "—the prisoner said "Yes; you know Carter, of Stone "—" Yes," he said, "I know him, but I don't know you"—I said "Has he lodged here "—Mr. Vincent said "No "—there is a place called Rose Cottage along the canal, going to Vincent's, nearly 2 miles from where I met the prisoner—I saw the prisoner drop something there from his hand—I believed it to be a purse, because I saw it shine and heard money chink—it dropped among some nettles—I said "You have dropped something?"—he said "No, I have not"—I then made a mark with the toe of my shoe on the towing path—I did not leave the prisoner—after going to Vincent's I took him to the police-station—he was searched—I found in his pockets 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a gimlet, and a pocket knife, and a large key with a latchkey attached to it, and two bunches of. keys containing 18 in number; in copper 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I left him at the station and went back to the place where I made the mark, and among the nettles I found the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing two sovereigns and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

Have you given your proper name?"—he said "My name is Tom Brown, from London. That's good enough. It's no use going to the station, I am not known there "—but I did go down—that was all I could ascertain—after he was remanded I asked where his mother lived; whether he had any friends; and after some time he told me where his mother lived, because I had ascertained at the station all about his career, and where his mother lived, not where he lodged.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 37, Little Russell Street;—the prisoner is my husband—we have been married about 12 months—on 20th May I was at home with him—we had a quarrel—he promised to be home by 8 o'clock, but did not appear till nearly 10 o'clock—that was the cause of the quarrel—it lasted about 20 minutes—there was supper on the table—I refused to go to it—he tried to push me towards the table—I did not feel that I had been struck with anything—I felt faint—I felt a knife by the bedside as I was going towards the table—my sister came downstairs—I walked to the prisoner's sister's place—it is not in the same house—I then found that I was bleeding—I was seen by a doctor about an hour afterwards, and the wound was strapped up—I was in the hospital seven weeks—there was a little struggle between us when I felt the knife—we were living together happily—I do not want to press the charge against him at all—I do not believe he meant to hurt me—he said, "I did not mean to do it; I do not know how the knife touched you at all."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 19, Cole Yard, Drury Lane—I remember the prisoner and his wife coming to my place—he is my brother—Mrs. Leach was sitting on the floor—the prisoner was holding her—he said, "I do not know what I have done"—I examined her back—there was a cut on it.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of 20th May I went to Duke Street, Bloomsbury—the prisoner's room was pointed out to me—I found this knife on the bed—there were spots of blood upon it—I saw the prisoner coming out of Smart's Buildings towards Holborn—he began to cry, and said, "I know what you want me for. I cannot account for my hurting my wife"—I took him to the station, me on the way he said he was very sorry; he could not account for it, and asked me several times if she was dying.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of William and Joseph Pitt, brothers, at Lockheaton, in Yorkshire, sewing-machine manufacturers—the prisoner was a customer of ours, and he carried on business for a certain time at 27, Walbrook, London—prior to July he was indebted to our firm 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 7th July, he called at our place of business at Lockheaton—he said he had come down to buy some more machines—I called his attention to the state of the account, and he said, "Well, I have two bills here," producing them, "and I will give them towards the account" this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—it is for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 1st July, 1862, at three months, drawn by E. Braundbeck, 27, Walbrook, London, and accepted by W. Peters and Co., 25, George-street, Commercial-road, London—I accepted that bill and the other in part discharge of our account—we asked him if they were good, and he said, "I will guarantee them as good as the Bank of England"—I then saw him endorse the bills—on the faith of those bills we supplied him with further goods—about a fortnight before the bill reached maturity</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240103"></xptr>
               <p>I again saw the prisoner, at 27, Walbrook—I then asked him more par<lb></lb>ticularly about the address of the parties by whom the bill was accepted—I said, "Where is this address, George-street?"—he said it was in the Com<lb></lb>mercial-road—I asked where this Commercial-road was—he said, "In White<lb></lb>chapel; why do you want to know?"—I said, "I am going down there"—he said if I would wait till the day after, he would go with me—the next day he said he was busy, and made an excuse, and a day or two after that I went down myself—the bill had not become due at that time—I made inquiries—I found George-street, but I could not find No. 25—that number was not in the street—I did not find W. Peter's and Co., nor any one of that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make every inquiry you could? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I am satisfied there were no such persons or any such number—I have not been down since the bill became due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How did you come to the conclusion that it was a forged bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had other bills in my possession, and I compared it with other signatures—it was not from information given to me by the witness Christ<lb></lb>mas—he had not left your employ at the time—previous to the bill coming due we took you by capias to Whitecross-street prison—that was for debt, because you had stated in my presence, and in the presence of other witnesses, that you were going to leave the country—it was not from what Christmas told us, nothing of the kind—I made an affidavit upon the subject; Christ<lb></lb>mas did not—when you paid in these two bills you did not pay any on your own acceptance—we had your acceptance in our possession to a larger amount, 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we got it from Abrahams, the man that you were employed by at the time—we did not know you at the time we took your acceptance; I had merely spoken to you—that bill for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn by J. D. Abra<lb></lb>hams, of Manchester, and accepted by you—Abrahams shortly after that failed, and we said to you, "There is a bill here of your acceptance for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; what about that?"—you said you had never received a farthing value for it, and we believed you, and asked if you would undertake to meet that bill when it became due; if so, we would supply you with the amount for it—the bill was paid, but you had the value in goods—Christmas is in our employ now—he has been with us about three weeks—we have opened a shop in London since you were arrested, in the same line of business as you were—I have never been summoned before a Magistrate—I have been twice before a County-court Judge, and in each case have had the verdict—I decline to answer whether I have been in Wakefield gaol for felony—I will explain it, when we are apprenticed, it is very customary for persons who begin business for themselves, to get patterns, and there is no way of getting them except by buying them; the prosecutor knew I had taken them, and charged me with stealing them—he had been charged with the same offence—I pleaded guilty—I could not deny having taken them, I was advised to plead guilty—I took them away at night, and brought them back the next morning—we have been ten years in business, and nothing has occurred against our characters since then—the witness Wilkinson, who is here, is not in my service.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long ago is it since this matter happened about these patterns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rather better than ten years ago—since that time I have been carrying on business in that neighbourhood in partnership with my three brothers, and that business a very extensive and respectable one—the second bill we received from the prisoner was for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was not paid.</p>

               <p>"If you have no objection I will go with you" - he had given the name of,</p>

We turned up Great Garden-street, and just as we got to No. 13, (I was about half a yard behind him), in an instant he turned round, and threw the bundle of grocery violently in my face, which stunned me, so that I could not see for two or three minutes. When I recovered I found the bundle and my hat on the ground. I looked up, and saw him running about twenty or thirty yards before me; I immediately called Stop thief! and ran after him - he turned down Chicksand-street, and got away. I returned and marked the note - (looks at one) - this is it. I had it with me all the while; I am certain he is the man. I saw him in custody about two months after,</p>

He gave me a 1 l. note. As soon as I saw the signature I perceived it was a bad one. I asked him whose name I should put on it? he said he came from Mr. Taylor, No. 4, Back Church-lane, which I immediately wrote on it, with my name and date - (looks at the note) - this is it. Taylor is a customer of mine. The prisoner stood at the bar about ten minutes - I was very busy. As soon as the customers were gone I went up to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"I doubt this note being a good one, I will go with you to Mr. Taylor" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I will go with you." We went; he himself knocked at the door, Taylor came out. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Taylor, have you sent this young man with a note for half a pint of brandy?" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Compton, I never send any one to you but part of my family, or come myself," he said he never saw the prisoner - he made no answer. I took the prisoner by the arm, and said</p>
               <p>"You have given me a wrong account, you shall go with me;" he said he would follow me. I took him to Lambeth-street, and gave him in charge of Miller, the constable.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you communicate your suspicion before you came round the counter to him - A. No, my Lord. He could have escaped when we were out, if he chose.</p>

            . I live in Back Church-lane. On the 22d of January, Compton brought the prisoner to my house. I never saw him before, and had not sent him with the note. The prisoner said I was not the person who gave it to him; that he had recived it from a person for making a waistcoat, which came to 6 s. He did not say where the person lived.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes. The note uttered to Almeroth is forged in every respect, and is not Kensall's signature. The others are also forged in every respect. The two 5 l. notes are off the same plate, and so are the three 1 l. notes. The whole five have the name of Simmons, 24, Oxford-street, written on them with the same hand-writing.</p>

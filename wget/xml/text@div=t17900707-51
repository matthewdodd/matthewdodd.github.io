               <p>How many quarts in general, do you think that contained? - The casks are made for four gallons; they do not contain all that; they generally contain fifteen quarts.</p>

               <p>Did you say so? - I said it out loud: they might hear me; they were close enough to me: I spoke to them, and told them I seized it for the use of the King and myself.</p>

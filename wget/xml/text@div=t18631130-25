                  </hi>. I am one of the detectives of the City police—on 9th November, about 1 o'clock, I was at the corner of Garlick-hill—I saw the prisoner coming along from Whitefriars, towards Trinity-lane—he was alone—I was in company with two gentlemen—I knew the prisoner by sight—when he came up to me I caught hold of his collar, and said, "Halloa, what have you got about you?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "If you have not got anything you have no objection to my searching you"—he said he had nothing—I called a gentleman to hold him, put my left hand into his right trousers' pocket, and pulled out this gold watch—I said, "Do you call this nothing?"—he made no answer—I took him to Bow-lane station, and charged him with the unlawful possession of the watch—it had been broken off at the swivel—he refused his address—he did not say at that time how he became possessed of the watch, but in going to the Mansion-house next morn<lb></lb>ing he said he had picked it up and was going to take it to the station.</p>

Louisa Harrison was in my service—she came on the 2nd of Dec. and remained till the 25th—on that day I had occasion to send her to the chemist's for a few trifling articles—I requested her to make haste back—she ought not to have been more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—she was gone an hour and twenty minutes, and came back quit intoxicated—I went to a friend—he came in and saw her—we went to her husband, who came and took her away—he said she had been home, and the landlady gave her a glass of something to drink—they went away together—I emptied her box out, and found a cake of scented soap, some raisins and currants, and a battle with some gin—I then looked at my plate, and missed a silver spoon—soon after the prisoners came back, and the man requested me to take the women into my service again, which of course I refused—I gave them her clothes over the gate, and said there was a spoon missing—she declared she knew nothing of it, it must be in the wash-house—I said I would look, and if it was not found when Mr. Jude came home, they would hear further about it—in half an hour afterwards, William Harrison brought the spoon back, and said if there was anything else miss<lb></lb>ing it should be brought back—I had tied Louisa Harrison's things up in the bundle before I missed the spoon—I could not have put the spoon into that bundle—in the course of the day I missed two pairs of linen sheets, pillow-cases, shirts, a little child's jug and basin—these are the articles—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at them</hi>)—I believe them to be mine—these plates are such as I lost—I missed</p>

On the 31st December I went to the prisoners lodging—I saw William Harrison and other his son—I told them I came to take charge of William Harrison for being concerned with Mr. Harrison in stealing some shirts, a silver spoon, and other things of Mr. Jude—he asked if I was aware that he had had his house searched before—I said "Yes"—he said he had had advice upon it, and I had better mind what I was about—I found these plates and some other things there—he said, "My son is not accountable for pawning the things"—the next day I went to the house and found Louisa Harrison—the door was fast—I threatened to break it open—she opened it and said "what is it"—I said she was charged with robbing her mistress Mr. Jude—she said, "My husband is quite innocent", and said, "There was quite plenty without putting the spoon upon me—I never saw it in the bundle till I came home, and Mr. Jude must have put it in"—I saw a jug there—I said, "that is Mr. Jude's"—she said had brought it with some broth in it, and she was very sorry—next day I went to their lodging again—one room had been denied as being occupied by them—I searched that room and found 155 duplicates—this small ornament and this cup and saucer were in a hamper—five of the duplicates relate to this charge.</p>

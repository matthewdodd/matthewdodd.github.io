I am the wife of Thomas Roberts, who keeps a beer house at Battersea Park—on 10th August, about 3 in the afternoon, John<lb></lb>son came in for a pint of beer, with a bricklayer's labourer—he had on a striped shirt, a lightish pair <hi rend="italic">of</hi> trousers, and a cap—he had some of the beer—Johnson gave me a florin, and I gave him one shilling, a sixpence, and fourpence in halfpence—I opened the till and put the florin in—there were several shillings and sixpences there, but no florin—they then left for ten minutes, and nobody came in the meantime—Johnson then came back with Harvey, who called for a pot of beer, and gave me a florin—I thought it was not good, and took it into the bar-parlour to my husband—he examined it, and I came back to the bar, took out the florin I had taken from Johnson, and gave it to my husband—they were both bad, and I told</p>

I did not know the florin was bad. This roan did not go in with me; I do not know him; he went in afterwards and called a for pint of beer for himself. When I was told the florin was bad I told the landlord to take the pot of beer back. I must have got it when I was loading a muck-barge. I told the sergeant where I lived.</p>

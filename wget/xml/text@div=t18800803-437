I am a painter, of 8, Victoria Place, Islington—on 30th July, about 5.15 a.m., my son aroused me and I went to Mrs. Morris's and made inquiries—I was with one of her sons in Shepperton Street about 10 a.m, and saw the prisoner coming down Green Man's Lane with I basket of linen on a costermonger's barrow—he knew me perfectly well, and held his head down as soon as he saw me turn the comer—he started off with the linen and the barrow as fart as he could—I ran after him; he got away, leaving the barrow and linen behind him—he was taken nest day.</p>

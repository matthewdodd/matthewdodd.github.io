             was driving the team he turned out for them, and when he came in he came in slowly; he came near the corpse; he never touched the corpse, nor any person attending the funeral. I then saw two men strike him. I cannot say whether the prisoner was either of the men that struck him, I was so alarmed at the time; I cannot say where they struck him. The cart was going on a goodish foot pace. There were two horses to the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of their striking him - A. When the first man struck him he turned round, and then the other man struck him, he fell. I was in the cart, sitting on a chest; I looked over, and saw the wheel go over him all the way up. It went on his foot first, and all the way up his back, over his right shoulder. He laid sideways on the ground. He went sideways from the wheel, and the wheel went over his body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything to these men when they struck him - A. Not a word; if he had done anything to them I must have seen it.</p>

            He had no use of his right arm or his right leg's he walked limping. He did not complain of being unwell before this happened; he appeared, except his lameness, to be as well as he usually was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of his breast when he was taken up - A. He complained of his shoulder and his leg; he could not bear us to touch his shoulder but what he would cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cart go over his breast - A. I cannot say it went over his shoulder. It is a heavy cart, almost a new wheel. He was walking along by the side of his horses; they struck him as he was walking along by the side, about the middle of the two horses. He was between the two horses. He was in such a situation that if he tell it was likely the cart would go over him.</p>

            ; I was within half a dozen yards of where this accident took place. I saw the funeral; out of curiosity I went up; I saw a post chaise first. I rather think the post chaise ran up against some of them; it drove off very fast; the people attending the funeral was very much enraged. The cart was six or eight yards behind the post chaise. The man that drove the cart was by the side of the horses. I saw he did not touch any of them; I am sure of that; I think the post chaise did. I am certain that neither he his horses, or cart, ever touched them. The deceased had no time to say anything, it was done so quick. When the cart passed, a man at the funeral came and struck him; after that, another man came from the funeral and struck him; he then fell. The cart was going on at the time, and when he fell the cart went over him, but what part of him I cannot tell, I was so alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the persons that struck him - A. I did not notice the first that struck him. The man that struck him the last blow returned to the funeral; I kept my eye upon him; I never lost sight of him; on that account I never saw the man that was run over afterwards. I pointed out the man that last struck the deceased to Mr. Stroud; he went after the man, and took him. The prisoner is the man that Mr. Stroud took, and I am sure the prisoner is the man that struck the deceased.</p>

            . I am a pupil in the London hospital. On Tuesday the 22nd of November, in the evening, I was informed that he had been knocked down, and that a cart had run over the body. I minutely examined the body, and questioned the man as to all his sensations; all that he complained of was a stiffness in his shoulder, and a pain in his ancle. I bled him profusely. I gave him some medicines. He went on perfectly well until Saturday morning. On Saturday morning he laboured under very great difficulty of breathing. There were other symptoms of inflammation of his lungs, and pain in his side. That was on the Saturday. I used proper remedies for the inflammation of the lungs. The complaint continued Saturday, and Sunday, and the Monday following the complaint gained ground. Sir

             saw him on the Monday following; he desired he might lose four ounces of blood, which I accordingly drew from him, and about four o'clock the man died, and on Tuesday we opened the body. The right globe of the lungs was very much inflamed, as likewise the membrane that covered the right cavity of the chest was very much inflamed also.</p>
               <p>Q. What would occasion this appearance - A. The application of cold and obstructed perspiration.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not external violence occasion it - A. I do not think it did in this instance. There was no external appearance on the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen in your experience that there has been such internal appearance without external marks of violence - A. There may have been such a thing, but not in my knowledge. It is my opinion, that these appearances of inflammation did not arise from external violence. The suppuration on the right cavity of his chest indicated it was not by any violence so recently done. There was an appearance of an old disease in the left globe of the lungs. In my opinion, this internal appearance was the cause of his death. There was no external marks that caused that appearance, or his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any bruises on his breast - A. The injury was on the left side, and the inflammation of the lungs on the right. The injury was on the left shoulder, and the inflammation on the right. The injury could not have gone on so rapid if it had been occasioned on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the fan have occasioned it - A. I do not think the fall could have occasioned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the pressure of the wheel upon this shoulder have occasioned such appearances as you saw in the cavity of the chest, or in any manner occasioned his death - A. I think not.</p>

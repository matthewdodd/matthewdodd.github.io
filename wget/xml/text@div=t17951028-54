               <p>Prisoner. My prosecutor was acquitted on Friday, and I was cleared about nine o'clock at the ball, and I went to her house in the evening. She told me that she bed gown was much better than my own things. She gave it me to go out and get her a little money, and the shawl likewise, and I went out in the dusk of the evening to get a little money. I was crossing Tothill-street, and this girl met me. The prosecutor told me, that she kept a house for girls, and that she had two girls that went out of nights, and that was why I went to her house.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How many girls have you in your house now? - None but a married woman, except one young woman, that her uncle allows her a maintenance down at Tooting.</p>

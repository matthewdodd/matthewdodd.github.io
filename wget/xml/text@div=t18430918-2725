                  </hi>. I live in Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields. About twelve o'clock on Sunday night, the 10th of September, the prisoner came to my shop—I am sure he is the man—he asked for sixpenny-worth of eggs—my niece, Mary Ann Morley, was sitting on the steps when he came in—she got up, and came on the other side of the counter, and said she had got no eggs—I was in the room, but did not go into the shop—I heard my niece call and went in—the prisoner had then left—I followed and saw him'about fifty yards off running—I caught him about 200 yards off in Went worth-street—I asked him for the saucer of money that he had taken out of my till—he said he had never been in my shop—he walked by my side about fifty yards, he then darted away from me into a lodging-house in Rose-lane—I stopped at the door, and in a few minutes the policeman came by—I told him—he went and brought the prisoner out of the lodging-house—I am sure he is the same person—I did not lose sight of him, except when he went into the house—the saucer was in the till—I had seen it about half-past ten the same evening—it is not here.</p>

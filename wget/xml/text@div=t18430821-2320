                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Charles Furber, of Pollet's-court, Gray's Inn; I was at a sale of furniture in the Commercial-road, on the 22nd of June; some fixtures were sold, and some were not—after the sale was over, Collins was going to take these drawers—he had removed them from the place where they were fixed into the shop—I said, "You shan't have them"—he said he had bought them, he had bought several other things—I do not know whether it was a mistake—it was done openly—I said, "Let them be till I ask Carr"—I asked Carr—he said they were bought, and he could not stop them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and was at the sale. Collins wanted to take the drawers—there was a person there acting on the part of the landlord—he said that these drawers were not sold by auction, they were fixtures, and not to be removed—Davis asked Collins for his bill—he said he had not got it, that Carr had, and when Carr came, he said it was right, and Collins took the drawers.</p>

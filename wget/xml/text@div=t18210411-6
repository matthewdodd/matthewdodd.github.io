The prisoner has come for the last two or three months to teach my daughter French, she is nine years old. On a Friday, I missed this watch off the dressing table in the bed room, I had seen it a day or two before; she had been to my house on the Tuesday or Wednesday; she usually gave her lessons in the parlour below stairs, I do not know that she was in the habit of going up stairs. I went to Bow-street, and had hand-bills distributed - the watch was produced by Cowlishaw. I then went to the prisoner's lodgings and had her apprehended. At her second examination, I saw her in the cell and she delivered me the chain, which was attached to the watch; I have not brought it here.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wilkinson, a silversmith, in Piccadilly. About the 17th of February, the prisoner came to the shop and offered a watch for sale, I offered her six guineas for it, she said she was to have six guineas and a half for it, but I said I could give no more. I afterwards shewed it to Mr. Less. (I produce it.) I am sure she is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. There is nothing very particular in the watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. LEES. The watch is mine, I know it by its general appearance, the face is chased off just above the figure 12 - it is my wife's watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.- You know it by its being chased - A. Yes, by its general appearance, there was nothing very particular in it. I saw it on the Tuesday previous to the Friday it was produced. I have seven or eight female servants, my wife is a millener; the prisoner understands English very imperfectly. I should imagine she does not understand what is going on now. I did not buy it. I know the maker of the watch lived in Frith-street.</p>

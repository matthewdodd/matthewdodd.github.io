                  </hi>. I am an upper manufacturer, of Hanbury Street, Whitechapel—on 19th February the prisoner and Freeman came there about mid-day, and Virgo offered a sample of one dozen <hi rend="italic">kips</hi> for sale—. said there were 7 dozens of them—he wanted 13<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for them—I asked him if there was any discount or credit; he said "No," but he was willing to give 2 1/2 per cent.—I told him that in the state they were in I. valued them at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. if they were up to the sample—he left the dozen with me and they both returned between 9 and 10 o'clock at night and brought 7 dozen and a half of <hi rend="italic">kips</hi>—I told him it was very late, my men</p>

               <p>were gone, and I could not weigh them, but he might leave them until the morning—he said that he thought I closed at 10 o'clock—I said that I closed at 9—he then said "I have a job lot of uppers," and brought some parcels in, pulled out some uppers from each, put them on the counter, and asked me to buy them—he asked 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some—I said that he would have to leave them that I might see that they were up to the sample—I gave him a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he left them—he called with his traveller about mid-day next day, and I said "I have been through the tops as far as I can; if you like to leave your man he can go through them with me, as some are short and some are over"—I then bought the whole for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I think there were 400 pairs—I gave them to the police—they were produced at the police-court.</p>

I paid him 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came with a pony cart—I have known him several years—he was in Matthews's employ—he gave me this invoice with this heading—there was nothing extraordinary in his coming—I am in the habit of buying goods for cash—I believe I have paid the full value for them—I would not have given a penny more for the <hi rend="italic">kips</hi>—I could have bought them elsewhere for cash without considering discount or credit—I do not think he gave an unfair price for them if he gave 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash down—the credit in the leather trade is sometimes four months—there are a good many failures, and a good many goods are sold at auctions—we should expect to buy them cheap there because we should not know their age—I should think goods sent to an auction would realise from 25 to 30 per cent, discount from the credit cost of price—we cannot easily tell their age in a sale room—I have never attended sales—I know Mr. Pangborne—I do not know Mr. Wood or Mr. Dowdeswell—I have known the prisoner in the employ of perfectly respectable tradesmen with whom I have done business on a large scale—Freeman was with him on most occasions and represented himself as his traveller—he did not bring the sample of uppers, he brought some other goods—he came alone the last time on Virgo's behalf.</p>

               <p>he thought the man who sold Virgo the goods would call for some more money—the man came, and I directly walked out of the parlour into the shop to him—I cannot say whether Randall knew him—I heard him speak to him but I found he was not a traveller—I only know what Randall told me—I did not tell you at Clerkenwell that Randall knew that the man was a traveller—I think Randall said to him "How is Annie in the New North Road"—I took him to the station and put him into a room with two boys—I fetched Virgo from the cell and asked him if there was anybody there he knew—he looked round, hesitated some time, and then said "I believe that is the man I paid 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to for those goods"—the man jumped up and said it was false or a lie and said "You don't know me"—Virgo made no answer—I let the man go-—I did not think Mrs. Virgo would be a competent witness against him, and the boy said that he did not know anything about it—I have found the man's address—he is not here—I went there after the second examination, after you had cross-examined me—I did not say a word in my examination in chief about going to Virgo's house or confronting him with the man, I did not think it was necessary—the man is not a traveller—Randall did not go with me, he knew nothing about it.</p>

I am a boot and shoe maker, of 9, Bentley Ter<lb></lb>race, Dalston, and have been in the trade over 30 years, employing hands—travellers are employed in the trade by different firms; they bring round samples, and afterwards bring the goods—they sometimes say "I have a little job lot which will suit you," and if it does suit we purchase it—we sometimes take a receipt when paying cash, and sometimes not—I have paid money 20 times and never taken or asked for a receipt—I have sold goods to Mr. Pash, of Kingsland Road, without a receipt; he is in a very large way of business—the goods have been purchased for money, and no invoice rendered—he has 10 or 12 shops—there are always job lots to be bought at auctions—if I had any stale goods I should send them to auction—I have sold goods that cost me 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to realise money—I have known Virgo 10 or 12 years, and always found him straightforward, upright, and honest—I was in his back room, about 9 o'clock, when the two detectives came—a person afterwards came into the shop and I heard the shop boy say to them "This is the man"—the man came into the parlour and the detectives followed him in—Mrs. Virgo said to the detec<lb></lb>tives "This is the man I paid the money to for the goods"—the man said</p>

               <p>I do not know what you mean"—Randall entered into a little conversa<lb></lb>tion with him and said "How is Annie in the New North Road?" and I thought he knew him—the man said "Oh, she is all right"—Randall said "Is that your <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> outside?"—he said "I don't know who you mean"—he said "You know who I mean, that full-faced <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> with no whiskers"—he said "Why don't you speak out and tell me what you really mean?" and then they dropped the conversation—Maroney asked Mrs. Virgo whether she would swear that was the man who sold the goods—she said "Yes," and I went out and fetched a four-wheeled cab, and they went away in it—I was at the house again next day with Mr. and Mrs. Virgo, when the inspector came and said "Have you sent any goods over the way?"—Virgo said "No," and turned round to his wife and said "Ann, have you sent any over the way?"—she said "Yes, John"—he said "Good God, you have done enough to convict an honest man," and sat down and began to cry—I have not been in Court this morning, only when I was called in for a moment—I said to Virgo "John, don't be a fool, to carry on like that," and the inspector spoke to Maroney, and they went out—the inspector asked Virgo if he had any receipt—he said "This is the only receipt I have, and produced this bill head, which he gave to the inspector—I went to Mr. Montague, the solicitor for the defence, and gave him information.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The travellers have a certain connection of their own and know on whom to call, but they must sometimes call on a new cus<lb></lb>tomer—it would be a usual thing to take a receipt for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it would not be unusual not to do so—I have never sold goods to Pash to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and received no receipt—Mrs. Virgo did not say "That is the man I paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods," she mentioned no amount that I heard—I am no relation to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather merchant of Liverpool Road, Islington—I do not know Virgo—about 20th February Freeman called on me with some leather goods, they were an odd lot—I did not buy them—I think I should know them again—they remained at my place for a whole day—these are them—he asked I think 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair at first, which he afterwards reduced to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I refused them—I should have bought them at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less, but I did not make the offer—they were not worth more than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. all round as a job lot—I said that the <hi rend="italic">kips</hi> were not worth more than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, but I only saw a sample—I am in a large way of business—Mr. Wood, a boot manufacturer, saw them on my counter—I knew that Freeman travelled for some one in the Hackney Road, but I did not know for whom he was selling these goods—he took them away as I would not give the price—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the <hi rend="italic">kips</hi> is more than I would have paid—if Virgo bought the lot for 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would not have done anything unusual for that lot of goods.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. This was about the 20th—I was not aware that Mr. Clogg said that he received them on the 19th—I saw the bulk of the goods but have not seen them since until this moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Freeman brought the bulk to me and they laid there in daylight all day, and were shown to several of our customers.</p>

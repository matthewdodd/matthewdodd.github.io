The next word was, give me two pence, or three pence, to pay the Turnpike. I said what do you mean? then he took a pistol out from under his right arm, and pointed it to me, saying, come, come, give me your money. His horse's head was in my chaise; by the posture<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110035"></xptr> he held his pistol, it seem'd to be confin'd under his arm. He said he would not take my watch from me; so I suppose he saw the silver chain hang out. Then I the more readily comply'd ; I held out 4 s. and a few half-pence ; he took it, and look'd at it, and shook his head, and said, it would not do, he must have my watch. I was at a stand, to know whether I should dispute it with him; then he said, come, come, be quick; what are you at? taking out his pistol again. Said I, if you must have my watch you must. He took it, and away he rode, as hard as he cou'd, towards Acton. He was alone, I am very certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

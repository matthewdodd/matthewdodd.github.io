                  </hi>. I keep a hosier's shop at No. 59, Gracechurch-street On the 18th of this month, about one o'clock, the prisoner Yoang andtwo other females came into my shop, and requested to look at some Guernsey frocks—I said I did not think I had any that would suit—they requested again to see what I had—I found the lowest-priced article—they said they would not do, and turned them over hastily, and went out—a few minutes after I perceived a parcel of stockings gone from my window—I told my young man to follow me, and went out—I saw two of the females turning round into Fenchurch-street, and saw the prisoner about thirty or forty yards in advance, walking with this young man (Hewitt)—I followed them—she was working with her hands under her cloak, and passed something to him—she turned away immediately after that was done—I ran up to Hewitt, and said, "That is my parcel"—I wheeled him round, and gave him to my young man—I ran back after the female, calling "Stop thief," and the policemen stopped her—these stockings are my property—(looking <hi rend="italic">at them</hi>)—she gave them to Hewitt from under her cloak—she was on the left-hand side—it was done in a concealed manner—he put his right hand round, and had them in his arm when I seized him—he evidently under stood what she meant, and took it in the same way, at least it so appeared to me.</p>

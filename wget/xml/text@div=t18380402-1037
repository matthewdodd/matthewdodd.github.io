                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and am a servant. On the evening of the 22nd of March I was at the shop window of Mr. Row, in Kingsland-road, and saw the two prisoners—Clark took the clogs from the door—he dropped them under the window, picked them up, put them into Bacon's apron, and he ran away with them—they both ran together—Clark told me to say nothing—I went directly into the shop and told the people—they were together before—I was going by the door, and saw him put his hands in the door and take them.</p>

On the evening of the 22nd of March, I went to my shop door, is consequence of what I was told—I missed a bundle of clogs, five pairs—they had been bunk just inside the door—I had seen them safe ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I got information from Hill.</p>

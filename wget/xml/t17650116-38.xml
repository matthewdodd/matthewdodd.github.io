               <p>E. Hogg. A very small watch, the outside case quite plain gold, the inside case metal, and a metal chain: I had no suspicion of the prisoner: I advertised it, and he was stopped by a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>E. Hogg. I wound it up about eleven o'clock, and I did not miss it till a little after one that day.</p>

               <p>Jos. Bareau. I live in Petticoat-lane, and am a glass engraver. I am a Jew: on Monday evening, I believe the 15th of December, the prisoner at the bar, and two others, asked me if I would buy a watch; the prisoner had it: I said yes; he shewed it me; he asked six guineas for it: I thought he did not come honestly by it: I stopped him with it: I asked him how he came by it; he said, he found it in a tap-room, on the other side the water, under a table: when he came before Sir

               <p>Bareau. In that part of Petticoat-lane that is in Middlesex; and carried him to my house, which is in the city of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was possessed of the watch, he or you, when you came into the city?</p>

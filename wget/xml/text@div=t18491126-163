               <p>with a friend at half-past twelve o'clock at night; the prisoners came up to us and asked us to go home with them—they took as to a house up a court, we had some drink; I paid for it—Sheen then asked me to sleep with her—I refused, I gave her a parting kiss and left—a person spoke to me, and I missed my purse, containing four sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and some silver—the policeman ran after the two prisoners and brought them back—I charged them with stealing my purse—I had it in the house when I paid for the drink, not a minute before I left—I was not tipsy, but something was put into my spirits—I was not exactly what I ought to be—no one else had the opportunity of taking it—I had not been out of the house three minutes—I paid nothing for the room—I do not know whether my friend did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 2, St. Margaret's-court, Borough; my house receives temporary lodgers for accommodation. On 2d Nov., between two and three o'clock, the prisoners came with Rougier and another man—Rougier sent me out for some brandy, and gave me the money for it—they staid three-quarters of an hour, to the best of my recollection—as he went out of the parlour be dropped his purse, it was a small spring one—Sheen picked it up and gave it to him, and he put it in his left trowsers pocket—I heard the money chink—I requested to look at the purse; and he handed it to me—the spring was tight—I returned it to him—he had it all right when he left my house.</p>

Last Thursday morning, between two and three o'clock, I saw Sheen come out of Mrs. Berry's house with the captain, they went into a dark corner of the court, twelve or fourteen yards from the door—Hurley went after them; they remained about three minutes—I saw them go away from him—he came and told me something, and I went after the prisoners, and stopped them about two hundred yards off in Redcross-street—I said they were charged with robbing a man in the alley—they said, "Very well," they would come back with me—Sheen dropped half-a-sovereign in Fishmonger-alley; my brother constable picked it up and gave it to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found this, sovereign and two shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the pocket of Sheen's gown—I took them to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-steward of the Earl of Yarborough, whose name is Charles Anderson Worsley Pelham—the prisoner was his lordship's hall-porter, at 17, Harlington-street. On Wednesday, 31st July, I was about to start for Appuldercombe, one of his lordship's seats in the Isle of Wight—the prisoner came and asked me for some money to pay the taxes, which must be paid on the Saturday following—I left 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with him—he had given me the notices previously—I took his receipt for the money—I do not know of what denomination the money I gave him consisted—I do not know whether the notes were 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I should expect they</p>

               <p>were one or the other, but I am not certain—there were two sovereigns and some silver—I am not aware whether there was a half-sovereign, or whether there were any half-crowns or shillings among the silver—I returned from the Isle of Wight on the Monday following, and saw the prisoner between four and six o'clock in the afternoon—I did not then make any inquiry of him about the money, because he was engaged, and there was a great deal to be done, and I passed it over, intending to ask him about it on the Wednesday morning, but I then found he was gone—he did not return until Friday night at ten—in the meantime I had been to a Magistrate and made some inquiry—when I saw him that night I asked where he had been—he said he had been to Brighton, and to Brighton races—I said, "What has become of the money?"—he said, "I have been robbed of it?"—"Robbed?" I said—"Yes," he said, "of every shilling"—I said, "That is very pretty; before I proceed any further I shall expect you will account for this money, or give me security for it"—he said he could not do that himself, but he could get the security of two persons—he sent for them, and they refused to be security for him—they said it was too large a sum for them to encounter—one was a servant, and the other a housekeeper—that being the case I said, "If I cannot find the money I shall give you under the charge of the police"—he seemed rather surprised at that—I said, "I must do that to secure myself," and I gave him in charge—the money I gave him was Lord Yarborough's, given for me to dispose of for the purposes of the household.</p>

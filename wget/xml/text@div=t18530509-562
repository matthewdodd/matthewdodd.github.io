                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Tottenham-court-road. On 9th April the prisoner came, about 6 or a quarter after 6 o'clock in the evening—I served her half a pound of beef steak; it came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she put down a half-crown on the counter—I gave her change—in the hurry of the moment, I did not know that the half-crown was bad—after she went away I took the half-crown off the counter—I thought it felt smooth—I took it to the door, and found it was bad—I marked it, wrapped it in a bit of paper, and put it into the till—I afterwards gave it to the inspector at the station—about a quarter past 9 o'clock the same night, I was then outside the shop—she came and asked me the price of some meat—I knew her again directly I turned round to give her the price of the meat; I knew it was the same woman; I am positive she is the same person—I told her the price, and she took two pieces of meat into the shop to be weighed by the man—I went into the shop, and said to my man, "I will take this woman's money"—she put down a half crown on the counter—I saw directly that it was bad, took it up, and said, "You succeeded in passing one bad half-crown; this is the second, within three hours; I shall give you into custody"—she said I was mistaken—I marked the second half-crown, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

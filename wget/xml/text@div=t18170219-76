            . I serve in the eating-house. The prisoner had her supper there, and soon after the prosecutor came in, and had some meat, and gave it to the prisoner; he got up to go out - I saw his seals hanging out, and told him to take care of his watch; the prisoner asked, what it was to me, so that nothing was done in my house. Six days after the prosecutor called on me to enquire for the prisoner, and said, he had lost his watch; he said, he should know her again; I told him to bring the officer to me, which he did; and we went to a public-house in Drury-lane, and met her at the door - He immediately knew her and gave her in charge. I am sure she was the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know whether the prosecutor was drunk, or not. He did not come to me till six days after.</p>

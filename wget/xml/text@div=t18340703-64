            . I am a hosier, and live in the Strand. On the 15th of May, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me to purchase these watch-guards for 25s. - I knew it was too little, and said they must be stolen - he said he gave a boy a book for them in Clare Market - I looked for a policeman, but did not see one - the prisoner left them with me, and went away - he said his name was Roberts, and he lived in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you leave him in the shop when you went for the policeman? A. I only went to the door - my wife was in the shop - he did not object to my keeping the goods, to see if I could find the owner.</p>
               <p>JOHN HENRY MACHU. I live in <placeName id="t18340703-64-crimeloc347">Twister-alley, Bunhill-row</placeName>

These watch-guards are mine - there are four dozen of them - I sell a great many; but only two dozen of this pattern have been sold, which I have traced - these are worth about 3l. - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not a great many of these in different manufacturers' premises? A. These brown ones, I only know, are our make - the green ones I speak more particularly to, I think there are not many a like - I have not seen any - I cannot say when I saw them in my possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them that morning for two books and 3s.</p>

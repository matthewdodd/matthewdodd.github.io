                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live at Bishopsgate-street Within. The prisoner was in my service as errand boy about seven months—in consequence of what the maid-servant said to me the last Saturday in May, I spoke to the prisoner, and said, "In consequence of your getting</p>

               <p>a situation in the New York line of steamers, I suppose you wish to leave me?"—he made no reply, hut it was mutually considered that he should leave on the Saturday; and he did leave—nothing more passed till Saturday, 5th June, when just as I was going out of town, at 5 o'clock, the maid servant came up the stairs, and said, "Moore wants you to give him a character"—when I came down, I said to him, "I wonder you did not ask me before, and not leave it to the last moment, when you know I am just going out"—I wrote him such a character as I could, and gave it him—I then left, leaving him there—he had access to the goods in the shop at that time—nobody else was employed in the shop—my wife was there, but no other servant—I did not see the prisoner again till he was brought up from Southampton by the officer—in the meantime I missed a considerable quantity of things; some must have been taken while he was with me; although he managed it in that way that I did not discover it till he left—on Sunday evening, 6th June, I went to a drawer in the counter, in the shop, and missed a dress coat—I also missed an ivory set of chessmen—the other things were missed after a day or two—on the Monday when the officer came, we missed, with bound books and numbers, 273 books—they are not in the indictment—there are a great number of things which he has robbed me of, which are not in the indictment—he was brought up from Southampton on the Friday—I missed from thirteen to eighteen bottles of wine out of the cellar, the staple of which I found had been drawn—I also missed some caps, and hats, and a carpet bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Southampton police. In consequence of information, I took the prisoner into custody at Southampton on 10th June—he was in a room with his brother-in-law, not lodging there, merely a visitor—I told him he was charged with stealing a dress coat, a quantity of books, and a set of ivory chessmen—he said he had got do books, he did not know anything about any books—I asked him to open his boxes—he did so—in one of them I found a set of ivory chessmen, four or five cloth caps, a duplicate of a coat, a variety of wearing apparel of his own, and five other duplicates—I also found a small carpet bag, not in the box, and a hat in the other box—there were eight bottles of wine, and on his person I found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found a hat, besides the one he had on—I gave up the things to sergeant Hamilton.</p>

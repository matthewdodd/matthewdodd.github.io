About two years ago I commenced the business of a tailor, and took the prisoner's brother into my service to measure, and cut out at the end of the shop - there was a partition between us; the prisoner was employed to make clothes - she used continually to come backwards and forwards to receive the clothes and make them up; in about two years I gave up that business, and dismissed her brother - in consequence of suspicion I went to Mr. Gray's, about a month ago, and there found some drill; I went to the prisoner's lodging with a search-warrant - he was searched in my presence; the officer has the duplicates found on her, and some others which were found in the room; I had not before that missed any articles, but I did afterwards - I have seen some articles which were found at the pawnbrokers, and compared them with some pieces of drill and jean which I have.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the prisoner buy any thing, or merely come for work? A. For work - her brother employed her to work at the business, what he told her I cannot tell - my attention was directed to John Boston, who lived with the prisoner as a husband- I accused

            . I am a Police-officer. I went to the prisoner's premises on the 9th of May; in a box, which was owned by Boston, I found five duplicates, and on her I found two duplicates, but they did not belong to any property which the prosecutor claims.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The box was claimed by Boston? A. Yes, but he said he knew nothing about any duplicates, and when Mrs. Boston came in she would tell me; when the prisoner came in I shewed them to her, but she made no observation.</p>

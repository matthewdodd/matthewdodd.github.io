               <p>THOMAS GOOK. I am an officer.

I said the butter shops were the best places; he asked me to take it, and I took it to the gentleman's shop; he asked me whose it was; I said it belonged to Mr. Smith, in Cooper's court - I went out, and saw the prisoner; I told him the gentleman was coming to know if it was right - he said, "It is all right," and I left him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, and live at Westwood Lodge, Sydenham—I am not sure that my furniture was assigned on a bill of sale, but there was a quarrel between the Land Security Company and myself—they had a claim upon me, and in August four men broke into my house through the window—the Seths are two of them—their right of possession I cannot tell you—I believed they were ordered to break in by the Land Security Company, by Granville Richard Ryder, M. P., who is manager of the Company—I did not watch them—I remember one of them coming in that evening, but the two Seths are so much alike, I don't know which it was—I think it mitigates their conduct very much that they only obeyed the orders of their chief—these four decanter-trays are my daughter's property—they have on them the crest of the company from whom I received them—they are part of a service which was given to me by a great company—they were in the house when it was broken into—I did not miss them till the police found them—I watched and noticed that a great deal of theft was going on by the representatives of the company who broke into my house—I identify these spoons, these 18 forks, and this soup-ladle—these two spoons and these two dessert knives also bear the crest of the company—they are my daughter's—I also missed 7-lb. quicksilver—it was not mine, but was left with me by a friend to make some experiments with—the bottle is marked 7-lb.—I found it empty—it was worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—this soap-box produced is mine—it was taken out of my dressing-case, and has been changed in shape—I never gave the prisoners authority to take these things—I abstained from all communication with them—there was to be a mock sale in my house by order of the Chancellor, but it never took place—I never gave authority for a quantity of waste paper to be taken from the house, but I saw at the station a moderate size eack full of valuable papers, plans, and drawings.</p>

These housebreakers were in my place six weeks—they were only there a few hours at first because I turned them out, but on the second era they remained until the Chancellor toned them out—a great gang came in the first night—I have not taken an inventory of what I missed—I left them to their own responsibility—a man named Rooke put them in, and came in himself; a man named Darling was chief housebreaker; he was subordinate to Rooke, I think Mr. Burke and Mr. Granville Byder—I think Darling had the keys of the premises; most of the valuables were in the dining-room—my goods were lotted and inventoried for sale—I am not sure that crowds of people came in for two days, but</p>

               <p>anybody could go in and out, and a number of people did, until the Chan<lb></lb>cellor stopped them—I think the auctioneer's name was Goatley—his men would be there to lot the property—I was in possession of the house yester<lb></lb>day at this time, but I am not now—while I was in Court yesterday waiting to give evidence the housebreakers took possession again, and vans went down and emptied my house, and they are now the runners of the whole property—that was under Granville Richard Ryder, who has an office at 22, Great George Street, Westminster, where he handles other people's property; it was under his orders that the men got in a few months ago, and again yesterday—I do not know what orders he gave, but I judged by their conduct; may be his agents are here to-day to take possession of this property—he has a claim to my property, and so has Mr. Burcham—I dare say they will present these articles to me afterwards; they have already offered to make a beautiful present to me of the whole of my property, pro<lb></lb>vided I will make them a present of the land.</p>

I am a solicitor and managing clerk to Mr. Walter Webb, solicitor to the prosecutor—I have acted for Mr. Russell in his affairs—possession was first taken of his house and furniture on 31ST July, and on 16th or 17th August the Land Securities Company advertised the property for sale through their auctioneer, Mr. Goatley—they are the mortgagees—an application was made for an <hi rend="italic">interim injunction</hi>, and Mr. Baron Pollock granted it, restraining the sale for a week—application was made on 28th August to Justice Manisty, sitting for Vice-Chancellor Hall, the Vacation Judge, to conntinue the <hi rend="italic">injunction</hi>, which he did until 7th November—up to 28th August three or four men were in possession—this is the <hi rend="italic">interim injunction</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the Land Securities Company were directed not to sell, but were at liberty to continue one man in possession—I do not know whether the defendants were in possession, but they did not obey the order till 15th September, because I had some animated correspon<lb></lb>dence with Mr. Burcham on the subject</p>

My husband's name is James—we live at 3, North Road, Sydenham—I am a customer of Benjamin's for clothing—I remember going into his kitchen on 14th August, I know the date because I went to pay some money for a young woman who had taken her wages that day—Mr. Benjamin was in the shop, and told me to go into the kitchen to Mrs. Benjamin—I went there and saw this plate on the table, but not this soup box or ladle—Mr. Benjamin came in and said, "You have got some nice silver there; "he said, "I have got that at Mr. Scott Russell's at a sale; "I said, "Is it all good? "he said, "Yes, first class"—I said, "How could there be a sale on when the bailiffs are only just in? "he said, "Well, I bought it, at any rate"—I paid the money and came away—on Tuesday evening, 22nd Octo<lb></lb>ber, Elizabeth Kendal came to me and produced this ladle—I went with her to the station with it, but she brought it away again, she was afraid to give it up, and I came back with her and left the ladle indoors, and went up the street and met my husband—I told him where I had been, and that the ladle was indoors—he took it to the station.</p>

"—she said that she was afraid—she also said "I will go to Scott Russell's first; will you come with me? "</p>

On 22nd October Mr. Prop brought the ladle to the station—I received information, and went with Inspector Hayward to an eating-house in Middlesex Street, Petticoat Lane—Benjamin's father and mother live there—I saw the mother, who handed me all the plate, but not the ladle or the bottle—I took them to the station, and on the same morning I went with Hayward to Sydenham, and met the prisoner Benjamin in Wells Road running</p>

"—I said "Receiving some plate stolen from Mr. Scott Russell's"—he said "Oh, I can account for that. I bought it of three men with some rubbish"—we went to the station, and I produced the plate before him—he said "Yes, that is the plate I bought of two of the broker's men at Scott Russell's. I bought some waste paper and maps at the same time of the servant; you will find them at my shop in Wells Road"—on 31ST October I took the two Seths at Twickenham—took them to Twickenham station, and charged them with stealing some plate from Mr. Scott Russell's during the time they were there in charge of his house—John Seth said "I know nothing about it. Why don't you apprehend Darling and Looker, who were with us also? "—I afterwards repeated the charge to Robert Seth—he said "Not me; I do not know anything about it"—I showed him this soap box, which had been handed to me by somebody else, and asked him how he accounted for the possession of it—he said "I don't know anything about it"—I said "Are you sure? "—he said "Well, my brother gave it to me when we were at Scott Russell's"—we found Looker—he was taken to Sydenham station and placed with a number of men—John Seth said "If I wanted to steal anything I should not have stayed eight days in the house without food."</p>

I knew that Darling was put in possession, but I did not know him—he has been searched for by the police, but he is not to be found—I believe he was the principal man in possession, and held the key of the room where Mr. Russell kept this property—there is no warrant out for Darling—this soup-dish is plated—it was being used as a tobacco box by the man who has scratched his name on it—it was used in the house for tobacco—a man named Jennings living at Twicken<lb></lb>ham gave it to me—I have been a police-officer at Sydenham 23 years—I know Twickenham—I saw Mr. Goatley, the auctioneer, who lotted out the property—I did not see his men, but I have been into the rooms, and it appears to be lotted out.</p>

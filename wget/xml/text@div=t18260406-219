            . I am a watchman. On Tuesday morning, the 21st of March, I was on Wellington-terrace, and saw the prisoner and another man, walking at the end of a stable, near Barnsbury-park - I called the hour of six, and when I got on to Park-place, they made a bit of a stop till I crossed the road; I turned round, and came by Barnsbury-park again, and saw them - I asked what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060091"></xptr>they had got - his companion said, "What is that to you?" the prisoner had a smock frock on his shoulder - I put my hand on it, and felt something soft; his companion ran away; I took the prisoner, and the night constable found in the frock three cocks and two hens - one of the hen's head had beed pulled off - he said he did not know what it was- the other man had given it to him to carry.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you candles lighted in your shop at the time - A. Yes. There were three of us in the shop at the time; it was not a minute before the chain was taken; I was shewing the gold chain to the young woman at the next door, and I had only walked across the shop when the chain was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you hear, and what happened then, after you put it back again into the shop window. - A. I walked to the shop window, I heard nothing to alarm me; I observed the cotton rumpled, and the chain was gone, and the board on which the broaches lay, was turned over; I looked, and the chain and two broaches were gone; they were of the best gold; they lay close to the chain; and they were close to the glass of the window. The corner of the pane of glass, was cut as if by a diamond, and the piece of glass was taken away, and the hole in the glass was large enough to admit a lady's hand. On the next morning I went to the refiner's, I saw part of the chain.</p>

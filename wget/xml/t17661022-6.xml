They had broke a square of glass in the window, which looks to the counter; I had left my candle burning just opposite the glass which was broke; I missed five pair of fine cotton and worsted stockings, and nine pair of worsted, and a five yard worsted piece; they were lying within a quarter of a yard of the pane that was broken; we went in pursuit of the men that had been seen at the window; my neighbour said he should know one of them from five hundred, but could not meet with them. I got bills and delivered them to the pawnbrokers; I found one pair of stockings pledged in Catharine-street, at Mr. Styles's; he said he knew the woman that pledged them very well: she was soon taken; she said she had them of Donnoly. I have since seen two pair more in the custody of Mr. Cawdey, which he stopped: I was sent for to Sir

            . I sing ballads. Donnoly came to me while I was singing last Friday night, between 6 and 7 o'clock, in Cranbourn-alley, he asked me how Kitty did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Kitty?</p>
               <p>M Stevens. She used to sing with me; he said he was short of money, and desired me to be kind enough to go and pawn a pair of stockings for him; I took and pawned them for 1 s. 9 d. at Mr. Styles's, and brought the money and duplicate to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say he was your husband?</p>
               <p>M Stevens. I did not think there was any harm in that, I knew him before by his being acquainted with Kitty.</p>
               <p>Donnoly's defence.</p>
               <p>I bought the stockings of a woman in Covent-garden for 3 s. 6 d. coming through Cranbourn-alley, I asked that woman to pawn them for me; I had but half a crown of my own, and I borrowed a shilling of a soldier to pay for them; she pawned them for me, and brought me the money, and I gave her some gin;

            . I sell fish and oysters. Last Friday night between seven and eight, I was going through Covent-garden, I saw the prisoner taking stockings of a woman; he had but half a crown, and that all of a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was this in Covent-garden?</p>
               <p>Pearson. This was under the piazzas.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side?</p>
               <p>Pearson. On the right hand side near the playhouse door.</p>
               <p>Q. How near?</p>
               <p>Pearson. Within two doors of the play-house gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Donnoly?</p>
               <p>Pearson. I have known him in St. George's Hospital; I was there for a sore leg, and I left him there when I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago?</p>
               <p>Pearson. He was there about three weeks before I came out, and I came out seven weeks ago today.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he buy the stockings?</p>
               <p>Pearson. The woman asked him 3 s. 6 d. for them. A man was going by, he happened to know him; he asked him to lend him a shilling, which he did; he bought and paid for them, and I gave him a pot of beer at the corner house, as we came out from under the piazzas to Russel-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man that he borrowed the shilling of?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220009"></xptr>Pearson. The soldier left him as soon as he lent him the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured stockings were they?</p>
               <p>Pearson. They were lightish coloured stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so particular as to the time?</p>
               <p>Pearson. Because at that time I was up there with my oysters.</p>

             I am a soldier in the first regiment; I have known Donnoly/ 15 months; I lent him a shilling on Friday or Saturday night to bay a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. This was under the piazzas in Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts under the piazzas?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. It was just at the bottom of James-street, on the same side the play house is on, at a bagnio door.</p>
               <p>Q. What person did he buy them of?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. He bought them of a woman, she took them out of a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. I met him by chance.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give for the stockings?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. He gave 3 s. 6 d. for them, he paid her a half crown, and the shilling I lent him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. This was about eight o'clock, within a quarter of an hour over or under.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were they?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. They were whitish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Wadsley/. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. There was another man along with him, but I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. I have known him about 15 months; he used to work at the new buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he been employed lately?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. to prisoner. Can you give the jury a reason why you pawned them so soon after you bought them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no money, and I did not know what to do; I thought they were cheap or I had not bought them.</p>
               <p>Webb's defence.</p>
               <p>I was drunk, and I bought some stockings of a young man last Saturday morning; I gave 16 s. for fourteen pair; I had but 2 s. left, and I owed my landlady some money, and I pawned them to raise my rent.</p>
               <p>Taylor's defence.</p>
               <p>Webb is my master; he said he had broke into a little of his landlady's rent, and he sent me to pawn these stockings; we went to the gentleman; he said, how came you by them; Webb said he bought them of a pedlar; Powell said they were bought where we sell oyners, by the Black Horse; then the gentleman said, bring the man to give you a character and I'll buy them.</p>
               <p>Powell's defence.</p>
               <p>Webb called for some purl; we drank it; he bid us both come home; he said he had broke into his rent, and desired us to pawn the stockings to make up his rent, and the stockings were stopped; when he went in at the pawnbroker's, we went out; I pawned one pair at Mr. Bland's for 1 s. and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Webb pawned two pair at one place in a strange name, and a young body pawned two or three pair for him; he said he had bought 14 pair for 16 s. of a pedlar.</p>

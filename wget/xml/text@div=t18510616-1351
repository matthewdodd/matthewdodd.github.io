                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Simpson, and life at Kensington. On Monday evening, 12th May, I left a tea-caddy, looking-glass, and sugar<lb></lb>basin on the window-ledge—I missed them about the middle of the day, Tuesday, and found a pane of glass broken, so that a person from outside could put their arm through and lay hold of the things—in the tea-caddy there was a piece of lace, some buttons, and pins and needles, my property, and forty duplicates which were in my care—these are my caddy and glass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner used to live near me.</p>

That she had been convicted when twelve years old, and, after being confined three months, she, went into an Insti<lb></lb>tution to redeem her character; that after staying there twelve months, she got a situation in a gentleman's family, where she remained five months; and then got another at a pianoforte-makers, and had been there a month, when Bradshaw, a policeman of the T divison, came and informed her master that she had been in custody, and she was discharged next day: that she got another situation, but her master refused to give her a character in consequence of what the policeman had said, and she was then compelled to get her living by prostitution.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Christopher John Armstrong. On the 12th of October, I got into the "Brilliant" omnibus, at High-street Poplar, and was put down at the top of Gracechurch-street—I went in another omnibus to Clapham, and then missed my shawl—I am certain it was in the first omnibus, of which the prisoner was the cad—it was in the day-time—I recollected I had left it in the first omnibus, and got my father next morning to inquire of the prisoner about it—I saw him in company with my father, and asked him if he had seen a shawl which was left on the sent of the omnibus—he said, "No"—I asked him if he could tell me</p>

               <p>where the two ladies lived who were in black, and sat by my side—he said, "No"—I asked him if he could tell me any thing about the shawl—he said, "No"—that was all that passed that morning—this was Wednes<lb></lb>day—I did not see him again till the Saturday morning following, when he came to our house, by himself, and said, "I have seen about your shawl, Ma'am, and you shall have it on Monday"—he had not said he would make inquiry about it—nothing further passed between us—I have not had my shawl since—I have seen one similar to it, but I have no mark on it—I think it is the same pattern, but it has been out of my possession so long.</p>

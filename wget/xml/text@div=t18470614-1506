               <p>On the 8th of June, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and saw some men quarrelling and fighting—I did not go up to them—I only walked by them—the people themselves were throwing stones at one another—the prisoner was seven or eight yards from me—I am quite positive it was him—as I passed he threw a stone at me, which knocked me down—he then ran up and kicked me—he did not come in front of me, but sideways—the stone hit me on the lower jaw, knocked me down, and knocked one of my teeth out—when I fell, he ran up and kicked me on the side of my face—I got up and ran after him—he ran away, and fell down—I overtook him—the policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—I went to the station-house with him, and from there to St. George's Hospital—I am quite certain he is the man—I never lost sight of him.</p>

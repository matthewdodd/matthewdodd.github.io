                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Hill Farm, Woodford-bridge, Essex. On the 17th of November I went to Romford—I returned, and received information about the prisoner, who had been in my employ for about seven years—I had directed him that morning to put two sacks of potatoes into my cellar—I got a policeman, and went and found the pri<lb></lb>soner in the road with a bag of potatoes—I examined them—they were exactly like what I had in my cellar—the sacks in my cellar were defi<lb></lb>cient in quantity—I found thirty pounds of potatoes in the prisoner's bag, but I missed more than that.</p>

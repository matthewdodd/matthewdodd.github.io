               <p>Spencer. I am an Irishman. The prisoner knocked me down about twelve at night, July the 9th, in <placeName id="t17690906-63-crimeloc339">Chick-lane</placeName>

I had been there to see a friend of mine home. There were five more along with the prisoner. They held me down. I struggled as hard as I could. They took my shoes, metal buckles, and three pennyworth of half-pence out of my pocket, and my hat from my head. They left me a pair of old slippers and an old hat, and said, Change was no robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Spencer. It was a star light night, and I knew the prisoner right well; he was in the same dress as now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call for assistance?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I durst not speak a word. They gave me a lick. When they had taken all from me, they went away, and I followed them. I went into Smithfield, and saw the prisoner sitting at the Ram door; the lamp was over the door. The watch was coming crying the hour; I charged the watch with him. He got away, but was taken the next day, by the tokens I had given of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the tokens you gave of him?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I described him in a gentleman-servant's dress, and a brown coat. The constable has my shoes.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There were two women in company with the men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>J. Williams. The prosecutor described a man something like a footman. I remembered I saw such a man going my round. I did not catch him that night, but I did the next day at the One Tun in Field-lane, and the woman that turned evidence swore the prisoner was the man that robbed the prosecutor. The next day, when the prosecutor saw the shoes, he directed me to her, but she was not to be found. He owned the fact<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060043"></xptr> before my Lord Mayor and me. He said another man persuaded him to do it, and helped to hold the prosecutor while he robbed him. He owned he was the man that took the shoes from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the shoes?</p>
               <p>J. Williams. I am a shoemaker. The prosecutor told me they had taken his shoes from him. I went to enquire about Field-lane, and found them at one Elson's, where the prisoner had sold them. (The shoes produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A man that works in lodgings made them for me.</p>

            . I bought these shoes of the prisoner at the bar, on the 10th of July. ( Holding them in his hand.) I did not know him before, but I knew him again when I saw him before my Lord Mayor. I changed another pair for them, with giving him a shilling to boot; these I value at two shillings and nine-pence. I was informed I should be all the money out of pocket, so I persuaded him to give me mine again; this was when he was going to gaol; when he came to me, he had the shoes on his feet, and said he gave six shillings and six-pence for them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These shoes are my property, there are two rows of nails round the heels.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On a Monday morning, about ten o'clock, my father gave me four shillings to buy a pair of shoes; going down Snow-hill, I saw a Jew coming along, with those shoes in his hand; he said he would sell them worth the money, if I would buy them. He asked three shillings for them; I bid him half a crown; at last I bought them for three shillings: I carried them home to my father, but they were too big for my father; my father lives in Grub-street; he is a shoemaker; I am a porter for him. He had not time to make them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. Did the prosecutor always give the same account as now?</p>
               <p>Williams. He always did, only in a blundering way.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a blundering way?</p>
               <p>Williams. He is an Irishman.</p>

I told them I was neither able nor willing to resist them, and hoped they would not use me ill: two of them held me by the arms, whilst the third rifled my pockets: they took from me my watch, and half a guinea, and about nine shillings. One of the robbers was in a white coat of the make and size of the prisoner at the bar; I saw his face very plainly more than once during the robbery, and verily believe the prisoner is the man, but I dare not positively sware to him; but this I do positively sware, that a man was coming up the hill and near us, while the robbery was committing, and the man in the white coat went to him and bid him retire, or he would beat or blow out his brains, or to that effect. I little thought to have heard any thing of the robbers; but the next day, my wife having occasion to buy something in the neighbourhood, heard that there had been a robbery committed in that place the night before: that one Perrin saw the robbery, and knew one of the robbers; he is servant to one Mr. Brumley: I sent for him; he came; I asked him, whether he had seen a robbery on the hill the night before; he said he had; I asked him, what part of the hill: he said, that part that is over against Hog-Island, which was the very place. I saw the prisoner in New prison the day after his apprehension, and I had a strong remembrance of his countenance  but don't sware he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>

            . On Friday night the 10th of March, about eleven o'clock, as I was going from Mr. Brumley's still-house to Gray's-Inn-Lane for a pint of beer, as near as I can remember, on Mount Pleasant I heard a gentleman say, take what I have got and welcome, but don't use me ill. I was got near, but drove back by the prisoner at the bar; he held a stick up to me, and said, d - n your eyes if you don't turn back again about your business, I'll knock your brains out; he was in a white duffil coat. I retired and went directly into the still-house, and there staid: I told two of our men, that had just come out of the tun from throwing off the grains of it; and that I knew one of them very well; and that the other men that was with him were rifling the gentleman they were robbing, while he came to me.</p>

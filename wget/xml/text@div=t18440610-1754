                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Teasdale, of Lisson-grove. The prisoner called several times—he said he was a dealer in different articles, and he came on the 1st of June and wished me to let him have some shawls to show to some customer—I went out with him to show these shawls to his customer—he wished me to go on and said he would overtake me—he told me to go next door to Mr. Batton's, a pawnbroker, in John-street, Edgeware-road—I went, and found it was a rag and bottle-shop on one side, and a chemist's on the other—he did not overtake me, but I went and inquired if any one there wanted any shawls, and there was no one wanted any—I went back to my shop and missed these articles—I did not see the prisoner again till he was at the Police Court, but I had seen him several times before that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter of Christiana Teasdale. On the 1st of June the prisoner and my mother left the shop together—in about two minutes he came back—he said, "O, they want to see the candlesticks and the decanters"—he took one pair of candlesticks and the decanters—I handed him another pair of candlesticks—he went down the opposite street—in about two minutes he came back again, and said, "There is one thing I have forgot<lb></lb>ten, and that is the shoes"—he took one pair, I handed him another pair, and he went away down the same street—I did not see him again.</p>

I went to No. 7, Brownlow-street, Lock's Fields, Walworth—I saw the prisoner there, and said I wanted him for obtaining two pairs of plated candlesticks, a pair of cut decanters, and two pairs of men's shoes, at Mrs. Teasdale's, at Lisson-grove—he said he had them, but he intended to pay for them—another officer, who was with me, found 105 duplicates at his lodging.</p>

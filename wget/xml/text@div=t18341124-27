                  </hi>. I live in Ball-alky, Lomboard-street, with my father, who is a hair-dresser. I have an uncle named Frank Wisdom—when he left town be left his carpenter's tools with me to dispose of, and to send the money to him—on Wednesday evening, the 29th of October I took some planes in a basket to Dye's beer-shop, is Finsbury-market—I left them there, not wishing to take them home that evening—they belonged to Wisdom—I saw them safe these next morning, when I showed them to two persons who wished to buy them—I missed them that evening—a young man had said in the prisoner's presence, that he would take me where I could sell them in the afternoon—Abbott said, "Remember you come"—I said I would if I could, but I went to the West-end, of the town—I left the prisoners outside the door when I went away—I could not go is the afternoon, but went about seven o'clock in the evening—I then only found the lid of the basket—I saw some of the tools exposed for sale at Bales' door, in Old-street-road, about twelve o'clock next day—I gave the prisoners in charge in consequence of suspicion—I said I gave them in charge for stealing the planes—Abbott said, "What, me steal the planes!"—I fetched the broker, and he identified him as the person who sold them.</p>

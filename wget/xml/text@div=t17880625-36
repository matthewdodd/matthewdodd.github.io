               <p>I carried the mourning ring to Mr. Bunn's, I got it from the prisoner between the hours of five and six, I chare for her; I was passing by the door, and she asked me if I would go of an errand to pledge the ring for her, I took it to Mr. Bunn's and he refused it, I told him I had it from the prisoner; I then went back, and the prisoner sent her daughter, who is about ten years of age, with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was the first that was stopt with the ring? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And desired to give an account of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came Mrs. Wylae to ask you why you did not come on the Monday, was not she angry with you? - She was.</p>
               <p>Did not she use hard names? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>I shall soon make that appear, will you swear she did not? - She did not.</p>
               <p>Then she was not angry? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Which do you mean to say, you have sworn both? - I do not know she was.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she displeased? - She was a little or so.</p>
               <p>Well, do not you know, that if you had not shifted this ring to Mrs. Wylae, you must have answered for it, and been tried for it? - I do not know, she took it off her finger and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Court. When you was first questioned about the ring, did not you know that unless you produced the person who gave it to you, you would have been liable to have been tried for it yourself? - Yes, my Lord; I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What do you mean by your having said you never was in a scrape before; do you mean you never was taken up? - I never was.</p>
               <p>When you returned from Bunn's, was she at home? - She was.</p>
               <p>You was taken into custody? - I was; I was in the Counter from Monday till Saturday.</p>

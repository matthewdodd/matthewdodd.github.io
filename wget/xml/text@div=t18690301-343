I reside at No. 13, Cavendish Road, St. John's Wood, and am cook to Mrs. Baugham, the mistress of the house—I sleep down stairs—I went into the kitchen about 4.45 in the morning, to light the kitchen fire, and afterwards turned round to look at the clock—the fire began to burn up, and I saw something in a corner—I took a few steps towards it, and the prisoner turned round and looked at me—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "Let me out, cook"—I said, "No, you don't go out till someone takes you"—I went to the door, and one of the servants said, "Who have you got in the kitchen?"—I said, "Go and call master and one of the men servants"—I got the laundry-maid to hold the door, and went to the gate, got a policeman, and brought him in—there were no men in the house at all, no master or men servants—111<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. came and took the prisoner into custody—I had closed the house up safe the night before, about 1.30, and the things were all put away—when I went into the kitchen in the morning I found the coffee-pot and other things on the table in a table-cloth; they had been removed from where I put them the night before—the scullery window had been broken open and the bar taken out—I found the prisoner's boots at the bottom of the kitchen stairs—I would not give them to him till the policeman came—I picked up a screw-driver on the floor, and gave it to the constable—I had left my purse on the kitchen table at night, with two sixpences and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—after the prisoner was taken I found the purse on the floor, but the money was gone.</p>

When the prisoner was in custody, I went to 13, Cavendish Road, and found the iron bar had been wrenched from the scullery window, and the lower sash pushed in—there were some matches on the floor, and the cupboards had been broken open—the marks on the cupboards corresponded with the screw-driver found in the kitchen.</p>

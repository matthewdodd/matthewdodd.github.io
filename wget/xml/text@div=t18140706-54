            . I am a watchman of High-street, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. On this Sunday morning, about one o'clock, did you hear the cry of stop thief - A. I did. I pursued the prisoner, and took him; he dropped the watch when I had hold of him; I picked it up. This is the watch that he dropped.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I implore the humane attention of the court, I having no friend alive, nor have I the means of retaining able counsel in the law to defend me. I trust I shall receive an impartial hearing. It is painful and awful for me to enter into this charge. It is the first time in my life I have had to answer for a dishonest act. I have been faithful in serving my king and country fifteen years. I am a native of Liverpool; and since my discharge I have been employed in the docks of London and Dentford. On Saturday night, the 2nd of July, about the hour of one and two in the morning, the prosecutor was robbed in Whitechapel; the watch was found upon me. With regard to any knowledge in me how the watch was taken; all I know, I never took the watch. As to the assault, I am not able to describe, from the very forward state of liquor I was in. Unhappily, from a fracture in my head, when I take any drink I have not the ability of knowing what I do. I hope and trust in some measure that may extenuate some part of the crime, and from every circumstance ariseing in my favour, where there is a doubt I hope I may receive the benefit of that doubt, and I shall how to the verdict of the court.</p>

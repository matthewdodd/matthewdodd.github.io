                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Littleworth-end, Mortlake. I know the prisoner—in the beginning of Dec., I had a male child of hers in my care—it was about five months old when I first had it, and I had it eight or nine weeks—it was a delicate child—the prisoner was wet nurse at Mr. Carless's, at Richmond—I have a daughter living there—the prisoner told me, when she placed the child with me, that it was her own, and she wished to change it for the benefit of its health—she did not say whether she had a husband or no—she said the father of the child was a German, and had gone back to Germany—it was called Henry Robert—she used to come to see the child; generally on a Sunday—to all appearance she behaved very kindly to it—on Tuesday, 2nd Dec., she came between 2 and 3 o'clock—she said she had been after a situation in London—the baby was then lying in a little cot near the fire—she took the baby up—I had to go up stairs—I left no one there but the prisoner and the baby—there was no one else rending in the house—when I had been up stairs some minutes I heard the baby coughing very much—I came down stairs to receive a letter from a servant of Mies King's—I then went up again—I heard the baby coughing very violently when I was up stairs again, and I came down a second time to see what was the matter—I took it out of the prisoner's arm—she took it again instantly out of my arms, and hushed it, got it quiet, and laid it down in the cot again—when I took the infant I perceived a smell of turpentine, and I said to the prisoner, "What a strong smell there is of turpentine"—she said she thought the young woman that brought the letter might have brought it in—this was about twenty minutes after that—I did not smell any smell of turpentine when I came down to take the letter from the young woman—I had no turpentine in the house—the prisoner went away in about a quarter of an hour after she had taken the child from me—I was in the room when she went away—I had been up stairs again for about two minutes; she wished me good bye in a great hurry, as if she was flurried—the child was then in its cot, apparently asleep—about five minutes afterwards I went to the child, and took it out of the cot; its appearance very much frightened me, its little eyes were fixed, and its mouth foaming as if he was going into convulsions—it was sick; that must have saved its life—what it threw up smelt very strong of turpentine, and what passed through its</p>

I went there with a letter from Miss King—I went into the downstairs room—the door opens into the room—I found the prisoner there, sitting down, with the baby in her arms—nobody else was with her—I went through to the stairs and called Mrs. Keele—she came down, and I gave her the letter—I observed the baby when I was there—it was coughing very violently—the prisoner was trying to quiet it—I said to her, "The baby seems very ill"—she said, "Yes, poor little dear, it is"—I did not take any turpentine into the house or do any<lb></lb>thing with any.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Mortlake—about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of the 2nd Dec., I was called on by Mrs. Keele—I went to her cottage, and saw the baby there—on entering the room, I smelt it very strong of turpentine, immediately I opened the door—the child was cold and pulseless, and quite comatose—it had vomited on the carpet, which I saw, and which smelt of turpentine—the child's breath smelt strong of turpentine—there was redness about the mouth, on the neck, and also on one of the eyelids, and the clothes about the neck were saturated with turpentine—I was told that it had had some medicine administered to it before I got there—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. KEELE</hi>. Miss King gave it some castor oil, and a little weak brandy-and-water—she was in the act of giving it when Mr. Palmer came in)—I ordered some salad oil to be administered to it, and to be put into a warm bath—I considered that the child had had turpentine administered to it by the mouth—in consequence of that, I gave information to sergeant Davis—I saw the child again in about half an hour—it was then much the same—I saw it again in about two and a half or three hours—it was then slightly better—there had been mucous diarrhœa, that smelt very strong indeed of turpentine—the secretion from the kidneys was mixed up with the evacua<lb></lb>tions of the bowels, and all passed together, and all smelt of turpentine very strongly indeed—I saw the child for the last time about 1 o'clock in the morning—it was then becoming more sensible, but it had very severe diarrhœa, still strongly impregnated with turpentine—I could not form any judgment as to how much turpentine had been given; considering the amount spilt on the clothes and about the neck—I should imagine there could not have been much less than half an ounce of turpentine used, so far as I could judge; some spilt on the outside, and some getting inside—no doubt the child must have taken some, or it could not have passed through the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in practice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just about 11 years, at Mortlake all that time—when I was called in I found the child pulseless and comatose—those are the ordinary symptoms of convulsions—I believe it had no teeth; the process of teething may have been going on—turpentine is frequently used as a medicine, in minimum, medium, and maximum doses—I believe it has been given to adults in large doses—I have read Dr. Duncan's works, but not of late years—I believe it to be the case that 4oz. has been given in one dose, without any perceptible bad effect, and scarcely more inconvenience than would follow from an equal quantity of gin—there are certain standard medical works on poisons—turpentine is not included in the list of poisons in those works—the smell derived from turpentine in the <hi rend="italic">fœces</hi> in not of a violet kind; the urine has that smell—in this case the urine and the <hi rend="italic">fœces</hi> were passed together, and the smell of turpentine pervaded the whole—I have not noticed that all the secretions have the violet smell, they had not in this case, certainly—the operations of the secretions are generally uniform—in this case the odour of the turpentine was so strong that it pervaded everything—the odour of turpentine is exceedingly strong—it is generally used medicinally for worms, we also use it as a diuretic, and for rheumatism; and in puerperal fever, both externally and internally—I never knew of its being administered for cough—I have known it used as an embrocation on the chest, but not administered—I know nothing about the practice in Germany.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is turpentine used as a medicine for children six months old? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never knew that it was at so early an age—I believe it has been used in infantile diseases—it is administered to adults for tape</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185612150109"></xptr>
               <p>worm, I know no other case in which it would be largely administered—if the whole of the half ounce had been taken by the child, it would have acted as a narcotico irritant; I should have expected the child to have had irritation of the intestinal canal, producing diarrhoea and inflammation, and that it would also produce convulsions with stupor and coma; it would most probably have terminated in death—there is no doubt about it—it would act as an irritant poison, given to an infant of that age—convulsions resulting from the administration of turpentine would be the same as ordinary convulsions, the symptoms likely to arise would be the same as in ordinary convulsions—I believe that the child had taken turpentine internally—I judge so from the symptoms I saw at the time—them were symptoms of its being need externally as well as internally—I cannot say that the use of it as an embrocation would have accounted for what I saw—I saw nothing to show that it had been applied to the child for the purpose of curing a cough—the appearances were consistent with there having been an administration, and a part of it going outside and part of it inside—I could not form any judgment as to how much had passed its mouth, it would be impossible to answer that question; the half ounce if merely speculative on my part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite confident that there was the smell in the faces? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite confident, for I examined it on four occasions, up to the second day—that satisfies me that some turpentine had been taken inter<lb></lb>nally—the clothes were so saturated with turpentine, that they were wet with it—the room smelt very strong of turpentine; but I could not have mistaken that for the smell from the fæ, for the child was removed to the house of Miss King the same night, for greater domestic comfort; and there was the smell of turpentine the next day—what it had taken had produced the most serious symptoms, and if it had not been attended to as it was, I think it would have died—I think, if it had not been relieved, turpen<lb></lb>tine the it had taken would have destroyed its life—the brandy and water it had taken was so slight, and so weak, that it had very little effect one way or the other—I do not attribute any harm to that; I came in as they were in the act of giving it, and stopped it; I did not see how much it had—the child was comatose when I went in—turpentine would act as intoxicating, like any other ardent spirit.</p>

On 2nd Dec., about a quarter past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in consequence of information, I went to Mrs. Keele's house—on opening the door I smelt a very strong smell of tur<lb></lb>pentine; I saw the child lying in the cot—I have produced its clothes to-day—when they were delivered to me they were wet about the breast; they were given to me that day; I asked for them, they smelt very strongly in<lb></lb>deed of turpentine—near 8 o'clock that night, I went to Mr. Carlsss's house at Richmond—I found the prisoner there—I asked her if she had been to see her child that day; she said she had—I asked her if she had been using turpentine during the day, for any purpose whatever—she said she had not—I then told her she was suspected of administering oil, or spirits of turpen<lb></lb>tine, to her child, at Mortlake, and for that I should take her into custody—she said she had not done so.</p>

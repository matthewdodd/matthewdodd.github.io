Mr. Pratt. and the two churchwardens, came to our ward, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150014"></xptr>consequence of a disturbance in the ward. Five or six men came and took the deceased from the side of my bed, and carried him down stairs; I went and told Mr. Smith, the master, of it, and then went down to the cellar-the door was fast, I could not get in; when I did get in, the deceased was extended by his two hands, tied to the beam, with rope-yarns. Mr. Smith untied him; I assisted him up stairs. He said he was very much hurt. I did not see the prisoner in the cellar.</p>

            . I was in the workhouse on the 10th of December last; the deceased was talking to the last witness, and some men came behind and snatched him up very suddenly; I followed them into the cellar-in a few minutes, the deceased was tied up to the beam by his hands, his feet touched the ground; his coat was tucked up, and a man gave him several strokes on his loins with the stave of a butter-tub: somebody was counting the strokes. When I first got down, they said eight. I heard he was to have two dozen. When he had received one dozen, the weapon was shifted into another hand. Only two persons struck him while I was there. I did not know them; I believe the prisoners were in the room at the time, they were paupers in the house. I saw the deceased the next day; he was a weak man, and in a declining state before; he said he was very much hurt, and complained of his loins being sore, several times.</p>

            . I was in the cellar at the time the deceased was brought down; I do not know who brought him down-there might be fifty persons in the cellar; the prisoner, Saint, tied him up. They both struck him with the stave of a butter-tub; the deceased cried murder. It might last ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I was in the oakum cellar. This punishment had not been inflicted often; the deceased was a weak man. I heard of his being hurt with the scales, about sixteen days after this transaction, and he died almost immediately after that.</p>

            . I am the door-keeper of the workhouse. I saw the deceased frequently after the transaction; he always appeared sickly, but he then appeared to be worse; he was forty-seven years of age. On the 10th of December, I was sent up into the ward, and saw him bleeding at the nose and mouth; he died two minutes afterwards. He bled a chamber utensil three parts full of blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. I had heard of his receiving an injury in the soup-room. He died the same day that he received that injury.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK AGER. I am a surgeon. I was called in on the 20th of December, to examine the body of the deceased; there were some blows about his back which had been done some time: in my judgment, they were not the cause of his death. I opened his body, and found the appearance of a blood-vessel being reptured. I have no doubt but the rupture, and the blood discharged from it, was the cause of his death. That could not have taken place so early as the 10th of December, it is impossible.</p>

               <p>Our house was broke open on the 2d of November, about seven in the morning. My husband and I went out at two o'clock; I went out a washing; my husband locked the door. I came home between four and five in the afternoon, and found the door wrenched open; there was no one in the house when I went out; the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) were locked up in my trunk; they were all missing. I had met the prisoner some days before; she asked charity of me, and said she had lost her husband, and had been obliged to pawn her clothes. I gave her some victuals, and let her lie all night by my fire; she said she was going into the country. I told her in the morning I could not keep her any longer, and sent her away; she went away about ten o'clock. I saw her afterwards in London with my hat, cap, and apron on; when she saw me she ran away as fast as she could; I cried, stop thief! and she was secured; she then confessed she had pawned my things, but would not tell me where.</p>

               <p>Did you buy any lead of Baptist and Sewell in November, 1783? - Yes, I think I did; I think I bought as much as came to 20 s. of Sewell and Baptist, and one Atkins, and Collins, and one or two more; I think it came to 20 s. the lead was very old, and much decayed.</p>
               <p>Could you form any opinion to what it had been applied? - It had the appearance of old decayed sheet lead.</p>

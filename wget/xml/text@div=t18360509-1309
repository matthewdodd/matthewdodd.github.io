                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Carpenter, a pawnbroker, on the 19th of December the prisoner pawned this pair of boots at our shop, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman, Mr. Peate spoke to me respecting the prisoner on the 19th of December, and I went to Carpenter's the pawnbroker's, and saw a pair of boots—I took one to Mr. Peate, and he instructed me to go to pawnbrokers to look for property—I appre<lb></lb>hended the prisoner in consequence of what occurred in January.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

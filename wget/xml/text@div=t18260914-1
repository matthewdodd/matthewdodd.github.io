I hallooed out three times, and then Roberts fell on my head. Cole and Roberts got from me, and crossed the road; Mack then turned down to the right. - I had felt a hand come out of my pocket, where I had 10s. 6d.; directly I got up I felt, and found only 1s. left: I ran after Mack, but could not catch him; I could discern their clothes, but not their faces - I had never seen them before. I saw them in Edgware-road on the Tuesday following, about ten o'clock in the morning, all three sitting together - I had nobody to assist me, and said nothing to them; Cole had a black coat, with the tail torn off, and black trousers - Mack, a long blue coat and blue trousers - Roberts, a light fustian jacket and corded trousers; they were dressed the same on Sunday - they appeared to be the same persons by their size and dress. - I saw them again together on the Friday, in Edgware-road, dressed as before; I got the officers to take them then. I can only swear to them by their clothes.</p>

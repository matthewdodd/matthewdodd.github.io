                  </hi>. I live in Annett's Crescent, Lower-road, Islington. On the evening of the 5th of March, about a quarter to seven o'clock, I was returning down Canonbury-park alone—I overtook the prisoner in Canonbury-park—I passed him—he afterwards came by my side, and said, "Some of your money if you please "—I perceived nothing in his hand then—I said I had no money—he then placed himself before me and presented a pistol—he held it before me, presented it, and almost touched my bonnet with the muzzle—I begged of him not to hurt me when I saw the pistol—he said, "I will not hurt you, but I am sure you have some money in your pocket"—I told him I had none, and said, "I hear people coming, let me pass"—he said, "Do not say a word, and I will let you pass; I am forced to do it, I can't help it"—he then let me go, and I went home—the prisoner is the man that stopped me—he was dressed in a white jacket—I cannot swear to what kind of an article it was—it was particularly white and clean—I know it was the time I state—I was coming from Islington—I had gone out at five o'clock merely into the town—I left Islington about half-past six o'clock—it is not quite half a mile from there to Canonbury-park—I walked straight to the park.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received a description of a person charged with stopping the prosecutrix—the description was left at the sta<lb></lb>tion-house where I received it—I did not have it from her—I took the prisoner on another charge on Monday night, the 16th—I informed the prosecutrix I had taken a person answering the description she had given—I took him in Windsor-street, leading out of Britannia-fields—I searched the house he lodged at, but found no flannel jacket.</p>

Q.</hi> Was the description given as a man in a flannel jacket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The features of the man and the stoutness answered the description—he was described as five feet eight inches, rather stout and a fresh complexion—the description was a man in a white jacket—the pri<lb></lb>soner had not on a white jacket when I apprehended him—I have no re-collection of ever seeing him before—he had on the jacket he has on now—he was also described as having on dark striped trowsers and a dark waistcoat—he had a dark waistcoat on—the description given to me was dark striped trowsers—I searched the house in Windsor-street for a white jacket, but found none—I have made inquiry about to find out any body who had seen the prisoner in a white jacket, but I have brought no evi<lb></lb>dence of the sort.</p>

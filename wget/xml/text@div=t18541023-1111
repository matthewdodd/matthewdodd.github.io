                  </hi>. I am the wife of Stephen Bishop, of No. 11, Red Lion-square; he is a draper and silk mercer. On Monday evening, 17th July, I went to bed about half-past 1 o'clock—I had seen the house fastened at half-past 11 or 12 o'clock—about 7 o'clock on the morning of the 18th my servant spoke to me, and I found that the shop door was open and the street door only on the latch—the back parlour window was open and the blind pinned up, not drawn—there is a door from the shop to the back parlour—the lock of that door had been forced, so that the thieves must have come in at the back window—I missed property to the amount of between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a large amount of silk handkerchiefs were missing—this is one (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>); this is one that I missed—I know it by the corner where the gum ticket was on, and that has been removed, and likewise by its being the outside handkerchief of the piece—the hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs were in a piece, and this was the outside one—I had folded that piece of handkerchiefs on the Saturday night, and there were two marks down the sides of this one, which I pointed out to the policeman—it was perfectly new, and the marks were fresh—I cannot distinguish those marks so plainly now—they were distinguishable when I saw this handkerchief at the station on the night of the 18th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness, and I live in the house. I have not the least doubt that this is one of my handkerchiefs—I always put a gum ticket on the side of the handkerchiefs, which is an unusual thing; and that has been removed—they are generally pinned on—here is where the ticket has been taken off—when I saw this handker<lb></lb>chief last it was in a drawer under the counter in my shop, with many others; I do not know how many, I think nearly a whole piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I live as servant at No. 11, Red Lion-square. On the morning after the robbery I came down about 7 o'clock, and found both the shop doors open, the parlour window open, and the blind rolled up and pinned—a number of lucifer matches were lying about the table—the street door was unfastened, but the door was shut—the door leading from the shop to the parlour was wide open—I saw that it was shut and locked the night before—two drawers in the shop were open, and a great many goods were gone.</p>

I went to the house No. 11, Red Lion-square, on the morning of the 18th—I examined the premises, as the house had been broken open—I made inquiries, and found the prisoner, at 8 o'clock the same evening, in a crowd at a fire in Broad-street) Blooms<lb></lb>bury—he was in company with another person—I took the prisoner into custody, and gave the other person to another officer—the prisoner said, "What are you taking me for?"—I said, "I am going to take you inside the station to see if a man can identify you as being seen in a certain place at 2 o'clock this morning"—he replied, "I can prove the contrary of that; I was in bed at half-past 12; I slept in Welsh's-court, High-street, St. Giles"—I took him to the station, and found on his neck this new black silk handkerchief, and in his pocket an old handkerchief as though it had been just taken off; it was an old satin tie—I said to him, "Where did you get this?" meaning the new one I took off his neck—he said he bought it of a man in Smithfield—I found on him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I sent to the prosecutor's, and Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both came to the station—Pethers, the constable, was there, and he said, "That is the man," meaning the prisoner, "that I saw with another man and a woman in front of Mr. Bishop's shop, or close to Mr. Bishop's house, at 10 minutes to 2 o'clock this morning"—the prisoner made some reply; I think he said, "No, you did not see me there"—Pethers said, "Yes, I did; I went up and spoke to you, and drove you down to the King's-road"—I showed the black handkerchief to Mrs. Bishop, and she immediately identified it—I first showed it her at half past 8 or a quarter before 9 o'clock the same evening—she pointed out a mark; she said she could see the folds where she had folded it on the Saturday evening—I do not recollect that she pointed out any marks down the side—she pointed to the folds, and said it was the outside handkerchief of the piece.</p>

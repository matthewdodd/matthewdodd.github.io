When I returned from dinner, I asked how he was? he said, "Very sick" - he had then taken the medicine and hour and a half - he took it exactly at ten minutes to twelve o'clock, and it was twenty minutes past when he went into the yard - he still complained of being very sick, but brought very little up, except some green yellow stuff - I went to him several times, found him very sick, and advised him to walk about, as it would operate better - at four o'clock, I asked him down to tea; he said he had rather have it sent up - it was sent up; he took some, but eat nothing - a little before five o'clock, he came down into the kitchen, drew a chair to the fire, and leaned his head on the table, and at short intervals vomited - my wife advised him to take some warm water, which he declined; I said I thought he had better take the other half, but he did not. I came down about seven o'clock, and thought he was asleep; I said to my wife he had better not sleep there; he said,"I am not asleep, I had rather sit by the fire, as I feel so sick" - I then went out and found his parents at a chapel, told them of it, and said I thought he had not taken sufficient; they advised me to persuade him to take the rest; I went home and found my wife had just put him to bed; she went up to him a little before ten o'clock, he appeared asleep, and she brought the light down - a man named Harris went up about a quarter to eleven, and he thought him asleep; he slept in the next bed - I went up about ten minutes to seven o'clock in the morning, and he said he was very sick every now and then, but in no pain except in his head, putting his hand to his forehead - I sent for Mr. Whitmore, and about half-past ten o'clock the boy died. He was opened next morning, in my presence - there were four surgeons. The prisoner had never said how much the two or three pennyworth of fox-glove would produce - the bottle was about three-parts full; he did not give him quite half; here is the bottle, with the remainder of the stuff in it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Coldbath-square - I have been practising for seventeen or eighteen years. I was called in about half-past seven o'clock last Thursday morning, and found the boy la<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260102"></xptr>bouring under symptoms common to vegetable nancatle poison, and under some symptoms peculiar to a preparation of fox-glove - his pulse was slow, weak, and very irregular; his extremities cold, and the pupil of the eye ceased to obey the rays of light - I had the room darkened, called for a candle, and found the pupil would not contract and dilate. I was told he had taken fox-glove, and the symptoms agreed with that; they could not have deceived me if they had tried, as he had taken such an immense quantity - I ordered him braudy every ten minutes, gave him medicine, and ordered him blisters; but he died while they were preparing. I afterwards opened his body, and there was an absence of all disease that might have produced death. Death is produced by vegetable poison, not by occasioning disease, but by lessening the energy of the nervous system, so that the heart and all the energies cease to act. I have no doubt the decoction of fox-glove caused his death; it is a medicine which is admiaistered in similar cases. The boy had been under my care for two months, and I had repeatedly administered it to him, properly guarded; it was a case in which I judged it right - I administered it to him successfully, I think, as his health was restored, and he returned to work. I cannot say how much would be sold for 2d. or 3d.; the prisoner told me, in the Coroner's Jury-room, that he had boiled down 4 ozs., which was a greater quantity than I thought - from measuring the cup, the boy must have taken about 51/2 ozs. of the stuff, as 61/2 ozs. are left in the bottle, which makes 12 ozs., which 4 ozs. would produce. It is impossible such a quantity could be given without danger; from calculation, I find the quantity of decoction twenty-four times the strength our College orders us to make, and then he had given him six times the quantity beyond our extreme dose, and twelve or fifteen times the quantity beyond the common dose. Nothing but complete ignorance could have led to such a dose being given - in my opinion, it must have produced death - I should have thought five or seven drops of this mixture a proper dose. I have seen the book the prisoner has published, and am sorry to say, it will produce much mischief, if acted upon. I remember a case where an undue and uncertain quantity of fox-glove was given, and was unexpectedly beneficial, but I do not know how much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Collingwood-street, Black<lb></lb>friars-road. On the 17th of August, about half-pact eleven o'clock at night, I was going over Blackfriars-bridge, and saw the prisoner on the parapet, with her legs over—I said, "Are you going to drown yourself?"—she said, "What has that to do with you?"—I said, "You had better come back"—she directly came back, caught hold of some gentleman's arm that was coming over the bridge at the time, and went down Blackfriars-road with him—about half-past three, I saw her again on the same parapet—she had then thrown herself but some female had hold of her clothes—her apron was down on the stone that projects over the parapet—we got her over, and I fetched the police—she seemed to have been drinking a little.</p>

               <p>three o'clock—I went up to the recess—the prisoner was then sitting down, apparently in a very exhausted state, and fainting—we brought her to—several people, there said they had saved her by pulling her back—when we got her a little way towards the station she made another effort to get to the parapet, and would have thrown herself over had we not prevented her—she clung round the coping, with both arms over—she appeared to be in a frantic state—she said she was determined to do it—she certainly had been drinking, but was far from being intoxicated—she talked very rationally in going to the station—she said at the station that she was an unfortunate girl; that she had had a child by a young man who had deserted her, and it was him, and him alone, that had caused her to attempt to do this—she said the child was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Watt, a grocer, of Park-terrace, Liverpool-road. On the 10th of May the prisoner came to the shop, he said he was in the service of William Hunt, and asked me to show him some shoe-brushes—I showed him a box containing several—he took three—he asked me the price—I said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each"—he said, "Put them down to my <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>, you know who I mean"—I said, "You mean Hunt, across the way?"—he said. "Yes"—that is Mr. Hunt, a stable-keeper—he took the brushes away—on the afternoon of the same day he came again, and brought the brushes back, saying he would exchange them for three others, as Mr. Hunt supposed the first expense would be the least, and he would have a better quality—he then asked for a body-brush for the bodies and insides of carriages—he asked me the price—I told him they were marked outside—he had four brushes, three in exchange, and one extra—he said he would exchange them for Hunt, and that his master would come in the course of the week and settle for them—he took them away with him—he gave me his name, as Harry Smith—when he came a second time, he said, "It is cus<lb></lb>tomary for us men to have an invoice, merely to show our employer—I gave it him—on Friday, the 14th, he came again for a bottle of blacking—he took up a bottle of blacking, saying, "Add this to the brushes," and took it away.</p>

On Sunday, the 16th of May, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at a public-house at Enfield, quarrelling about a dog—I observed his person, and asked him what he had got in his pocket—he refused to tell me—he after<lb></lb>wards said they were brushes—I asked where he got them—he refused to ay—I took him to the station, and found four brushes and a bottle of</p>

On Sunday morning, 5th July, I was with a friend in the Regent's Park—at about half past 4 o'clock my attention was directed to No. 5, Cambridge Terrace, by what I thought was a bang at the door, a loud slap—I saw the prisoner Smith on the step of the door, and Morley on the pavement close to him—I then saw them go to the carriage way of the crescent, and come out to towards the Park; they went across the park railings—I followed them up till I reached the constable—I saw the con stables standing in the distance; the prisoners were going towards them—I gave the constables the alarm; I sung out, "Stop them!"—when I got up to the constables I gave Morley into custody—the constables said, "What do you charge this man with?"—I said, "Coming out of a house in Cam<lb></lb>bridge Terrace"—the said, "Can you show me the house?"—Morley, when I said, "Coming out of the house," made the remark, "You do not mean me"—I went with the constables, and showed them the house—after we got out of the Park we met a third constable, and close to the station Mor<lb></lb>ley was in the act of pulling out a pistol at the constable—Smith was in custody when I went round and showed them the house.</p>

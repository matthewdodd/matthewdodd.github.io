                  </hi>. I live at Hartland Road, Kentish Town—on 15th December, about half-past eleven, I was in the Hampstead Road, going towards home—Cooper accosted me and induced me to go to a public-house—it was late and the bar was being turned out, so the landlord would not draw anything to drink there—she appeared to be known to him and he drew her a gallon of beer in a jar, which I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—I afterwards went home with her—another woman was there—I was there for about half an hour—when I wanted to go away she took my hat—some one I supposed to be the landlord, demanded 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me—I said I would not pay—a little time after that Connor came in and demanded 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said Cooper was his wife and that he should have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he found I would not give it he knocked me against the wall, hitting me at the same time—Cooper struck me, too, seven or eight times—then Connor put his right arm round my neck, and with his left extracted 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a latch-key from my pocket—he then said I had more money than that—I told him I had not—he tried to get my coat off—by this time I was beginning to get half stupefied, and, believing their meaning was that I should not get out of the house alive, I got out of the room on to the landing and rushed to the staircase window—the prisoners ran after me and tried to keep me back—I broke the window in trying to get out, and sang out "Police! murder!"—I then rushed over the stairs, holding my head, half insensible, and a policeman was outside the door when I got there—I asked where the beer was when I was there, and Cooper gave me three parts of a cup full—I saw nothing of the jar of beer—I was not drinking with the woman when Connor came in—I never said I would give them a song.</p>

Early on Sunday morning, 16th December, I heard a window smashing, and cries of "Murder!" and "Police!"—Burns came out of 17, Mary's Place, with both hands up to his head, and blood all over the side of his head—he described the parties who had done it, and, knowing them well, I went upstairs into the front room, where I knew Connor was living with his mother—I did not find him there—I then went into the back room and saw him behind the door, and Cooper and another woman—I said, "Connor, I want you for assaulting a man and robbing him"—Cooper said, "He didn't have his money, I had it"—I said, "At any rate, I shall take you, Connor, from the description the man gave me"—Burns had gone into the front room with me—he came into the back room and said, "That's the man that robbed me"—Connor then made use of a fearful expression, and said we should not take him out of that room—another constable was there—we had a desperate straggle to get him down stairs—he was very violent, and we got severely knocked about—we had to carry him out of the house—I handed him over to another constable, and then went back to look for the woman.</p>

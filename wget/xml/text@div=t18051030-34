               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, she was a <rs id="t18051030-34-deflabel181" type="occupation">washer-woman</rs>

               <p>Q. You knew she was employed to wash for you? - A. I did, she never washed for me before, I had spoken about it to her myself; she lived in Bird-street; I gave the cloaths to my servant, on the 19th of September, in the evening; I did not see them again till the 25th, and then they were at various pawnbrokers; they were brought to the Office in Marlborough-street, when I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner taken up? - A. I apprehended her myself, on the 25th of September, in Bird-street, in a kitchen where she slept, my servant came to let me know where she lived, I told the prisoner if my things were in the hands of any respectable washer-woman, I would excuse her, upon which she told me that she had let a woman have them to wash and iron for her, it turned out to be an untruth, and I told her that she deceived me, she having sent me to Henrietta-street, to a Mrs. Jones, at a pork shop, and I found no such person; she then told me if I would give her leave to go herself, she would bring me the things, I gave her leave to go, and my servant was to attend her, and there she found four shirts, the woman refused to let her have them, unless I would go and take them, which I afterwards did, and the woman delivered them to me; they are not in the indictment; I saw the other things at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH DREWRY sworn. - Q. You are a servant to Mrs Edgeworth? - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar washed for another lady in the house, and she said, she was very badly off, and I gave her them to wash, on the 20th of September; she said she would bring them home on Saturday night, I did not see her till the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been after her before? - A. Yes, a great many times. On Wednesday, I asked her the reason, why she did not bring the things home, she said she had been very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go afterwards with Mrs. Edgeworth to her? - A. Yes, I staid with her while the lady went about to get her things. The duplicates were delivered to the landlady of the house, and she delivered them to Mrs. Edgeworth afterwards.</p>
               <p>JOHN UNDERHILL sworn. - I live with Moorat, pawnbroker, High-street, Marybone.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know her? - A. I have seen her before, I cannot possibly swear to the prisoner, I know nothing more than the officer desired I would produce this property. I produced it, at Marlborough-street; there is a handkerchief pledged on the 20th of September, for 1 s. on the 21st, a shift for 2 s. and a shirt for 2 s. On the 23d, in the same month, two pair of stockings, and a handkerchief, for half a crown.</p>

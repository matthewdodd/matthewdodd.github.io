On the 19th of March, about one o'clock in the night, I met the prisoner in Thames-street; I was neither drunk nor sober; I had four sovereigns loose in my breeches pocket; I went down a court with her, near the water-side, and staid there about ten minutes, as I came out of the court I felt in my trousers pocket, and the sovereigns were gone - I am certain I had them when I met her; she had asked me for no money, nor had I given her any; I said she had taken four sovereigns from me - she denied it, but I held her, and said if she did not return it I would give charge of her - she insisted that she had not got them; the watchman came, and I gave her in charge; they were found in the sleeve of her gown - she said she knew she had them, and that they were mine, but she thought they were shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you married? A. Yes. I gave her no money; I had no silver about me- I struggled with her in the street, to get them from her, and said if she would return three I would give her one - I meant to change a sovereign, in order to give her something - she did not say I had given them to her by mistake for 4s.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner and Murphy together at the corner of Lambeth-hill - he said, "You know very well you have got my money;" he called me in a few minutes, and gave her in charge for stealing four sovereigns; she said she had not seen a farthing of his money. I took her to the watch-house, and saw the four sovereigns found in the sleeve of her gown - she then said she knew it was his money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear her say any thing in the street? A. She said at the watch-house that the man had attempted to rob her, and she had her pocket in her hand.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He promised me 4s., and I thought they were shillings; when he came out of the court he said, "Now, if you don't return me that money I will say you robbed me of it;" he took hold of my pocket, and I put them down my sleeve.</p>

            . I am a constable. I found five shillings and two sixpences in the prisoner's breast - I asked her if that was all she had got - she said Yes; but I thought she talked rather thick, and found two half-crowns and one shillings in her mouth - the prosecutor had stated that his money was 12s., in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences.</p>

I am a manufacturer of shag duffel for great coats; he worked with me in the year 1772, with a woman he called his wife; he went down to Norwich; she got a pass and went after him; he came up again by himself in 1773, and worked for me in July; I never saw him here since he sent for me when he was in the Poultry Compter; I asked him how he could be so foolish to marry another wife, his former wife being alive; he said he had been down into the country and saw her; and unfortunately while he was gone two letters came up; but he had settled matters; so that no harm could come of it. I asked him if he had any connexion with her when he was down; he said no, not so much as to kiss her lips. That was before his second examination.</p>

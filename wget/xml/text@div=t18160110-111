            . I am an auctioneer. I heard the child crying in the street, very loud. I suspected somebody had been robbing her, and I looked to see if any one was running, and I saw the prisoner running; I immediately pursued him, and he dropped a bag containing four pairs of children's shoes; I called out stop thief, and the prisoner was stopped, and brought back to where I and the child were. When she saw the bag in my hand, she said"give me my bag, give me my bag."</p>

            . I was at the top of Cross-lane, which leads into Long Acre, and heard the cry of stop thief; I turned round, and saw the prisoner running; he had a bag which he dropped, and I stopped him, and secured him. Mr. Hemens immediately came, and we took the prisoner back to where the little girl was, and she said he was the person who robbed her. The prisoner said to me going along, "I am all right, for the child can't swear to me." The girl appeared to be frightened, and I can't suppose she knew who the man was. The girl had fallen down, and was very dirty; she might have dropped the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at the railway station, New Cross, Deptford. In the middle of the afternoon, on the 31st of March, I was buying oranges near the Montague Arms at Deptford—the prisoner came up and asked if I would stand anything—we went to the Montague Arms, and were under a shed outside—I had three halt-sovereigns and other money in my pocket—she then took me to a room, where I suppose she lived, and sat down by the side of me—I then felt something come from</p>

                  </hi>. I live in North-street, Finsbury—the prisoner boarded and lodged there for about three weeks. On Friday, the 22nd of January, at ten minutes past four o'clock, I put my watch into my work-box in the dining-room on the ground floor, where the lodgers all dined, and left it there—the prisoner was present when I put it there—I returned to the room in about ten minutes, and met the prisoner in the passage—hetold me he was going out for half an hour—I requested him to be back to tea—he did not return that night—I missed my watch about six o'clock, when I went to my work-box—I found the prisoner next day at Mr. Dixon's, in Cheapside, and demanded my watch—he denied it very strongly—at last he confessed that he had given it to a woman at the bottom of an alley in Bishopsgate-street for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered to go for it, which I declined, and sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—this is the watch—it is worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On Saturday, the 23rd of January, I was sent for to Mr. Dixon's, in Cheapside, and saw the prosecutrix there, and the prisoner, who was given into my custody—I asked him if he could tell me where he left the watch—I made him no threat or promise—he said he could not tell the name of the street, but he could point out the house—I went with him to No. 2, Catherine Wheel-yard, and saw the witness Francis—I asked him if he had received a watch from the prisoner—he said he had—I asked if he had lent any money on the watch—he said no, he had received it from Lewis—he said there was also a piece of paper, which he had left with the watch, and he</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Catherine Wheel-yard. Lewis gave me this watch—it is not gold—the prisoner said he would redeem the watch as soon as he got the money from the Bank—he asked me when the paper was dated—I said, "The 18th of January"—he said he thought it was dated later than that—I asked why—he said, because a cheque was sent to the Bank, and this was an order on that cheque, and it could not be paid until seven days had expired—I asked what the seven days was for—I understood him to say it was four days for the note, and three days' grace, and it would not be up until the Monday, and therefore he would leave it and the watch until Monday, that then I might go along with him, and take the cheque to the Bank, and he would give me one sovereign to give to Miss Lewis, and he would have the watch.</p>

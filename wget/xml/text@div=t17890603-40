               <p>Cout. Do you keep any account of the number of those diamonds that you lay before your workmen? - No, it is impossible to do it; one of our young men was by, and I left him to attend him, a shopman, his name is

            ; on my return he said he had seen him take a diamond, and put it into his left hand waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Was this in hearing of the prisoner? - Yes: on which I said to the prisoner; it is a very odd thing, one of our people says, you have taken a diamond, and put it into your left hand waistcoat pocket; now turn out your pocket that we may see whether it is true or not; upon which he put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and after fumbling about some time, he pulled the diamond out, which he threw on the table, and said there it is; he said he hoped I would excuse it; he made an open confession.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to that diamond? - It is very difficult to swear to loose stones; but there is something particular in that diamond which makes me swear it is my diamond; there is something in the stone of a particular colour.</p>
               <p>Court. There was nothing passed between you and the prisoner, to induce you to believe from any thing he said, that it was not your property, but the property of another person? - Not the shadow of it, he confessed, and he said he had often robbed us.</p>
               <p>Had you previous to this confession made him any promise to shew him any favour? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Or threatened or frightened him into such confession? - No, nothing of that sort passed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Jones, how long had this man worked for you? - A considerable number of years.</p>
               <p>Every body knows, Mr. Jones, that in your house you do a vast quantity of business, particularly in this way; how many thousand diamonds do you think might be produced to him for his choice? - I suppose in point of number there might be some thousands; but they were principally very small ones.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Jones, this man had been induced very much by the encouragement of your house to go into the business? - He was a working jeweller.</p>
               <p>I understand he was established in that business before your house employed him? - He was not confined to work for us, but he did a great deal for us.</p>
               <p>Did it ever happen to you to pay this man in any other way than by cash? - He frequently wanted diamonds, which he said was for a correspondent at York, and we sold him loose diamonds for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Then he was in the habit of buying loose diamonds for his own use? - Occasionally he did; whenever he took diamonds, they were immediately placed to his account.</p>
               <p>Upon this occasion had he any more diamonds in his pocket than the one that was produced to you? - Not loose, that I know of; but I suppose that he had diamonds to the value of seven hundred pounds to repair.</p>
               <p>I need hardly ask you then, whether at that time he was a man of good character, and in your confidence? - He was a man that we had confidence in, certainly, or we should not have done it.</p>
               <p>I observe that upon your coming in from the lady, who wanted you, you stated to him what had passed from Tate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Tate's conversation to you was not in his hearing? - I believe it was so low that he could not hear it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Very few people have more experience in this trade than you have; I believe that unless there is a flaw in the stone, neither you nor any body else would venture to swear to a loose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030046"></xptr>stone? - This has a colour which distinguishes it.</p>
               <p>Therefore it would be of the same class with others of the same colour? - There is something that would distinguish it, I mean to say that I had observed it before.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, as a man conversant in the trade, that it is your's? - I mean to say that I frequently have occasion to six loose diamonds; that to the best of my judgment I have more than once taken up that stone for different pieces of work, and found it so incompleat in colour that it would not do; I do not take upon me to say-positively to it, and yet I say there is something particular in the stone, by which to the best of my judgment I knew it to be mine; there was not any of my other workmen present at that time; I have many others, and they are all supplied in the same manner.</p>
               <p>I believe that occasionally the different shopmen, and other persons in your shop, shew those diamonds? - We keep the key of them, either Mr. Jefferies or myself; he is not here; he very seldom is in the shop, he does not attend much; he does sometimes.</p>
               <p>In point of fact he has access to that drawer? - Yes, but he had been out of town; he was in town at that time.</p>
               <p>Then it is quite impossible that you could swear he had not been there half an hour before.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner at this time make any pretence that he had taken this diamond with a view to set it in the ear-rings to supply the place of those that were lost, or any thing to that effect? - He did not.</p>

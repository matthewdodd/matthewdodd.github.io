                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, at Woolwich—these four silk handkerchiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—I know them by my mark on them—they were taken away about three days after I had purchased them—I have not the slightest doubt this print dress and robe dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine also, but there is no mark on them; they are exactly like mine, and there are others like them—I have lost the handkerchiefs within the last three weeks—they were on the counter, at the end of the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 340). I searched a box at the male prisoner's house—he had told me at the station where he lived—a little girl, sister of the other prisoners, was there—the box was not locked; it had been previously searched by another constable—I found these four handkerchiefs and the dresses in the box, and also another piece of print—I went back to the station and asked the male prisoner how he accounted for these things that were found in his box—he said he knew nothing further than that the girls must have brought them home—the girls were in custody at the time.</p>

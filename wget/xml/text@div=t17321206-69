            , the Child's Mother. On Sunday Nov. 5. my Child went up Stairs to play with this other little Girl. The Prisoner was asleep upon the Bed; they waked him with playing. He got and bolted the Door, and took my Girl by the Hand, and laid her upon the Bed and -</p>
               <p>Court. You was not present?</p>
               <p>Long. No this is what the Child told me.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you must not go into Particulars, for what another told you is not Evidence. If she told you any thing that gave you Occasion to suspect that the Prisoner had been meddling with her, you may say so in general Terms.</p>
               <p>Ann Long. I discovered it on the Thursday following by her stradling as she walked: I asked her what was the Matter made her walk so? She whimper'd, and said she was afraid to tell me. So I search'd her and found she was all gaulded, and had a Running of white Matter upon her.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe any Marks of Violence?</p>
               <p>Long. I found she had been very much abused.</p>
               <p>Court. Of what Kind was the Abuse?</p>
               <p>Long. Such as if a Man had attempted her - I asked her who did it? and she said, Jo. York (the Prisoner.) I shew'd her to a Midwife and a Doctor.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you think it was in order to have Carnal Knowledge of her?</p>
               <p>Midwife. Yes.</p>

            . I am in the service of Edmund Pontifex, and others; the prisoner was in their employ. On the 27th of August, about one o'clock, I was desired to search him, as he was stopped at the gate by one of the partners; I found eight pieces of brass and cock metal upon him - he was given in charge; we could not miss so small a quantity - it is worth about 1s.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutors' employ. On the 27th of August, I saw this metal in a small cupboard, adjoining the shop; the prisoner was working in another shop - the cupboard was not the proper place for the metal; I saw it there five minutes before one o'clock; and at one, when the bell rang, the prisoner came for his jacket, which hung opposite the cupboard; I saw him take some metal, and put it inside his shirt; I told Mr. Wood, followed him to the gate, and saw it found on him.</p>

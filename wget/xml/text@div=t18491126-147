                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live at Florence-terrace, Deptford, On the morning of 7th Nov., between one and two o'clock, I was at the White Horse, Greenwich, and placed a great-coat on a chair in the coffee-room, in which there were three pairs of gloves, a pocket-handkerchief, some loose papers, and a six-feet tape measure—I missed the coat, and on inquiring for it was told by the landlord I had come into the house without one—I said</p>

               <p>I had not, and insisted on its being found—the landlord afterwards brought it me, and told me he had taken it from the tap-room, some one had removed it from the parlour—I lost my things—on leaving the house I saw the prisoner, with some others, in front of the bar—he came behind me, and threw some flour over me—I turned round, and saw him, called for a police<lb></lb>man, and gave him into custody for assaulting me, and on being searched at the station my gloves, handkerchief, and the measure were found in his pocket—these produced are them.</p>

On 7th Nov., at an early hour in the morning, I was on duty in London-street, Greenwich, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I found the prosecutor with his face, coat, and hat, smothered in flour—he gave the prisoner in charge—I took him to the station, searched him, and found three pairs of gloves, a six-foot measure, and a silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief—he said he found the measure in the White Hart—he did not say anything about the other articles—they were found in a different pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the conducter of an omnibus, and have been in Mr. Wheatley's service fifteen years—I have known the prisoner twenty years; he is a driver. On this evening, I went into the parlour of the White Hart, and there were two or three gentlemen lying just inside the door on the top of each other—I suppose they had been fighting—Mr. Parry was stand<lb></lb>ing at the further corner of the room, and I saw him cane Mr. Moore, a very respectable old tradesman of Greenwich, with his stick—I think Mr. Parry was in his shirt-sleeves when I went in; I will not be sure; I know he was, some part of the evening—Walker went in with me, and be picked up a gentleman named M'Killan, a wine-merchant; the potman helped—after we came out of the parlour, and the scuffle had been quieted, Mr. French, the landlord, got Mr. Wilcox, another old gentleman, out, and put him in the bar<lb></lb>parlour, and the prisoner said, "I have picked up something; look here," and he rolled it along the counter: it was a tailor's measure, a round thing that wound up, like that produced—the prosecutor wanted to fight again two or three times, and wanted to get to Mr. Wilcox and Mr. Moore, and we would not let him—there had been some disturbance with them about some punch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, residing in High-street, Deptford. On this evening I was in the parlour at the White Hart, Greenwich, and saw Mr. Parry, Mr. Wilcox, and Mr. M'Killan there drinking a bowl of punch—a disturbance arose between Mr. Parry and Mr. Moore, an old gentleman, as to the payment for the punch—Mr. Parry was not sober, but had been drink<lb></lb>ing—Mr. Moore said I have nothing at all to do with the punch; I have had my three glasses of gin-and-water, and I shall not pay for any punch—I did not see him drink any—some more words took place, and Mr. Parry said, "You old vagabond, if you don't sit down I will cane you"—he struck him with the cane, and it was broken in the scuffle—I saw Mr. Parry take off his coat and throw it across the table—I suppose he did that to fight—he said to me, "Mind that coat!"—I was sitting down quietly, and took no part in it—I did not see the coat afterwards—he offered to fight, and jumped on the table to do so—I do not know that I was sober—I could fully under<lb></lb>stand all that took place—I afterwards saw the prisoner in charge, in Skelton-street—if he had wanted to get rid of anything he might have done so.</p>

Horsley was up in the van—I called out, "Will you stop, please, while I get further away, as there is not sufficient room;" in a loud voice—Horsley could hear me—no answer was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Vauxhall-wharf—this occurred some distance from my door, and the child was taken to my surgery, in a state of collapse, from which it did not recover—I believe the collapse and ultimate death were caused by the accident—Horsley came to my shop—he was intoxicated.</p>

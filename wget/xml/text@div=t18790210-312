                  </hi>. I am shop-boy to Messrs. Norton and Stretton, pawnbrokers, Barking Road, "West Ham—on 15th January, about 2.45 p.m., the prisoner and a man came into the shop—the man held up a quilt in the shop and examined it, and asked me to sell it to him—I told him I could not sell it to him, as my master was not in, but he would be in a few minutes—I then saw the woman put something up her petticoats, and when she turned the man put the quilt down—I missed a coat off the counter which was safe just before they came in—when they got to the door, I said, "You have got a coat there," and the woman replied, "I will punch you on the nose if you say I have got the coat"—the man said the same—as they went on I noticed the coat dropping from her petticoats—she was pretending to be lame, so that it should not drop from her clothes—they walked along till they got to the Croydon Road, and when they got to the first turning they began to run—the coat then dropped, and the man picked it up, put it on, and ran away—I ran and got in front of them, and the man turned over a lot of green fields and ran away—the prisoner picked up half a brick and said she would aim it at me—soon afterwards Golding came up, and I gave her in charge—I only lost sight of the prisoner just as she turned the corner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). From information I received, I went to where the prisoner and the boy were, and the boy said in her pre<lb></lb>sence, "I will give the woman into custody for stealing a coat from my master's shop"—she said she knew nothing about it; that she went into the shop with a man to buy a coat, but did not take the coat—I took her to the station—I have searched for the coat and made every inquiry for the man in vain.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. When was this? A. Last Friday week; I let my lodging to a woman, who said she was a shoe binder, and the same evening the prisoner came, and was there the remainder of the time - I said the woman might have taken property, and given them to him to pawn; I cannot say when he had been at my house, but I have a side door which persons go in and out at - the prisoner came there on the Sunday after I missed them; I accused the woman of stealing them; I do not believe it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the young woman been at your house? A. Yes; I went on the Friday to put my little baby to bed, and missed them - I think I had seen them the morning before.</p>

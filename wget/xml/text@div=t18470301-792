                  </hi>. I live in Ray-street, Clerkenwell. I am a smith, and am in the employ of Mr. Thomas Potter, of South Moulton-street—I was at work at the Adelphi-terrace—some iron railings were taken from there—the first marked ones that were missed was on Friday 19th Feb.—I missed some on Monday morning 8th Feb., and on the 10th, and on the 18th—I have seen</p>

               <p>them since—I can swear to them by the pattern, and by the holes that I drilled in them—I missed a lamp-iron which I had seen safe about five o'clock on the Wednesday evening—it was Mr. Potter's property he would have had to made it good if it was lost.</p>

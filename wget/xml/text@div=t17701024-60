Last Saturday morning the cook awaked me, and told me the house was broke open; I got up, and found the kitchen window was broke open. The kitchen window opens into an area in the street; the kitchen window had iron bars to it; the whole frame of the window was drove in, the wood and iron work together; we found a tinder-box upon a bench in the passage, a piece of candle, and a flint and steel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they belong to the house?</p>
               <p>Topham No. There was a bar outside the kitchen door, which was shattered all to pieces. We also found two chissels and a short crow in the kitchen. ( Producing them.) The pantry door, where the place was, was not broke open, but cut with a chissel, or some such thing. I saw all was safe over night; and there was stolen this plate. (Producing the several pieces mentioned in the indictment.) They got the plate out at the hole they cut in the door. There was another shelf above this that they could not get at; it was a narrow closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the plate you have now looked at is Mrs. Jeredore's property?</p>
               <p>Topham. I am. They were all in the closet the night before the robbery. My mistress ordered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240040"></xptr> me to go to Sir

I was sent for to Justice Fielding's; he asked me if I could swear to the plate; I told him I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Topham. I knew Knight; I succeeded him in Mrs. Roberts's service at Hackney; and I was acquainted with him at Mr. Mackay's; he has been several times to see me and my fellow servants at Mrs. Jeredore's.</p>

               <p>Halliburton. Underwood was coming down stairs as we went in. When I asked at the door they said Underwood was not at home. Payne had no hat on when I took him; he said he had sold it to buy a pair of shoes; the other two had their hats.</p>

He said I know what you are come about; the plate has been here, but it is gone; then he said the people were up stairs waiting for their wack, that is their money. We went up stairs; Bird and Payne were playing at all-fours; Wright was learning over the chair behind them, and the woman was sitting by the bed-side; when they saw us they looked thunder-struck; I said, Why don't you play the game out? Halliburton had by that time brought the plate down; then we searched them, and found this castor top is Knight's pocket. We tied them together; Halliburton and Wright took them to Sir

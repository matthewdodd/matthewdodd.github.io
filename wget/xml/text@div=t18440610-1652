                  </hi>. The prisoners were in my employ. About half-past twelve o'clock, on the 13th of May, I met Hobbs in Worship-street, going in the direction of Tracey's, with a basket of phials—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, where are you going with those?"—he said, "To Whit<lb></lb>taker's," alluding, as I expect, to a customer in Shore ditch who was in the habit of taking goods—I said, "Why come this way, why not go down Holy well-lane?"—he said, "I come this way sometimes"—I said, "Is Mr. Sharp (my partner) at home?"—he said, "Yes"—I followed him, and did not see him go into Mr. Whit<lb></lb>taker's—I waited some time, expecting he had gone in—I then went to my warehouse and saw Mr. Sharp—I went to Hobbs's mother, and while there he came in—I said, "Where did you go with that basket of phials you said you were going to take to Whittaker's?"—he said they were not phials, they were flower-roots—I said, "Where were you going with them?"—he said, "To <hi rend="italic">Fred's,</hi>" meaning Tracey's—I went with him to <hi rend="italic">Fred's</hi>, and asked Tracey where the phials were—he said, "There were no phials brought here, they were flower-roots"—I said, "Where is the basket?"—he took me round to the back <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the premises and showed me one—I said that was not it—he said it was—I said I thought he was dishonest, and had been robbing me; I should like to go into his parlour—he refused, I insisted, and then he said there were two or three glasses there which he had taken, and he hoped I would forgive him—I found a number of glasses on his side-board, which he said he had taken, and was very sorry for it—I questioned him about the phials—he said he would tell me, and hoped I would forgive him—I said I would—I went with him to Brick-lane, and there I saw some phials in a basket—I am not able to say it was the basket Hobbs was carrying—I told Tracey I expected he had been robbing me for. some time—he said he had not.</p>

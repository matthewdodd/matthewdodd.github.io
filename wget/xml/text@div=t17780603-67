I cannot safely say, but I believe these are the bills.</p>

I stuck one up at Wood-street, nine about the 'Change, and put one in my pocket. At eight in the morning I went afterwards to Justice Girdler to make affidavit of a fire that had happened, and told Justice Girdler what I had done; I gave him one, and he kept it, and has it now, I believe.

               <p>Was the difference so great, that he having been accustomed to Mr. Strahan's must have known it? - I cannot say that; I believe a person that reads it must know it to be forged.</p>
               <p>Do you think he knew it to be forged? - No; I don't think he knew it.</p>
               <p>What marks of forgery are there in it? - I don't know any in proclamations. Effingham, deputy-marshal, is generally at length; this is D. M. for deputy-marshal.</p>

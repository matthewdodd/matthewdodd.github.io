                  </hi>. I reside at the Rectory at Horsleydown—on the evening of 17th October, about half-past 5, I was at the Swan Pier—I saw a man standing close to me, looking at a watch which he had in his hand—I thought it was his own watch at first—at that moment I saw my guard fall to my side—I seized him directly, and held him till the officer took him—I am quite sure I saw the watch in his hand—I have not found it—the man who had the watch was the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter and sometimes assist Mr. West, a broker. On the 12th of March I went, by his direction, to No. 2, Cooper's-court, Rose-mary-lane—West, Thompson, and Barnes were with me—I went into the room on the ground-floor, where the prisoner lodged—I did not see him at first—we made a distress on his goods, and had a warrant—I saw two or three females there—I believe one was the prisoner's wife—I told them what I came for, and showed the warrant—an inventory was made—I left Thomp<lb></lb>son in possession, and went to a room up stairs, in the same house, and while there, I beard a noise in the prisoner's' room—we had not seen the prisoner then—hearing a scuffle, I went down, and found Thompson out<lb></lb>side the prisoner's room—West was with me—I asked Thompson who had turned him out—West said, "Push the door open, and go in and take possession again"—we spoke loud enough to be heard inside, as the door is very thin—we asked the people in the room to open the door, and I heard a man's voice, which I afterwards found was the prisoner's, say, the first person who opened his door he would split his head open, but with what I do not know—we pushed the door open immediately, and in an instant I was struck with an axe on the forehead—it did not injure me much—it cut a place in my forehead, which bled a little—it cut through my hat—the axe had a short broken handle, as it has now—my forehead did not bleed a great deal—the mark was about half an inch with the graze—it cut through the skin, but was a very trifling cut—we called for a policeman who came—I afterwards went and got it strapped up—I was not stunned.</p>

On the after<lb></lb>noon of the 12th of March the prosecutor was brought to our shop—he had a cut of about a quarter of an inch, and about half an inch graze on his fore-head—it had cut through the skin and flesh, but very little below the surface of the skin—the edge of this axe would make such a wound—I do not think the back part of it would.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Luke-street, Spitalfields. 1 went with West and the prosecutor—I was standing on the bottom stair, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner—as Fox entered the room, he said, "You b—, if you come in here I will split your b—head open" and with the words, he struck him on the head with the edge of the axe—I immediately jumped forward, and caught hold of him.</p>

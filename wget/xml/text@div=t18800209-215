                  </hi>. I am a travelling clerk of the General Post<lb></lb>office, and conduct investigations into matters of this kind—my attention was first drawn to this matter on Monday, the 19th of January—on the following day I saw the prisoner at his father's house, 63, Balance Road, Hackney—I said to him "My name is Stephens, I am attached to the General Post-office, what is your name?"—he said "Francis Small"—I said "You were formerly engaged at Mr. Cooper's, No. 39, Great Castle Street," and I told him I wished to speak to him about a letter, and then took him to the Post-office, Mr. Chabot met me there—I was there when the prisoner and three young persons were introduced into a room where Mr. Chabot was—I had not said or done anything to direct Mr. Chabot's attention to the prisoner—after Mr. Chabot came out of the room I said to the prisoner "You will be charged with stealing a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of a post letter, and forging and uttering the same; you will be taken to Bow Street, and one of the officers will have to go to your house and search your place, do you wish to send any message to your mother?"—he replied "No, I have writtern a letter to my father"—the prisoner had just told me his father would not be at home, so I said, "But your father will not be at home, do you wish to send any message to your mother"—he said "No, if I had money I would make it good, and then perhaps there would be an end of the matter"—he was then given into custody—the south side of the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Some part of the S.W. district is on the Middlesex side—the prisoner was brought to the Post-office by myself and an officer—I saw him in my private room—he told me he had given the letter to a woman—then followed the observation that if he had the money he would make it all right—I spoke to the gentleman from the bank before identification—the other three boys were in the employment of the Post-office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The other young men were not in uniform—nothing was said or done to draw Mr. Chabot's attention to the prisoner—the lads were requested to put on their great coats and hats and coat into the room at the same time, because the prisoner had his hat and coat on, and they came into the room with their coats on and their hats in their hands.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM LORD</hi>. I am a police-constable attached to the Post-office—I received the prisoner in custody on the 20th of January—I heard him say o Mr. Stephens "If I had the money I would pay Mrs. Cooper, and there would be an end to it"—there was a conversation about his having gone to Mrs. Cooper on the 6th, but I do not remember whether he said he went with the intention of knowing whether this letter had come or not—I went to his house and searched—I did not find anything bearing on this case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, carrying on business at 10, Finsbury Pavement—the prisoner was in my employ from the begin<lb></lb>ning of February to the end of July, 1878—I believe him to be thoroughly honest—I had many opportunities of seeing his writing during the six months he was with me—I say there is no similarity between the endorse<lb></lb>ment on this cheque and the prisoner's writing—I believe the word "bearer" is not his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As a solicitor's clerk the prisoner would be required to write a very distinct hand-writing—he had acquired a fixed style of writing before he left me—he had been in a solicitor's office before—these two letters were written by the prisoner in January, and handed to me, and they are the same style of writing—one is a copy of the letter he wrote to Mr. Cooper, which I asked him to write—Mr. Cooper had a reference from me—he came from Messrs. Vallance and Vallance, of Essex Street, to me—my clerk, who is now in Court, took a character of the prisoner from that firm—it was not a written one.</p>

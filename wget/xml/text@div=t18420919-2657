                  </hi>. I am in the service of James Gill, a pawnbroker, in Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square. The prisoners came into the shop, and asked to look at a piece of silk—I believe they both spoke—I showed it them—they did not like the colour, they wanted a jet black, and it was a blue black—I said, "I have got a nice article in stockings that I can show you"—I took down a bundle from behind containing nine or ten pairs—I took one pair out, doubled it up, and laid it on the counter—Webb took another pair, put her hand in them, went to the door, and said they were very nice, and she thought them cheap—there was a set of china stood on the back counter—Moir said it was very pretty—I showed them to her—I saw Webb take the stockings, double them up, and put them down below her person—she took them up again, put them on the counter and said, "The man will think I am going to steal his stockings"—I then Proposed some boots to them, Webb then took the stockings off the counter, and placed them under her arm and scarf—I watched them very</p>

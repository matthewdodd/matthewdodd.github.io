On the 10th of this month, when I got up in the morning, at half past five, the door of my room was wide open, and the drawers, and these things were missing, the door was open where we were a bed. I went out to the pawnbroker's to see if she had pawned. I met the prisoner and two more, the prisoner was quite drunk, she had my handkerchief on her neck, this was about eight o'clock the same morning; I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I never saw her before.</p>

            . On Tuesday, the 10th of July, between seven and eight in the morning, a person came to my house and said they had been robbed. I immediately went to the prosecutor's apartment, and at the door the prisoner was sitting; the prosecutor told me the circumstance of the robbery, that he was asleep in his bed, and the door on the latch, and the person, whoever it was that had robbed him, opened the door and came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a ground floor - A. No, up one pair of stairs. The woman enumerated the things that she had lost, and said that she had a handkerchief of hers on her neck; I desired the prisoner to take it off her neck, which she did; on searching her the woman found a five shilling paper of halfpence, two shillings in silver, and some odd halfpence. I then went with her daughter to Mr. Cotton's, in Shoreditch; upon enquiry they produced a frock and two aprons; there were a pair of shoes on the prisoner's feet, the prosecutrix said they were her shoes, and on the stain were left an old pair of shoes and a pair of stockings. The prosecutrix took her into another room, undressed her, and took off her an old flannel petticoat that belonged to her daughter.</p>

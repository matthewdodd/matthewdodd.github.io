            . I am a carpenter. On the morning in question I was looking out of my window, which is opposite the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner with another person; the prisoner lifted the sash up by degrees - I suppose he went to it five or six times, opening it about an inch at a time, and then walked on - when they had got it quite up the prisoner got in; I immediately went down stairs, and got a rattle - I opened my front door, sprang my rattle, and went over to the window; he jumped out - I tried to catch hold of him, but could not - he ran, and was taken by Branch; there were five more by the place besides him.</p>

I being smaller than him - he told me to put it into my hat, and then said,"Run, you rascal, run;" he ran as well as me.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

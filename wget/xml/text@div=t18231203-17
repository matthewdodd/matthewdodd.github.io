            . I live at No. 6, Honeysuckle-court, Moor-lane, Fore-street, and am foreman to Mr. White, horse-slaughterer, of Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross. On Tuesday, the 4th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to me there with several other boys; he had a poney, and asked if I would buy it; I said, Yes, and asked what he wanted for it - he said 15 s. I said I should give but 12 s., as it was so small; he said that was too little, but he supposed I must have it. I questioned him where he came from, and who he was - he gave me a name, which I do not recollect, but it was not Fairchild - he said it was his father's horse; I asked where his father lived; he said, "In Middle-street, Cloth-fair." I asked why his father wanted it killed - he said it was a very old horse, his father had had it ten years, and had no further occasion for it. I said we were very particular in buying horses, and should like to see his father, and would go to him with him, which he consented to very readily. I set off with him, leaving the horse in our slaughter-house, and when I came to Middle-street, the landlady came to the door of the house he said he lived in - I asked if she knew anything of him; she said No - he was present with the other boys. I then suspected him, and asked if any of the neighbours knew him - he said nobody knew him there. I asked if he was known at any public-house; he said No. I said, "You young rascal, you have stolen it I am certain" - he firmly stood by me, but at last ran from me, saying he would fetch his father. It was about four o'clock. I ran back towards the slaughter-house, and met my fellow-servant, who had the keys; the poney remained in the slaughter-house. I found out that evening where he lived, went there, and saw his aunt - but did not see him again till he was apprehended in Bartholomew-close, on the Thursday evening. I shewed the same poney to the prosecutor on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BERNARD. Q. Several other boys were in his company - A. Yes; he was the only one who spoke; 15 s. was more than its value to slaughter. One of the boys is named Crockett - the prisoner might have said his name was Crockett; he did not say it was Crockett's horse.</p>

I have brought it here; it is a gelding.</p>

            . I am twelve years old. (The witness appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath.) I live with my parents, in Little Bartholomew-close - my father is a traveller, and is now in Scotland. I have known the prisoner about six weeks; he lives in Great Bartholomew-close. One Tuesday, early in the last month, he came to me when I was at play in Bartholomew-close with one Drysdale, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and asked me to go with him to fetch one of his master's horses home - that Mr. Sadler was his master, and the horse was at grass on Kennington-common, and if I would go with him I should ride it all the way home - he said he was going to bring it home to have its tail cut. I and Drysdale went with him to Kennington-common; he took us there, and caught a little black horse; he tried to catch another at first, but could not - there were three in the field; he said he would bring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030010"></xptr>home two, as both were to have their tails cut; it was then about half-past two o'clock. I and Drysdale rode it all the way home, by turns, and when he got into Bartholomew-close he said it was his father's horse, and he was going to sell it - that his father said it was past work. He took it to Cow-cross; we both went with him - he asked Fuller 15 s. for it. Fuller said Bartholomew-close was in his way home, and he would see his father; he was to give 12 s. for it. I went to a house where the prisoner said his father lived with Fuller - he took him to a wrong house, and Fuller went to stop the horse that nobody should have it, and the prisoner went away, and told me afterwards that he went to Cow-cross to get it back, but the man would not let him have it - he said, "I got there before the man did, but they would not let me have it back - I will go and fetch my father;" he ran away, and I did not see him again till he was taken; this was when I was playing with Drysdale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your father is much absent from home - A. Yes. I go on errands for my mother; she does not let me play in the street often. I had been on an errand, and was playing when he came to me. I saw him again about five o'clock, when I was playing - I had been on an errand, and came out to play without my mother's leave. I got acquainted with him by playing about the close. He did not mention the name of Stone to me; he had a halter to fetch the horse with - it was a black horse. I was with him when he offered to sell it, and rode it about the close. I did not know where he lived. I never said it was my father's.</p>

            . I am twelve years old. (This witness, being questioned, appeared sensible of the obligation of an oath.) I had known the prisoner about a month - I became acquainted with him in Little Bartholomew-close, and have known Crockett about a year. On Tuesday, the 4th of November, he came to me and Crockett, and asked us to go with him to fetch one of his master's horses, and he would give us a ride all the way home - that he was going to Vauxhall-common to fetch it to have his tail cropped; he had a rope. We went with him to Vauxhall-common, and caught the horse; it was a little black one - we tried to catch another grey one, but could not; he said, "Catch the little one if you can, I may as well take that home too." We brought the one home, and rode it by turns to Bartholomew-close, rode it about there, and took it into Aldersgate-street; the prisoner told us to ride it about and he would come to us directly; he went to Sadler's yard, leaving us riding it up and down the street - he returned in about five minutes, and said he should take it to the knocker's. We went to Ford's, Cow-cross; Crockett rode it, and the prisoner asked if they would buy the horse, and wanted 25 s.; the man asked whose it was; he said it was his father's - he told him to send his father with it. He then led it away to White's, next door, and asked 15 s. for it; Fuller asked whose it was; he said his father's, and he wished it killed. Fuller asked where he lived - he said at the top of Middle-street - 12 s. was agreed upon, and he said he would go with him, and pay his father, and when we got to the top of Middle-street, he said he lived there, but his father and mother were out. A woman came down and said they did not live there - Fuller let him go, and he went away. I saw him again in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he said he was going home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you often played with Crockett in the Close - A. We generally played about there, and had been playing about an hour when the prisoner came up; he said nothing about having a letter to take from Stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the object of catching the second horse that you might both have a ride - A. Yes. We rode it about. He said his master was Mr. Sadler, stable-keeper, Aldersgate-street; he told me to ride it up and down while he went in there. He left the same horse at Fuller's, as he brought from the common.</p>

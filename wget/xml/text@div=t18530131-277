                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, living at No. 9, Byde's-place, Shoreditch. I have three rooms there upstairs; one of them is my kitchen—on a Saturday night, somewhere about 11th Dec, I was at home between 11 and 12 o'clock—there is a shop door and a front door—the external door was fastened on its spring, but was not locked; it could not be opened without a pick-lock key being used—it is a common street door lock; a drawback we generally term it—I heard a noise at the door, and in two or three minutes, as I was sitting by the fire, I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the room; I said, "Who are you?" he said, "You know me well enough;" I said, "I don't recollect ever seeing you before in my life; what do you want?"—he said, "Your money"—I believe I said, "I have got none"—I did not like his appearance, and got up from my chair, intending to call the police, or to make a noise of some sort, and he seized me by my wrist—I had a knife in my hand—we had a little struggle, and he got the knife out of my hand—we still struggled together through a passage, but still not a word was spoken by either of us—I intended to shut him in, but he was too quick for me, and seized me by my handkerchief—I broke a pane of glass in the window, and called out police!" as well as I could speak—I never left go of him till he was taken by the police—in the course of the struggle we got into my kitchen; while we were there I called out "Police!" and he put his hand over my mouth, to stop me from making a noise; I wanted to get to another part of the room, to make my neighbours hear, and he laid his hand on my mouth again—after that I got to the window again, broke two more panes of glass, and called out again—a policeman came into the room, with two more persons, and took the prisoner—in the course of the struggle he <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> me by the ear, and I felt something on the left side of my neck, but I could not say anything, as I was <hi rend="italic">game</hi>, and pretty well <hi rend="italic">mashed</hi>—it was a sensation of pain; and before the police came I felt more pain—it bled; you can come and feel it, if you like—I went from the station to the London Hospital.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been examined before about this matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At Worship-street—I think I have told you pretty nearly all that happened, all that I can remember—I knew nothing of the prisoner before, to my knowledge—I have omitted nothing important that happened that is of any advantage to him; I have stated the truth, and you can ask me any questions you think proper—after the knife was taken from me, when I was going to shut the door, the prisoner sprang forward, and <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> me by my neck handkerchief, and I believe I received a wound in my neck; and I went through the passage to the kitchen, and screamed, "Murder;" and the <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> tumbled down, or I tripped him up, or something of the sort; he fell on his face, and I kept him there till the policeman came—nothing of this sort has happened to me before; I have omitted nothing else; oh yes, I told you the prisoner said he wanted my money; he said there were three or four more downstairs with pistols, but that is no good to the prisoner—I have been drinking to-day, but not all the morning—I have been taking some coffee, or it might be chicory for what I know—I am a carpenter, and want some beer; I have had as much as I thought proper this morning—I do not take spirits or rum when I come to a Court of Justice—I had been about a quarter of an hour in my room when the prisoner came up—I had not, to my knowledge, seen him in the court that night; and as to striking him there, how could I strike a man without seeing him?—I struck no one that day or night, nothing of the sort; that I swear—I believe it was my own knife with which I was wounded, but I did not see him strike the blow—I was just cooking an onion on the knife, for my supper—I had a candle—no one but myself lives in the rooms—other people lodge in the house—there are several houses in the court—it is not a narrow court—I have not had occasion to complain of people committing a nuisance against my door, but I should not like to catch them at it—I never have caught them, and I never complained of it in my life—I had not struck any one for committing a nuisance against my door that night; nothing was done—I dare say that I was perfectly sober on this night; quite as much, I assure you, as I am now—I have had more to-day than I had had then.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 113). On Saturday night, 11th Dec, I was on duty in Bydes-place, Shoreditch, and between 11 and 12 o'clock heard a noise of a window breaking, and heard cries of "Murder!" from the prisoner's kitchen, which looks into the street—I and a person named Smith went to the front door, and found it fastened—we went round to the shop door, burst it open, and went up a ladder into the prosecutor's room, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor lying on the floor struggling—the prisoner was undermost—there was blood on the floor, and a great deal on the prosecutor's head—I did not notice his neck—there was blood on the prisoner's hands—I assisted the prosecutor to get up, and Smith took the prisoner up—the prisoner said, "Where is my hat?" he had lost it in the struggle—the prosecutor was quite sober—I took the prisoner down to the front door—it was bolted, and the chain was up—I took the prisoner to the station, the prosecutor going with me and preferring a charge, and I afterwards accompanied him to the London Hospital—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the floor of the room, bent as it is now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. On Saturday morning, 12th Dec, Williams was brought there about half past 12 o'clock—he had two incisions, one on the top of the head, about an inch long, down to the bone, and another on the left side of the back of the neck, about an inch and a half long and an inch and three quarters deep, extending very near to the carotid gland—such a knife as this would inflict them, but I should think it was straight at the time, but it is impossible to say—the wound at the back of the neck was dangerous—he remained in the hospital a week, and was then discharged, but not cured.</p>

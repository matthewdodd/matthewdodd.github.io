                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Gray, of Earl-street, Blackfriars. On the 18th of Oct., between ten and eleven o'clock, I missed a great coat belonging to Mr. Robinson, from the stable—I had seen it safe at ten o'clock the morning before—the prisoner James was jobbing about the yard—I do not know when he was there last—he used to come backwards and forwards—I have seen the coat since.</p>

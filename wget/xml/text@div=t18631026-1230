                  </hi>. I live at 2, Conway-place, Clerkenwell, and am in the employ of Messrs. Bonser and others, meat salesmen, of 20, Newgate-street—I have known the prisoner seven or eight years or more—he is a jobbing porter about the market—on Saturday, October 17th, Mr. Ives, a butcher, bought of Messrs. Bonser five pieces of beef—they were weighed, and I delivered three of these pieces to another porter, not the prisoner—about</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at Notting-hill—about a quarter past 6, on Saturday morning, 17th October, I employed the prisoner—he always meets me, and asks me if I want him—he met me on this morning, I think, near the prosecutors'; I will not be positive—he said, "Have you got a job?"—I said, "I shall not be long before I employ you"—I told him where to go and get the meat, and he loaded my cart for me—I asked him where he was on the Saturday previous, the 10th, and he told me he was ill in bed—I said I wanted him, and I had to employ another person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the officers to the Sheriff of Surrey, and have been so for thirty years off and on—I am a servant of Mr. Seal's—I am appointed to my office by the Under Sheriff, by giving a bond of security—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bond by which I was appointed to my place—on 13th September last, I went to the Victoria Tavern, Waterloo-road, next door to the Victoria Theatre—I think it must have been as near 4 o'clock as possible, or a little after, when we got to the house—I went for the purpose of arresting Frank Towers on a warrant of capias—he was the landlord of the public-house, and I believe is now—I had known him some time—he knew me personally—I had arrested him once before, about three weeks prior—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the warrant on which I arrested him—I had it with me on this 13th September—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the writ of capias—George Walter Reeves and George Remnant were with me—they are my assistants, employed by Mr. Seal—I went in first to the front of the bar, and stood there a short time—Reeves followed me—I knocked on the counter, and called for three pennyworth of brandy—nobody came, but I saw Towers in the bar parlour, making his way towards the kitchen stairs—I immediately went round through the folding doors and saw him on the top of the stairs—I said, "Mr. Towers, I want you again"—he made some answer; "What for," I think, were his words—I said, "For a much larger amount than the last"—I took hold of him by the right arm, and he went up the steps into the parlour, and threw himself on to a chair—the female prisoner, Agnes Towers, his wife, immediately came into the room, and he requested her to fetch him a knife to stab himself, or to cut his throat—Reeves and I, and those two, were the only persons in the room then—I served Towers then with the capias and writ of summons—I served him with copies of the two writs of summons, and a copy of the capias—I showed him the two original writs and the warrant—I turned round to the other assistant</p>

               <p>for him to fetch a cab, seeing that Towers was very excited, and the moment I turned round to get to the door I heard a shuffling, and a shriek from Mrs. Towers—that was before I got to the door—I was making my way to the door—I heard a bit of a scuffle, and a shout directly—I turned round then, and saw that he had jumped out of the window—at the moment of the shriek, a regular rush came into the parlour—Mrs. Towers caught hold of my collar when I was in the act of getting to the window—when the parties came into the room, she said, "These two men are come to take Frank away again"—I should say there might have been twelve or more come into the room, but the principal among them were the three male defendants—I was caught hold of by Pierre Le Rois in the first instance, and the other two defendants rushed upon me—my coat collar was torn in two places, but nothing happened to the tails of my coat—Le Rois wrested the staff out of my hands, and asked, in his way, whether I was a policeman—I nodded to him—the door was locked at that time—I cannot say who locked it—I made every attempt to get out of the window—I was knocked down over the table, and Mrs. Towers fell once with me—we were both down together at one time—I was knocked down by the three male defendants—I then fought my way through as well as I possibly could, to get to search the house—Reeves got through out of the crowd and got out, and the door got opened somehow—I tried to force my way from them, and could not do so for two or three minutes; at last I got into the front of the bar, and there I was forcibly shoved out by Allen and Le Rois—I could have had Frank Towers very easily in the yard supposing I had not been interfered with in the manner I was; because when he jumped out he fell and lay there—I was forcibly pushed out of the house by Allen and Le Rois—I afterwards tried to get an entrance again, but could not—Alfred Towers was there with them, pushing and knocking about—he caught hold of me by the collar and held me—I went to the police-station—a young policeman came up, and he did not understand anything about it, and there was a potman as bad as the rest—I have not been able to capture Frank Towers since—he has entirely escaped for the present.</p>

               <p>believe me to be a policeman in order to give it up—I merely nodded to him, thinking he would give it up—he did not pull me off Mrs. Towers—he came and collared me—Mrs. Towers was not out of the room a second before Le Rois came in—I was examined twice before the Magistrate, and my deposition was read over to me before I signed it—there is not a quarter of my evidence in that deposition—I have not read it since; not with the attorney on the other side—I have called to my recollection everything that occurred—if a man made his escape of his own will it would depend on the circumstances at the time, who would be liable—I don't think it would make any difference if we could make out that we were overpowered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Seal, the officer of the sheriff of Surrey—I was in company with Herrick and Reeves on Saturday afternoon, 27th September, at the Victoria Tavern—I received directions from Herrick to get a cab—the first thing I heard was a scream from the female prisoner—that was after I had the direction about the cab—she seemed to be in the back parlour—after that there was a rush, and the folding-doors were closed to prevent me getting in to render assistance—I attempted to render assistance, but was prevented by the door being shut—I tried the doors and found them bolted, I suppose, inside—they were so fastened by some means inside so that I could not get in—I knew Le Rois, the Frenchman—I believe he cannot speak English, from what I heard at the police-station—I have not spoken to him at all.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, L</hi> 3). I am stationed at Tower-street station, Waterloo-road—on the afternoon of Saturday, 13th September, the three male prisoners came there accompanied by an officer—the female did not come—Herrick, Reeves, and Remnant, were also there, and made a charge in the presence of the prisoners—it was quite half an hour before could get any charge at all, but Mr. Herrick stated that Mr. Frank Towers had been rescued from his custody when he went to the Victoria Tavern to arrest him for debt—Reeves was present at that time—he was sober, but very excited—the Frenchman spoke, and made a very great noise, but could not understand what he said—I think he spoke French—he did not speak English—I had not known him before—Allen was not brought at first, but Le Rois, Alfred Towers, and Edward Towers who was afterwards discharged by the Magistrate, were brought in—Allen was brought in after<lb></lb>wards, and during the conversation, he said to Mr. Herrick, "I should not have collared you had you not collared me"—I believe those were the words—Herrick said that he had been pulled about, and considered that he was the foremost of the whole lot.</p>

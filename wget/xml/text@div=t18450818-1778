                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Kennington-place. On the 1st of Aug., a few minutes after ten o'clock, I was leaving my shop to go into the parlour behind—when I got to the parlour door I heard some money rattle—I turned and saw Baylis leaning on the counter on his elbows, with a halfpenny in his hand—he asked me for a halfpenny-worth of Negrohead tobacco—I said I did not sell it—he then turned, and was about to leave the shop—I looked into my till, and found all the money was gone—I missed a sixpence and two fourpenny pieces, which I had put in the minute before, and what other money there had been in it I do not know—I jumped over the counter, ran round the cor<lb></lb>ner, and caught Baylis in Devonshire-place—my house is the corner house but one to Devonshire-place—I saw Dibbin was just parting from him—I took Baylis back—I said, "I want that money you have taken out of my till"—he said, "What money?"—he said he had none about him—I said, "You have given it to that other <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>"—Dibbin was then in the road—he had come back, and was standing near my door—Baylis called to him and said, "<hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi>," and Dibbin ran away—after he was gone, Baylis said, "If you will come with me I will take you to the place where the money is"—I said I would keep him—he then ran off, I ran after him up Kennington-lane, and he was taken again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Queen's Arms, in Kennington-lane. About ten o'clock that morning I saw the three prisoners standing at the corner of Vauxhall-street, right opposite the prosecutor's shop—I saw Baylis and Dibbin leave Wright on the other side of the way, and come across to Mr. Collins's shop—I saw Baylis go inside, and Dibbin was standing outside—I then went in<lb></lb>doors, and in a few minutes I went into Devonshire-street, and saw Baylis and Dibbin come down the street, and Baylis gave Dibbin some silver—Mr. Collins then came round the corner, he pursued Baylis and took him—Dibbin then went and gave something to Wright, and they went off together—Dibbin came and stood by Mr. Collins's shop—some person said, "That is the boy that was at the door," and he ran off.</p>

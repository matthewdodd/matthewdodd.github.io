                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of Church Street, Paddington. On Saturday, 14th March, about half past 11 o'clock, the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and as soon as she left I discovered that it was bad—I put it into a drawer, and kept it separate till I gave it afterwards to a policeman—on the Thursday following the prisoner came again and asked the price of a snuff box, bat nothing passed—on the Saturday she came again for half an ounce of tobacco, and offered me a bad sixpence; I caught hold of her across the counter, and charged her with passing bad money; she said that she had never been in the shop before—I went for a policeman, who tried to take some money from her mouth, and a four-pence dropped on the floor; my wife picked it up, and gave it to me; it was bad, and I gave it to the policeman immediately—I knew the prisoner by sight before she came the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was not in your shop on the 14th; I went to Whitecross Street prison, to take some clean clothes to my husband, who is unfortu<lb></lb>nately there, and did not return till after the public houses were shut up; why did not you give me in charge, you saw me frequently passing the house?</p>

The prisoner was handed over to me to search on 21st March—she asked to go to the water closet, and I allowed her to do so, because she said that she was in great pain—I did not go there till Monday morning at 10 o'clock, but nobody had been there in the mean time, and I</p>

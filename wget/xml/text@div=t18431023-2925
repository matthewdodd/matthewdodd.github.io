                  </hi>. I live in Short's-buildings, Clerkenwell-close. On the morning of the 8th of Oct., between one and two o'clock, I was near Hatton-garden, and saw the prisoner—she wished me to go with her—I walked a little way up Hatton-garden, and after about two minutes' conversation I put my hand into my pocket, and missed a sovereign, which I knew was in there when I began talking to her—I gave her in charge—she said she had not got it—I was quite sober.</p>

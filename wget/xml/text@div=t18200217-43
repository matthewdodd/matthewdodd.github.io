On the 22d of January, the prisoner was in the parlour; a man, named Smith, asked him for the loan of 5 s. I afterwards saw him come into the taproom alone; he had a glass of rum and water, which came to 6 d., and gave me a 1 l. note. I immediately took it to Mr. Lange, at the bar, and told him

             had given it to me, as I had heard Smith call him so. It was not long before he came out, and my master, asked me if that was the man? I said Yes. He went out, came in again, and asked me for the change. I said my master would give it to him, and then went into the taproom.</p>
               <p>LUDOWIG LANGE. I keep the house - the prisoner was there; Sinclair brought a 1 l. note out to pay for a glass of rum and water. The prisoner went out, returned in a few minutes, and came before the bar for his change. I asked him where he got the note? he said, over the water, and that he worked for a distiller. I said that it was forged; he gave me 1 s. in silver, and I returned him the note, having marked it with F; he was searched in my house about ten minutes afterwards, and some notes found on him. I sent for a constable, as I found I had another bad note, which I suspected Smith had passed, but he was gone.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I was sent for to Lange's, took the prisoner in charge as he came out of the taproom, and said,</p>
               <p>"I suspect you have some bad notes about you." I took him in front of the bar, searched him, and found a pocket-book in his waistcoat-pocket, containing five 1 l. notes. I asked him how he got them? he said he would sooner die under the stick (gallows) first, than tell me. Several people came into the watch-house, and among others a Mr. King. The prisoner said to him</p>
               <p>"You appear to be a gentleman, I'll tell you how I got them. I picked the pocket-book and notes up on Tower-hill this morning." Soon after Smith was brought in, charged with passing a bad note to Lange. He was telling me how he came by it, but the prisoner called through a hole, and said,</p>
               <p>"Smith, if you split I will burst you when you come in;" in consequence of which I took Smith to another watch-house. Next morning the prisoner said he did not know that he had the pocket-book, and if he had, somebody must have put it into his pocket.</p>

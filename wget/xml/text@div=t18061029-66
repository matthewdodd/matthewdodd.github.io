On the 1st of August I called at the Duke of Clarence's Head, Charing-cross; Mr. Delare had two pair of braces which I knew, from thence I went to Bow-street, I got an officer and went to the prisoner's lodgings, Of-alley, Buckingham-street, and after taking him in custody, I found among his duplicates, one respecting a nankeen pair of trowsers pledged in Chandos-street. The trowsers and the braces are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. He has been my journeyman eighteen months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>How much did you happen to owe this man at the time. - A. Properly, not one penny.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you arrested by this man because he could not get his money of you. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. For how much. - A. I think he swore to eleven pound.</p>
               <p>Q. The day after you was arrested by this man, you made this complaint against this man and proceeded as you have stated. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was arrested at this man's suit. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the officer say to you, are you sure that there are no money matters between you. - A. I do not deny it direct, there was some trifling mention of it, I said there was some the day before he had arrested me.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable. I took up the prisoner, I produce a duplicate that I found in the prisoner's lodgings for a pair of pantaloons. I said to Mr. Baster, has there been any money matters between you, or any summoning, he told me positively no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How long have you known Mr. Baster. - A. I have known him some time.</p>
               <p>Q.Would you believe him upon his oath. - A. I should have a doubt if I was a juryman of his oath: When a man tells me a lye upon the outset of the business, I should not believe him much upon his oath.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Edward Archibald Jones and Henry Jones, at Fishmongers' Hall-wharf. I was at work in their cooperage, which is under one of the dry arches of London-bridge, on the 15th of Feb., between four and five o'clock—the door was shut—I heard a creaking noise</p>

               <p>of the door being gently opened, and it threw a ray of light through the arch—Meller walked in directly after, took a cask of lard, and ran over to the street—I pursued, and caught him in the act of dropping the cask into a cart belonging to a butcher of the name of Stebbings, which was detained.</p>

On the 13th of Feb. the prisoner Hackett applied to me for it—I let him have it—it was the same cart that was detained with the lard—he said he wanted it for Mr. Gibbons, at the upholsterer's shop up red-lion-street—he asked my husband to let the young man harness it, and bring it up to Mr. Gibbons's, which is about five minutes' walk from our place—he came again on the 15th, about half-past three o'clock, and had the same horse and cart—he is the person who both hired it and drove it on the 15th.</p>

            , who depos'd, that on the 28th of October, about 5 a Clock in the Afternoon, the Prisoner came down the Treasury Stairs, and bid him open the Door, which he refus'd, asking him from whence he came, he answer'd, from Mr. Mickelthwaite, Masters told him he would call the House-keeper: accordingly double-locking the outward Gate, went and acquainted Mr. Wooly, that a Person wanted to go out. Mr. Wooly depos'd, that when Masters called him he made a strict Search, but could not discover any Person, till at last they found the Prisoner under the Scaffolding in the Sale Room, delivering at the same time two Bags, one of Money and one of Papers. Mr. Mickelthwaite depos'd, that going to the Treasury he found a great Quantity of Silver upon the Tables and on the Ground, and that they miss'd upon Examination 1100 Guineas, besides Notes, &amp;c. partly the Company's, and partly other Persons. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he had been under an Indisposition of Mind, and endeavour'd to prove it, by calling Dr. Cromp, who depos'd, that Abram had on Saturday the 27th of October, enquir'd of him how many Drops of Opium he took when he was not well; this Deponant reply'd, more than he would have him or any other Person take, for it might do him an Injury. An Apothecary depos'd to the same Effect. The Prisoner likewise called several to his Reputation. Upon the whole, the Jury found him <rs id="t17111205-31-verdict150" type="verdictDescription">

            . On Wednesday the 10th of August last, between seven and eight in the afternoon, I was stopped in a foot path in the fields between Hampstead and Marybone: I was coming to town on foot; I met the prisoners on this side a place called <placeName id="t17740907-49-crimeloc236">Primrose Hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Look at the men, are you sure they are the persons?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Mills and which is Pugh?</p>
               <p>Gilson. That is Mills and that is Pugh ( pointing them out); I saw them as I came down the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before they robbed you?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was it?</p>
               <p>Gilson. It was about half after seven o'clock on the 10th of August; on the 20th of August I took a walk that way again, and near farmer Wellings' I sat down under a bush, and saw two men at a little distance; I knew them to be the men that robbed me; I followed them to farmer Wellings'; I told the story to the farmer's servant on horseback close by; there were several people had been walking that way; they urged my pursuing them; the farmer brought me a horse and sent the two men with me on horseback, and we pursued and took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the two men you took were the men?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Yes, very sure; I knew them at the first fight, and communicated it to this gentleman, and they retired on seeing me.</p>
               <p>Q. from Mills. What colour clothes had I on at the time?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Brown colour clothes.</p>
               <p>Mills. Was this the coat?</p>
               <p>Gilson. I cannot speak positively; it was a coat nearly that colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he it on both times?</p>

               <p>Gilson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the face of the men?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Yes; I looked at him sharply while he was searching me, for which the other threatned me, but seeing him with the other in the same field and in the same dress that first caught my attention.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his face make no impression upon you?</p>
               <p>Gilson. It struck me as soon as I came up; I am satisfied he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. from Pugh. Had I these clothes on when the robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Gilson. He was in clothes very much resembling these.</p>
               <p>Mills. We have witnesses to prove we had different coloured clothes then; but they are not here.</p>

               <p>Edward Hall. I went to fetch a mare for Mr. Wellings; there was a hue and cry after these footpads; I saw the two prisoners going across the fields; this gentleman pointed at them, and said they had robbed him; we all three rode after them; I was the first that overtook them; I stopped Mills first; said he, what do you stop me for? I said I don't know; said he I will not be stopped by any body; I said I would blow his brains out if he did not stop directly; the gentleman came up and said these are the two men that robbed me.</p>

Yes, on Wednesday the 4th of February I saw him come by my window in the slaughter house, with some beef steak and a mutton chop in his hand. I went backwards, and I saw them in the slaughter house; in half an hour they were removed from there. I acquainted my master of it, my master fetched a constable, and they were found in the prisoner's box in our room.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of beef and mutton was there. - A. Two pounds and ten ounces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner and you eat as well as lodge in your master's house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were dieted there, as well as lodged there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. Is it not usual for journeymen butchers, when they want any thing for themselves, or fellow servants, to take it. - A. It may.</p>
               <p>Q. You have done it yourself. - A. Not to conceal it in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not have put it there for sale, could not you have eat a bit of it if he had asked you, if it had been done very nice and hot. - A. I dare say I should.</p>

            , junior. I was very much irritated at the ingratitude of the prisoner. At the request of Bedford I went into his room and saw his box opened before the constable came. I saw the parts in the shop where they were taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you permit your servants to take beef or mutton out of your shop. - A. Certainly not, they have a good table to sit down to.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

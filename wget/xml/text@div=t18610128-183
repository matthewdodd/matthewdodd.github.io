                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside at 8, Upper St. Martin's-lane, and am a confectioner—on Thursday evening, 3d January, about 7 o'clock the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a brick loaf—that came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put in a crumpet to make up the weight—she tendered a shilling, I gave her 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and she left—I put the shilling in a small box in the till by itself—there was no other silver there but a sixpence, which I took out to give her—the next day, Friday, she came again about half-past 4, and asked for a loaf—that came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she tendered a shilling—I looked at it; it was bad—I said, "The moment I saw you coming, I was sure you were coming with another bad shilling"—when I said the shilling was a bad one, she said, "I did not know it was bad"—she begged me to let her go, and wanted me to give her the shilling back—I did not give it to her—I sent for a constable, and constable F 81 came—I gave him the shilling that I had taken on this occasion—the prisoner was then taken to the station-house—I went to the station, and after that, I went home and looked directly at the one I had taken the day before, and saw it was bad—it bad not been mixed with any other silver—it was placed with some halfpence to pay a baker—I gave that shilling to the same constable directly—my little daughter Mary serves in the shop besides myself.</p>

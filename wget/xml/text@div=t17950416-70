               <p>Q. On what part was that wound inflicted? - On the upper part of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw it, what day? - I really don't know the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this business happened? - The day after this had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th of April? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part of the head was it? - On the upper part, towards the side of the crown of the head, towards the ear.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a continued grazed wound? - It was continued.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any judgment, whether that would was indicted by a gun shot? - I have an opinion on the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your opinion that it was? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. On your opinion, as a man of seience in the profession, it was indicted by a gun shot? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you washed the wound or see it washed in your presence? - I did not. I directed it to be done; it was not done in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not extract any thing from the wound? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. When you say it was your opinion, did you form that opinion from the appearance of the wound only, or from such information as you may have received? - Merely from the appearance of the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. You had, I suppose, heard at least, what passed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That did not assist your judgment? - It certainly had a very different appearance from what we call an incised wound or a contused wound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You have seen many gun shot wounds? - No, I have not been in the habit of seeing many of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Thank God there are not many practical surgeons of that cast.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. How long have you been in practice? - About ten years in practice; not all the time for myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Which side of the head was it upon? - Upon my word, I have almost forgot on which side it was; I think it was the left, but I am not positive of that.</p>

               <p>Q. Of what prison? - New-prison, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the warrant of commitment that was made by Mr. Flood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good to hand it over; you know Mr. Flood's writing? - Yes.(The warrant of commitment of Isdwell Isdwell, otherwise of Idswell Idswell, dated the 14th of March, read.)</p>
               <p>Const. Was he brought on the date of that warrant - He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When did you last see him in your gaol? - It was on the Wednesday preceding the Friday; I was up at Bow-street with him at a re-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What Wednesday was that? - It might be the first of April, Friday was the third.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was with him at that time at a re-examination at Bow-street? - Yes, on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come back again in your custody? - Not in my custody; he came back in the custody of a servant of mine, named Roberts.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen him yourself? - I saw him the Wednesday at Bow-street; I left him at Bow-street in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160150"></xptr>care of my servant; I did not see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Roberts? - He is at the door; he see him every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Day was a keeper of the prison? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the particular appointment of him in the prison? - He was as an under servant, but he had not been above a year, or year and a half with me, and therefore he was not entrusted with the outer key, except at night, and then they took it in turns.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your principal man under you in the prison? - I consider Roberts as my principal man; but my principal turnkey, his name is Norman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Day an under servant to him? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Day entrusted with the key every night? - No, not every night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it depend upon Norman, the principal turnkey, to entrust him, or did the trust come from your particular order? - It did not come from my order, but they settle it among themselves; three of them took it in turns.</p>
               <p>Q. When he is entrusted with the key at night, of course he has the care of the outer gate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Newport, had Day acquainted you that he had at any time received any presents from Isdwell? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Not of any sort, nor at any time whatever? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever the smallest idea that he meant to give Isdwell, or any other prisoner, any indulgence out of the walls of the prison? - If I had any idea of it I should have prevented it, you may depend upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of any person being admitted to him beyond the order of the magistrate? - I never knew it till after this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Day never acquainted you with it? - No; that came out at Bow-street; I never knew it till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if ever Day did any thing of this kind, it was against his duty, and without your permission? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Henderson. How long has Day lived with you? - He has lived a servant with me about a year and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him before that time? - Yes, I have seen him sometimes, before I engaged him, and I went to inquire into his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in prison? - Never.</p>

               <p>Court. Then I must correct Mr. Roberts's evidence. You see him on Wednesday, was it on Wednesday after the examination? - On Wednesday, if the examination was on Wednesday; but I am not sure whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday, but it was the day when the last watch was delivered up to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Roberts, was you there when the last watch was delivered up to him? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And was the prisoner taken back to gaol, and was he continued there till Friday, when you see him? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was there on Friday the 3d of April? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the deceased since he died? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man? - That is the man that I saw on the 4th, and that escaped from gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gurney. Did Day ever disclose to you that he meant to give Idswell any indulgence beyond the walls of the prison? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court. We must almost take that for granted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will admit it.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did he mean by your master? - Idswell. I went up stairs directly, and Idswell asked me whether I had said any thing more to Crosswell? - I said, no, I should not say any thing more; he asked me to send for Crosswell up; there was nothing more past. I came down, and sent Crosswell up to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next fact that took place? - Then when Crosswell went up, he had a rough great coat on, which he had worn the whole day. I went up stairs again, and I fetched some things out of pawn, that Idswell had given Crosswell the duplicates of, on Thursday night.</p>

When in fact did you come from the prison? - He went out as soon as Mr. Roberts was gone, I went out and see every thing was still; Crosswell went out, and asked me to go and see if every body was gone to bed; when I came in again, Crosswell wanted me to go directly, he said it was very safe then. Just as we were going to go out, I refused three or four times over; says Crosswell, I will load a blunderbuss for your safety; he loaded one, and I refused to go then, and he said that would be security for me, I might go safe enough with that, and master's servant came down in the place, and he was going to ask him for a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, when did Idswell come down from his room, if he came down at all? - Near twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. What then? - Idswell said, if you have any scruples of my coming back again, I will leave a hundred guineas, and all my property with you; at last, with great persuasions, I went out along with him, we walked as far as Smithfield, and then took a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a great way; is it not? - Not half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the first coach stand? - No, there was none on Clerkenwell-green.</p>

             and Haydon were the two first that came up in the manner you describe. Now, Haydon kicked you on the Hams, and by that means these two got you down? - Yes, While I was down, Hardwicke came on this side and got the blunderbuss away from me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that before you on the stairs? - It was before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have got to that place but by passing you, while you was in the scuffle? - I don't know that he could.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160156"></xptr>Q. Any other stair case there? - I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. To your own knowledge, was there any other? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What position were you in at the time that the blunderbuss was discharged? - I was catching hold of the banisters of the stairs, I was with my heels up, tripped up, and laying hold of the banisters of the stairs to save myself; afterwards they broke my hold, and I went to the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the instant that the blunderbuss was discharged, what was your situation then? - My head was bleeding, and they broke my hold, knocking my hands off the banisters, and I fell to the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you fall from the place in which you was standing in? - About two or three stairs; they knocked my hands a way, and my head fell within two or three stairs of the bottom, my heels laying above.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the blunderbuss discharged from a situation above you or below you? - Above me. Then afterwards they beat me across the loins with the blunderbuss.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what was the first thing they said or did, after you so fell? - They beat me across the loins, with the blunderbuss.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form a judgment whether there were more persons employed in doing you a mischief than four? - I believe there were, because when I got to the bottom, I strove to get myself up, and I catched hold of a man's apron.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were beating you do you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear that the person to whom the apron belonged, was standing with respect to you? - Somebody was kicking me in the face, and I caught hold of his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you, while another, or others were beating you with the blunderbuss? - Afterwards they jumped upon me, and said, d-mn him, he is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more voices, or more persons employed in that act of violence than one? - I am sure there were more than one. Then some of them went up stairs, and got a light with a bit of brown paper, and they could see that I was not dead, and they raised me up by the hair of my head.</p>

               <p>Q. What was said or done? - As soon as I saw the light, somebody said, no, he is not dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Who called out that? - I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it more than one? - No, I don't know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you distinguish who that person was? - No; they afterwards came down and raised me up by the hair of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons came down, do you think, and raised you by the hair of your head? - I think five or six. After they had raised me up, I began to fight as well as I could, and cried out murder, as loud as I could. They then got my handkerchief-</p>
               <p>Q. Was there then, at that time, any other light produced except the brown paper? - No, there was not. I said, for God's sake, don't murder me, for my family's sake; they then got me down and hanged me in my handkerchief. They got me down again, and I had a silk handkerchief on my neck, and they put their hands between my neck and handkerchief, and they held me so till I was almost dead.</p>
               <p>Q. This was after you begged them not to murder you? - Yes; there were people coming round about the house; I lay still on my face towards the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard an alarm from without? - I did; and I see a woman come to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160157"></xptr>bottom of the passage with a candle in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that turn out to be the woman of the house? - Yes; and said, for God's sake open the door, and let them out. As soon as they perceived the light come, they all ran up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When the light first came, did you observe any man in the passage, whom you had not before seen, after you had gone into the house? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the light coming, what state of things presented themselves to you? could you observe how many persons ran away from you? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. More than one or two? - One or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the time of the light appearing in the passage, and the people coming in from the street, was almost instantaneous? - Yes. I got up as soon as I saw the light, and walked towards the street door, with my head and face bleeding. The door was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the first person that drew your attention after you had light to make observation? - I believe it was a watchman that came to me first; then there were some more patrols. As soon as I got the door open, I stood against the door, and there was a woman came in her shift.</p>
               <p>Q. The appearance of light, and their running up stairs, and the opening the door, was all done in an instant? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened the door? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the watchman came in first? - Yes, the watchman; and patrols went up stairs with him. I see a woman come to the door in her shift.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, came in from the street? - Yes, in at the outer door, and said, there were two men on the top of their houses. I went with the woman, about eight or nine doors off, and found it to be Haydon, and John Henley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the same side of the way? - Yes; they went out of a window on other persons houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them in the hands of a person of the name of Spencer? - Yes, Spencer was there present.</p>
               <p>Q. What, were they on the top of the house? - On the top of Spencer's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up to the top? - Yes, I went up to the top, and brought one down, and Spencer the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you bring down? - I brought Haydon.</p>
               <p>Q. And Spencer brought down? - Henley.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do next? - We took them to the watch-house, and then the patrols brought all the rest in, except Mr. Tilley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return at all to No. 13? - Yes, from the watch-house; I see a patrol, and he asked me what I wanted? I said, I wanted the prisoner. He said, he is dead; and then a patrol gave charge of me to go to the watch-house; I believe his name is Service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Idswell afterwards? - I did not till I came back from the watch-house. I see him sit down with his head down between his legs, just within the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. He was alive at that time? - I believe he was; somebody oil say he spoke two or three times after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to the persons that you have named, how did you get back from the watch-house the second time, after you had been sent to the watch-house? - The patrol gave charge, but they did not take any notice of me, and I went back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to Hardwicke, Haydon, Henley, and Delany, are you quite sure that these are the persons? - </p>
               <p>Court to Hardwicke. Stand forward.</p>
               <p>Q. To Day. Are you sure that is the man that took the blunderbuss from you? - I am sure that is Hardwicke.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160158"></xptr>Q. Have you the least doubt at all about his person? - I am sure that is the person.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are a public officer? - I am overseer of the Old Artillery Ground.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to this house in Artillery-lane first? - As the watchman was going one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. I will trouble you to produce the fragments of a blunderbuss; did you see them found in the house? - Part of them; I produce them as delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. There are some sticks you have got there, where did you get them? - Two I found myself in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them? - In the one pair of stairs, on the left hand, one in the bed-room, and the other in the front room, the parlour or dining-room. This stick was delivered to me by a man of the house at No. 13. In what particular part it was found I did not see. (Produces the pieces of the blunderbuss.)</p>
               <p>Q. It has been in your custody ever since? - Yes, it has.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it first put into your custody? - Between five and six o'clock on Saturday morning. This stock I took down to the watch-house myself, and these pieces Mr. Mitcheli got together, and gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Day. They are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen them before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have looked at them again now? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the blunderbuss with which you was beat in the manner you have described? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. I am for Hardwicke, Henley and Delany. Mr. Day, you have told us that you was the turnkey of this prison? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have likewise told us, that Crosswell was the other? - Yes, he was my fellow servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore all the applications that were made to you, Crosswell was privy to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are aware, that if you are not believed in what you have told to the jury, of course the consequences of this man's escape, and his subsequent murder, you will have to answer for? - I have told nothing but what is true.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160159"></xptr>Court. He is certainly not liable to the consequences of this man's murder, if his evidence is true.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Did I understand you that you were not certain that orders were given to prevent any body from seeing Mr. Idswell? - His wife used to come to him, and Mr. Tilley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that there were orders for nobody else to see him? - I am not sure. Mr. Brown see him that night the murder was committed, and uncle Johnny; I know there were many persons refused to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know there was such an order given? - I have heard Mr. Roberts say, that there was nobody else to see him but Mr. Tilly and his wife; but he never gave me a strict charge, because I had not the key.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you said that his uncle, to gain admission, gave you a guinea a piece? - No, not his uncle, Mr. Idswell did.</p>
               <p>Q. In the night that you went with this man, you say you walked part of the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is the prison from the place where this unfortunate affair happened? - I cannot say exactly, because I am not used to that part of the town; the coach was a shilling fare.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you guess at the distance that you went? - It was from Smithfield to Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the room, or followed Idswell into the room, you say that Hardwicke took hold of you by the arm? - He took hold of me by the arm, and tried to pull me into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you resist going into the room? - I hung back, and my coat sleeve came off.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do immediately, on your coat sleeve giving way? - I hung back, and Haydon laid hold of my right side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come out of the room? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the light at this time? - In the room, so as I could see the others come from behind the curtains.</p>
               <p>Court. So situated as to give live light to the stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Then without moving the light in the room, there was light enough on the stairs to see what passed? Did any body else after that bring out the light? - Yes, while we were struggling on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. These two persons who took hold of you on the stairs, whoever they were, besides Haydon, had done it before the candle was brought out? - The candle was in the room, but it was so as I could see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards the candle was brought out; did you see who brought the light out? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Hardwicke did not attempt to take the blunderbuss when Idswell said, d-mn him, he has got a blunderbuss; but it was after when you was on the stairs? - Yes; they took it from me in the struggling, at the time during the struggling; there were then four on me, them that I perfectly know, if there were any more I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the candle put out at the time that he took the blunderbuss from under your coat? - At the time the blunderbuss went away, he said, d-mn it I have got it, and immediately the candle was put out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there could not be half a minute pass from the time you first attempted to go into the room, from the time that the blunderbuss was fired? - It might be half a minute, or it might be rather more, I cannot say exactly to a moment, it was almost instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. You perfectly saw and observed, and was able to observe every thing so distinctly? - I see them four persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in that half minute, was it possible for Idswell to have passed you, and get down without your knowledge?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160160"></xptr>- I cannot say that. I cannot conceive how he did get down, I thought he had been in the room all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew not what happened to Idswell till you retuned? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You describe yourself as your heels being higher than your head, and your hands hold of the banisters, and your face towards the banisters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did I hear you right, when I thought I heard you say, that they two persons were holding down your head? - I am sure them four were there, how many more I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When you talked of being beat with the blunderbuss, you did not tell who it was? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the blunderbuss was broke on you? - That is the blunderbuss that I took with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say by the display of its being brought here, that this was broke about you? - I can say no more than this, the first time they struck me the blunderbuss broke.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that at the time? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do swear that this was broke on you, and in the way that you have described? - I will swear it was broke about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it broke in the way that you have produced it? - I never see it till I see it at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. When you returned to the house did you see any of the pieces? - I did not; I never saw them till they were brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same night, or the next morning? - I believe it was five or six o'clock the next morning, but I did not see it all then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the four persons before? - I don't know that I ever see them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manley. Where do you come from? - I came from Cornwell and Liecester.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of Liecestershire? - From Swandom.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with Mr. Freeman of that country? - I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in his company often? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to school to him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you left that country? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you before you came out of that country? - I followed my father's business, a harness maker and collar maker; I came up and followed my own trade for some weeks, and it began to grow very dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had you any knowledge of this business before? - No, I never was in it but once.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to get the place? - I was recommended by one Mr. Ridgeway.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you come from now? who brought you hither? - I come from New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you in your office still? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You come as a prisoner? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was committed for this felony? Have you been in confinement? - I have been in confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. You come here now in custody? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You received a guinea to admit this man's uncle to see him, and Mr. Crosswell another? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any other largeesses? - We received one guinea one night, and one guinea another.</p>
               <p>Q. How many good things did you receive; not money, but monies worth? - When he first came to prison he wanted to send down a note to his house, in St. Mary-axe, Mr. Roberts see the note; I sent my wife with it, and the next morn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160161"></xptr>ing he asked me what I expected? - I said, nothing, he asked me how many children I had? - I told him I had got two; and Mrs. Idswell brought two yards of common cotton for my two children.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Day, you received a guinea a piece besides these things that you have mentioned? - We received two guineas each.</p>
               <p>Q. How many duplicates might you have received? - I did not receive any, Crosswell had some duplicates given him, that the times were almost out, a watch, ring, hat and coat. On the Thursday night, just before I went out, Idswell said to his wife, my dear, will you go and fetch these things out of pawn; and he gave me three guineas to get them out of pawn with, the hat, coat and watch, was in for two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you bring? - A hat, a ring, a coat, and watch; I believe the interest and every thing came to two pounds seventeen, or two pounds sixteen and ten-pence, I don't know which, and Idswell said to me, do you take the hat and coat to your house, and bring me the watch and ring the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Day, had you not orders to permit no person to see this man, but his wife and attorney? - I will not say positively that I had, because I had not the key to let in any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that several persons were turned away? - Two persons were turned away.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to deny or admit that you had full knowledge that nobody but this man's wife and attorney, were to be admitted? - I don't know, I will not say positively that I had that order.</p>
               <p>Q. He offered a large sum to be left? - He said, Mr. Crosswell, I will leave you all my money, watch and security, to the amount of a hundred pounds, if you are afraid I shall not return.</p>
               <p>Q. So then you went out to see that every thing was quiet? - I did, by my fellow servant's desire.</p>
               <p>Q. O, your fellow servant to be sure was all wrong; by his desire you went to see that all was hush and quiet, and then at twelve o'clock at night, you chose that hour to take this man out? - I did not choose it, it was not my will, I went against my will all the way, but through great persuasions.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you came to the house, what sort of a candle was in it? - I did not make that observation of the candle, but I see it was a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen any one of these four prisoners at the bar? - I do not recollect ever seeing them, I may have seen them, but not know them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to the landing place, where you say Hardwicke seized you, a pretty considerable scuffle ensued? - No, there was him, and then Haydon came in, and then the other man came out.</p>
               <p>Q. And it lasted half a minute? - It might.</p>
               <p>Q. The blunderbuss was in your side pocket? - It was in my side pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it in your side pocket? - Not half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. May not the cock have gone off in pulling it out? - It was not off till it was out, not till the candle was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say now, and mind what you are about; do you mean to say this, that that did not go off by accident, while it was pulling out of your pocket? - I say it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that? - I do; because after he got it out -</p>
               <p>Q. Now immediately after the person used that expression, d-mn him I have got it, what past then, was there not an immediate scuffle then? - It was all in a scuffle then, and the candle was put out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160162"></xptr>Q. Was it not quite dark then? - It was dark when the blunderbuss was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. And all in a scuffle? - It was all in a scuffle, and my heels were up, and head down.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell who fired? - God knows, I cannot say who it was that fired; I don't know, I did not see any body fire.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was a great scuffle at that moment of the firing? - There was a scuffle.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the persons serving you at that firing? - Two above and two below.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on the steps of the stairs? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Two of them below you, and two above you? - There were.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they from you at the time? - Some of them had hold of me, and I had hold of the banisters at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not swear now, to these gentlemen of the jury, that any man fired that instrument? - I cannot; because as soon as he said, d-mn him I have got it, the light was put out instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. It had before been told by Idswell, that you had a loaded blunderbuss, and then it was answered d-mn him, I have got the blunderbuss away? - Yes; it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you say of Idswell, the deceased, when you returned, you was taken to the watch-house, and afterwards you found him sitting at the bottom of the stairs with his head down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell us that you thought he had been in the room all the time, you never see him pass you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person pass except these persons that you have mentioned? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had been at the bottom of the stairs, when you was first taken to the watch-house, you might have seen? - I might see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why the man was dying, how could you avoid seeing him? - I tell you I did see him, I see him when the watchman came and laid hold of me; the patrol gave charge of me first, and the watchman did not take any notice of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean you see him now before you went to the watch-house? - I see him when they brought the light.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to state, that as soon as the light was produced, and before you went to the watch-house, you see Idswell on the stairs? - I did not see him when the first light was produced, but when the people were coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Your answer to me first this moment, was, that you did not see him when the light was first produced? - I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from the place where you see Idswell? - It may be two or three yards; I lay with my head facing the woman that brought the light, and he lay against the door, and she said, for God's sake let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time might there be between the light coming, before the light came? - I cannot say, I was fighting with them till the light came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the light came, before you see Idswell there? - When I was fighting, I was calling out murder all the time, till they got me by the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the bringing of the light that you saw Idswell there? - Almost directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any groans at that time, when the blunderbuss went off at any part? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not hear any thing like a groan of a person that was injured at the time the blunderbuss was fired off? Did you hear any groans before the candle was produced? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The man, we are told, died within<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160163"></xptr>twenty minutes after? - I don't know when he died.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear any groans, and yet the man was not five yards off from you? - Not three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no appearance of any person being wounded there? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Between your going into the bed-room, and the person coming with the candle, how long might it be? - Two minutes is a long time in the situation I was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say how long it was? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say it was four minutes? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that time you had never seen Haydon or Hardwicke, Henly or Delany? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you was a good deal confused and flurried when your coat sleeve went away? - To be sure, I was, but I was not so much alarmed, but I could tell the persons; I know them four.</p>
               <p>Q. In the moment you were seized by your coat sleeve, you were in a considerable alarm and confusion? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Tilley. The present that you received for admitting the uncle of Idswell, did you acquaint Mr. Roberts or your master? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you acquaint Mr. Newport that Idswell's uncle had ever been admitted into the prison? - Never, I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say you were requested several times to admit Idswell, to go to see this 
dying aunt of his? - I was.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you ever acquaint Mr. Roberts or your master, or Mr. Newport, that any such request or desire, had been made to you or any body? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that it was not a thing for you to permit, or for him to desire of you. It was a wrong thing either of one side or the other? - I know it was a wrong thing for me to be guilty of.</p>
               <p>Q. Or Idswell to ask of you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not acquaint Mr. Roberts or Mr. Newport your master, that any such solicitation had been made to you? - I never consented to it till the very night it took place.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was a handsome present to be made in case this was done, by Mr. Idswell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you expect on this occasion? - There was no sum mentioned; he said he would make us a very handsome present.</p>
               <p>Q. You expected, however, that it was something that they would come down handsomely? - We expected something.</p>
               <p>Q. Why will not you answer my question; did you expect something handsome, yes or no? - We expected something. We expected him to be as good as his word.</p>
               <p>Q. When you arrived at this house, on your oath, yes or no, did you ring at the bell, or was the door opened? - I did not ring at the bell.</p>
               <p>Q. That you will swear most positively? - I see Mr. Tilley coming from the door, and I said to Mr. Idswell, there is Mr. Tilley, and when I got up at the door, the man had got the door against his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean positively to persist in it, that the door was not opened, but that you found it open? - We never rung nor knocked. Whether Mr. Tilley rung at the bell, and then came away when he see us come I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, you cannot say that Mr. Tilley touched any thing at all there? - I cannot tell, I see him come along the door.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was Tilley you saw, he had his wife hanging on his arm, was not she? - I did not see his wife hanging on his arm, they were both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the wife was pregnant or no at that time? - I did not; indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160164"></xptr>Q. Upon your oath, did the person you say was Tilley, speak to you at all? - Not as he passed, but when I got up to the door, I said to the man that opened the door, there is Tilley, call him back, Tilley comes back, and said who should think of seeing you Mr. Idswell.</p>


               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you ever speak to him? - When he got me by the hand, he said good night Day, don't be afraid of me; I said good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you call him back to speak to you or not? - I told Bowley to call him back, and he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell him to call him back for? - I had no inclination to call him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told him to call him back without any inclination? - I knew him to come backwards and forwards to Idswell in the prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you say to somebody there, for God's sake don't you say that you see me here? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that was not your reason for calling any body back? - I had no other reason than seeing him come backwards and forwards to him in prison. Tilley shook me by the hand, I never said such a word. Tilley shook me by the hand, and said good night Day, don't be afraid of me.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you would not liked to have been seen there conveying a prisoner out of goal? - I should not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you would have been liable to punishment if you had been observed? - Yes; but I was not so well acquainted with it as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that you did not desire any body not to tell that you was seen there? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, then Tilley and his wife if it was he, went away? - They did.</p>

               <p>Q. They were going in the contrary direction at the time you desired him to be called back? - They were going in a direction from us.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, have you been in the same room with Bowley, confined in the room since this happened? - No, I have not, I slept in one room, and he in another.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you permitted to see one another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On you oath, have you ever conversed with him from that time to this? - I have never conversed with no one, no other than speaking open to them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, or have you no, conversed with him? - I have discoursed with him as well as other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath, have you never conversed in private? - Never; because he slept in another room to what I did, and there were four more in my room, and four or five in his room.</p>
               <p>Q. In the day time you may have conversed together? - Yes, but there were ten or eleven of us more together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. With respect to Mr. Tilley, being called back, how many times had Mr. Tilley been at the goal in that particular day? - Four or five, I will swear to four myself; because Mrs. Tilley came with him twice.</p>
               <p>Q. The same person that you see in Artillery-lane? - The same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the last of these visits that he communicated to you, that Mr. Moses was going to keep the passover at home that very night? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Having disposed of that, I have but one more question to ask. You was asked, whether this blunderbuss did not go off by accident, as it was coming out of your pocket? it wounded you on the back part of your head, and killed Idswell; I need hardly ask it, it is so ridiculous-</p>
               <p>Court. You was laying down at the time that the blunderbuss went off? - Yes my heels were up the stairs and I catched hold of the banisters.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the coat pocket shot through?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160165"></xptr>- No, they had got it quite out before they shot.</p>
               <p>Q. It was perfectly clear of the pocket before it went off? - Hardwicke had said, d-n him, I have got it, before it went off; I lay on the side on which the blunderbuss was.</p>
               <p>Q. No part of your clothes were burnt at all? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your pocket turned out in the business? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live in Artillery street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Near the house No. 12, the next door to it where this accident happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect hearing any particular noise that took place on the 4th of April last? - Yes, I was alarmed by the cry of murder, and fire, as high as I can partly tell, about half after twelve, or a quarter before one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - I ran to the door to hear what it was, in my shirt; I went back and put on my clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you dressed yourself? - I put on a few things, not entirely all. I went back to the house, and a watchman was getting in at the window. When he got in, I desired the watchman to open the door, which he could not. I tried to force it open, the first time I could not; the second time I tried, it flew open. The first thing I saw was the man that was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. In what posture was he in? - He lay on the ground with his back towards the door, about a yard from it. I observed that his clothes were on fire, which by some means I put out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any other person in the passage? - I see a man, who they call Day, about a yard from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light brought into the house? - The woman of the house brought me a candle as soon as I got in.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the person you met next? - I laid hold of Day, he said, for God's sake help me, or I shall be murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person come to your assistance? - Just after that Mr. Jarvis, the night officer, came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you and Day any assistance? - He ordered me to aid and assist, which I readily said I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any body in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there? - We went up the one pair of stairs, and at the bottom of the second pair of stairs we saw two men and two women coming down stairs. I asked them what they did there?</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they? - That man in the blue coat. Phillips The other is the man that is turned evidence, Bowley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to them? - Yes, I asked them what they did there? The reply that that man made was, that they were lodgers, and came down to know what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then take them in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had taken them in custody, where did you go? - I went into the one pair of stairs bed room; I searched the room and the bed, and in the bed I see a pillow tied up at one end.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing remarkable about the pillow? - It had a woman's cap on. I then was called down stairs, I believe by Jarvis. We went into the out yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the house? - Yes; afterwards we went into the out yard, and we went round to the privy; there we found a man, I believe his name to be 
               <persName id="t17950416-70-person767">
                  John

            . That is the man I mean.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he to say for himself? - He said, that he had heard a noise, and was frightened, and had occasion to go there; Mr. Jarvis said, we should have occasion to bring him forward; as such,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160166"></xptr>we took him into custody, and took him to the watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then return into the house? - Yes, we searched the house, and upon the house, and found no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the house? - Yes; I found the blunderbuss in different parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean in different parts of the house, or the blunderbuss in different pieces? - In different parts of the house. The but I picked up in the passage, and sent to the watch-house, the lock I picked up in the ashes of the one pair of stairs room, in the fire place, the front room; throwed quick behind, the lock was close to the sender.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the room where the pillow was? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Room on that floor? - Yes. That other bit of the stock was with the handle, and this other piece, I believe, was in the window of the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of these sticks?(some sticks shewn him) - Yes. This stick I picked up on the one pair of stairs landing place, on the floor, the landing place between the bed room and the front room door; the other was found in the house by Mr. Sanders, and other people, in my presence, and delivered altogether to Mr. Sanders; to the best of my knowledge, that crooked stick was in the garnet, picked up by Mr. Sanders. This one, that man that had the care of the house with me during the night picked it up in the bed room, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the other was found? - I do not particularly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manley. Then this large stick was found in the bed room? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of it? - I think up at the bed's head, by the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. In the natural place where it would be expected to be? - It may be so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I am for Phillips and Solomons. When Phillips had told you we are lodgers, had he any stick about him? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched? - Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a stick in his hand? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to John Solomons he had got into the privy? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. He hearing the noise? - I don't know what made him go there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Was not the door shut when you came to the house? - It was, and double locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the state of the curtains in this room? - They were all drawn about the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in the room? - We found three hats, Mr. Sanders and I, and two or three more gentlemen. This is one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend before the magistrate at Bow-street? - Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body at the examination at Bow-street that claimed that hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was? - That little man behind owned the little cocked up hat, John Henley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body own that hat, or another hat? - We asked round and that hat belonged to the keeper which was found on the prisoner that stands there behind.</p>

               <p>Court. Where was that hat found? - The hat that he has now got was found in the house, and this hat he had got under his arm at the examination at Bow-street, which I was ordered, by Mr. Flood, to take.</p>
               <p>Q. To Day. Had you left a hat of your's in Artillery-lane? - I went home without a hat.</p>
               <p>Q. To Michall. This hat was taken from Handland at Bow-street, and a hat gave to Day, which was found in Artillery lane? - It was so.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160167"></xptr>Q. Was any thing said about that hat? - Handland said, he had bought Day's hat and gave nine shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he did not own either of the hats found in Artillery-lane? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. To Day. Did you lose your hat in the scuffle in Artillery-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went home without it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the hat found at Artillery lane your property? - I believe it is, it is not in the state in which I lost it now, because there was a stamp went across and a maker's name went across.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe it is your's? - Yes, and I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you give this reason for it, there had been a flat stamp descriptive of the duty paid? - Yes, and a round mark descriptive of the abode of the hatter and a leather that went before.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear to you that these are the marks of these things having been in that hat that are not in it now? - I believe that they have been in it, and there was a large twist band on it.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us the next person you saw? - The next person I particularly noticed was the deceased; he was sitting on the floor of the passage, with his head leaning forward towards his knees.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the door? - Just within the door, so as the door could open without touching him.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell my lord what light it was that you was able to discern these people? - I cannot tell justly by what light, but the watchmen had candles on the step of the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him, or he to you? - I don't recollect saying any thing. I immediately secured him. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160168"></xptr>held the drawn cutlass before me, and secured him by the collar.</p>

I went into the yard with Mitchell; there was a light, and came to the privy door, and it was fast. I then laid hold of it by a hole that was in the door to admit the light, and it came open, whether by my shaking it or not, I cannot tell; and that man was then sitting on the seat of the privy. I asked him what he did there? - he said that he had heard a gun go off; I think those were the exact words, and that he was obliged to come in there, into the privy.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you and the other ladies went to Artillery-street. Had you been there before? - Yes, several times. I was employed there; I had half a guinea a week ever since the second day that Mr. Idswell was in trouble, first of all in St. Mary-axe, and then at this place in Artillery-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in the room then, when you said that joke? - There was only Simon Jacobs there, and the mother of the maid servant, then a little while longer I carried on that joke till Hardwicke came in. I said I did not care if I am the sick aunt, and one of them said I might as well be the sick aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. Phillips was not there till you began to play the farce of the sick aunt.

               <p>Q. How long might you continue in bed? - Not above five or six-minutes; I got up immediately, and then I heard the bell ring.</p>

               <p>Q. It is one thing to swear positively to them. We understand as to those you have now named, Hardwicke, Haydon, Jacobs, and Phillips, you swear positively to? - I do. There was another man came in along with them, but who it was I cannot say; but if I am right and not mistaken, it is him in the whitish coat; I am not sure of it, (Handland) I said at that time, this man in the blue coat came in, Haydon; I am sure he came in.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you heard the bell ring, were all you in the bed room? - We were. I went down then and opened the door; when I opened the door, came on Mr. Idswell and Day, just at the threshold of the door; then Day says to me, Bowley.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by being just at the threshold of the door? - They were not on the step, but close at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they were the persons that rung the bell, you cannot tell? - I can not tell, but they were very near to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What past on your first opening of the door? - Day says to me, Bowley; there is Tilley going, go and call him; I then went out about ten yards, and as I went Tilley came right up to me like; I then said to Tilley, there is Day wants to speak with you; he then came up to the door, Tilley did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Day and Idswell stay at this time? - They were standing at the door while I called Tilley; Tilley came to the door, and shok hands along with Day and Idswell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with Tilley? - Not when I see him; he came up as I was going forward.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether his wife was with him or not? - No, I cannot swear that his wife was with him. He came up and shook hands both with Day and Isdwell. I cannot say that I heard what he said; he did speak, but what he said, I cannot be certain; but he shook hands with them both. Then afterwards Idswell went in first, Day followed him. I then stopped at the door for about a minute and a half; and I said to Mr. Tilley, why don't you come in? - and I said so to him twice or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say or do? - He said, he would rather not. He did not go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160173"></xptr>he went about his business, went away. I after then shut the door; before I could rightly come up the first pair of stairs, I heard a wrangle.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean? - The first pair of stairs where the bed chamber is.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that wrangle seem to proceed from? - That I cannot say. I heard a wrangle, and I went to the second stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What you passed the bed chamber? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down stairs to open the door, where did you leave all the company? - In the bed chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not in the front room all that evening? - That I cannot say; they never assembled there; the rooms join each other; I cannot positively say; the landing place is as well to the dining room as it is to the bed chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. The landing place! I do not understand you? - When you get up one pair of stairs, the first room that you come into is the bed chamber, and the room that goes right front is the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same stairs lands you for the one, lands you for the other? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. In which of these two rooms were all the parties assembled? - In the bed room, where the sick aunt was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any truth in that story at all, or was mere artifice? - There was no such aunt, no further than the pillow and night cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you heard the wrangle, and what became of you? - I went up stairs towards the second stairs; I had not been but a few stairs before I heard the prisoner, whom I supposed it to be Idswell by the irons, running down stairs, as it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light at this time, by which you could see the state of things? - I could not, for I removed further up stairs towards the garret; then I heard the noise of a gun, as I thought (that is now called a blunderbuss) discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon might that piece of fire arms be discharged, in your judgment, after you had heard the found of Idswell's irons? - I suppose it might be three minutes or so; I cannot rightly say. I went into the garret, when I went into the garret there was the servant and another woman, her mother, sitting on the sofa; but they are not here; but a little while after in came Phillips, and the man called John Solomons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same Solomons whom you had seen in Fashion-street that evening? - It was. A little while afterwards John Solomons was gone down, and I don't know where he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body attempt to get out of the window? - Solomons attempted to get out of window, but he could not; we heard the rattles and the officers all about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Solomons went down? - Yes.

            ? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the country all at once? - Never, unless I went to Holland or back again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of going to Holland all of a sudden? - I traffick in all kinds of goods, I bought hard ware there, and I sold it here.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a dealer in hard ware? - I have dealt in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you dealt in lately? - I went out when I had nothing else to do; I got my bread in an honest livelihood, as well as I could, worked hard for my bread.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manley. You say when Day went up stairs, Idswell went up stairs, and Day followed him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You were then at the door, standing at the door, and let them in? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it after that that you went up stairs? - About a minute, or a minute and a half, I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you past the bed room close by it? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And went up the two pair of stairs? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you past the bed room door, there was nothing happened at that time. Did you see any body laying hold of a man by the arm? - I see nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no sluster at that time? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the bed room was shut when you past it? - Half and half; I did not see them when I past; I cannot say that I did see either of them, Day or Idswell.</p>
               <p>Q. If Day had been on that landing place must you not have seen him? - I dare say I must, but I did not see him. I am quite sure I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not quite sure if he had been on the landing place, you must have seen him, must not you have brushed close past him if he had been there? - I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Idswell there? - I saw neither of them. I saw neither of them after I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole stair case was clear when you went up? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that Idswell and Day went up before you? - I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed them in a short space of time, and you are quite sure they were not there? - I am quite sure.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160175"></xptr>Q. Pray, you say Haydon came there, had Haydon any things with him? - Not that I see, I saw none of the men have any thing with them that came.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you now whether Haydon had any instrument of death, or any thing of that sort? - I see nothing at all by him, or any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no stick yourself? - I had that stick which I got from Mr. Tilley, I asked Mr. Tilley for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You heard a gun go off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the other two, Phillips and Solomons, went up into the garret? - I don't say that we went all up into the garret together.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were all there? - We were, positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the irons you heard rustling along down stairs, and there were other persons following, they all went away? - I cannot tell, I heard some following; I cannot tell further, because I was in the dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up stairs, and afterwards John Solomons and Phillips? - No; together there was no difference in their coming up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any stick in their hands, had they any weapon? - I see nothing by none of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You told us that at this night you heard the bell ring; at what time was this? - About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you heard the bell ring? - I am positive I heard it ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body else has said that the bell did not ring, they must have said false; if Mr. Day, for instance, said the bell did not ring, he must have said false.</p>
               <p>Court. Day said he did not ring the bell, whether Tilley might have rung it, he did not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say when you went down stairs, and till the time you heard the bell ring, you left a certain number of persons in the room, and among the rest you left Jacobs? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the street after the bell rung about ten yards? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You then stopped to speak to Mr. Tilley? - I called him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a considerable space of time must have been occupied from the time you left this room first, tell you came up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot take on yourself to say that Jacobs was in that room? - I cannot be on my oath, who was in the room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When the gentleman who stands near me asked you some question about yourself, you seemed quite at a loss; have you ever been at Amsterdam? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What occupation did you carry on there? - I told you that I went backwards and forwards as a dealer and chapman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been imprisoned at Amsterdam for uttering bad coin? - Never, as long as I live; I never was in prison in a foreign country in my life, I was in prison for debt here.</p>
               <p>Q. Now then, my good friend, I will ask you one question more; what is the reason that you have been called in general Bowley? - Because my name in Hebrew is Boruch, which they call Bowley.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that Jacobs has been several times at this house? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not be a very near relation to Mrs. Idswell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Henderson. Soon after you got up some part of the second flight of stairs, you say you heard somebody run out of the bed room? - Yes; after I got up two or three of the second flight of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Having passed the door which you say was almost shut, and there being no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160176"></xptr>light on the stair case you heard a wrangle as you passed by; as you was on the stairs, you than heard somebody rush out of the room and ran down, and you conjecture from the noise of the house that it was Idswell. Are you sure that others went with him? - I heard others following, but I cannot be sure who it was, because I was on the second stairs, and see nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it you apprehend it was from leting them in, until they rushed out of doors? - It must be a very short time. It may be about a minute or two after my coming in doors. I stood at the door and spoke to Mr. Tilley, and asked him to come in, and I went afterwards up stairs, and past the door.</p>
               <p>Q. A minute more had elapsed before the persons had rushed out of doors? - I suppose it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how soon was it after you heard them rush down stairs, was it you heard the report of a gun? - Very soon; I dare say, not a minute after, before I could reach to the garret, I heard the blunderbuss while I was going.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear before the explosion of the gun or after, any person crying out murder? - I did not; I heard a sad noise and a racket.</p>

               <p>Q. But if any one had been breaking a blunderbuss about the head of Mr. Day could you have heard it? - I was frightened in such a manner after I heard the report of the gun that I cannot say, I did not hear.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost your senses so much as from the situation in which you was in on the stairs that you could not have heard? - After the explosion of fire arms, I was thunderstruck.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment from what part of the house the explosion came? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was on the stairs, or in the room, or where? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot form any judgment whatever? - No, it is out of my power, I have not an idea of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that none of these men at the time you see them, had any offensive weapons? - I never saw any.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you see when you came there? - When I got outside of the house I asked what was the matter, where the fire was? - the neighbours told me there was no fire, there had been an alarm, but there was none, there had been a murder committed, there were some thieves about.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see after that report? - I see a couple of men climbing over the tiles, near to my house.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you had not got any of your things on? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did these persons turn out to be? - I know their persons, I don't know their names; that man in the light coloured hair, and blue coat (Haydon) and the other is the black bearded man(Henley.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Henderson. Did Day say, when he appeared in that manner, he had been shot, or beat? - He said he had been cruelly used, by being stamped upon.

I cannot say who it was, but I believe it was a tall man behind (Handland) I believe that was the man that had his foot on Day's neck, and with his hand beating him at his head, as though he had a club or something beating of him with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body else near him at that moment? - No one at all. He made his escape to go up stairs, the man that was beating him did that.</p>
               <p>Q. That is left him, and went up stairs. What became of the instrument, whatever it was, that he appeared to be beating him with? - I don't know; I did not see. Day rose immediately with violent cries.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the nature of the cries he made? - As though he had been very much wounded. I returned in the same moment for further assistance, and saw no more.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the street door was Day at the time you see him laying in this deplorable condition? - He was not near the street, but near the middle passage door; there is a door that divides the passage into two parts, and he was near that door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see nothing further that morning? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Idswell before he was taken out of your house? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had returned into your own apartment; when did you return again into the passage? - It might be a quarter of an hour. I went and dressed myself; I past through the passage, and I saw Idswell laying, or rather sitting in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the passage was he at that time? - Very near the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. Much nearer, if I understand you, than the situation in which you had before seen Day under the hands of this man? - Much nearer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be wounded? - Very much so indeed, as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was soon afterwards conveyed away? - He was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take particular notice of his situation? - I believe I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no more observation that day? - I did not; but on the Sunday following I found a file and a punch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they found? - At the back of the sofa in the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you describe to us what you mean by the back of the sofa? - Were they open to common observation, or concealed? - No, they were concealed between the back and the seat, pushed under a bit of the seat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that sofa part of your furniture, or something brought in? - It was Jones's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got these instruments now? - I delivered them to one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Those which you found were the same that you delivered to the officer? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You know a person at the bar who calls himself Phillips. Do you know that man? - I have seen him at my house twice.</p>
               <p>Q. When might that be? - I think it was the Thursday before that accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. The day before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in company with any other person that you have made any observation upon? - I did not see him in company with any; he walked through the house and stood in the kitchen very silent to himself, and I see no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come as a visitor to you, or the lodgers? - To the lodgers; I had no such acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a lodger of your's? - He was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160180"></xptr>Q. He was not a lodger in your house? - Not at all, never. I have no men lodgers in my house.</p>
               <p>Manley. You say you was disturbed in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that disturbance continue, that very great bustle? - But a very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it continue a few minutes? - And then the pistol went of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bustle continue while the pistol went off? - I think it did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out of your parlour, you say you see Day laying down on the floor, could you see to the street door then? - No, I did not see so far; I could, but I did not; I was standing at my parlour door, and I did not look to the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you did not look towards the street door? - I am sure I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you now sufficient recollection, so as to speak with certainty, that you did not look at the street door? - I did not look at the street door, I was at the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might the parlour door be from the street door? - There is another door that parts in the middle of the passage, that projects out.</p>
               <p>Q. That door was open? - It was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the street door? - The parlour door is very near the back door, and it is a very long passage.</p>
               <p>Q. The middle door being open might you not have seen if you had looked? - I might if I had looked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any groans there at all? - I cannot say that I did hear Idswell groan, because Day's were so very loud.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, in point of fact, you heard no other than those of Day? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing, in short, that induced you to look to the house door; you was close by Day? - I was. Day's cries were so very violent, and the surprise was so great I did not hear any more from any other part.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And you had not a foolish curiosity to go to look further, when you see a murder being committed. Attend to me a moment, will you? When you looked out, the object that prasented itself, was Day laying at his length with his head towards the foot of the stairs, and laying on his breast? - Yes; his head against the foot of the stairs, and his feet pointing towards the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he laying in the passage, clear of the stairs in the passage? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You see afterwards the situation in which Idswell was sitting, after you came out the second time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the relative situations of the places in which you see Day, with a man standing over him and beating him, and the place where you afterwards see Idswell? - He was sitting very near the front door, very near on the mat.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they in respect to each other? - Idswell's head towards Day's feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing him to have been sitting or standing on the very spot where you afterwards see him sitting, would he have been in a strait line a head of Day? - Yes, very strait indeed.</p>

               <p>Q. Supposing one had an object of discharging something through two points at the same time, could one have accomplished it by passing these two points at once? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing I intended to do it from the bed chamber door, could I have done it? - From the turning of the stairs you could have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could I from any place in which it was likely to have shot Idswell, have hit Day? - No, not where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. They appeared to you to lay directly one in a line a-head of the other? - Yes, as they fell.</p>
               <p>Q. From the top of the stairs, supposing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160181"></xptr>a man to be breaking in at your door, could you have shot at him? - I don't think they could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manley. Could they have been shot from the landing place? - No, not as they lay; Idswell could not have been shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Could Day have been shot in that place? - No, no such thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. If I understand you, the stair case you talk of goes from a passage up a few steps, and then winds about to go up to the other pair of stairs room? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the greater number of stairs are between this landing place and this one pair of stairs? - Yes, only three or four below it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body by discharging a blunderbuss near the door of the bed room, or any part of these stairs that go to the bed room, from the winding place, they could not have shot Idswell? - They could not, unless they had gone down two or three stairs, have shot him where he lay. There are two or three winding stairs where they might have stood on; there are three or four strait stairs and a winding stair or two.</p>
               <p>Q. And they must have gone down all them before they could have directed the gun strait to the door? - They certainly must.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stairs are there? - Three or four. They must have gone down all the winding stairs except two or three, before they could have shot him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stairs are there altogether? - Fifteen or sixteen altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you had the curiosity to examine whether there were any tracks of blood on any of the stairs? - Yes, there was quite up to the end of the passage of the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the quantity of blood pretty equal? - The greatest part was in the passage itself.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got clear of the passage, did the rest appear to be the tracks of people dragling up and down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Day. Where was you, what part of the house, when the blunderbuss was fired? - I was within three or four stairs of the bottom.</p>

               <p>Q. If I understand you right, after the blunderbuss was fired, they knocked you lower down still? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you was found afterward, you was lower than when the blunderbuss was fired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You was alarmed at this night? - I was; I was passing on that night at the house, No. 13. Artiilery-street, there were three watchmen at the door, and Mrs. Cummings in her house, in her room on the ground floor, with the window open. I went in at the window; she was intreating for God's sake for some body to come in, for there was murder crying in the house; so then I addressed myself to the watchmen, and told them, I insisted on their going in to give assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in fact, go in at the window? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went in at the window, in what part of the house did you find yourself? - I found myself in the room on the right hand of the passage, on the ground floor.</p>

               <p>Q. It was the parlour window you got in at? - It was. Mrs. Cummings at that time had a light.</p>
               <p>Q. What took your observations immediately after you got in? - At the passage door the noise of murder proceeded, from, I see the deceased laying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the situation in which he lay, according to the street door; how near to the street door was his situation? - I suppose it might be near two yard;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160182"></xptr>he was then sitting, apparently in great agony, at this time alive.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from the stairs? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Day? - I see Day at this time standing with his hands to his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was Day standing? - Nearer the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see then any of the prisoners at the bar? - There was nobody in the passage then. The door was forced open just at this instant. I then, when I see there was assistance, I directed my thoughts in search of the persons. I went up stairs with two watchmen; and in the first pair of stairs, in the room opposite, where two men sitting; I can swear but to one of them, (Hardwicke.)</p>
               <p>Q. He was sitting in the front room? - Yes, he was. I then gave charge of them immediately; while the watchmen were conveying them, two men came down stairs; the patrol came up with more assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. I will simply ask you, whether you saw any other of the prisoners, that you recollect, in the house at that time? - There were four more coming down stairs, two men and two women.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to point out who those two men were? - Him of the name of Phillips.</p>
               <p>Q. He was one of the two men with the two women? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you looked at the other? have you learned what the name of the other was that was coming down with Phillips? - I have seen him; that, I was told, was the other, but I cannot swear to him. When I found there was so much assistance, I desisted from exerting myself so much. After these people were secured, I went down stairs with the patrol; and in the privy there was a man, whole name was Solomons, a tall young man.</p>

               <p>Q. That was before you went to the New Prison? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the body? - We got the key of the engine-house, and I helped to get the body out of the coach, and laid it in the engine-house.</p>

               <p>Q. To Ray. Describe to the gentlemen of the jury what use is made of that punch and file? - Such a kind of thing as that is used to take the bolt out of the basil, to take the iron off, it drives out the rivet that goes into the ring on the small part of the leg.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manley. There must be something else besides this to get the ring off the leg? - Yes, a hammer.</p>
               <p>Q. And I dare say that may be used as well to any thing else as a basil? - It is such a thing as that that is used for that purpose. I have got an apron and stocking that I took off one of the prisoners,

               <p>Q. Were you called upon to attend the body of Idswell after this accident, or to open the body? - I was called upon near about four o'clock on Saturday morning. He was dead then. There was the mark of some Instrument either bails or others entering the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he die of a gun-shot wound? - Yes, he did; I have got the bullets, there were eleven slugs.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was he wounded? - At the bottom of the back on the side near the hip.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is all the evidence that we shall think of troubling the court with.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardwicke. In regard to the evidence which Mr. Day has given, I assure you, it is totally false; I was in the front room, I was not in the back room at that time. I did not so much as lay a hand on him, or on his coat. As to the evidence of Bowley in what he has said, I never heard him say any thing about the sick aunt. I was only employed as a porter to move the goods on the 25th; there was another porter along with me, there are two people in court, and I should with to call upon them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Haydon. With respect to what is said against me, I am quite innocent of the matter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Henley I am quite innocent of the matter; I had no part in it; I had nothing at all to do with it; I was at work the same day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Delany. I am quite innocent of the matter. I never see the two men in the world till I see them after I was taken. I never was in the house at all I was drove into the watch-house; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160186"></xptr>up to the watch-house while they were taking some of the men in, and I spoke to one of them, and they drove me in and all with them. I leave it to the officers to say, whether they took me in the house, or about the house, any of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Handland. I am quite innocent of the affair intirely. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jacobs. I am the brother-in-law of the deceased; and the time he came into prison he sent me word, that as he was obliged now to leave all his effects to strangers, for me to come there often, to look about his effects, and that was the reason that I was there so often. As for my going down into the passage, the reason was, as Day tells you, after the light was there, hearing my brother was shot. He was then alive, and he told me Day has killed me; these are his dying words. He listed up his hand again, and pointed with his hand to Day, and said, this man has killed me. I have no more to say, I leave my cause to God and you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Solomons. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, some little time after the two Idswells were apprehended up at Bow-street concerning the stamps, Mr. Phillips, who is an intimate acquaintance of mine, came to me a little time after. He then told me, the solicitor of the Stamp office has sent for me, and he said, if I could put him in possession of the dies belonging to these stamps, he should have two hundred pounds. He then came to my house again, it was a few days after, and we went to Mrs. Idswell's house, in No. 13, Artillery-street. I see her at home, one morning it was; I told her, Mrs. Idswell, Mr. Phillips has been up to the solicitor of the Stamp office, and if you can put him in possession of the dies, it may be the means of liberating Mr. Idswell. She then told me, I should call again in a few days, and she would let me know more about it; which, accordingly, I called there on Wednesday morning, which, I think, was the 2d or 1st day of April, I will not be certain. I called there, and she told me to call again on Thursday. I called there on Thursday morning, with Mr. Phillips, and I told her, Mrs. Idswell, will you put me in possession of the dies? She says, I cannot do that, but, I believe, I can tell you where the die-maker lives, he lives in Islington-road, on the left hand side, near the turnpike. I have been with my husband once, and she said he never would take her into the house; he let her stand near the door. Accordingly, she told me then, if you call to-morrow evening, I believe it will be in my power to put you in possession of the dies; I cannot give them you now, but I can tell you where you may get them. I then went away with Mr. Phillips; and Friday night, about a little after ten, about a quarter past, I was sitting at home; I just put two of my children to bed; Mr. Phillips comes in, and said, now we will go to Mrs. Idswell, you know she appointed to meet us to-night, to put us in possession of these dies. We went to the house, No. 13, Artillery-street. We rung the bell, the servant came down; he asked if Mrs. Idswell was at home? Says she, she is not at home, but I expect her home very soon. From thence Mr. Phillips says to me, I dare say we may find her at her uncle's, in Fashion-street, at Mr. John Jones's. Accordingly I and Phillips went, past eleven o'clock, to Mr.

            's wife opened the door. We then inquired if Mrs. Idswell was there? She says, no, she is not here, but we expect her here very shortly. Accordingly, I and Phillips went in doors; we sat down till nigh on half past eleven o'clock. Then I says to Phillips, Mrs. Idswell don't come here, we will go along home. Returning down Fashion-street back again, which is my way home, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160187"></xptr>Mr. Phillips went off home, then says Mr. Phillips, we will go in and see if Mrs. Idswell is at home now. We rang the bell, and the servant opened the door. Says we, is Mrs. Idswell at home? No, she said, she is not within, but she will not be many minutes, if you will walk up. Accordingly I and Phillips went into the dining-room. I see in the room the mother of the servant; says I, do you expect Mrs. Idswell home? Yes, says she, I dare say it will not be many minutes first; accordingly we sat on the chair. I sat down by the fire; the clock was very near twelve. I said to Mr. Phillips, Mrs. Idswell does not come, we will return home. He says, we will stop till the clock strikes twelve, and we will call again in the morning. Accordingly I says to Mr. Phillips, I will go down into the yard, I am very ill, and if she is not come when I come up, we will go home. I had not been in the yard scarce five minutes, when I heard a bell ring at the door, which I then thought Mrs. Idswell was come home. A very little time after that, I was going to get off the seat of the privy, and I heard the alarm of murder called, I could not tell where it came from; and I just got out into the yard when I heard the report of a gun go off, which I thought was in the house. I ran back into the privy again; I see the neighbours out of the windows from all parts of the yard, and they said, there has been a murder committed; there are some thieves. I thought there were thieves in the house, and I sat in the privy, and buttoned the door up till such times as I was apprehended by the two men. The two men pulled at the door, and I thought they would have pulled it open if I had not unbuttoned it; one of them held a naked cutlass across my breast, and I said, I will go along with you, don't use me ill. I have got a wife and four children, and I am as innocent as a child. I did not know such a thing was going on, or I would not have been in the house for five thousand pounds. I am innocent at this time, in this case, as an infant that never was born or its mother, and that I can prove by Mr. Phillips, for he will tell you the same. I never knew any of the family till Mr. Phillips brought me into the house.</p>
               <p>Court. I think there is not enough to go to the jury on the part of Tilley.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Phillips. My lord and gentlemen, when the two Idswells were taken into custody, the officers of Bow-street came after me; on which, when I came home, I heard that they had been after me; my wife was at home. I said, I knew nothing of the business, but I will go up to-morrow to Bow-street. On which I called at Mr. Solomons's, to know what was the matter, and what they wanted with me? which Mr. Solomons went up to Bow-street, and he went to know what was against me? They said, they cannot tell him; if I would come voluntarily to Mr. Lee, and if I will tell what I know of the business, I shall not be kept in custody. On which I went to Mr. Lee, from Mr. Solomons; and they told me, if I came up to-morrow to Bow-street, before the justice, and tell what I knew of the business, I should go back again without being taken into custody; which I did, and I was examined before Mr. Flood and Mr. Escot, the solicitor of the Stamp office; which I told him I knew nothing of the business. They told me, if I would make it my business to go among the family, to find out the business among the family, they would make it worth my while. On which I did go among the family, to find out what I could. I called on Mr. Escot, I went to him in his chambers, and I told him, if he will give me leave to go among their family, I thought it was in my power to bring something to light. On which Mr. Townsend went with me in a coach, to Old Bedlam, No. 9, where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160188"></xptr>Mrs Idswell was. Mr. Townsend says, if Mr. Phillips comes here as often as he likes, let him speak with Mrs. Idswell; and I went from there to her sister's, Mrs. Oswald, in Oxford-road. I could not find any thing there. Says I, if you will give me leave to go to the other Mrs. Idswell, perhaps I can find something. Accordingly I went to her, and asked her about the dies, to see what I could do for the Stamp office I called several times; I went there on Thursday morning. Says she, if you call in the evening, perhaps I can let you know something farther of the business. I did not see her. I went there on Friday morning; she was not at home. I called in the afternoon, and they told me that she was gone to her uncle's, in Fashian-street. I went there, and she called me out, and says, Phillips, if you will call to-night, I believe I can put you in possession of the dies. I called on Mr. Solomons to go along with me. We went about ten o'clock to the house, No. 13, Artillery-lane. She was not at home. From thence we went to Fashion-street, her uncle's house, and we staid there till very nigh twelve o'clock, and they told me they expected her that night. Says I, I think it is so late I want to get home. On which we came away, went to Artillery-street, and rang the bell, and asked the servant, if Mrs. Idswell was at home? She said, she expected her home every minute. - When I went up stairs, there was Mr. Bowley there, and several in the place. I was not in the house long before there came a ring at the door. Solomons says to me, he must go down to the yard. He went down to the yard, and Bowley went down and opened the door, and I went up stairs immediately; and I declare to Almighty God, as I stand here a sinner, that I knew nothing if Idswell's coming out, nor I never see any thing of the transaction. nothing at all, declare to God Almighty. I went up stairs; for I asked where the mistress was? There is Mr. Escot, he cannot deny that I called on him several times; he is in court now, he knows I have called, if he has a mind to speak.</p>

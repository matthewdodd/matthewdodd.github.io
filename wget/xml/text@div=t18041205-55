             sworn. - Q. You are a surgeon? - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar came as a servant to my house about a quarter past seven in the evening; I went out a little after, and visited a child that was sick; I returned in about three quarters of an hour, my wife told me the girl was gone, and had robbed the house; about ten o'clock she returned from the baker's with a loaf; I asked her the reason she stopped so long, and I told her I supposed she had forgot her pattens; no, says she, I have returned with the loaf, and the change of the half guinea; I asked her if she had brought the linen she had taken out of the kitchen; she said, she had not, nor did not take it, nor did she see any; I asked her the reason of her being gone so long, and also where she had taken her own box, as she had taken her own box with her; she told me she smelt something disagreeable on the top of the stairs, and she always conceived that she heard me in the back kitchen cutting up dead people, that was the reason of her going away; I told her it she did not tell me where the linen was, I should certainly send her to the watch-house; she said, she did not take it, I might do as I pleased; I then called the watchman, and took her to the watch-house immediately; the constable of the night took her into a little apartment, and searched her; he found none of my property on her, but found ten duplicates at another place; she gave the watchman the key of her box, and told him where she lived, and she had left her box at her lodgings, No. 30, Monmouth-street; there the watchman searched her box, and found none of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the things? - A. Something about two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Roberts.) What do you value the linen at? - A. Above two pounds.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. At half past seven in the evening I went to this place, I took with me a small box; there was a smell in the place, I thought it was the smell of human flesh, and they were chopping something up; I took up my band-box, and was going to leave the place; Mrs. Roberts rung the bell, she told me to go and get a quartern loaf and some cheese; I went home to my lodgings with my band-box, and I went back to my mistress with the loaf and the change; I could not get the cheese, it was too late; Mr. Roberts abused me when I came back, he said I had taken his linen; I told him I had not, I had never untied my bandbox at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

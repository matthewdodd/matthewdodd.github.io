            . I am a watchman. On the 18th of June, at five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the Three Compasses, public-house, Drury-lane. He came in with a girl of the town. In consequence of information, I took him, and asked if he had a watch, which was not his own - he said he had none. I found one in his breeches pocket. He then said he would make me suffer for taking him, for he would bring a person who said that he came honestly by it. I asked where the chain and seal were - he said</p>
               <p>"Here it is." I put my hand to his breeches pocket, and he struck me.</p>

            . I am a porter at Covent Garden-market. About three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner scuffling with two others, under the Piazza, fighting (I do not know who they were), and in a few minutes after I saw him with the watch in his hand, with neither ribbon or chain to it; he ran from the two he was scuffling with. I afterwards saw him in a public-house, and told Horrigan.</p>

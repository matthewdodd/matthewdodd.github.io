                  </hi>. I am employed in the shop of Mr. Peter Broad, in Tavistock-street, Covent Garden—he is an oil and colourman—he has a shop in King-street, Seven Dials. On Tuesday, the 3rd of January, I saw the prisoner there at half-past eight o'clock—he ordered a quarter of a cwt. of yellow soap, and 14lbs. of pearlash—he said he would call again by and by—he called at a quarter-past eleven o'clock, and I was sent with him,—he said he would return with me with the money and pay the shopman—he did not say where the goods were to be sent to, but they were for a person in Holborn—at the prisoner's desire I carried them—I believe there was a bill made out and given to the prisoner—16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to be brought back—I went with him as far as Gray's-inn-lane, and he went down some court into a little low public house—he wished me to go in, I refused—I told him I should go back with the goods—he told me to stop there while he went to the top of the court—he joined me again at the top of the court, and went into Holborn till he came to the corner of Red Lion Street—he told me he had sold the goods there, and took the basket from me—he went in and told me to wait outside—he came out in about five minutes and brought back the pearl ash and basket, and told me they were too busy now to pay at<lb></lb>tention to him, they wanted more things—I asked him if he had got the money, he said, "Yes"—he went back to the shop with me, and told the shopman he had not got the money and they wanted more things—it was bees' wax, I think, and a quarter of a cwt. of pumice stone—I saw him the next day in Middle-row and asked him where the soap was, he said, he was going to call at eleven o'clock to pay—I took him back to the shop and fetched my master, and he was given into custody.</p>

               <p>—I went to some public and private houses, they would not have it; I came again into Holborn, and went to a gentleman named Clarkson, and left it to see if it might suit him—I came out—I was very unwell, and saw a man, he said, "If you will give me a few halfpence I will carry it."I had been with this lad the day before—here is the invoice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in High Holborn, at the cor<lb></lb>ner of Red Lion-street. I know the prisoner as a customer—I recollect his being in my shop on Tuesday, the 3rd of January, about one o'clock—I think he had quarter of a cwt. of yellow soap—he said nothing—I was busy—he handed me a paper, and asked the loan of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay a porter—I gave him the money to get rid of him, and put the paper into the till—I never bought nor ordered any thing of him—he went out, and left the soap on the counter—he came back in about an hour, and wanted the soap—I said, "Are you going to leave me the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—he said, "I have left the soap on the counter"—he had left two bars on the counter—I said, "This won't do, I must have the money; but he went out, leaving the soap; (but before he wanted me to buy it;) he took all the soap except two bars—he said he should call in about an hour, and went out directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I brought it to his shop expecting to sell it him—he was very busy—I wrote a little bit of a note to him, and requested the loan of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never got paid, and he left these pieces of soap behind, which I suppose was about a quarter of what he had with him—I heard no more of him till he was in custody.</p>

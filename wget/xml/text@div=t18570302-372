                  </hi>. I am a porter, of No. 150, Bishopsgate—street. I was passing through Bishopsgate—street on the evening of 16th Feb., about half past 6 o'clock—I know the prosecutor's—the prisoner and another man were lurking about—one was looking in at the door of the lobby, and the prisoner was looking in at the window of the shop, apparently watching the shop—I walked on a little way, crossed, and came back opposite the shop; by that time the two men had gone away, and walked to the corner of Great St. Helens—in a few seconds one of them came and laid his hand on the collar of the coat, and took the label off—the coat was hanging for sale—he walked away again, and in a few seconds another came, and walked back, and took the coat off the block that it was on, and ran to Clarke—place with it—the other man followed—I ran round into Camomile—street, and saw the man come out of the other end of Clarke—place with the coat, and in a few seconds the prisoner put on the coat, and they went on together—when they got to St. Mary Axe they made a short stop—they then went on, and then made another stop—I walked past them, and stood in a doorway—they walked past me, and stopped by Brown's—buildings—the one who had the coat stood still, and the other went away—I walked over the road, collared the prisoner, and told him he had stolen the coat—he said, "What do you mean by stopping me? I am a respectable man"—in about four minutes a constable came, and I gave him into custody—the other man had escaped—I am sure the prisoner was one of the two persons I saw watching the shop.</p>

I am a reader in the service of Frederick Straker, of 35, Camomile Street, Bishopsgate Street, who is the printer of the Eastern Argus, a weekly newspaper published at Bethnal Green—on 31st January the defendant was the publisher and editor of that paper—on 30th January a MS. article was handed to me of which this is a copy in the Argus of 31st January.</p>

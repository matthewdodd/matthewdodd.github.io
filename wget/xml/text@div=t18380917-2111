                  </hi>. I live in Little Knight Ryder-street, Doctors' Com<lb></lb>mons, and am clerk to Mr. John Nixon, a lead merchant. On the 9th of September, 1837, the prisoner came to the premises and presented this order—he said he had come from Mr. Le Cren for those goods—I looked at the order and told him it was not Mr. Le Cren's writing—he said, "It is the writing of the young man in the shop"—I said the young man had not</p>

               <p>signed his name to it—lie said he supposed he had forgotten to sign it, as the men were waiting in the shop for the goods, and they were in a hurry—I said he had better sign his own name to it then, and he signed it "Tho<lb></lb>mas Clarke," in my presence—I then delivered him the goods—he had been to me before from Mr. Le Cren for goods—(<hi rend="italic">order read</hi>)—"1/2 cwt of solder, two lengths of 3/4 pipe, 3 bib cocks, for Mr. Le Cren, No. 73, Cole<lb></lb>man-street.—<hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS CLARKE</hi>."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in Moorgate street. I was in the habit of dealing with Nixon for lead—the prisoner was in my service eight or nine months, as a plumber—I had the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing him write—I discharged him, I think, in January or February, 1837—I cannot recognize this "Thomas Clarke" at the bottom of this order as his writing, but I am certain the body of the order is in his hand-writing—I never authorized him to go and get these goods.</p>

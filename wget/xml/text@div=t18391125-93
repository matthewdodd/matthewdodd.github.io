                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in Gray's Inn-road—the prisoner had been some time my porter. I found a pound and three quarters of horse-hair in the stable on the 1st of November—it ought not to have been there—I marked it and left it—the prisoner had access to that stable, and as he was going that evening, I called him back, and asked him if he had any thing upon him—he said "No"—I said I thought he had, and he had better go with me to the station-house, and on the way he asked me what I thought he had got—I said, "Horse-hair"—he said, "If I confess, will you forgive me"—I said, "No"—I took him to the station-house, and found this on him.</p>

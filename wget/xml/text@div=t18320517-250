            . I am overseer of St. Mary, Aldermanbury. I commenced giving the prisoner parochial relief on the 6th of April, 1831, and continued to do so till the 28th of March, when I went out of office - I paid her 3s. a week at first, and increased it on the 30th of November to 4s.; I have paid her altogether 10l. 8s., believing her to be chargeable on our parish - she presented herself as a pauper of that parish at the vestry, weekly - her name was in the book which was handed to me by my predecessor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROWE. Q. How are the entries made in that book? A.Weekly - the casual poor are entered in a different account; she made no representation to me, except coming with the other paupers, and taking the weekly allowance.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was she entered as a weekly pauper before you came into office? A. Yes, and I find, in 1830, an instrument was bought for her to go to work with.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BROWN. I am one of the parish officers of St. Mary, the Virgin, Aldermanbury - I came into office on the 4th of April. The prisoner applied to me that day for her weekly allowance; I paid her 6s.; Mr. Watson had given me the list, and had reduced her allowance to 3s. a week, which she refused to take, saying she had a great deal of illness in her family, and I gave her 6s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know nothing of her settlement? A. No.</p>

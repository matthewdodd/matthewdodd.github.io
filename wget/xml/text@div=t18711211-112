                  </hi>. I live at 6, Webb Street, Walworth, and am an iron bedstead-maker—on 8th November I went to Boobier's, about 1 or 2 o'clock—he was in bed, with rheumatics—I went to see him again on the 9th (Lord Mayor's Day), about the same time—he was then in bed—I called again in the evening, between 9 and 9.30, and he was in bed still—I remember it, because it was Lord Mayor's Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He keeps a pony and cart—I borrowed them, and took them out on the 8th, and On the 9th, too, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the day, and took them back between 9.30 or 10 o'clock—I was on the hawk, with my work—I sell iron bedsteads—I had the cart the day before, about the same time—there was no one there when I had the cart those two days, and no one went with me—Webb Street is about a mile from Wynd<lb></lb>ham Road—I am sure I am right about the date.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, at 21, Holliugton Street, Cam<lb></lb>berwell—on 8th November, about 7 o'clock in the evening, I called on Mr. Boobier, and found him in bed, suffering from rheumatics—I went to buy some pigeons—he told me to call again the next day, and I did so, about 7 or 7.30 in the evening—he was still in bed—I know it was the 9th, because it was Lord Mayor's Day—I remember better about the 8th, because it was my lodge, night, and I was going to pay my subscriptions, and the next day was Lord Mayor's Day, when I called again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I live about a quarter of a mile from the prisoner—I keep pigeons, and so does he—I went to buy some—I did not know he was in custody till I received a subpoena, which I have in my pocket now—I am a bootmaker, and work amongst omnibus men—I have never been in trouble myself, I am positive about that.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think I received the subpeena to come here last Thurs<lb></lb>day—I only knew the prisoner by being introduced by Winter, being told that he had some pigeons that would suit me, and I called to see him about them.</p>

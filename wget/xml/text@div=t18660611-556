I am a labourer, of Rumanworth, Northamptonshire—on the night of 1st June, I was going over Waterloo Bridge; I don't know the exact time—after I got over the bridge I saw Rowe, and asked him where King's Cross Station was—he said, "I will show you the way, if you will come along with me; come into a beer-shop, and have a drop of beer"—I went into a beer-shop with him—I had a pot of beer, and paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—whilst in the public-house the other two prisoners came in and joined Rowe—Rowe gave them some of the beer—Rowe left first, Hurley next, Whitey was behind me—just as I got in the street, Hurley caught me by the throat and dragged me back—I tried to call out—he said, "Don't let him halloa"—Rowe struck me on the mouth, and put his hand over my mouth—then both put their hands in my pockets—I couldn't see Whitey at the time—I saw the other two—I had a purse, with 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I lost all that—I had a knife and a handkerchief—I have not seen the knife again, but here is the purse and handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am quite sure these are the three men.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Rowe</hi>. You told the Magistrate you met me by some steps. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I came over some steps at Blackfriars Bridge, and walked along the street some little way—I saw some steps near there—I never asked you where there was a lodging—I asked for King's Cross Station—it is not true that I paid 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a lodging, and went back with you to get the money, because I wanted to go away with some woman—I was not with any woman.</p>

About a quarter-past 11, on the night of 1st June, I was on duty in Shoe-lane—I heard a whistle in Raven-Hood-court—I went up and met the prisoners with two other men and a female coming down the court towards Shoe-lane, laughing together—Rowe was behind the others, about nine or ten yards, and just as be came up to me, he dropped this handkerchief, which I picked up—five or six yards higher up, I found the prosecutor on the ground, bleeding from the mouth—about a quarter of an hour after this I went back to the court, and found the purse on the ground—I afterwards went to the Blue Anchor public-house, Farringdon-street, and picked the prisoners out from among others.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 136) From information I received from License, I went with the prosecutor to look after the prisoners—about a quarter to 1, on the Saturday morning, we went into the Blue Anchor public-house, in Farringdon-street, and he pointed directly to Hurley and Rowe—he was not quite so positive about Whitey—they were drinking with Rowe's brother—from what I could see of it, he was paying for the beer—this was some time after the robbery—Whitey was there drinking with them—I detained them while I sent for a constable, who identified the three at once—I then told them they would be charged with assaulting and robbing the prosecutor—Rowe said, "I am innocent; I know nothing about it"—</p>

               <p>the other two made no answer—I took them to the station, and searched them—I found on Rowe an old knife, but no money.</p>

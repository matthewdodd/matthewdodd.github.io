BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see his mother last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left her down stairs—I had no conversation with her on the subject of her son—she does not talk to any body about him since his committal—I have seen her every day—all she says is, "I hope my son will get off, and get clear, because I think him innocent"—I was not in bed on Easter Monday—I had got up on the Saturday before, and was in my front room, which is my laundry—I have a clock in my room—I have made a statement of the time to the pri<lb></lb>soner's sister, and to his brother-in-law William Cockburn, the witness—I stated it to him, because he put the question to me—I cannot say exactly when I made the statement to him—it might have been the day after I was subpoenaed, but I have not borne it in memory—it is since Wednesday last, the day I was subpoenaed—I cannot tell whether it was Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday—there was no clock in the place where I had the conversation with him—if I must come to recollection it must have been after we met here at the Old Bailey—I came directly from my house up to the Old Bailey.</p>

               <p>not speaking to any one till I arrived at the Court—it might have been about half-past nine in the morning, when I had the conversation with Cockburn here in the Old Bailey—he did not ask me any question—I had very little conversation or none with him—I made a statement respecting the time to his sister and to him—we were all of a party—I was at the police-court, but was not sworn—I was in the court at the time Bridget Thomas was sworn, and beard her give her evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I was passing by St. Pancras church on Easter Monday—I did not go into the church—I knew Bridget Thomas before that—I saw her go into the church with a man who was not the prisoner—I do not know the man, but on my oath it was not the prisoner.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did they find you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Last evening I was going down the road, and I saw the prisoner's mother—I asked her whether he was come home—I had not a great deal of conversation with her—I told her that I saw Bridget Thomas going into the church on Easter Monday—the prisoner's mother is a neighbour of ours—I heard last Thursday that the prisoner was charged with bigamy in marrying Bridget Thomas—I did not go and tell his mother then, for I did not know but what she knew it—I am not to get anything for coming here—I have had no conversation with anybody about being paid—I go out washing and cleaning—I should not have been at work to day—I met the prisoner's mother last evening at the corner of Oxford-street—she was alone—she addres<lb></lb>sed me—I did not go anywhere with her—we stood talking about ten minutes—I saw her this morning at her own door when I came out of my street door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister and am the wife of the witness who has been examined—I saw Bridget Thomas with the marriage certificate in her hand in Feb. last—she told me she was married to my brother, and I made her answer that she was not—I and my mother have two beds in one room, and one bed in another—on the 28th of March, to my great surprise I saw Bridget Thomas in bed with my brother and another man—I should know Shehan if I were to see him, but I believe he has been transported—he went by the name of Shirtbutton, I believe—he denied his own name—I knew Bridget Thomas was acquainted with Shehan—I have seen them at dances together, and carousing about—I have not seen the prisoner since April—I did not see Bridget Thomas on Easter Monday with any body—I got up at eight o'clock in the morning, and never left my home till past twelve—I left to go to Stepney fair—neither she nor any other person entered my house that morning.</p>

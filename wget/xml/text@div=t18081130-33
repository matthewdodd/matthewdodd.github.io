            . I am a carpenter. On the 25th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into my master's yard and asked me to go and drink with him, which I refused; he came again, the second time, and asked me the same question; I told him, no; then I saw no more of him till about three or four in the afternoon. I heard a rustling in the pit; I got up from my business where I was, I saw him going down the yard with a deal upon his back; I followed him and asked him what he was going to do with it; he said he was going to have it cut; I asked him where he was going to have it cut; he said he did not know, a person ordered him to take it away, he was going to have four cuts in it; I said, very well, you know what you are going to do. It was a fourteen feet three inch plank. At the bottom of the yard are two iron gates; when he came there, I said, I think you have carried this deal far enough, you may as well rest it here; he said, Samuel, will you go and have a glass of gin; I said I do not care, let us have something to drink; he went out of the gate and I at the back of him; he wanted to go over to the Falstaffe liquor shop; I said I did not like to go there, I did not like the people nor the stuff they sold, if he would go to the Pigeon public house, I would go with him; I got him in the Pigeon public house, I followed after, and set my back against the door when I got him in; when he found my back against the door he thought himself taken, he rather tustled with me to get out; I told him it was of no use to try to get out, I was upon my guard, he should not go; he tried the second time; I collared him and shoved him against the chain; we had two or three ups and downs. There were five or six people in the tap room, they did not assist me. I kept my hold till Tipper, the officer, came and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Ponder's sawyer, the top one, asked me to help to take the deals home with him; I said I did not care; he said they lay along side of the pit; I went and brought one out and laid it in the street; he told me to go and take the others out; I went into the yard; Mr. Ponder's and Mr. Beazeley's men were there; I took out the plank; this man followed me; when I found myself in an error I was surprised, I did not know what I did; I might ask him to have some gin.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ponder. Had this man any right in your yard - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body any right to take any deals out of your yard - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a joiner by trade, and live at 78, Rich<lb></lb>mood Road—I am 25 years of age, and am married—in June or July last year there was a strike in the building trade in London—at that time I was in the employ of Messrs. Alden, builders, at West Brompton—I had been three years and a half in their employ—the hands there were locked out, union men as well as non-union—I was locked out amongst the rest—I was out of work a month or two—I then went and obtained employment at Jackson and Shaw's, in Page Street, Westminster—I remained there a month and more—at the end of that time, in consequence of something that had taken place, I left—I remained out of employ a week or so—I then went into the employ of Messrs. Weeks, the horticultural builders, in King's Road, Chelsea—their men had had nothing to do with the strike—I remained there about six months—in March, this year, I made up my mind to go back to Jackson and Shaw's—on the 20th I went and made inquiries, and on the 21st I went to work there at 7 o'clock in the morning—Mr. Young is the foreman, I was taken by him into the back shop, and set to work at a bench—there are two men at each bench; I believe a man named Nix was my partner at the bench, but I could not say—there were twenty or thirty other men at work in the shop—I set to work at my bench at oak work—Tamblyn and Pyle were two of the men at work there, at the same bench—there were also two men named Moulton and Camp; they were not at the same bench—I continued working till 8 o'clock, breakfast time—nothing particular had happened to me up to that time—I returned from breakfast at 8.30—as I came back into the shop I observed the men looking at me, and saying "That is the man"—I did not make any observation upon that, I went to my bench and began to work again—after I had been a little while at work they began "Baa! Baa!" all over the shop—I asked the man who was working with me some question—I did not know what it meant at the time, I know now; it means what is called "a black sheep"—after this "baa-ing," some lumps of wood were thrown at me, ever so many struck me and hurt me—some were as large as my fist, and some smaller—after that Moulton came up to my bench and took a mallet off it; he also</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="1873060900024"></xptr>
               <p>took my bat, which was lying underneath the bench, and passed it away—I saw it in the hands of both Tamblyn and Pyle, and then I never saw it I again—Tamblyn and Pyle were the busiest of all the lot, they had more to say than any, "baa-ing" and throwing the lumps of wood—some papers were passed about with me <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> upon them, a sort of likeness of me—Tamblyn wrote two of them; this is a part of one—(<hi rend="italic">This was a rough sketch of a man</hi>, I <hi rend="italic">underneath which was written "I want my money, please, Mr. Jackson, they have made me a black</hi>")—I asked Tamblyn for my hat and things, and he said he would knock my b----head off if I did not get out of his bench's way—I said I wanted my hat and umbrella—he said he knew nothing about it—I said I saw him with it—before that he was "baa-ing" and swearing at me—he said he would make me go; if I did not go out of the shop and leave my work, he would make it too hot for me—Tamblyn, with others, said so—Pyle was going to fight me; he said I was no b----man if I did not go—he came to the side of the bench where I was when I was asking for my things; he said he would make me go, he would knock my head off, and was no man if I did not go—this kept on till I went away at 4.30; most of it took place after dinner—sawdust was also thrown at me, tied up in pieces of apron and paper, and old hats; they tried to blind me—I missed some tools, but they were brought back again; they said I should lose my tools if I did not go—I could not say which of them said that—we all find our own took—a man named Camp was working at the next bench to me—about 3 o'clock he asked me to go down to the mill and help him fetch up some work—I went down stairs with him—he took me into a water closet; he went straight in and asked me to follow him—I did not know where I was going to—it is a place about 10 or 12 feet long, and there is a passage running up to it—in the closet there is a long trench and two bars or rails, one as a seat and one for the back—when I got in there were fourteen or fifteen men there—I could not say that Tamblyn or Pyle were there—Walker was there and Moulton, and others came in afterwards, I should say fourteen or fifteen more—some stood behind the door, whilst the others threw me about against the wall, backwards and forwards—they tried to throw me in this place, but they were too think on the rail, I could not be thrown in there—Walker then got hold of my legs and held them up whilst I lay on the floor, and others were kneeling on me and knocking me about—whilst Walker was holding my legs up he struck me many times behind, at the bottom of my back—I could not say whether with his fist or open hand—the others were kneeling on me, knocking me down and trying to squeeze me to death—a man named Mack was there; I can't speak to Tamblyn and Pyle—Moulton and Camp were in the room at the time—I don't know whether they were doing this—it went on for nearly half an hour, at the end of that time some one said "The b----has had enough of it"—I don't know who was there then; they tried to kill me—I was insensible at the time—I was then let go—I was suffering pain—my coat was torn to pieces—I had not got it on at the time, I had left it in the shop; I had got a cap on, that was broken all to pieces; my hat and umbrella were gone—my shirt was torn and my braces broken—I felt pain all over—I can't say how long I remained in the closet—I ultimately went back to my work in the shop—the greatest part of the men were then back in the shop; they began again "baa-ing "and throwing the wood; they thought I would not go—both Tamblyn and Pyle called out to me, "baa-ing" again, saying they would make me go, and would make it too hot for me—I did not make them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="1873060900025"></xptr>
               <p>any answer—when I went down with Camp I left my coat hanging np at the head of my bench, and when I came back it was still hanging there, but the collar had been cut off, and it was torn almost to pieces—I have I never seen my hat or umbrella since—about an hour and a half after I came up from the closet, Mr. Young came into the shop, and I made a communication to him, and showed him my coat—in consequence of what he said, I went to Tamblyn and asked him for my hat—he said he would knock my b----head off if I did not get out of his way; he knew nothing about it—shortly after that I took my things and went away—I left the service before the day was over.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. The master builders are prosecuting this case—I believe it is an association of masters—they took it up a fortnight after—I believe they read the papers—I suppose they applied to me; some gentleman did; I don't know him; I had never seen him before; I have seen him once since; I don't know his name—I have seen him once or twice; I know the man by sight—previous to that I had laid an information on the Saturday, the next day after this happened—I did not say anything against Tamblyn or Pyle; I knew I should do so; I said there were ever so many that I could pick out; I did not mention any names, I did not know them; I said there were eight or nine that I could pick out—Tamblyn and Pyle were about the worst in the room; I noticed them at the time as being the worst in the shop—I could not say that they were or were not in the water-closet; I have not sworn that they were not, that I knew of—I won't swear that I have not—I did not knew Walker's name when I laid my information; I pointed him out at the works when I went there with Davis, the constable on the beat; I went first with him and afterwards with a warrant officer, on two different days—I was told by the Magistrate to pick out three or four of the worst—I first wanted the ones that were in the closet—I did not, in my information, say that the reason I did not lay information against Tamblyn and Pyle was because they were not among the worst; I will swear I did not—it was not until the person from the Masters' Association came to me that I applied for a warrant against Tamblyn and Pyle—I wanted to see how I got on with the others first—I had not made any complaint then of what had taken place up stairs in particular, no more than my clothes; I did that—it was not the gentle<lb></lb>man from the Society that put me up to making the complaint about throwing the pieces of wood—I swear that I made a complaint to Mr. Young; I don't know whether he is here, I have not seen him—I saw Tamblyn once at the Police Court, on the examination of Walker—I said there was a man in Court that I wanted; I did not know his name; I was told I was to get his name; I afterwards got a warrant and went to the works with the officer—I did not see Tamblyn'and Pyle seated at their bench; I saw one of them, I could not say which of them—I don't recollect whether I saw them when I went with the warrant officer; I went twice with him—I said there were two there; I did not exactly point them out at the bench, but as I went through the shop I said "There are two here"—I did not speak loud; I did not let them know it; we then wanted Moulton, Camp and Knapp—I knew that the officer at that time had a warrant to apprehend two persons, names unknown, and that I was taken there for the purpose of pointing them out—I don't know that Tamblyn and Pyle were those two—I will swear they were not—Moulton and Knapp were the two; Knapp is a labourer—he was not in the shop—I believe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="1873060900026"></xptr>
               <p>Moulton was; I had not got the warrant then for Tambyln and Pyle, and I wanted the others first—I intended to charge them about my clothes; I was not going to lose them for nothing—I asked the officer to take the names of Moulton, Camp and Walker; that was when we went through the shop the first time; that was before I had got a warrant—the Magis<lb></lb>trate sent me—I did not ask him to take the names of Tamblyn and Pyle, because I could not swear that they were down in the closet—I had no idea at that time of making any charge except for what took place there—the pieces of wood they were throwing struck me in ever so many places, about the head and shoulders; I was seen by a doctor, the next day—I was hit in the mouth; I did not point that out to the doctor—I was all colours; I could not say that I pointed out anything that had been done by the pieces of wood—I saw Tamblyn write this paper, I was looking at him all the time; I swear that; it was passed from bench to bench to mine—I can't say who produced it; it was produced before the Magistrate; I don't know who produced it, I did not—I can't remember who I gave it to—the Magistrate saw it—the first time I was at Jackson and Shaw's I was dis<lb></lb>charged—every night as I went home there were Society men outside, offer<lb></lb>ing me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to leave my work and not stop there—I said I would let them know—the very night I was discharged I had my tools in my basket ready to leave when I went away, and the foreman came and said "I don't want you any more"—on my first examination I said "I was asked to come out by the Society, and I came out after I had been working about a month or five weeks"—I also said on cross-examination "I was discharged from Messrs. Jackson and Shaw's in September; I don't know that that was because I was a useless workman; the foreman gave me no reason for dis<lb></lb>charging me"—I thought I was discharged through the Society—I do not know a person named Lambell (<hi rend="italic">he was called in</hi>)—I do not known that man; I might have seen him; I never talked to him as I know of—the day Tamblyn and Pyle were arrested I passed by some church near Belgrave Square, and a man came out and asked me how I got on; it may have been that man—I don't know that I said "All right; they have got two more to-day"—I did not call him "Bill;" I never knew the man—I don't know whether he asked me who the men were; I forget all about it; I think he did ask me—I don't know whether I had the names then or not—I wont swear I did not mention Tamblyn and Pyle—I don't recollect his saying "What have you got them for?" he may have said so—I don't recollect saying "I do not know, but they want them;" I might have said so—he may have said "Who are <hi rend="italic">they?</hi>"—I did not reply "The lawyers and them"—I will swear I did not; I did not mention the lawyers or the masters, or any one—I did not say "<hi rend="italic">They</hi> want them;" I will swear that; nothing of the kind—they were wanted for my clothes and for insulting me in the shop—he did not say "This job will cost you something; if you like I will take a hat round for you;" nothing of the kind—nor did I say I did not want it, as they were paying the expenses—he did not offer me a job, or say he would get me one—I never heard him say so; he was not speaking half a minute to me.</p>

               <p>did not know his name at the time—Walker held me up by both legs—I laid at the Police Court that he held me up—I meant by the legs—I asked Elm to let me go, ever so many times—he held my legs up all the time I eras down, I should say 20 minutes—I was underneath the whole lot of them—Davis was the constable to whom I pointed out Walker—I believe I mentioned to Davis about my legs being held up—I might not have said for 20 minutes—I spoke to Mr. Young and showed him my coat, and what took place in the shop—my chief cause of complaint was not what took place in the water-closet, it was in the shop as well, at the time—those in the closet were the worst in one way, but I spoke of the whole—that was the chief cause of my complaint—that was the first charge I made—I don't think I told Mr. Young that Walker, or anybody, had held me by the legs for 20 minutes—Moulton was in the closet—he was at work after that and Camp too—I have not seen him since he left—I swear that Moulton and Camp went into the closet, but I don't know that I saw them afterwards—I did not mention Moulton's name at the Police Court on 22nd April—I said Walker and Knapp were the only two could swear to—I was kicked in ever so many places, not very hard, I was knelt upon mostly, I was kicked in the mouth; I had a bad lip—that was not the only time—I was kicked and hit both—I did not tell the doctor or Mr. Young that I was kicked—I said I was knocked about, I did not say struck—I believe I have said before to-day that Walker struck me on the bottom of the back, I cannot say where; I know I have said so, and I will swear that he did—they left me insensible—I forget whether I have said that before to-day—I was not right, I had not all my senses as I ought to have had—they were kneeling on me, shoving me backwards and forwards against the wall, and scratching me, I was hit and smacked and knocked about, and crushed against the wall, and they were trying to stifle me whilst I was on the floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I first made an application to the Police Court it was for an assult, for what took place in the water-closet—I did not say any<lb></lb>thing about my clothes then—the officer went with me that I might point out the men that were concerned in what took place in the closet, and I pointed out Walker, Moulton, and Camp—I did not tee Knapp, they found out his name—they first of all took Walker, and I gave evidence against him—I never saw Knapp or Moulton after that—I believe I saw one of the others afterwards—I have not seen Camp since he left the shop, not since he was wanted—I had no attorney at first—the case was reported in the newspapers, and after that someone came to me on behalf of the masters, and Messrs. Wontner were instructed—I then gave Mr. Wontner a full state<lb></lb>ment of what had ocoured to me, in the shop as well as in the closet, and he did what he thought proper—when I said that Tamblyn and Pyle were the worst, I meant the worst in the shop—I was not discharged from Jackson and Shaw's in September as a useless workman—a man named Charteris was the foreman who discharged me, I had seen him in communication with the Society's men outside lots of times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. I never knew anything about what had occurred in the water-closet till the following Monday; he never mentioned it to me; one of my employers was the first that told me about it—when I went down the shop he brought his coat in his hand and said, "Mr. Young, look what they have done to me; they have taken my hat away altogether"—I did not understand it; it was not my business to look after the man's coat, I had to look after his work—I said "If you can tell me any one that has interfered with you, or done anything to you, I will discharge them; that is the extent of my power"—he said that he should summons them—I remember his coming round with the officer—he did not point out Tamblyn and Pyle; I could not swear that they were at their bench, but they were working there in the shop; I am quite sure he never pointed them out—I heard him swear at the Police Court that he had done so—he never pointed them out to me at any time—I did not observe any mark of injury to his lip or face, or any blood—he called my attention to nothing but his coat and hat—we were not four minutes talking together.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. I believe Walker was working at Jackson and Shaw's at the time of the strike last year; I can't swear that he was working there while the other men were on strike, because he was in the yard on the other side; it was before he worked on my side—he might have been at work there during the strike time—I don't know whether it was before the strike—I should say he has been in the employment of the firm two, three, or four years—I can't answer whether he was out of em<lb></lb>ployment</p>

               <p>by reason of the strike—all the men in my yard were out on strike, with the exception of a labourer or two; I believe he was at work on the other side at that time; I don't know it—Mr. Charteris is the foreman of the other yard; he would know; he is here—Walker is only a labourer—he had nothing to do with the Union, that I am aware of; he is not a joiner, a handy labourer we call him—if a man makes himself handy, we put him to a machine; he was working an endless saw; he does not get a joiner's wages—he would get about a penny an hour more than a labourer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am a Non-society man, not a member of the Union—I should say Walker was not a member of the Union, I cannot tell; there are societies for labourers as well as mechanics, of course I don't know whether he belongs to that—I do not know one way or the other whether he is or is not a member of any society—my conversation with Coffin was over nearly in a moment you may say—I believe I have told you all the words that passed; it lasted a very short time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M.R.C.S., 141, Finborough Road, West Brompton—Coffin came to see me on Saturday evening, 22nd March; I had previously attended his wife in her confinement; she had been very ill; he was apparently very ill—he seemed to be suffering a great deal, in a very excited state, particularly nervous, and quite hysterical; he appeared to labour in his breathing, and to have great pain in taking a deep inspira<lb></lb>tion—my attention being called to the nature of the accident, I examined his chest and his body generally—I found marks, particularly about the buttocks, as if the hand had been applied very freely—there were marks on his chest, on the back, and about the shoulders—very slight marks—there was no abrasion of the surface, very slight discolouration—it gave him great pain to take a deep inspiration—he could not bear me to touch his chest, it seemed to inflict a great deal of pain upon him—I apprehended that in<lb></lb>flammatory action might supervene, and I treated him accordingly—he went on very well, and is now convalescent, much sooner than I anticipated—I consider that the appearances upon his body were the result of rough handling.</p>

I examined him thoroughly—there was no abrasion on any part of his body—I looked at him gene<lb></lb>rally, but it was late in the evening, and I was very ill myself—I was sent for to him, but was unable to go, and he had to come to me, and my examination was rather a hurried one—I did not notice anything the matter with his mouth; he did not complain of it; no allusion was made to it—he was in a very excited state, crying, and hysterical—I did not see that his lip was cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at King's College Hospital. On the evening of the 17th of June the prosecutrix was brought there—I examined her throat—it had been stitched up, but I found it necessary to re-dress it—there was an incised wound in the right side of the throat, about four or five inches long, dividing the external jugular vein on the same side—it was about three quarters of an inch long, and an inch deep—it was a very dangerous wound indeed—I did not expect her to live at one time—an ordinary knife might have caused the wound—from its position, it is not at all likely she could have inflicted it herself—it must have been inflicted by another party, I think—it was not quite horizontal, it was diagonal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have not a thousand people cut their throats in that dire<lb></lb>ction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not on that side—the person who made the wound must have done it with his right hand, but if the same individual did it he must have done it with his left hand—I watched the woman's hands at the hospital, and will swear she is not a left-handed woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you. mean she did not use her left hand at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not say that—I did not make such particular observa<lb></lb>tion as to see if she could use her left hand as well as her right—some people can do so; but I made particular inquiries about it—I cannot say from my own observation whether she is right or left-handed—I say another person must have done it, from the direction and position of the wound—I have seen cases of suicide; and all, without exception, have been either on the left side or in front, never on the right—I did not inquire whether those people were left-handed.</p>

               <p>doubted whether the right hand could have inflicted it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when a wound is inflicted by another hand I can tell whether the person uses his right band, by the position and direction of the wound—it would depend on the position of the persons; but it is my opinion that the man must have stood behind the woman, and drew his hand across the throat—it could not have been made by a marl standing in front of her—I particularly examined where the first incision was made—there is what we call a tail, in professional lan<lb></lb>guage—a wound is made in the skin before it gets to the deep parts, and that was particularly evident, showing that the incision must have begun, and got deeper as it went on—the tail of a wound is at both ends—we cannot tell at which end it began.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Nicholls, of No. 5, Feathers-court. On the 17th of June, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and his wife return home, and go into the house—in about five minutes afterwards I heard Mrs. Hannan halloo out, "Oh, oh!"—I was on the step of the door—I went to her door, and saw her just at the top of the stairs, close to the street door, bleeding from the neck—she had a white apron on—I said to her, "Peggy, what is the matter?"—she said, "The villain,"or "My husband, has stabbed me"—I cannot say whether it was one or the other—I called to Mrs. Paine, who lives in the house, for some water, and the policeman took Mrs. Hannan to Dr. Walker's—I did not go away—after she was gone, I saw the prisoner standing outside his own door—I did not see him come out—he must have come up the kitchen stairs without my noticing him, or he might have come from up stairs—he did not inhabit any part of the up-stairs, only the kitchen—they were both very tipsy—I saw Mrs. Collins there—she said to the prisoner, "you foolish man, go away"—his answer was, "No, I won't, I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I don't disown it"—he was taken in charge very soon after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 70, Mark Lane, City—on Wednes<lb></lb>day evening, 25th February, a little after 7 o'clock, I was in my shop, I had just cleared the window; the prisoner came in, he had his coat but<lb></lb>toned up just as he has now—he said "What would you make me a coat like this for?"—I unbuttoned the coat, and looked to see what it was lined with, and said "I will make you a coat like this for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said "What is the price of that in the window?"—I said "If you go outside and look you can see"—he then laid hold of my watch chain and pulled at it—I laid hold of him as well as I could with my left hand—he pushed me and crushed me against the door, and another fellow came and knocked me down in the street; it was a mercy I was not run over—I got up and ran after the prisoner as hard as I could, crying "Stop thief!"—one of my waistcoat hands was outside and she ran as well, and cried "Stop thief!"—I ran over to Tower Hill and saw the prisoner in the hands of the police—I feel the effects of the blow now that he gave me—the other man also struck me and sent me right out into the street—I could not swear to that man; I can to the prisoner—my watch was found on the door-mat.</p>

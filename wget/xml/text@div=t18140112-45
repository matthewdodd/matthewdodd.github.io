               <p>Q. Should you know them again - A. I do, all of them, perfectly well. I never saw them in the house before to the best of my knowledge. I have not been long in the house, only since the 10th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came in how long did they stay - A. They staid, I think, until half past four o'clock. I could not get them out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they while they were there - A. I cannot exactly tell; my daughter-in-law served them, and her mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing to eat - A. Donaldson had some supper: he returned thanks for his accommodation. I was the only person that was left up in the house with them. My daughter-in-law went to bed; they persuaded her to go to bed, and called her their dear, and wished her to go to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they at last attempt to go - A. I told them I insisted upon their going, and not having any more liquor.

             said he would stay, and the other two said they would not hurt me, but they insulted me very much, and when they were going away they all three huddled me together. I had the door half open. They were all upon me at once. I thought they would have lamed me. I desired them not to kill me. Petherick wrested himself out of the house first. I clapped my hand to my watch; I felt the watch was gone. My watch was taken, I am sure, when the three huddled me together. They were all on me at one time, but which of the three took it I cannot tell. I had shewn my watch to Mill-bank; he said he would open it, and did; he said it wanted cleaning. I pursued them into Broad-street.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to the watch by the inside, and likewise by the seals. I can speak to the watch by the paper inside; the paper was cut by a foreigner that lived with Lord Sligo, and here are two gold seals I can swear to. I do not know the number of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had that watch - A. About eighteen months; the seals I have not had so long. I have only had the seals since my son's return from Malta with Lord Sligo; the small seal not so long. I am certain they are my seals. I pursued them into Broad-street, all three together. I seized Mill-bank and Donaldson by the collar myself; Petherick walked off. I took them in custody myself; they said I might search them, they had not got the watch. I called the watch; they sprang the rattle, and two of them were taken to the watchhouse. The watch was not found upon either of them two.</p>

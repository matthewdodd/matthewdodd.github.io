                  </hi>. I am a traveller, of 4, Green Street, Whitechapel—the house belongs to John Bird—on 29th April, about 2.30 a.m., I was in bed in the front parlour—that is my bedroom and sitting-room—I was awoke by the striking of a match, but the shutters were shut as they were when I went to bed—I looked up and saw the prisoner—I said "Who's there?"—he said "It is me; I have been robbed and you have got to die"—he tried to catch hold of me—I jumped out of bed—it was dark, but I could hear by the glasses moving that he was seated on the sideboard, and knowing the part of the, room he was in I went to the door, which was locked—I went out and closed it as well as I could—I wanted to lock him in, but could not get the key out—Mr. Bird came and I then heard the prisoner open the window and jump out—the window was fastened when I went to bed, but not the shutter—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man, because he struck a cigar light, and in trying to blow it out he held it up to his face.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 225). I was on duty in Whitechapel about 2.30 a.m. and saw the prisoner in Green Street, about 100 yards from Bird's house—I afterwards stood in the shade under a wall opposite the house, concealed from view, believing that the prisoner was still there—I saw the shutters come open and the prisoner jumped out—I ran him about 100 yards and he stopped of himself, turned round, and said, "There runs the boy, master, you are wanting"—I said "No, you are the one I want," and took him in custody—he said "I have not done anything nor yet got anything"—I did not lose sight of him from the time he got out at the window—I was close behind him all the way and have no doubt he is the man who got out—he was sober.</p>

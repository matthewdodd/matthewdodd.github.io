                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">inspector of police</hi>.) I was at Woolwich dock-yard on the 28th of Nov.—I observed a part of the dock-yard insecure—the fence is generally brick, but the part I saw was wood, and had a part broken away at the top—I examined it minutely, and from what I saw I gave directions to the policeman, Fisher, who was on duty in the evening, to watch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 272.) On Thursday, the 28th of Nov., I was at Woolwich dock-yard—I went there by the inspector's orders, and saw the prisoner—I was examining and watching what he did—I saw him come from the boiler-shed, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—he came towards the fence—the top of it slopes over, and part of it is broken—he stooped down, picked up something inside, and threw it over—he went away—I went to the spot, and found a piece of metal—I do not know whether it was copper, or brass, or mixed metal—it weighed 36lbs.—I then went into the road and requested my sergeant to send me another man from the dock-yard—he sent another, and we sat down on the ground till a quarter to seven o'clock, when the prisoner came and took the metal away—he placed it under his coat under his arm, and I came out from my place and seized him—he had a great coat on and a white apron—we had heard something else come over while we were in the dark—we got a light and found it was half a pig of iron—the prisoner came as if he came on purpose for this metal, as there is no thoroughfare there—there was another man with the prisoner, and the prisoner told him to wait—he said, "I am going down here a minute"—as soon as the other man found we came out from our place to seize the prisoner, he ran off, and we could not succeed in taking him—the prisoner dropped the metal as we took hold of him, and exclaimed, "I am innocent"—we had not at that time charged him with anything—he knew me, and called me by my name—I tookhim into custody—we took him to the dock-yard—this is the piece of metal—it has no mark on it—he threw it over the fence—I</p>

               <p>cannot say I saw him throw it, but I saw him come to the placed stoop down, and then something came over which sounded very heavy—I cannot say there was any jink in it—I did not see anything large and heavy like this that was thrown on the ground till afterwards—I went to the spot within half a minute, and there found this metal.</p>

            . About the 6th of December, 1742, I bought about 12 tons of hemp of him - to the best of my knowledge it might be to the value of about 330 l. - there was an attachment in the Mayor's Court, about the 10th or 11th of Dec.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body offer themselves to be bail?</p>

             was recommended to me by Mr. Satchel, about the 11th of Dec. - I don't know that I ever saw Moravia's face before that time in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he willing and ready to be bail?</p>
               <p>Bedell. He was very willing; at the instigation of Mr. Satchel, Mr. Moravia went to be bail - about the 17th or 18th of Dec. and was rejected.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you get any other bail?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Moravia apply to you to buy this parcel of hemp?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I think it was the afternoon before Christmas-day, he said he would give me 200 l. for the hemp, and laid down a moidore, but we did not make any agreement then; we met again the 3 d of January at Peele's Coffee-house in Fleet-street, I did not go to meet Mr. Moravia, I went to meet Mr. Robinson, but Mr. Moravia and I finished the agreement then.</p>

               <p>Bedell. I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell the hemp for?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I sold it to the best of my knowledge for a note of 105 l. - payable in 8 days, and a note for 100 lb. weight of India rhubarb, to be delivered upon demand - the major part of the hemp lay at Warner's warehouses in Mincing-lane, they are kept by one Clark, the rest lay at the White-horse in Purpool-lane; that part I sold him lay at Warner's warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. What bill of parcels did you produce at that time?</p>
               <p>Bedell. To the best of my knowledge I delivered a bill of parcels given me by Mr. Owen with his receipt at the bottom of it, we had been drinking of rack punch pretty plentifully, that I cannot very well tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver Mr. Moravia any bill of parcels?</p>
               <p>Bedell. Yes, I delivered a bill of parcels of Mr. Owen's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for you to make a bill of parcels then?</p>
               <p>Bedell. It was not possible for me to make a bill of parcels then, because I could not tell the weight of the hemp. - We went away about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go then?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I went directly home to Grays-Inn-Lane. - I staid there the whole night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Houndsditch that night?</p>
               <p>Bedell. To the best of my knowledge I have not been in Hounsditch these three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Moravia that night after you parted at Peele's Coffee-house?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I saw him no more that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw him again?</p>
               <p>Bedell. The note was made payable in 8 Days, I saw him before the 8 days were out in order to remind him of it, as I wanted money. - I never had a farthing of him, for he said he could not well pay me till he got the hemp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever borrow any notes of him?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I never borrowed one note of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you arrested?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I was arrested the 18th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was you carried to the Fleet?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I believe it was about the 22d.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first time Mr. Moravia came to you?</p>
               <p>Bedell. The 22d was on a Saturday, and then I went to the Fleet, and he came to me the Sunday following - I think it was the 22d of January, I cannot be positive to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you notice of the commission being taken out?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I think the commission was sealed the 24th, and I had notice of it the 27th.</p>

               <p>Bedell. I believe it was on Friday the 28th, he might come after my goods, and the notes and every thing I had was seized on.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the two notes then, the note of 105 l. and the note to deliver the 100 lb. weight of rhubarb?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I think they were at my lodging in Gray's-Inn-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of Moravia's waiting on you then?</p>
               <p>Bedell. He said he understood there was a commission out against me, and that all my effects were seized; he said, be of good heart, and I will take your part, for I believe the commission will not stand, and if you will take my advice, I will allow you 2 guineas a week, and put a 1000 guineas in your pocket - he said, he thought it was not a good commission.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did he say he would put in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I cannot tell justly, it was a large sum, I am sure it was 500 l. and he laid down a great deal of gold upon the table; Mr. Ravenscroft, Mr. Robinson's clerk came, and we went into Mr. Helbutt's room, and he took some instructions for an answer in Chancery, but very short; he went away, and came again about four o'clock; Moravia said, he had a summons left him to attend the Commissioners at the Crown-Tavern on Ludgate-Hill, but he could not tell what they wanted with him; there was one Mrs. Burrell a relation of Mr. Helbutt's there, and he desired her to go out of the room; and he wanted me to enter into an agreement with him, and desired me to write down (I think it was) January 3, 1742.

               <p>Q. What did he say when he desired you to do this? Did he give you any reason for it?</p>
               <p>Bedell. He said as he was to serve me he expected me to serve him.</p>

               <p>Bedell. I cannot tell what he meant by it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to do that?</p>
               <p>Bedell. I was like a bird in a cage, and wanted to get my liberty - he would not suffer any body to be by then, he said he was going to the Commissioners; on Sunday morning he came again and said, he had been 7 or 8 hours before the Commissioners, that they had harassed him very much, and that he was obliged to sign the deposition.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what the contents of that deposition were?</p>
               <p>Bedell. He said, if I did not keep up to the contents of that deposition, he and his family would be ruined; and if I did it would be a great deal in my way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what that deposition was?</p>

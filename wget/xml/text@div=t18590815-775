                  </hi>. I am a carpet warehouseman at 11, Basinghall-street—I first became acquainted with the prisoner in January last—he was brought to me by a customer of mine—he referred me to Messrs. Skiff, Brothers, of Great Alie-street, which reference was highly satisfactory—I knew At that time that he was carrying on business in St. Swithin's-lane—I did not know from him how long he had been there—he first purchased goods to the amount of 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said when he bought these goods, that he had become buyer for some houses in Holland for Fortuyn, Keiser, and Hartolf; upon which goods he was to receive a commission of 5 per cent., for purchasing on their account—the goods were sold at 21/2 per cent. in a month from that time, up to the beginning of April—I should say the amount was nearly 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I supplied him with goods in April; on the 4th, 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 7th, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 8th, 164<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 11th, 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 13th, 224<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on 16th, 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 19th, 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 21st, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 25th, 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 27th, 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 29th, 786<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these were for donnetts and serges—I can separate them; the donnetts are 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

               <p>and the serges, are the difference, namely, 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on May 10th there were some table covers, which came to 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were 144 table covers; they were sold in one lot—the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were what we call Victoria covers, a different kind altogether—on 11th May there are carpets and table covers, 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; June 8th, carpets and donnetts, 167<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I don't know whether the whole amount of these goods is 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I could tell if I added them up—that 21/2 discount was altered—after he was doing a good trade he wanted to have a little more time, and I promised then to give him an account up to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a running account—that was six weeks afterwards; by that time he had paid me about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no further alteration of credit—I did eventually give him credit—he asked me if I could, and the feeling was so straightforward and satisfactory, that I had no hesitation at all in trusting him—when he got the donnetts and serges on 29th April, he said that they were for Holland; nothing else—I was not aware that they had not been shipped to Holland until after I received information from Grundy's, of Manchester, in the middle of May—Messrs. Grundy were the manufacturers of whom I had bought the goods—in consequence of the information I went to the prisoner immediately, and told him I had heard that the goods had been offered to Messrs. Grundy for 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that being 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. below what they had been invoiced to me at—that was the donnetts only—he seemed very much surprised, and turned to his day-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and showed me this entry, (<hi rend="italic">R ad:</hi> "R. Berhens, goods bought, 30th April; donnetts, 368 pieces, 754<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.")—the date in the prisoner's book is 9th May—he said he could not account at all for how the goods could have been sold in Manchester—he said he had sold them to Mr. Berhens, a friend of his from Holland—I asked him if that was the party for whom the goods were originally intended—he said, "No; the goods were originally intended for Hartolf"—I then asked him the reason Hartolf had not received the goods—he said Hartolf already owed him a considerable amount of money, and he did not wish to send any more goods to him until the account was reduced; and this friend coming over from Holland, he sold him the goods and got cost price for them—I asked him how the goods had been taken away—he said he had taken them to a packer's when they were brought by Berhens—I think he said the packer lived in Newgate-street—I don't think anything was said about a cart—they could not go without a cart—I knew nothing about Mr. Berhens, and had no further means of ascertaining—I asked the prisoner where Berhens lived—he said he did not know—I said it was a very extraordinary thing; I should like to have such a customer, to know where to go back to him again—nothing else passed—when I sold the 144 table covers to him, he said they were to send to Mr. Fortuyn, of Holland—there was another parcel supplied after the table cloths on 19th June—I had no suspicion at that time—he told me he had received the money—the first time I had any suspicion about the prisoner was when I got the information from Manchester—I attended the meeting of his creditors on 22d June—a person named Eames was present—I believe he is a watchmaker—he was very vehement indeed against the bankrupt—he said in the bankrupt's presence and hearing that ho had sold him goods, and asked what had become of them, and Goldsmith stated that he had pawned them with Attenborough, in the Strand, and that he had after<lb></lb>wards given him (Mr. Eames) the pawn-ticket—when the prisoner ordered the carpets and donnetts on the 18th June, he made no representation specially about the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general merchant, in Gutter-lane—I know the prisoner; he came to my house in February last, and stated that he was a purchaser of goods for various parties on the Continent, in Holland, and many of them his own relations; that he got 5 per cent, for acting as agent, and gave references as to his respectability; he referred to Skiff, Brothers, to and H. Isaacs, and to Mr. Peter Brown—he had no one with him at this time—he said he never purchased goods for himself, only as agent for others—to certain inquiries he gave the name of one party in Holland, A. J. Fortuyn—he gave me an order for some samples, and I was to inquire of the reference—I executed that order on 24th February; the first order came to 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the goods were principally black lustres and black awnings, as far as I can remember—I saw the prisoner again after that, on 10th March, I think; he then ordered 700 pieces of black lustres, and a large quantity of donnetts of different sorts; the order for the lustres came to about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—we refused to execute the order for donnetts, we thought the order too large to trust to one man—I don't think any more goods were ordered till 1st May—I have not an account here; the goods ordered then were about 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. value, in black lustres; the prisoner said that they were for a party in Holland; this delivery was on 5th May; we had no further order after that—the orders were delivered, on an average, about a week or a fortnight after the goods were ordered; altogether we have been paid about 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 447<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is now due.</p>

               <p>into these accounts—saw the prisoner, and entered into an examination of his books—I got such an explanation from him as I thought necessary—I saw that he first began to trade as a shipping-merchant in December, 1858, in St. Swithin's-lane, and in the Pavement as well, where he has a retail cigar shop, which he has carried on since February, 1858—having examined his books, he was, in January, 1859, insolvent to the amount of about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and in March he was about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. behind—at the end, his deficiency, according to his own account, was 4,519<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that has since been checked by me, and I find it right—the whole amount of purchases which appeared by the books from January to June is 10,285<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the purchases for the three months preceding the bankruptcy, taken from 1st April, were 6,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he mentioned Mr. Hartolf as a debtor for 954<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I inquired who he was, and he said he was a merchant living at Amsterdam—I asked how he came to include him as a doubtful debtor—he said that he had sold him a large quantity of goods, and that was the balance of the account; and he heard from friends that he had left Amsterdam, and therefore he considered it was doubtful—he recognised Mr. Fortuyn, of Zutfen, as a good debtor of 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said that be thought the debt would be paid—he said that Mr. Reyser, who was down for 832<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was a bad debtor; that he knew him some time in Amsterdam, and he used to call on him, but had returned him as a bad debtor, as he did not know where he was, as he had ran away from Amsterdam, and he did not know his present whereabouts—I find entries in the books of goods sold to Behrens amounting to 754<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 19th May here is one sum due, 176<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—at the meeting of his creditors on 30th June he said he knew Mr. Behrens in Holland, and that Mr. Behrens called on him in Finsbury Pavement, and wished to know whether he had any goods to sell, and lodged with him sums of money; on 2d May 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 3rd May 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on 4th May 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 6th May 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and on 9th May 216<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the 9th May being the day he sold him that large parcel of goods—those sums come to 754<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I inquired further about Behrens—he said that he did not know his address, and could not tell where he could find him, but that he was in the habit of calling on him almost daily at his office, but did not know where the direction was—I have seen this entry about Behrens—cloaks and mantles, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and clocks, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., appear by the balance-sheet to be all the stock given up off the premises in the last three months; the difference is made up by debts, and by a stock of cigars which had not been referred to in the furniture; the stock was valued at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is his valuation, contained in the account laid before the creditors—the accountant does not value; he puts down what the debtor gives—his private expenditure for the last 18 months before his bankruptcy is down in the book as 1,401<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the three months before his bankruptcy—in this book, under date of 19th May, here is what purports to be a sale to Simons and a payment by Simons to the amount of 590<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in the cash-book I find, "19th May. Simons, 590<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6th June.

I live at Elgin, and am a solicitor—I was stopping at Morley's hotel, and on 7th September, I was near the National Gallery, at about half-past 10—I was walking leisurely, and was suddenly struck a severe blow on the back of the head, and again on the back—I turned round and saw the prisoner come round and take my watch from my button-hole while two others held me—I saw the watch in his hand—he immediately bolted—I freed myself from the others, and ran after him, calling out "Police!"—I gained on him considerably, and he turned round and asked what I wanted of him—I seized him by the breast, and said that I wanted the watch of which he had just robbed me—he swore that he had not seen me before—I detained him, and gave him in custody—I have not seen my watch and chain since—they were worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

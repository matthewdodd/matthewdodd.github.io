The prisoner came to me on Thursday the 9th of July, he slept with me three or four nights there. On Sunday after he had eat his dinner he took hold of the table cloth and wiped his knife he said that knife should either end his life or mine; after that he laid himself on the bed, and I came out. I did not return till eleven o'clock on the Monday morning, and then he had a pint of beer before him; he asked me if I would shake hands with him; I did; he asked me if I would drink with him, I told him I would, he said I should not have beer, he would go to Mr. Murphy, and get some cherry brandy; he went out and returned, and said he could not get a bottle; he turned back into the passage and sharpened his case knife; he returned, into the room and said he would have my life, Hannah-Black was in the room. She went to take the knife out of his hand; he cut her knuckles with it; she went out to call assistance; he laid hold of me with his left hand by my head he had the knife in his right hand, he went to put the knife across my throat; I put up my arm, it cut my arm in two places; as soon as I could run away I did; there is the mark of one of the cuts; the other you cannot see.</p>

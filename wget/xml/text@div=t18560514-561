                  </hi>. I am Mr. Munday's cousin, and assist him in his busi<lb></lb>ness; he is a butcher, at Woolwich. On Saturday night, 5th April, the pri<lb></lb>soner was in Mr. Munday's service—he and I were in the shop, and Mr. Mun<lb></lb>day was outside—the scales are about two feet six inches from the till, and the prisoner was between them—there had not been any customers for a few minutes, but about 11 o'clock, Mr. Munday told the prisoner to weigh a piece of fat—I went to get it from a quarter of beef which hung up, and heard a jingle of silver in the till; I turned round, gave the prisoner the fat, he took it from me with his right hand, and I saw him drawing his left hand from the till, with silver in it; his fore finger was not clenched, as he had a bandage on the tip of it—I believe his hand came out of the till—I did not see him literally take it out—on Saturday evenings we take the till and put it near the scale quite open—I whistled, made a signal to Mr. Munday, and pointed to the prisoner's hand—whistling is a general custom of ours, but it had not been agreed upon—Mr. Munday came in, and as he came in the prisoner took out his handkerchief, wiped his nose, or pretended to do so, and as he returned his handkerchief to his pocket, I heard the jingle of silver—he had put the fat on the scale—Mr. Munday said, "George, what have you put in your pocket?"—he said, "Nothing"—he drew his handkerchief out, and there was 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the prisoner took a slight glance at the money, and then Mr. Munday asked him how much he had, and he said, "About 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—and then, I believe, he put it into his side pocket, from which he had taken it—the pocket was loose; it was a round frock—there was no occasion to go to the till; there was a customer in the shop, but no money was exchanged.</p>

               <p>from the till, which was on his left hand, and the scale on his right—he had his face to me; I saw him attempt it once before the same evening, which caused my suspicion—I had had no previous arrangement with Mr. Munday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher of Eyre-street, Woolwich—the prisoner was in my employ—on the evening of 5th April, there was but little meat, and there was not the slightest obstacle to my seeing to the scale where the prisoner was weighing a piece of meat for a woman—Stride was inside the shop—I saw him hand a piece of fat to the prisoner—he then whistled and pointed to the prisoner's left hand and I saw some money in it—he pre<lb></lb>tended to wipe his nose and dropped the money into his pocket—I then heard the chinking of silver—he put his hand back and I said, "George, what have you put in your pocket?"—he said, "Nothing, you may search me"—I went in, and he took out four half crowns and four shillings and twopence before I asked him how much he had—I said, "How came you by that?"—he said, "It is what I have saved out of my wages"—I said, "How can that be, when you only have a crown a-week?"—he said, "I have saved it"—I boarded and lodged him—he said, "I went over to Mr. Fry's, had a quartern of gin, changed half a crown and he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out"—the silver I saw in his hand appeared to be two shillings and a half crown by the gaslight—there are three compartments in the till; there was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the silver side—I went for a policeman and gave him in charge—he had been in my service seven or eight weeks.</p>

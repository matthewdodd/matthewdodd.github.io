                  </hi>. I am a surveyor and auctioneer, and live at Stratford-green. Harwood was in my employ six or seven weeks ago as stable-boy—I missed a pair of gig-lamps on the day that be absconded, six weeks ago last Wednesday—on my returning home, he had gone away and taken the key of the gate with him—he did not come back—when he bad left I took Hide into my service, the same day—I missed a pair of lamps in the evening—Hide remained in my service a month and three days—the policeman brought Harwood to my place on a Sunday a fortnight ago.</p>

The Prisoner was employed in my master's house, on the 3rd of November, in taking down the furniture of a bed. Before the prisoner came, I took down the watch, which was hanging up in the room, and put it into a drawer, in the same room. The prisoner came to work at about ten o'clock in the morning, and went away at twelve; at times during that period, he was by himself; I was going backwards and forwards; but did not remain in the room the whole time he staid. At about four o'clock, I was sent up stairs by my mistress for the watch; I looked in the drawer, and the watch was gone. We did not miss the other things until the Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What other things were there in this room, or else where, that were missing on the Saturday, and which you had seen before-A. I had only seen them on the Sunday previous; there was a chain and an eye glass, that belonged to my mistress; there were two mourning rings, and a hair ring, and the other things. It was not I that missed them on the Saturday, but I was in the room when Hutt, the officer, looked in the wardrobe, and then they were missing. I have seen the things since, and know nothing more.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce two mourning rings, a hair ring, three brooches, and an eye glass and chain; also the duplicate for the watch. I apprehended the prisoner at the workshop, on Saturday,the 4th of November; I told him what I apprehended him for, on suspicion of stealing a gold watch, the property of Mr. Raynsford; he denied any knowledge of it. I asked him where he lodged? he said, in Colwille-court, and took me to his lodgings. I searched them; but without any success. He still persisted in knowing nothing of the matter. I took him and his wife to our office, on suspicion. He was committed for a re-examination, and in consequence of information which I received while he was locked up, I went with his wife to No. 2, Monmouth-court, Seven Dials; his father-in-law lodged there, and I got the property there. The prisoner did not express to me his wish in words for me to go, but I saw a letter of his; that letter is his. I had gone to Mr. Raynsford's house, and examined with the servant the bureau or wardrobe, and on her opening this little box, it was empty, and she said the things were gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That witness has said it was No. 2, Monmouth court; it was 8, Lumber-court.</p>

            . After the prisoner was apprehended, and examined, the first time he was locked up again in the place at the office, I heard some person cry "hoy," to me from that place, and it was the prisoner; I went to him; he said, he wanted to speak to me; he asked me if Mr. Raynsford was gone from the office; I told him he was not. He said, he wished to speak to him; he had something very particular to say to him. I told him I would tell the magistrate; I went, and did so. The magestrate then ordered him into the office. He then said to Mr. Raynsford, that he was very sorry for what had happened, but would confess the whole; he said that the watch was in pawn, over Westminster bridge. He asked, might he be allowed pen, ink, and paper; he was informed he might if he wished. He said, that the watch was in pawn, over Westminster bridge, and the rest of the things his wife knew of. (Witness producing a letter.) I saw him write this; I know it to be the same; here are my initials at the corner.</p>
               <p>(The letter was here read, and was as follows.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness to give him a geod character.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, in summing up the evidence for the consideration of the Jury, informed them, that in order to substantiate the capital part of this charge, a stealing to the amount of forty shillings in a dwelling house at one time must be established;-here, one article, the watch, was considerably above that amount, and if they were fully satisfied in all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060004"></xptr>the other particulars, it would be their duty, however painful, capitally to convict the prisoner; but, if on the other hand, they had any doubt, it ought to be thrown into the scale in his favour.</p>

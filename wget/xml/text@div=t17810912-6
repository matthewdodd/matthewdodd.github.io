            . On Friday, the 20th of July, at about eight in the evening, when I was going to shut up the warehouse, I saw a man take up two pieces of harrateen out of the passage that leads to the dwelling-house; they were put there to be given to the dyer. The street door was open. When I saw him take them up, and go out at the door with them, (my fellow-servant was behind me) I said, Do you see that? he answered, Yes, let us follow him. I followed him, and never lost sight of him till I took him, which was in about thirty or forty yards from the door. He had it under his arm; when I laid hold of him, he dropped it; at first he said he never saw them: my fellow-servant coming up, assisted me in taking him and bringing him back, and got a constable to take him into custody.</p>

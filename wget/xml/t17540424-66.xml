            . On the fourth of March I was sent for by one of the men that work for Mr. Whittle, who told me their maid servant had been robbed. I went, there was the prosecutrix, the prisoner at the bar, and more that were strangers to me; they accused the prisoner, who said the little boy took it; the boy being called up, he came crying and said he had no hand in it at all. They then had the prisoner down in the kitchen, where he confessed to me that the boy was innocent, and that he took the money out of the box himself. We found the two guineas where he said they were put. On my asking him where the other guinea was, he said he had changed it, but would sell his coat and make it up; I told him to return the remainder. We went into the room where he lodged; he put his hand into the bed and pulled out a box, in which were eighteen shillings, and a pair of buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the buttons?</p>
               <p>Carnagy. They are, and the same money.</p>

               <p>They frightened me to what I said. I did not own one thing of it, but said I knew nothing about it, and what I said was in a fright.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. What character has the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Ashley. I knew nothing of dishonesty by him before this. He lived at our house about eight months; we have lost several things about the house, but never suspected him.</p>

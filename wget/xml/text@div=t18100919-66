On the 13th of August, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was in the King's Arms, public house, Wood-street; I stopped there till within a few minutes to twelve. While I was there I had occasion to take out my pocket book to pay for a watch, I had in it property in bank notes, to near the amount of one hundred and forty pound. The prisoner was sitting before me, he had an opportunity of seeing the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before - A. I had seen him a number of times. I had a pint of porter to drink, and a sixpenny worth to drink while I was there, exclusive of some wine and water the prisoner pressed me to drink. When I left the public house, I went up New Compton-street, in the direct way to my home; when I got into <placeName id="t18100919-66-crimeloc363">Great Poulteny-street</placeName>

In the course of a minute I found somebody over me, endeavouring to take my book away, I holloaed out, murder, two or three times; the book was taken away, and they snatched at my watch chain; in snatching the chain they dragged the button off, but fortunately, I caught hold of my chain; there were two or three over me. I heard the prisoner over me, he said Nash.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure it was the prisoner's voice - A. I am certain of it, I have heard his voice a score of times; they separated and got away. Immediately I got up I saw the prisoner before me; I endeavoured to lay hold of him, I could not; he escaped for that night. He was taken the next day at the same public house, and directly I saw him, I said, there is one of the d - nd thieves that robbed me; the prisoner seemed to be alarmed, endeavoured to make his escape by throwing the table over, and applied to the poker; he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you never recovered any of your property - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known the prisoner before, you had no difficulty in knowing his person, as well as his voice - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said so at all the examinations, before all the magistrates; there is one of the magistrates here - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you knew him before Mr. Birnie - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>R. BIRNIE, ESQ. Q. I believe you were one of the magistrates acting on this occasion - A. The only one; this is the examination taking by me, I had the prisoner up three times.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How many examinations did you attend before the magistrate - A. Three, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. In all the examinations before the magistrate, you had just so much certainty of the prisoner as you have now - A. Certainly, I had, I never before the magistrate entertained a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the servant maid of the house to give evidence to day - A. I believe she is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any application to her on the subject of this robbery - A. Certainly not, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did she tell you that she would tell no untruth about it - A. No such conversation.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the house and found a mob there; Kelly gave the prisoner in charge for robbing him of 4l. 18s. She denied it, but said if we would clear off the mob she thought we could settle it - the people went out; I then advised her to give him his money; she said she had 3s. or 4s., and she would give him that to make it up, but he would not take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Ratcliff-highway, and met the prosecutor (who was very tipsy) with two other men. I dined with him and he had some rum. I then took him to my lodgings, and he sent the woman for half a pint of rum, which he drank; he sent me for some beer, and when I was coming back with it I met a woman who said "There is a great row at your house;" I went there - he called me aside, and said if I would give him a sovereign he would let me go; I said I had not got one, but I had three or four shillings, which I would give him rather than go to the watch-house.</p>

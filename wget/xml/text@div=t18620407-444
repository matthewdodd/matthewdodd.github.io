                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and omnibus proprietor, residing at Lower Park-road, near Peckham—on Tuesday, 4th March, about a quarter past 5, I was standing at the end of Talbot-court, Gracechurch-Street, William Spong, an omnibus driver, was standing alongside of me—I saw the prisoner driving an omnibus—his omnibus was drawn round behind our's, with the pole drawn up so close to our door, that I oould not get on the board till the horses moved—I go with the omnibus occasionally at con<lb></lb>ductor—it is well known that the regulation made by the City is, that omnibuses ought to stand four feet apart—the prisoner drove up to the door with the pole as close to the door as he possibly could—I did not hear the prosecutor say a word to the prisoner—I could not get on the board, and no one could get into the omnibus—I turned round to two ladies to ask where they were going, and Spong was putting the horses of the prisoner's omnibus back, and the prisoner was whipping them up—the prisoner began lashing at him, and the horses too—I said, "For God's sake come away, else you will be <hi rend="italic">drove</hi> through the door"—Mrs. Downing, Alderman Abbiss's assist<lb></lb>ant, was very much frightened, and persuaded him to do the same—the prisoner got down, threw the reins down and ran round the omnibus—Spong</p>

               <p>did not come away, but put the horses back—he was at the horses' head—when the prisoner got down, he ran round and took him by the collar of his coat round the neck, shook him against the wheel, and they then went across the pavement together and fell in Talbot-court, Homewood <hi rend="italic">atop</hi>—I saw them go down; after he fell, the prisoner took hold of him by the collar of his coat, pulled him up on his bottom as far as he could, hit him with his fist on the front of the head, and then let him go again, and when I looked at him, blood was coming out of his nose, left ear, and mouth—I think he struck him on the nose—he had got a black eye when I saw him the next day—he lay there for some minutes, and I was frightened and thought he was dead—the prisoner came to me and said, "Now I will serve you the same"—I said, "I think you have done quite sufficient, you have killed that man"—I did not see Spong strike the prisoner at all—there was no blow struck till after Spong was on the ground, except with the whip—there was none with the fist—he had Spong by the collar almost ready to throttle him—Spong had got his coat and gloves on ready to drive—as I was coming back from Peckham, the prisoner met me again, and offered to fight me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am omnibus driver to Mr. Martin of Peckham—on 4th March I was in Gracechurch-street, about a quarter past 5—the time-keeper gave me the time to start—I had just gone to get up on my omnibus but the pole of the defendant's omnibus bus against the door, prevented me—I could not get up in front because there was a cart close against our pole, and I had to go to the hind part—I wanted to go round to the other side of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and get up—I told the prisoner I wished him to put his horses back, for I could not get by—he did not do so—he said, "Your time is called, and it is time you were gone"—I then took the horses by the heads and put them back—he whipped both the horses up, my left side was against the step-board, and the horses' shoulder was against the side—he drove them close against the door—I put them back again, and he cut me several times across the hands with the whip—while I was putting them back a third time, he came round behind his omnibus, got me round the collar, and threw me up against the wheel of my omnibus, and then ran me up Talbot-court—that is all I recollect—I became insensible after that, the blood ran down the side of my head which was cut, here is the mark on my hat which came across the iron railing in the passage—I cannot say exactly how long I was insensible, for I found myself down at Billingsgate, sitting on a fish-stall there—I do not know how I got there, no one was with me—I then came up into Grace-church-street and went home by omnibus—when I got home I sent for a</p>

               <p>surgeon and was in his hands a fortnight—I was prevented from going to my work for three weeks—I did not strike the prisoner at all—I had never quarrelled with him or threatened him in any way—I still feel the effects of the blows—the back of my head is very bad now, and I feel a singing in my cars.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the City—on 4th March I was sitting on the near side of Martin's omnibus—I had been there about three minutes when Home wood came up on his <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> and drove his pole close against Mar<lb></lb>tin's door—Martin's time was up, and Spong went to Homewood and asked him to put back his horses—he did not make any reply that I know of—Spong took hold of his horses' heads and backed them—the prisoner imme<lb></lb>diately slashed them back again on Spong—Spong pushed them back again and Homewood slashed at him with the whip—Spong again pushed the horses back, and the prisoner threw the reins down, got off the box, came round to Spong, caught him by the collar, forced him against the wheel and the board at the end of the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> and then took him across up Talbot-court, and fell heavily on him—I saw that Spong was insensible, as the prisoner was getting off him—he hugged him tight—I could not set what passed but he struck him in the face—Spong was lying on the pavement bleeding, a crowd collected about a minute afterwards—no one went to Spong for a minute or so, and then a man came and took him in his arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see where Spong went to after this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I went away with Martin's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> about seven minutes afterwards—I would not be sure as to the time, that is all I know about it—I was sitting on the end seat, at the near side of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—there were no vehicles about, that I noticed—I could not see any vehicles behind Homewood's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I could not see whether there was any <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> standing behind; busses do stand very frequently about there—I merely heard Spong ask the prisoner to put back his horses—Spong was sober—I did not hear him say anything to the prose<lb></lb>cutor about fighting—I was near enough to have heard—I was right over his head—I was not particularly attending to this matter—there was not a policeman near till after Spong was insensible—two gentlemen on the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> cried "Police!" and "Shame!"—the prisoner whipped Spong across the hands, but his hands were protected with gloves—they scuffled towards Talbot-court, and there they fell—they fell intentionally—I could see that they were trying for the throw—it seemed that each was trying to throw the other—there was one blow struck by the prisoner after Spong was insensible; that was as they were lying on the ground together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Southampton-street, Peck<lb></lb>ham—I was called in to attend Spong on 4th March—I found he had suffered from the effects of blows, but from what cause I could not say—there was a scar over the left ear on the scalp, such as might be made by falling on a scraper—I heard that blood had been flowing from his ears; that would show that some internal injury had been caused, but I think the blood came from the scar and ran down from the ear—blood from the mouth would be caused by some external injury—he had evidently had a severe blow in the face—his right eye was slightly bleeding, and he had evidently had a blow on the nose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any injury of any serious character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was the cut over the left ear, that was not more dangerous than scalp wounds generally are; it was only dangerous from the fear of erysipelas setting in; in itself the wound was not dangerous—erysipelas is more liable to set in from scalp wounds than from others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mr. Wheatley, of Greenwich—I saw William Spong on the evening of 4th March, before 6 o'clock, in Talbot-court—he told me of the occurrence that had taken place, and that he would wait there for William Homewood's next journey from Peckham to fight it out—he did not seem insensible—there seemed nothing at all the matter with him.</p>

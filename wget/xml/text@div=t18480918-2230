                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, and live at Walworth. On 7th Sept., about twelve o'clock at night, I was taking a little walk—I had had sundry glasses of grog—I called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Holborn—I was accompanied by two females, who asked for a ride—the prisoner was one—we rode to the Elephant and Castle, and there had three or four glasses of brandy-and-water—we were then walking along the Walworth-road—I missed a small Geneva watch—I accused them—they both denied it—they were taken to the station—this is my watch.</p>

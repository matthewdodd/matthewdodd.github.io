            . I am a pawnbroker. I have two shirts pawned for 2s., I have every reason to believe by the prisoner - she came on a Monday morning between eleven and twelve o'clock; I asked if she was twelve years old, and who she pawned them for - she said for her father, and gave her name as "Ann Wood, 14, Old-street"- I think there was another girl with her.</p>

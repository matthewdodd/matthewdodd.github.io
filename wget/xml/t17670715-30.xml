            . I met the prisoner one evening about the beginning of June, about ten at night, and asked him the way to St. James's-street, St. James's palace; I came from South Wales, and was a stranger; he came along with me; (I had never seen him before;) I had him in at <placeName id="t17670715-30-crimeloc178">the King's Arms, in Catherine-wheel yard</placeName>

I went to see for a countryman to borrow a couple of shillings of, at the Ax and Gate in King-street, there I saw the prisoner sitting in the house; I went out to see if I could find any of my friends, Welch chairmen, to help to take him; I could not see any; while I was speaking to a stranger at the door, the prisoner went out at the back door; after I had told the people what had happened, one went one way, and another another, and he was taken that day; I saw him in the Round-house, and before Sir

            . I live in King-street, Westminster, by the Coach and Horses; the prisoner came to me about seven o'clock that morning he was taken, to have his shoes heel-pieced; the girl of the house came out to me to have a 9 s. piece changed; I at first refused changing it, but on account of the people not being up I did; she said, the man could not pay his reckoning without he could get it changed; after that one of the chairmen came and asked me to look at it, the prisoner was then gone; I did not understand it to be his money then; they sent for me into the house to look at the piece; I went and showed it them: then I said, I dare say the man will call again for his shoes, I had lent him a pair of slippers; he came about three hours after; I asked him to come in, and put his shoes on; he said he was in a great hurry, and could not; he did come in, and a man went in at the Ax and Gate, and told of it; the prisoner then said, upon being asked about it, it was his own 9 s. piece; (the prosecutor was not there then;) after that, the prisoner went away, and I went after him, and catched him; after that, the prosecutor came, and desired me to go with him to Justice Fielding's, as I changed the money; I went and told the Justice I changed the piece of money; the prisoner said he took that piece of money at Brentford.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I lived three years with the Earl of Abercorn; I had that evening been helping the servants; the prosecutor met me, and said he was a gentleman's servant, and desired me to show him St. James's palace; I thought it was very odd, when he said he did not lodge there, he said he lodged in Catherine-wheel-yard; it being very late, I lay with him; he got into bed, and lay on his breeches all night; I was born in Sussex, at a place called Westford.</p>

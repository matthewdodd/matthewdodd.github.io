                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 7, James-place, Deptford—on 4th October, from a quarter to half-past 6, I saw the prisoner in a public-house where I was—I put a bundle, containing tea and food, on a cask mere—the prisoner was in the side compartment—he came round to where I was—I missed the bundle, and, in consequence of what somebody said to me, I went after the prisoner down Old King-street, and saw him going across the water in a boat—I sang out to the waterman, "Bring your boat back, King; there is a man has got my bottle and food"—that was said loud enough for the prisoner to hear, and he turned round and threw my bottle overboard, and it sank directly—I then got into another man's boat to go after him, and I then saw him throw the handkerchief over with the food, and that sank too—I went across, and said to him, "Either pay me for what you have taken, or I shall give you in charge"—he said, "If you will come back to Deptford I will rectify it"—when I got him back he turned vary obstreperous, and would not pay me—I never saw him before that.</p>

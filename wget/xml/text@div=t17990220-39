               <p>WILLIAM SHAW sworn. - Between the 22d of December and the 13th of January, there were twenty thousand brass nails, and some girth web, taken out of my shop; the prisoner, Thompson, came to my shop, and said, she wanted these things, that they were for Mr. Elliot; I gave orders that she should be served with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Elliot a customer at your shop? - A. He was not a customer; but we had sent the day before to Mr. Elliot soliciting his custom.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you delivered them to her for Mr. Elliot? - A. Yes; every time she came, she came in the same name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put them down in your book to Mr. Elliot? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there must be an end of it. - Gentlemen of the Jury. This appears to me to be a fraud, but certainly not a felony; she comes under false pretences, saying, that she comes from Mr. Elliot, whose custom he had solicited, and he enters them in his book to Mr. Elliot, and therefore the prisoners must be both acquitted; is Mr. Elliot here?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>- ELLIOT sworn. - Q. Did you give this woman orders for these goods? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 15th of June did you lose a watch. - A. Yes, a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose it from your person. - A. On the 15th of June, about half past eleven at night, I was in <placeName id="t18070701-25-crimeloc154">Well-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18070701-25-crimeloc154" type="placeName" value="Well-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. Yes, I am never otherwise. The prisoner at the bar was the person that drawed the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of his person. - A. I never left him from the minute he took it; my wife and I was going down Well-street; he came up against me; I said at the moment, that man has got my watch; when he shoved up against me I felt the watch drawn out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch in his hand. - A. I only felt it go from me; I pursued after him in a minute.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010030"></xptr> Q. Were there many people in the street at that time. - A. Not a soul was in the street but him, he was alone; I cried stop thief, and pursued him immediately; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he get before he was stopped. - A. I believe the space that he ran before he was obliged to turn back again was twenty or thirty yards; my crying stop thief alarmed the people; he run down Red Cross-square, and turned back to avoid the people; he returned back because of the quantity of people that were coming up Red Cross-square; I laid hold of him by the collar and had him on the ground; some other person came up and he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch found upon him. - A. When we took him to the watchhouse he was searched, and no watch found upon him; Mr. Brock went back to the same place where the scuffle was; there he picked up the watch, and brought it to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. You say it was half past eleven at night. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were passing through Well-street, Cripplegate - is that in the road to Barbican. - A. It is the strait road to Red-Cross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner came to you and attempted to take the watch from your pocket - had you been drinking - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober. - A. I am always sober.</p>
               <p>Q. So I heard you say before. - A. I defy any man to say otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say that he returned back because of a mob coming, will you say that you never lost sight of him. - A. I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see him. - A. It was light enough for me to see him, because I was never farther from him than I am to you.</p>
               <p>Q. The moon was nine days old - do you mean to say it was light enough for you to see the face of a man, so that you could identify the person that took the watch from you. - A. If I were not positive I would not appear in this place.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know the probability of your story, not your reason - what dress had the prisoner got on. - A. A brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not any other man in a brown coat. - A. I had hold of the man before there was another man to be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where your watch was lost was it from where it was picked up. - A. Not above forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any person being present when the prisoner was brought up to you. - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said that you could not identify the person that robbed you. - A. No, I never quitted him till the constable took him from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the constable or any other person that you could not identify the person that robbed you. A. I never did.</p>

            . I am a china enameller and gilder. I assisted in taking the prisoner to the watchhouse; the prisoner was searched, there was nothing found on him, I saw where the prisoner fell, I went back to the very spot, I found the case within five yards of where he fell, in the gutter; I found the watch a little further against the wall, with the chain and seal to it; I took it to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it claimed by the prosecutor. - A. Yes, and the prosecutor identified the prisoner in the watch-house.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

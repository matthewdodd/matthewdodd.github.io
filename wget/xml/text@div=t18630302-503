                  </hi>. I have been living with the prisoner as his wife—I live at 2, Bridge-street, Limehouse—on 1st February, we both came home together; he was lying on the bed dressed, and I was lying on the floor at the side of the bed—shortly afterwards he said, "Where are you?"—I said, "I am lying here all right"—he went out into the passage, came back, said that he would kill me, struck me on the head with something very heavy, and I became in<lb></lb>sensible—I do not think he was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and licentiate of the College of Phy<lb></lb>sicians of Edinburgh—I was called, and found Jane Dixon insensible—on entering the house there was a pool of blood in the passage the size of a meat<lb></lb>plate—I administered stimulants to her, and she rallied—there was a con<lb></lb>tused wound on the top of her head, a bruise on the inner part of the left arm, one of her knuckles was broken, and her back was scratched over the lower two-thirds—she said, in the prisoner's presence, that she was lying on the floor on a pillow, and the prisoner got out of bed and said, "I will murder you," and beat her with a chair till she became insensible—the only remark the prisoner made was, "She cut me on the head "—she was unable to leave her bed for ten days—I think it was done with this chair-back—this piece of a fender would be more likely to make an incised wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have worked hard to keep her since Easter. She came home drunk, and laid on the floor. I asked her for some victuals, and she said there were none. I said, "Then I must have some money." I put my hand in her pocket to get some money, and she took this thing and cut me on the head, and then I threw her down, and her head was cut.</p>

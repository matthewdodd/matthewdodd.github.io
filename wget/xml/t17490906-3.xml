He took out a pistol as I thought , and held it to me, covering the place where the barrel should have been with his left hand, and said he would shoot me through the body. Hold your tongue, you dog, said I. Hush, hush, said he, or I'll shoot you immediately. I shifted about and parlied with my stick, that he should not have a mark at me. I saw Mr. Paterson, and called out to him for assistance. He came running , and the prisoner run away; I followed him , and he could not get through the posts quick enough. So he turned about and swore he would shoot me through the body if I pursued him; I advanced upon him and gave him a great blow with my stick on his left hand , which he covered the supposed barrel of his tinder-box with; he then got over the bank and run.</p>

               <p>Greenwich, with my mother, Elizabeth Sinnock Bennett. A gold watch belonging to Mr. Flower, of Lea, was left in my mother's care to be repaired—it was put in the workshop till it should be applied for—the officer afterwards produced it—this is the same watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bishopsgate-street. On the afternoon of the 21st of April, the prisoner brought this watch to pledge—I asked him whose it was—he said his own—I asked him where he got it from—he said his father gave it to him—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "No. 16, Worship-street"—I could see by his manner he had not got possession of the watch as he should have done, and I called in a policeman, and sent him to where he said his father lived—he brought him back, and said it was all wrong.</p>

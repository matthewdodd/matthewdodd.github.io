            . I am an officer. I received the two prisoners from the prosecutor - he gave me this handkerchief; I knew the boy who was discharged, and think I have seen Newberry, but not Ware.(Property produced and sworn to.</p>
               <p>Ware's Defence. It was not me - I was going on an errand through Smithfield, and the gentleman took hold of me and said I took his handkerchief - there was another boy; I know nothing of this prisoner - the handkerchief was on the ground, and I trod on it.</p>
               <p>Newberry's Defence. I passed this boy and the gentleman - I got as far as I am from you; I heard this boy say, "There he runs" - the gentleman then came up with Ware, and took me into the public-house; I am innocent.</p>
               <p>JOHN REEVE. I am positive he was near enough to be acting with the other boy.</p>

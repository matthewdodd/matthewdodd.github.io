               <p>EVAN DAVIS. I was in the prosecutors' employ. On the 7th of July the prisoner came about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was in the counting-house; I went into the warehouse, and saw him go up stairs (his brother was employed at our house): he came down while I was in the warehouse and left; I gave the officer information: he took him and produced about 3 lbs. of cochineal - the prisoner said he was done.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DEVEY. I am a constable. I observed the prisoner come down the prosecutors' gateway, and asked if he had not come down there - he said No, that he did not know them; I took him into a public-house, and found cochineal in his outside coat pocket, and some in the crown of his hat, tied up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MR. GRIFFITHS. We never allowed him to purchase cochineal of us - I have no doubt this is ours.</p>

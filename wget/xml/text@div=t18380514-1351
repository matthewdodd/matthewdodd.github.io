                  </hi>. I live at Old Brentford, and am a furniture-broker. The prisoner was in my service for about nine months—on Thursday, the 12th of April, about two o'clock, I went to look for him in a stable behind my house, and found him there—there was a mare there—(<hi rend="italic">here the witness described having found the prisoner in a certain situation</hi>)—I stood a minute or two, and then said, "You scoundrel, what are you doing? do you want to get yourself hanged?" and told him I certainly would tell my son, who was his master, when he came home—he said be had not been there a minute-nothing more passed—I came out of the stable, and he went to his work—(my son was gone out on business, and did not come home till twelve o'clock at night)—the prisoner was at work in the front shop—there is a parlour behind the front shop which opens into the shop-about four o'clock in the afternoon, I sat down to take tea to that parlour, the prisoner was then in the shop alone—I had taken two cups of tea and put some sugar into a third cup—I use moist sugar-be<lb></lb>fore I poured any tea into the cup, the prisoner called me into the shop, where I found a customer—I am sure I left nothing in the cup but that sugar I had put into it—there was a bottle of stuff which I use to take stains out of mahogany, on the sideboard—I produce the phial—it has a label with the word "poison" pasted on it—it had been there all the time the prisoner was there, and was often used—he has seen it used—I do not know whether he can read—I have pointed it out to him to be careful, that it would burn any thing, even wood, if it was left too long—I saw the contents of the phial on the Saturday, and had it in my hand that evening before this, just at dusk—the liquid then came up even with this first letter on the label, as near as I could see—I was not out of the house that even<lb></lb>ing, nor the following day—the stuff had not been used that day at all, nor the day before—I went down the yard with the customer, leaving the prisoner in the shop—I was gone about half an hour-nobody could go into the parlour without the person in the shop knowing it—I was in the yard and nobody could come in that way-when I returned, the prisoner was in the shop—he did not tell me of anybody having been there during my absence—I sent him down the yard with the customer for a screw, and I went into the parlour—I looked into my cup and perceived a liquid in it, which I knew I had not put in—I waited a few minutes to consider, and being certain I had put nothing but the sugar in, I filled the tea-cup up with tea, and put the milk into it—I stirred it up—I noticed it looked a dark colour, and the milk curdled—I poured it into the saucer, and took a whole mouthful—it tasted very pernicious indeed—I spat it out di<lb></lb>rectly—I did not swallow any of it—I noticed a sediment round the saucer exactly the same as is hanging round the bottle—I do not think I could have swallowed any of it—I did not keep it long enough in my mouth, it was too nasty—I went into the shop, and asked him what he had been doing to the tea-cup—he said, with an oath, that he had not been into the room since I had gone—I told him I was sure he must have done it, and nobody else—he denied it again in the same way—I called over the con<lb></lb>stable, who lives over the road, and gave him the cup, with what remained in it, to take to a chemist-while he was gone, I went to look for the bottle, which I found in the same place on the sideboard, but all the contents were gone—the constable returned, and said, in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence, that there was poison in the cup—the prisoner did not say a word—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Ealing. J was called over by Mrs. Kilsbey, and found the prisoner there—I received the tea-cup from her, took it to Mr. Slark, the chemist, and gave it to Mr. Woolferstan—he examined it—I returned with it—Mrs. Kilsbey and the prisoner stood in the parlour together—I told her there was poison in it—the prisoner denied that he had put any in-as soon as I told her it was poison, I asked if she had anybody in the house—she said, "Nobody but this boy," and he denied it—she would not give charge of him then—she gave me the cup, and I have kept it ever since—I produce it—here is a larger bottle, which contains the tea which was in the cup after the chemist had done with it—and she handed me this phial, saying it must have come out of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Slark, a chemist at Brentford. Hughes brought me the cup—I applied a test to it, and food it contained poisonous acid—I gave it as my opinion to be either sulphuric acid or vitriolic, and I afterwards examined it further, and found it was nitric acid—the cup contained five or six drachms, which is sufficient to cause death if she had drank the contents of the cup—this phial has con<lb></lb>tained nitric acid without a doubt.</p>

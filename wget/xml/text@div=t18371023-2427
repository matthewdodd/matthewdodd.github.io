                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Swan in the Old Kent-road, in the parish of St. George, Southwark. I rent the stables there, and the rooms over it, and pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for it to Mr. Elgee, who keeps the Swan—on the 2nd of October I left the place at half-past eight o'clock, and locked the door—there is a window at the side of the stable—I fas<lb></lb>tened that—there is no way into the room except through the door or window—I came back at twenty minutes after nine o'clock, and found the window open, and the bar forced down, which I had put up at the window—it had been nailed up—the window was pushed to—it is a sash-win<lb></lb>dow, and runs backwards and forwards—it was shut when I left it—the bar was nailed up inside—if the window was pushed back a person might force the bar down to get in—I unlocked the door and went into my room, and missed one waistcoat and eleven sovereigns and a half—the sovereigns were kept in a box which was locked—I found it broken open—the waistcoat was also kept in the box—I knew the prisoner be<lb></lb>fore—he had been about the house and about the yard before, as I em<lb></lb>ployed him—he came to me out of em<lb></lb>ployment—I said if he liked to assist me about the yard he might, till he could get employ—I had em<lb></lb>ployed him in that way about nine days—I have since seen the waistcoat on the prisoner's back—I lost it on the 2nd, and saw it on the 3rd, when I saw him in custody.</p>

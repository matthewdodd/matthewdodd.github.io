            . I am a custom house officer. On the 10th of March I was at the East India warehouse, Crutched Friars; about ten minutes after two I observed the prisoner, he was coming out of the iron gates that separate the premises from the outer yard; he came to me to be rubbed down as usual; on searching of him I found some loose tea in each of his coat pockets; he was in a very great hurry, he made a start to run up the steps with the delivery book; I immediately followed him up the steps and told him I had not done with him; he then begged I would let him go, he hoped I would forgive him; I told him it was more than my situation was worth. I took him into Mr. Saunders's office, and took out six ounces of tea from both his coat pockets; I asked him to unbutton his waistcoat, which he declined; I did it myself; I then found one bag of tea on his right side, under his arm; I searched on the other side, I found another in a similar direction on the left side, and another smaller one just at the pit of his stomach. I was then ordered by Mr. Saunders to see him to the compter; he said he was sorry for what he had done, and begged Mr. Saunders to forgive him. I have got the tea here; it has been weighed, the weight is three pounds. I looked in that warehouse on Saturday or Monday, I cannot say which day, I saw a chest in the upper floor that apparently had been plundered, which corresponded with this part that was in his pockets.</p>

               <p>Mr. Glass. That paper of tea is of the same colour and quality, one part of it, as is in the warehouse; the other part is blacker than any tea I saw in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

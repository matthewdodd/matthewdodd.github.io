               <p>Q. Who did he live with? - I cannot tell exactly. On the 27th of September he came to my house about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner come down the street, when he came opposite to my door he made a stop and said, there was a gentleman at his father's that wanted a pair of buckles; I knew his father very well, I did not deal with him, he said he wanted two or three pair, I looked at him I did not much like to trust him, but knowing the prisoner and his father, I came into the parlour, and let him have three pair of as large buckles as I had by me; he said he should sell one pair and bring the others back and pay for them, in an hour; this was at eleven o'clock in the morning, he did not return all day, I sent up at night to his father's to know about the buckles, he knew nothing at all about them; the man came back with that answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 7, Red Cross-street, and am clerk to Messrs. Harmar and others, distillers and rectifiers, who carry on their business in that street—the prisoners were, last month, in their employ as carmen, and had been so, I think, rather more than three years—Mr. Chap<lb></lb>man of the Gate-house Hotel, Highgate, is a customer of Messrs. Harmar and Pearson—on Monday morning, 17th April last, I was about to send a cask of gin to Mr. Chapman's—it left the warehouse about 9 o'clock in the morning—the prisoners were the carmen who were to take it—I have nothing to refer to now, but I think it contained 101 gallons when it left the warehouse—I put down at the time, how much it contained—I have not that entry with me—I tested that gin about 8 o'clock that morning, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120051"></xptr>
               <p>found it seventeen under proof—it is not possible that anything could have been taken out of that cask between the time I tested it and the time was sent away, without my seeing it—the cask was under my eye from half-past 8 to 9—no one could have touched it between that time without my seeing them—I did not see it between 8 and half-past; I was not there—Mr. Frederick Pearson was there—he is a son of one of the partners, and is a partner himself—the cask was quite full when I tested it, with the excep<lb></lb>tion of the sample that was taken out—that deficency was filled up from the vat that the gin was drawn from originally—the deficiency was about a pint—I saw the prisoners leave the distillery with the waggon—Mr. Chapman's name, the contents, and the strength, were written on the cask with chalk—we always send out a delivery-note with casks sent out in that way—the delivery-notes are kept in a book—we do not usually tear them out—the book is delivered to the carman, and he gets the receipt signed—the delivery-note that was given to the prisoners is not in my possession—the carman should deliver it to the publican, and he would sign it—the carman, if he comes home after the warehouse is shut up, would deliver it to me the next morning; if not, he would deliver it when he came back—the delivery-note was brought back to me by the prisoners the same evening, Monday, 7th April, about 7 o'clock—the whole book was given to me—the note was not then torn out; it was in the book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same delivery-note—Church gave it to me—it mentions 102 gallons as the quantity, and the strength seventeen under proof—Robinson was present when Church gave me that—Church gave me the book, and said that he had had a row with Mr. Chapman at the Gate House, Highgate—he had accused them of tampering with the gin, and that he had said to Mr. Chapman that he had never been accused of anything of that kind before, and he threatened to kick Chapman—Church said, in Robinson's presence, that it had been raining all day, all the time they had been out, and a little water might have got in the cans, which they supposed accounted for the deficiency that Mr. Chapman found—he meant deficiency in the strength—Robinson corro<lb></lb>borated the statement of Church—the prisoners appeared sober—they said that Mr. Chapman accused them of being tipsy—I received a telegraphic message the same evening from Mr. Chapman, about ten minutes before the prisoners arrived—Mr. Chapman came the next morning, and gave me a bottle sealed up, containing gin—I tested it's contents in order to ascertain the strength, and found it fifty-three per cent under proof—I tested it with the hydrometer and thermometer together—those instruments sometimes get out of order, but we always keep a standard in our office—I do not know about there being many hydrometers made inaccurately—they get inaccurate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you test it, and find it fifty-three under proof with the same hydrometer that you had tested it with in the morning, and found it seventeen under proof? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120052"></xptr>
               <p>much gin must have been taken out of that cask, (supposing it to have been full originally of gin at seventeen under proof,) and replaced by water, in order to bring it down to thirty-seven—I cannot tell when I made this calculation—it is necessary to take out about three gallons of gin, and replaces it by three gallons of water.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>altogether 102 gallons or thereabouts—I should think altogether about fifteen gallons of gin must have been removed, and fifteen gallons of water, or diluting power, put to it to average the test at which I found it—the gin in the vat was represented as being gin which had been delivered by our men, with the exception of a small quantity which was in the vat before—the small quantity was, I should think, about two gallons—the remainder of the gin was put into a cask in which there were fifty gallons, which I tested and found twenty-nine under proof—the men brought me home the receipt, on which was written, "Received 102 gallons of something called gin, fifty-five per cent under proof"—I did not know what to believe when they brought me that paper; they told me one tale, and that said another—the men said it had been raining all the time they were out, and they accounted for the deficiency in strength by saying that water had got into the cans—I did not believe, when I received their statement and the telegram of Mr. Chapman, that it was fifty-five under proof, knowing that it was seventeen when it went out—we sent the men on duty the next three days—I showed this piece of paper and a telegram to my superiors—the men were continued on the duty after I came back, having tested the gin myself—I do not know that they were watched in the mean time.</p>

               <p>of holding about three gallons and a half each—they were not full of water—I asked him what he wanted—he said that he wanted some water for his horses—I then took the trouble to show him where the pump was to get it—the pump was inside the house, in the passage—I then left him—I saw Thomas Lee just previous to opening the flaps, and stationed him at the flaps, and told him to be sure and not leave them, but to watch these men; more espe<lb></lb>cially to see that the cans were full—when I was in the cellar I chalked the number of the measures that were delivered—the measure was a four-gallon measure—a few minutes after I had been in the cellar, Lee came and made a statement to me, upon which I looked at one of the copper cans, standing on the pavement, and one that was under the syphon, apparently full of gin—I then returned to the cellar and directed Robinson to fill a twelve-gallon cask first—he said we had better fill the vat first, containing sweetened gin—I said, "No;" I wished the small cask to be filled first to retain it for unsweetened gin—the large vat contained sweetened gin—he again objected to do it, and said that it would be just as well to fill the small cask last, it would be more convenient to him—I insisted upon his filling the small cask and he commenced doing so, and put ten gallons in it—I did not measure what was in the small cask, there might be about from three quarters of a gallon to a gallon, of strong unsweetened gin, in it before he began to fill it—I asked him to give me a sample out of the second four gallon can that he brought down—we were then filling the little cask—it was from the second four gallon can that was poured in—Thomas Lee, the pot-boy, was by me at time—I put the sample aside on a cask—the jug was an empty one—I fetched it myself—it was hanging up in the bar, and was quite clean and dry—the first can full, was put into the twelve-gallon cask—the second, out of which I took the sample, was one of those that I had seen on the pavement either filled or being filled—the remainder of that from which I took the sample was put into the twelve-gallon cask, making the second can that had best emptied into it, less the quantity which I took out for the sample—we put ten gallons, two cans full and a half, into the small cask, and I then bunged it up—we then began to fill the vat—I said nothing to Robinson or the other man about the sample—after the small cask was filled, Robinson said it was not right for me to take a sample out of that can, as he had been doing some<lb></lb>thing with gin at Holloway, and wanted me to take it out of another—that was just after filling the small cask, while we were filling the vat—I told him that whatever he had been doing with gin at Holloway it could not possibly affect mine, as mine was in one cask by itself, and it ought to be all alike—he said several times afterwards that it was not his fault, and that he had had nothing to do with it—I do not know what he alluded to as not being his fault, except it was the sample—Church was drawing it from the cask, and was not within hearing—I heard some conversation between Lee, Church, and Robin<lb></lb>son, in fact, I entered into it myself, because they disputed the tally, both before and after Robinson made that statement to me—the men had both been drinking—they were just sober enough to carry the cans along—Robinson had spilt about a gallon of gin in the cellar; he could not hold the can steady to pour it in—there was a dispute about the gin, the sixteen gallons; they wanted to make it eighteen, and they kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with the potman, and swore at him very much, and the man came to me, and I told them that if they did not deliver their gin in a proper way, I would not take any more in—I keep a tally down stain, and every can that came down, I chalked on the cask it went into—after taking all the gin, I tested the sample that I had taken—the cask was empty, turned bung down in the waggon, drained out;</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Robinson asked you about the pump, he told you he wanted the water for his horses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have not measured the cans, but I should say they would hold fully three gallons and a half each, and perhaps more—I did not hear him say that he had had sweetened gin at Holloway in his cans—I do not remember his saying anything about sweetened gin—he might have said he had sweetened gin in the cans at Holloway; I should not like to swear positively—he said he had been doing something with gin; I will not undertake to swear whether he said it was sweetened gin or not—it was out of the copper can that I took the sample—I put ten gallons into the twelve-gallon cask, seventy-four gallons of the strong mixing gin in the vat, and eighteen gallons in the Old Tom cask, making in all 102 gallons—I suppose there might have been about thirty gallons in the Old Tom cask previously—it is a very strong gin—that which was in there previously was very strong—it is the strongest gin we sell, only it is very much sweetened—I did not then sweeten the eighteen gallons which I put in the Old Tom; it is sweetened now—the gin which was previously in there was sweetened—the eighteen gallons was sweetened by mixing with the sweetened gin—we have put in sweetening material since, to make it Old Tom, to make the cordial—I cannot test sweetened gin—at the distillery they can, because they re-still it—I can test unsweetened gin—Mr. Miller tested the unsweetened gin with me, and the strong mixing-gin—he did not test the Old Tom—I took it up to the distil<lb></lb>lery, and left it there—I took five gallons of each, to see the strength of it; that was afterwards—Mr. Miller tested the twelve-gallon cask, and attempted to test the gin in the large vat, where we had put the seventy-four gallons; there was only about two gallons of sweetened gin in previously, which would not affect it very much, still it would affect it—you could not test it cor<lb></lb>rectly on account of the sweetening—three gallons in seventy would perhaps make a differerence of 6 or 7 or 10 per cent.—there was none put in after the seventy-four gallons—I have never measured the vat—I should say it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120056"></xptr>
               <p>would hold quite 160 gallons, perhaps more—I cannot swear what he tested that at—I think it was 44 per cent, but I should not like to swear to it—he did not attempt to test the Old Tom, because it was no use—he did not test it at my place—if he did I did not see it—I did not see him test any other besides the twelve-gallon cask and the vat—it would be matter of im<lb></lb>possibility to test the strength of the Old Tom at anything approaching to the truth—the sugar destroys the effect of the instrument—no water was put into the vat after the gin was put in, and no more gin at all—I locked the cellars and did nothing till after I had communicated with the distillery—I told Mr. Miller that fifteen gallons of water had been put into a hundred the day before to reduce the strength—no more gin had been put in—we don't sell gin so strong as they do at the distillery—wears obliged to reduce our spirits; sometimes we get rum at 44 over proof, which we are forbidden to sell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The fifteen gallons of water was to reduce the hundred that you expected to come in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, this very hundred—gin seventeen under, proof is very strong, the strongest the distillers send out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the hundred gallons to be mixed with the fifteen gallons of water so as to make it less strong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If it is to be done I like to have the pleasure of doing it myself—it is done throughout the trade—I do not know that Mr. Miller tested as a very strong gin at twenty-nine that which we sell as Old Tom—if he did, I did not see him—there was not water put in that—sugar was put in—there was not a drop of water in the twelve-gallon cask—it was ail genuine—that is a more expensive gin; we get a higher price for it, you can buy gin at any strength—they disputed the tally—I got 102 gallons, or within a fraction, but they admitted they were wrong—if I had admitted I was wrong, I should have lost sixteen gallons of gin—it was either at six or seven, and they wanted to put it down at sixteen or eighteen, and if I gave way to them I should have lost sixteen or eighteen gallons—I went up and saw the cask turned over, and that proved that I was right.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming that there had been sweetened gin in the cans, the mouths of which were so small, that would have reduced the strength at once, would it not, of the gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot see that that was possible—the sweetened gin in the vat reduced it 10 per cent.—it is not very likely they would leave gin in the cans—I cannot say anything as to whether, if there had been some sweetened gin in the four gallon measure, it would reduce the strength of that which was poured on it—I do not know how it would act on the instruments—the fact of a little gin being in the can I do not think would affect it at all—if there had been water in, of course that would have diluted the gin which was poured on it—if there were sweetened gin it would depend on whether the sweetened was watered or not—I sent this receipt home, "Received 102 gallons of something called gin, 55 under proof"—that is true—the men said the sample was not a fair sample—I could not test that which was in the large vat, nor what was in the Old Tom.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman to Mr. Chapman, of the Gate House Hotel, at Highgate—on Monday, 7th April, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, Messrs. Harmar &amp; Co's. waggon came there—the two prisoners came with it—Robinson asked me for a pail to give the horses some water—I went to the stables, fetched him an empty pail, and directed him where to go and get the water from—he went and got some and brought it back in the pail—I only noticed the cask of gin in the waggon—I do not know whether there was any name on it—there were two copper cans on the road which had come with the waggon—when Robinson returned with the pail, he emptied the water into one of the four-gallon cans, and then returned for more—he fetched two pails full of water, one of which he emptied into the other four-gallon can—he did not quite fill the cans—I then went to my master to tell him what I had seen—he was down in the cellar—after I had told him I came up the cellar steps to the flap—I did not notice any pails there then—I did not see the horses watered at all—I never noticed any water on the ground under the horses' heads—Church was there when I returned—I saw him just fill one can up with gin and put it on the pavement, and then fill the other up from the syphon, from the cask—those were the two same cans I had seen before—I saw him begin to fill both of those cans from the cask—they did not take as long to fill as they usually do when they are empty, a much shorter time—shortly after this my master came up out of the cellar, and Robinson took one of the cans down into the cellar—I took the other can myself—when I got down with the second can I saw Robinson emptying the first can into a twelve-gallon cask—I then gave him the can which I had—he was about emptying that into the twelve-gallon cask, when my master asked him to give him a sample—Mr. Chapman had a jug to put the sample in, and Robinson filled it from the second can—I then left the cellar and went up to the flap—Robinson came up shortly afterwards—Church was there, and Robinson said to him, "He has had a sample out of my can; I don't know how you will like it"—Church made no reply—the prisoners had been drinking—when five cans had been taken down Church said it was seven—I kept a score of the cans as they went down—when six<lb></lb>teen had been taken down, Church said it was eighteen—he and I had some little dispute about it—I then left to speak to my master, and we agreed as to the number of cans that had been taken down—the gin was taken out of the cask till it was perfectly empty—Robinson told my master he had better have another sample, as that was not a fair one that he had got—he said nothing about where the sample should be taken from—after the gin had all been emptied out of the cask, I went with my master to the bar-parlour, and he gave me the sample that had been taken out of the second can, and sealed</p>

               <p>it up—I saw him making a test of it—I did not look and see what proof it was—after the sample was tested it was divided into two bottles, which were sealed—I have got one of them—it is not here; I have not brought it—it is still in the same state as it was when it was sealed—Church asked my master to sign the delivery-note, and he said he would not, at which Church used an expression.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in practice as a surgeon—I was called to the prisoner's house about 9 on the night of 29th August, and found the deceased lying apparently dead, with her head on the under shelf of a wash-stand—with assistance I raised her on to the bed, and partially examined her—I observed some bruises on the thigh; they appeared to be done by a blow or fall, a kick perhaps—I told them to send for the Coroner's officer—I afterwards examined the stomach—I found a bruise on the left side, three inches below the umbilicus; a small bruise on the left side of the right leg, near the knee-pan, and another bruise above the right buttock—none of those bruises had anything to do with the cause of death—from the position I found her in, I think she had got out of bed to use a certain utensil, and had slipped off.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I made a post-mortem examination of the de<lb></lb>ceased, at the Coroner's request, on the afternoon of 13th August—I was told she was fifty-three years of age, and I should say she was about that—she was a fat, bulky woman, in good condition—the body was still some<lb></lb>what rigid—there was an old scar on the right side of the forehead, and another on the right shin—those were the results of violence some yean ago—around the left eye was a very severe bruise, from which a cut extended down to the cheek-bone, about an inch in length—that bruise was becoming green and yellow, and the cut was in process of healing—I judge it to nave been from one to two weeks old—upon the abdomen, midway between the navel and the pubes, was a very severe black bruise—on the front of the left thigh were four more severe, transverse, black bruises—their size, colour, and appearance indicated that they were done at the same time and by the same instrument or means which bad caused the bruise on the abdomen—I believe they were caused by the toe of a large, heavy boot—they were such wounds as only very severe violence could have caused—I judged them to have been about three days old—there was a small bruise on the knee, and another small bruise on the buttock—on opening the head I found a clot of blood weighing about 3 ozs., dark in colour, and firm in texture, lying between the brain and the membranes on the right side, in the cavity of the arachnoid—it spread all over the right side—that clot of blood had sprung from a rupture of the meringiael artery, where it passes through a groove in the skull—that had been the cause of death—the brain and its vessels were perfectly healthy—I examined the chest and stomach—the rest of the organs were healthy—the bruise in the abdomen bad net caused any visceral mischief—from the character of the fat about the body, and the condition of her liver, I should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190063"></xptr>
               <p>have suspected that she was in the habit of drinking too much; but not that she was a drunkard—such persons have a peculiar oily kind of fat—I think the rupture must have been caused by violence, because that artery is never known to burst from natural causes, unless from aneurism or some manifest disease—the vessels in the brain itself are very liable to rupture in common apoplexy—this was not apoplexy—the clot of blood may have existed there three weeks—I have known similar cases, in which the violence was clearly traced to a week or ten days before, without any symptom beyond headache being caused.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You attribute the death to the effusion of blood on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that may have been caused by a fall on the floor—with a person in the habit of drinking freely, there would be a brittleness of the brain-vessels, which would render them more liable to burst—drinking rots all the textures—this was not a vessel in the brain itself—it supplies the skull and membranes of the brain.</p>

I shew'd the apothecary the corrupted blood which came from him when he made water; it looked like blood itself. The apothecary told me it came from the bruises he receiv'd from the men. And after he was dead, when I went to lift him into the coffin, the blood came into my hand from a hole between his shoulders. Before he died, he complained of pains all over his body.</p>

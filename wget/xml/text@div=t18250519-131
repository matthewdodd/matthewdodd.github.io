On the 11th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was on the Pavement, Moorfields, opposite to Albion chapel, and saw the prisoner there - she asked me to give her a glass of gin; I took her into a watering house opposite the chapel, gave her a glass of gin, and desired her to go about her business; I was sober; I had a bundle under my arm, containing a shirt, a coat, a waistcoat, and a pair of unmade trowsers; she turned one way, and I went towards London-wall, and stood against a wall for a necessary purpose; she came and took the bundle from under my arm, and ran away with it; I turned round, but lost her. I found her at the Mansion House four days after, with all the property; it was a very fine night: I am certain of her being the person I gave the liquor to. My face was towards the wall when the bundle was taken; I could only see that it was a female who took it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MORRIS. I am a patrol of Bishopsgate. On the 11th of April, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came round into Broad-street-buildings, in a hurried manner - I told her it was no thoroughfare: she had a bundle under her arm, and the coat tail hung out of it. I followed her towards the gate, and asked where she came from; she said from Mr. Wilson's, in Bishopsgate-street - I asked what number - she said No. 10; I said Wilson's was No. 43, and took her to the watch-house. The bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

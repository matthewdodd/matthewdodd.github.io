             gave the prisoner in charge to me; this Ives and the prisoner and two more had a dispute or quarrel among themselves; after I had the prisoner in charge we had an engagement, and both of us came down together; he got from me, but he was stopped; the things were lying upon the flags; Ives picked them up, and we carried the prisoner and the things to the watch house; I do not know where Ives is; he was admitted an evidence against the prisoner, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when Ives charged him with having stolen these things?</p>
               <p>Seaton. The prisoner did not say any thing about them; he only asked what he had done; I heard him say before the Justice, that Ives was as big a thief as himself; Mrs. Seaton was asked if she knew any thing of the clothes; she looked over them and said they were all the things she had lost excepting one handkerchief; upon her saving this, the prisoner took a silk handkerchief fifth neck and said to her may be this is it; she looked at it, said it was, and that there was a tear in the hem at one of the corners; when that handkerchief was examined, it appeared to be tore as she described. (The goods, particularly the handkerchief, produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before that time?</p>
               <p>Stone. No; I had a candle in my hand and I took particular notice of him; I am certain he is the man; he was close to Mr. Seaton's door, I did not see him come out of the house.</p>

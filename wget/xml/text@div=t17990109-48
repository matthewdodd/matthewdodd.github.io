             sworn. - I called at Mr. Brennand's, on the Wednesday evening, and saw the prisoner there; and Mr. Brennand's brother, Robert, whispered to Mr. Brennand, that he suspected she had taken something; Mr. Brennand immediately went forward, and put his hand upon the pile, and said, Robert, which print is it; the woman then went out, and he called her back, and challenged her with taking it; then the woman let the print fall; I saw the print on the ground, and part of it was under her clothes.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BRENNAND sworn. Q.What reason had you to suppose the prisoner had taken any thing? - A. I had shewn the prisoner several prints, and she took one piece, and pulled it from end to end; I turned my back, and I heard her pulling the print to pieces; soon after that, she set down upon a stool; I told Mr. Brennand my suspicion, and she was detained.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

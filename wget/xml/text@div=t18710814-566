                  </hi>. I live at Mitcham, Surrey, and am a widow—on 9th April, 1865, the prisoner married my daughter at Croydon Old Church—I did not go inside the church—I did not see the marriage completed—I produce a certificate which I have compared with the original—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1865, <hi rend="italic">and was a certificate of a marriage at the Parish Churchy Croydon, between Thomas Kitley and Amphillis Arthur</hi>)—the Thomas Kitley named in that certificate is the prisoner—I knew him before the marriage for a few weeks—he courted her before—I am sure he is the man—he was only nineteen then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the dinner after the wedding—I did not hear my daughter say she would rather cut her throat than have married the prisoner—they lived together five or six weeks, when she left him and went to live with a man named Harris, and she has been living with him since, and has had three children by him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale printseller, of 120, London-wall—Drasda has been in my employment for two years, as salesman in the print department—part of his duty was to enter in a book all the prints that were sold by him—on the afternoon of 17th March, Weil came in about 4 o'clock—he went upstairs into the print-room to Drasda, and stayed about five or ten minutes, and came down without having bought anything—I asked him to step up again, and see if he could not find something that would suit him—he did so, and bought something of the value of a shilling—several prints were shown him, but he said he had no use for them—while he was upstairs I sent for a policeman—he came downstairs, and I called him into my counting-house, and told him that I had heard that hundreds of my prints had been sold by him at a much less price than I had sold them for—I asked him whether he had got those prints from any one in my employ—I mentioned Gustave Drasda's name—he said he had never had anything to do with any of my men, and had not received any goods of Drasda—he would not, tell me where he got the prints from—I called Drasda down, and told him what I had heard about the prints—he denied knowing anything about them—afterwards he said he had stolen 500 prints, and some pain<lb></lb>tings, and that Weil had received the prints, and the paintings were at his lodgings—Weil then said he bad bought them of Drasda, and had paid for them—Drasda lodged in Wenlock-street, Hoxton—I went with Baker, the police-officer, there, and found four paintings—we afterwards went to Weil's lodgings, at 28, Gloucester-street, Bloomsbury, and found there about 100 prints which had come from my warehouse—they were in a box, which was locked—to customers like Weil, I should sell these prints at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen; that would be about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per hundred—if a large quantity was taken they would be 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a 100—a single hundred would be 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Weil was a cus<lb></lb>tomer of mine—he never bought more than twenty-five at a time.</p>

Zarn's—Weil and Mr. Zarn were in the counting-house—I told Weil that I was a detective, and I asked him where he got those prints from that he sold to Mr. Le Visconte, in Commercial-street, and also to Mr. Alba—he said he had bought and paid for them—I asked him where, but he would not tell me—I then asked him if he had bought any prints of either of Mr. Zarn's servants—he said, "No"—Drasda was then sent for—I told him I was a police-officer—I asked him if he had ever taken any prints home from his master's premises—he said, "Yes; I will tell the truth; I am very sorry; I have taken 500 hunting prints, and sold them to Well"—he said he sold them for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a hundred—Weil said it was true:</p>

               <p>he had bought the prints and paid for them—I went to 28, Gloucester-street, Bloomsbury, Weil's lodgings, and there I found these 110 prints (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a box, locked.</p>

Zarn—Weil called on me again and asked me if I would buy any more prints—I said, "No; do not come here again with your prints"—he asked me what reason I had to tell Mr. Zarn I had bought the pictures—I said I had a good reason to do so.</p>

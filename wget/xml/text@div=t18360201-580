                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Charles Casey, a dealer in shoes, in Brick-lane, Old-street. On the 29th of January, the prisoner came to our shop to book at some books. I showed them some—they tried a pair on, which were too narrow, and while I went to get another pair I missed a pair, which were found in Conan's basket—I saw them found on her—these are them—I had not sold them.</p>

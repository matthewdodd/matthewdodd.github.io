                  </hi>. I am a solicitor carrying on business at 26, Martin's Lane, Cannon Street as "Lowless &amp; Nelson"—on 5th November, 1874, the prisoner called on me and handed me this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I read and identified Mr. A. A. Millar's handwriting—I have been acquainted with Mr. Millar, for many years—I asked him his business, and he said he bad come over from Ireland, on 27th October, in charge of four horses, hunters, which had been sold by his firm in Dublin to a Mr. Alfred Hughes, of High Street, Aldershot, through Hughes' agent, one Michael Hunt, that the price agreed was two at 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; and two at 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, making together 408<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that Michael Hunt had paid his firm ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes on account, leaving 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he had come over at his father's request to settle the matter, that he had seen Mr. Hughes on one or two occasions, that Hughes wanted a reduction in the price of the horses; that he had written to his father about it, and his father declined to make any reduction—I think he used the words "To sell the horses over again"—that he wanted proceedings taken against Mr. Hughes to recover the 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—then asked him for the Christian and surnames of the partners in his firm—he told me there-were his father, Thomas Haughton, and himself, that his name was James Haughton—I asked their address and he told me "The Q uay, Dublin"—he asked me if there would be any necessity for him to stop in London—I told him "No"—he said'he had placed the horses at Burton's Livery Stables, Marylebone Road, and that he had served Hughe's with notice that the horses were there at his risk and expenses—I told him the matter should be attended to—he then said "I apologise for troubling you, but Mr. Millar was in a great hurry when he wrote the introduction—was just going into Court, and when I came over I had no idea there would be any difficulty with Mr. Hughes—I am stopping at the Euston Hotel, and I am afraid I may run short of money, as you do not want me to stop in London, I shall be glad to get back to-night, could you oblige me by exchanging my firm's cheque; Mr. Millar will be very happy to give you the money for it, or you can pay it into your banker's"—I rang the bell and my cashier came in, and I wrote out my cheque and prisoner wrote</p>

Haughton," signed by him J. Haughton—I was present when he was apprehended—in fact I apprehended him myself I believe—I put my hand on his shoulder, and I said. "Mr. Haughton?" and he said "Yes"—Sergeant Bull was across the street and I charged him—I told him I had a warrant for his apprehension, and he was taken prisoner and I did not interfere after that—my cheque was duly paid and debited to our account—the other cheque was returned in the same state, it is now except that it has got the stamp of the Mansion House <hi rend="italic">'</hi> Justice-room upon it—I should not have parted with my cheque unless I had believed that I held valuable security for it.</p>

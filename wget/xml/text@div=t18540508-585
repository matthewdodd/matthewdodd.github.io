                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Chatham-street, Pimlico. On 4th April, I received some coals, I ought to have had four tons—I believe it was the prisoner brought them, but it was rather late in the even<lb></lb>ing; the person who delivered them brought me this note—there were two other men with him—after they had been there some time I went out and saw that there were three or four corn sacks there—not coal sacks; and they were delivering coals out of them—I made an objection to it to this man—I said they were not proper sacks to put coals in, and he said they had some broken sacks, and they were obliged to put them in these—I said, "Well, you may shoot them"—and one of the men said, "I have got five sacks for another person"—this railed my suspicion, and I told the prisoner the coals were mine—he said they were not, he had to take them to ano<lb></lb>ther place—I asked where, and he said somewhere in York-street—I paid the prisoner for the coals, and directed my son to follow the wagon.</p>

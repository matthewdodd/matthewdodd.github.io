               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. Between seven and eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. No, I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband in the house?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. He was; he is a <rs id="t17540530-8-viclabel34" type="occupation">smith</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17540530-8-victim116 t17540530-8-viclabel34"></join>and was at his business; the prisoner came up two pair of stairs, and asked no questions of any one; I heav'd up my headand saw a strange woman in the room. I saw her take away the gowns, and go down stairs; she dropped both the gowns upon the stairs : she saw me in bedand heard me shriek. I cried after her as she went down stairs; I was in my shift; I went down to the door, and desired my neighbours to call out stop thief. My husband ran after her, and took her in a neighbour's house.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you say that you was half-asleep and half-awake, and that you did not see me go out?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. My Lord, I said, that when she came into the room, I did not see her open the door, for I was between sleep and wake.</p>
               <p>Rice Vaughan. I am a smith; I heard my wife cry out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way is it up into your room?</p>
               <p>Rice Vaughan. There is a passage that goes through without coming into the shop. I followed the prisoner, and found her at a green-stall; a neighbour told me she ran in there; I desired her to come back again, for she had robbed me; when I brought her back, my wife charged these gowns upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Vaughan. By the opportunity you had of seeing her when your husband brought her back, Are you sure she is the same woman?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. I am sure she is</p>

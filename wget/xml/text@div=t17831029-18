               <p>- COXFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of October, I had a search warrant to search Shipley's house for some horse cloths, and I found one, and next to the sacking of the bed, between that and the bed I found a sheep skin, it was up stairs, there was only one room on the floor.</p>
               <p>Who lives in the house besides Shipley? - He has a wife but she was in London, I know it to be his house, the door was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>(The Sheep skin produced.)</p>
               <p>I found in the same room at the feet of the bed, a leg and loin of mutton, I put it within the skin and took it to the house where Shipley was then, I took him to the Justice, and the Justice sent me to see if I could find any more mutton, I went into the next house thinking it was the same, and there I found a shoulder of mutton with part of the breast; that was in one Easterlough's house, then Mr. Church suspected Templar, and he had a search warrant for his house; and in the back place next to the common, I found a leg, shoulder, and loin, and part of a loin was boiling in the pot; I found the wind-pipe of a sheep over the oven, and I found the head over the ashes of an oven partly burnt.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it was the wind-pipe of sheep? - The butcher says so, it was partly burnt to pieces, and the suet of one loin in a flour bag, this was at Templar's.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason to know whether that mutton belonged to Mr. Church's sheep more than any other man's sheep? - Only by the butcher.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at Mr. Wagg's door when Templar was there, and he sent for me in to examine the meat, I compared it together, and I think the two loins fellowed before being parted where they were chopped, one had all the bones the other without any; I saw the two legs, and the two shoulders, and they looked to be very much alike as to size.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they correspond or not? - They did.</p>
               <p>Were they loins of the same sheep? - Yes, I am almost sure they were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How long have you been a butcher? - I served five years of my time and my master broke.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS BOND sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the skin, and said, it was Mr. Church's property by the brand marks, and the riddle on the rump, I compared the mutton, and the hind quarters, the leg and the loin was cut from each other, that is that which was found in Shipley's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Coxford. What did you say about the loin that was found at Templar's?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290065"></xptr> - I found a leg, and a shoulder, and one loin, but half of that was boiling.</p>

               <p>Templar came to my house on Thursday night, and bid me come on Friday to him, when I came there he was not at home, I waited there some time, his wife said, he was on the common cutting furze; I saw him put a parcel of sheep in a corner indeavouring to catch one with a hook, I begged of him not, he damned me, and bid me hold my tongue, he said, he should think no more harm to kill me, than to kill a dog; he asked me to go home with him, he hung it up by the hind legs, he said, take the skin home and lay it under the bed, the wool will all peel off, and wash it, and it will make you a very good bolster.</p>

The prisoner came in the shop. I did not see her come in the shop. I was told by Miss Pearson that a woman had been in the shop and had taken something with her. I went after her, and overtook her in Grafton-street, about fifty yards from the shop. I told her that she was wanted in the shop where she had gone out of. She asked me what I wanted. I told her she would be told when she came back. She came back with me to the shop, and produced the articles out of her apron. She had twelve papers of pins in her apron, one pound of thread, a quarter of a pound of cotton thread, and half a pound of thread besides, and two pieces of tape, they were worth eleven shillings, the selling price was fourteen shillings. She then said these articles she got for half an ounce of thread. She said she asked for half an ounce of thread, and got these articles for which she paid eighteen shilings, that she gave a pound note, and received two shillings out of it, and that asked for half an ounce of thread, and had these articles besides, and by her account she paid eighteen shillings for these articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Eighteen shillings was more than the selling price of these articles, was it not - A. Yes. When she produced these articles I took her into the warehouse; then she took out half a pound of thread while the constable was being sent for. The constable was sent for. He came and searched her, and found nothing else.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear what she asked for - A. No. I was serving a gentleman with a variety of haberdashery articles. I went to another counter to fetch something that was wanted. I had left these goods on the counter that I was serving the gentleman with. On turning my head, I saw the prisoner,

            , handling one of the parcels of cotton thread. I made what haste I could back to the place, and by that time she was going out of the door. I asked the witness that spoke last, if he had been serving her with anything. He said, no. I then mentioned the circumstance of the cotton, and said she must have stolen it, and requested him to go after her, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not she given you a note - A. No; I had not spoken to her, nor had she given me a note. I received no money of her at all. She returned back to the shop with the young man I sent in pursuit of her. She opened her apron of her own accord, and took out a quarter of a pound of cotton thread that was missing, twelve papers of pins, and a pound of thread. She was taken into the warehouse, and then she took out half a pound of thread besides. She said that she bought that thread, and gave me eighteen shillings. That was not so. She said nothing respecting the other articles. She said that she gave me a one-pound note, and I gave her two shillings in change. She pretended to have bought only the thread; the price of that thread would be two shillings. I said she had not given me a note. She persisted she had. These are the articles; they are my master's property. I saw her handling the thread, but I did not see her move it from the counter.</p>

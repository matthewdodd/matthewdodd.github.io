                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Praed-street, Paddington. On the 31st of May, about three o'clock in the morning, I was going up the Wdgeware-road towards home, when the prisoner seized me by the arm and asked if I had any money—I said, "No,"—he then seized me by my other arm, threw me down, and attempted to strangle me, whilst he stole my shawl and collar, and ran away—I saw him put the shawl underneath his coat—I called out, "Police," and "Murder"—I got up and ran after him—he was stopped by the witness Morris—I went up and said, "That man has thrown me down, attempted to strangle me, and stolen my shawl and collar"—Morris seized the prisoner, took the shawl and collar from under-neath his coat, and gave them to me—I still called "Police," and one came—I told him what had happened—the prisoner had not gone away far from where he was stopped—Morris still had hold of him—the prisoner then said I had taken 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him, and that he had given me some coffee—that is not true—I never saw him till he seized me—I gave the shawl and collar to the policeman.</p>

               <p>my way I met the prisoner running in the direction of Cato-street, and within twenty yards of it—I saw the prosecutrix about forty yards off, running and calling after him—I stopped him, and held him till she came up—she told me he had taken her shawl and collar from her, and showed me her throat where his fingers had pressed her—there were marks of violence—I perceived a bulk under his coat, and took the shawl and collar from under it—I asked the prosecutrix if it was hers—she said it was—she immediately ran away calling "Police"—a person came up and said the woman had got her shawl, what did I want holding the man—there was no policeman there then, and I let him go—he did not go more than thirty or forty yards before he was stopped, and brought back by a policeman, and by that time the prosecutrix had come back with an<lb></lb>other policeman—the prisoner then said she had robbed him of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or he had given her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to tell him the way to Cato-street, or show him a lodging—she denied it, and said she was willing to be searched.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the morning in question—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner run from Edgeware-road up Newnham street—I went up Molyneux-street, and met him <hi rend="italic">full butt</hi>—he directly turned round to get away from me—I laid hold of him, and took him to the end of Newnham-street, where I met the pro-secutrix and Morris—the prosecutrix said, "That is the man that knocked me down, pinched me about the throat, and robbed me of my shawl and collar"—as I was taking him along the prisoner said, "The woman took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from me—I don't know the laws of this country—I have only been three weeks from Ireland, but I thought I would have my money's worth"—the prosecutrix was not far off, and might have heard that, but I cannot say whether she did or not—she gave me this shawl and collar—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found on him a penny, two half-pence, a tee-totaller's medal, and two half bricks—I asked what he wanted with those, and he said, he had them if any Englishman attacked him, to give him <hi rend="italic">a benefit</hi>—I saw marks on the prosecutrix's throat, and likewise on her arm when before the Magistrate, at half-past eleven the same morning.</p>

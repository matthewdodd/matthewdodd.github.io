                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Tulse-hill, Brixton. The prisoner was in my employ about nine days, as a plumber—he was employed on some buildings at Brixtorin-hill—a little past five o'clock, on Monday, the 27th of June, I met him a very short distance from the build<lb></lb>ing, with a carpet bag on his shoulder, which appeared to be very heavy—I passed him, and looked round at him—I went to the building a back way—I sent a labourer to tell the prisoner to come to me directly—he did not come—I followed, and overtook him—I said, “Plumber, how is it you</p>

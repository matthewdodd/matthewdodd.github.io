On a Saturday in the beginning of November last, at about eleven o'clock in the forenoon; the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to see some bottle-stands; I showed him some which he looked at, but said they were not high varnished<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160050"></xptr> enough; he then asked me, if the seals which were in the show glass were gold; I said no; he asked me if I had not some gold seals; I said we had; he desired to look at them, upon which I took out the drawer, and showed them to him; he said they were not good enough, and therefore desired to see some cornelians; he wanted to have his arms cut in them; he then went away, and said he would come upon the Monday following; he did come on Monday about twelve o'clock; it happened at that time, I was alone in the shop; a carriage came to the door just at the same time as the prisoner came in, upon which I made some apology to him to be excused to go to the carriage; he said by all means; while I was at the carriage, my husband came into the shop, and attended upon the prisoner. I was about ten minutes with this carriage; then I returned into the shop. In three or four minutes afterwards the prisoner went away. In about two days after this my husband mentioned to me, that two cornelian seals, set in gold, were missing from a drawer; this drawer is in a glass case in the shop. When I returned into the shop from the carriage the drawer was out; it had been taken out by my husband; the prisoner went away in about the space of three or four minutes after I came in; I know there were two such feals in the drawer; these seals were found about a month or six weeks afterwards, exposed to sale, at one Mr. Dartnall's shop, a silversmith in Oxford-street; they were worth fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>[On her cross examination she said, that many people use their shop, but that at this time she was certain, that when the prisoner came in, there was no one in the shop but herself, that when she went to the carriage her husband came in, and when she returned into the shop, there were no other persons in the shop but her husband and the prisoner.]</p>

               <p>I am a silversmith in Oxford-road. Sometime in November last the prisoner came to my shop, and offered me a gold seal upon his watch chain to sale, and a cornelian stone seal, set in gold; he asked a guinea for it; I gave him sixteen shillings, and thought it a fair price to a gentleman for a second hand seal; two or three days afterwards the prisoner came again to my shop, and offered another cornelian seal, set in gold; this second seal I did not think so strongly mounted as the former, therefore I thought it not of so much value, and offered only fourteen shillings; the prisoner said, he thought it of as much value as the other, however he accepted the fourteen shillings. In about three weeks or a month after this Mr. Cartwright came into my shop, saying, he saw two seals exposed in my window that were his property, and desired me, if I could recollect the person of whom I bought them to stop him; after this, I do not know but it might be the end of the month of November, but it was a considerable time before Christmas that the prisoner called again at my shop, and offered another seal to sell which was made of a composition. Thought I had been desired by Mr. Cartwright to stop the man of whom I bought the seals, the prisoner had so much the appearance of a gentleman, that I could not prevail upon myself to stop him, but I acquainted Mr. Cartwright with it, and in few days after I was summoned before the justice's in Litchfield-street; they said it concerned myself and my character to stop the person of whom I bought these seals. In a few days after the prisoner came in order to sell a locket to me; then I stopped him, and he freely went with me before a justice.</p>
               <p>[The seals were produced in court, and deposed to by Mrs. Cartwright.]</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I received these seals. After I had been in Spring-garden Coffee-house with two officers, one Mr. Johnson, an English officer, and one Mr. Miller, a German officer; they asked me several times to lend them some money; I had lent them three guineas; Mr. Miller came and asked me for two guineas more to save him from being arrested. I lent him twenty-seven shillings, and took these seals of him; he said he would give it me in six or eight days in that coffee-house; he used to come there almost every morning to take his soup. I asked for them; they did not come there for three weeks after. I was informed of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160051"></xptr> other officer there, that he had set out for France. I walked from the silversmith's shop; I had been several times there; he cannot say I have not behaved like a gentleman. I asked him to buy these seals; he asked me what value I set upon them; I said they had been offered me for money, I do not know the value of them; he gave me sixteen shillings; after three days I went to the same shop, taking this other seal from my watch chain; he paid me fourteen shillings for it; he saw me behave like a gentleman; I afterwards walked in Oxford-road by his door; he said, will you walk in; I said, yes; what is the matter? he said the two seals he had bought of me had been missed out of a shop in Bond-street; I said, Sir, I hope you will not think I am capable of such low things, as to take them; I would tell him in what manner I had come by them; he said he could do no other then stop me, and I must go before the justice; I said I was ready to go, for I was innocent: a coach was called; I was taken to the justice; I told him by what means I came by the seals; the justice said I was intirely innocent, but he said, that by the laws of this, country, if I could not find this gentleman out that I had the things of, I must be put in the same shoes, which alarmed me very much; I was bailed by that gentleman near my counsel; I should never let these things lie on my honour. I have been known by gentlemen of honour, character, and property. I said I would go and find the man that gave me this seal; I went and enquired for the two officers; I was informed they were gone to Paris; I set out after this German officer; I had seen him before in Holland; I went through all Flanders, but could not find him; I went all over Holland; nobody could give me intelligence of him; I left my family here; I am married to a respectable family in England; I was sure, if I could not clear my character I should be lost; I went to the Prussian Ambassador, and told him what had passed. I served the King of Prussia seven years as first surgeon of a regiment; the Ambassador said, I could have a regiment of the King of Prussia's when I got back, if I would leave my wife and family; I said, no, I could not leave my wife and children; I came back, and told my friends that had bailed me, in what manner I had done every thing that a gentleman could do for his honour and character, but could not find him; they were all very sorry till I appeared; I cannot say that this lady ever left me alone in the shop.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>This drawer from which these seals were lost; was it kept within your shop, or exposed in the window? - Within the shop. It is a drawer that is in a glass case, that is fixed on the counter.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you left the shop, and went to the coach; was this drawer open, so that he might take the seal? - No; my husband took it out, and showed him the seals.</p>
               <p>You never remember to have seen these seals exposed after the departure of the prisoner from the shop? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a watchmaker. Dr. Gabelhousan came to lodge with me in 1775; he lodged with me about a year and three-quarters; no man could behave better; he always paid me regularly every week; he gave me a guinea a week for the first thirty weeks. After that he said, Mr. Perwin, I shall be in town in England about a year longer; I hope you will make it easy as I stay so long. So as he staid a year longer, I let him have it at sixteen shillings a week; he always behaved like a gentleman, and kept good hours; he never wanted to be denied to any body. He married a Mr. Pitt's sister of Monmouthshire; he had a good deal of company sometimes, and plate and other silver things were about. I never lost any thing, nor had any suspicion of him.</p>

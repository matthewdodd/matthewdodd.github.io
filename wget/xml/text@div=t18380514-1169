                  </hi>. I am a barrister, and occupy chambers in the Temple. The prisoner Smith was in my employ, as laundress—I went into the country, and left her in possession of my chambers, in July last—while in Scotland my servant died, and on my return it was necessary to give while the things to my new servant—I saw the locks of toe drawers had been forced, or attempted to be forced, and some sheets, table-cloths, nap<lb></lb>kins, and towels taken away—the articles produced are part of my, property—I have lost nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property.</p>

                  </hi>, I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 4th of April I went to Smith's house, No. 5, Yates's-court, Carey-street—I told her my name, and who I was—read over to her two lists of property—she said she knew nothing of it—the prisoner Harrison, who is her mother, told her to hold her tongue—I then showed her some towels which I had from Mr. Murray's chambers, as a pattern—she said she had none like them—I searched, and found these towels—I asked her if they were Mr. Murray's—she said "Yes"—I then went to Harrisons's house, in Little Es<lb></lb>sex-street, and there found one towel—she said she hoped I would not tell Mr. Murray—I asked if she had been pledging any thing—she said "No"—I searched, and found some duplicates—I went round to different pawnbrokers, and found the whole of this property—I went on the 6th of April, and took Smith, who gave me a pocket-book with ten duplicates in it, which she said were for property of Mr. Murray's.</p>

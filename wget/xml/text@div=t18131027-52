            . I live at Mr. Harris's, the father of the young man. On last Thursday, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was in company with Mrs. Harris and her daughters, and her son-in-law. We had been to the Old Bailey with some people that came from Harris's. On our returning home, Mrs. Harris proposed to go through Long-alley, and call at a public-house for her husband. She did. Her husband came out and joined our company, and as we were coming up Long-alley, the prisoner and a young woman were standing in <placeName id="t18131027-52-crimeloc290">Long-alley</placeName>

Mrs. Harris and I passed the prisoner and the young woman, and then I heard a quarrelling. I went back. I then heard some indecent words come from the young woman that was with the prisoner.

               <p>Q. He had not been of your party before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him come up what did you see done - A. He said to his father, do not fight with him, I will fight him. Then the prisoner and young Harris fought. I saw them fight together about a minute; the prisoner went up the alley; Harris, the younger, followed him up the alley, and directly young Harris came out of the alley, he said, father, I am stabbed, I think I am dying. I went to him and lifted up his arm. I saw the blood coming down his waistcoat. He was taken to a surgeon in Sun-street.</p>

            . I was at home waiting for my father and mother coming home. I came home about eleven o'clock; the house was locked up. I waited at my father's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270040"></xptr>door in Worship-street; I waited at my father's door until one o'clock in the morning I heard a noise; I went up to it, and when I came up it was my father, mother, and sister, quarrelling with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. No. The prisoner was following my father; I pushed the prisoner away. There was a young woman with the prisoner. My father was quarrelling with the prisoner. The prisoner went to hit my father; I told him not to hit my father, to hit me. The prisoner hit me, and I struck him again; with that he shuffled up a dark passage, and I followed him. He then stuck me in my side. I thought it was with some sharp instrument. I came out of this little alley; I called to my father; I said, I am stabbed. I was taken to the surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. You are now recovered - A. Yes. My father apprehended the prisoner the same morning.</p>

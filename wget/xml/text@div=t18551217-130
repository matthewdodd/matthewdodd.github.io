                  </hi>. I am an engraver and printer, and live in Westmoreland-buildings, Alderagate-street In Oct., the prisoner Barnett called on me—he was alone—he asked me whether I could engrave or make him a label—I told him, "Yes"—I asked him who it was for, and his name—he said, "Charles"—I asked whether it was Mr. Charles—he said, "Yes"—be then took me outside my window and showed me a specimen which I had in my window, a machine engraving, and asked me If I could do him one something like that—I told him yes, if he brought me a copy—that which was in the window was a card—he left me, and called the next morning and brought me a paper, which he called a label—this is it—he asked if I could do him one like that—I told him, "Yes"—he wanted to know the price—I told him I could not tell, he must leave it for a few hoars—I thought it was a label—he left me, and called again about 5 o'clock—I then told him he must leave it till the next morning—I com<lb></lb>municated with the police the next morning before he called—I had I ascertained it was a Russian note—he came on the Saturday about 3 o'clock—he asked me if I had got the price—I said, "Yes," the two plates would be about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had ascertained that what he called a label was something to do with Russian notes—I asked him what was to be in the centre of it—he said there were English letters to go inside—he could give no order about that—when I told him the price would be about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he shook his head, and said the gentleman would not go to so much as that—I had not got the label at that time—I had left it with the superintendent of police—I saw the prisoner again on the 22nd Oct.—we came to an agreement about the price—he beat me down to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was to engrave the back plate and the border plate for that—it was agreed I was to have</p>

I put one black letter in, it would spoil the whole plate—on the following Saturday, Barnett came again, alone, to know if they were ready—I said he could not have the plate till the 9th—it would not be ready—on the 9th he came again—I told him I had not got the plate, but he must wait, and he waited from between 3 and 4 o'clock till past 11 o'clock at night—I then gave him the back plate, and he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and he asked me about putting some water marks in the plate, and he marked with his finger on the counter a stroke and an aught—I put him down a sheet of paper with the water mark on it—he said, "That is what I mean, only it is to be a 10 instead of letters"—he left me that evening and took the back plate with him—he came the next morning, and gave me another pound, and told me to get on with the other plate—he asked me when it would be done—I told him about the middle of the week—and on 13th Nov., Barnett and Rosenberg came together—I told them I could not get it done before Friday, it was a more difficult job than we expected—Rosenberg gave me a bit of paper which had been cut out of a note, and he said, "That is the paper I want to have the labels printed on"—he asked me to inquire what would be the expense of the paper—I told him to leave the paper with me, and he left me this bit of paper as a pattern (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—they both called again on the following Friday, the 16th, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I told them I had not got the plate, they must wait or call again—they had had the border plate on the 16th, and Rosenberg gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him he ought to give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, and he gave me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and told me to get the copy back—I told him it was at the engraver's, and I would' get it—they both called on the 17th—I asked Rosenberg whether he had brought the border plate book—he made no reply, but asked whether I had got him his pattern of the label—I told him, "Yes"—he patted me on the shoulder, and told me he had got some more money for me—I gave them the back plate and the copy—that was the last time I saw either of them till I saw them at the Mansion House on the Monday following—they both spoke English well—Barnett spoke the best, and they understood me.</p>

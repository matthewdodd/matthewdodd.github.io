I in consequence of a suspicion, marked a piece of silver wire, on the 10th of November, and gave it to a person named Davis. The prisoner was at work as usual that day; I saw him at about seven o'clock. I saw him on the 11th; I asked him whether he had any flat edges over, after the work he had been appointed to do was completed;(that was some which we had marked;) he said, no; he had had a piece of Mr. Davis, which was just sufficient for the required purpose, and no more. I then sent for Davis, and asked him how much he had given him, and then it appeared by the quantity given him, and the work done, there must have been a considerable remainder. The prisoner then said, he believed there was a little bit over, and it was in his can. We had searched the can, and there was none there, and we told him so. He then said, it was on the board. I told him it so unfortunately had happened, that we had searched both can and board, and there was none about either. I then sent for an officer. I gave him to understand that, I had done so. A few minutes afterwards, he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out the wire, rolled up, for the more convenience for putting into his pocket; I observed my mark very plainly upon it.</p>

            . I am a journeyman to the prosecutor. On the 10th of November last, I received some silver from the prosecutor, for the purpose of my keeping it in my can until I should want it. I gave the prisoner four case edges and four flat edges in the afternoon of the 11th they were marked. He could not have completed the work for which they were necessary until the following; morning. In the evening, Mr. Jackson asked the prisoner. If there was any of the flat edges left, and he said, there was a bit, which was in his can. I had not seen the can. I had seen the board, and it was not there, when he said it was. After a time he produced a piece out of his pocket; one of the pieces which I had delivered to him that day. Mr. Jackson asked him for the rest, and in a little time he produced more, in all, about two ounces and a quarter.</p>

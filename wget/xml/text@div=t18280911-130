            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 27th of August I was in a field by the Harrow-road, looking through a hedge, and about twenty minutes to four o'clock, three of Messrs. Scotts's carts drove up; Tilbury and Collins drove the two first carts, and Hawes, (who is since dead) drove the third; they were coming from Paddington to Shepherd's-bush, loaded with brees - behind each cart was a sack, which contained corn, as I thought; they stopped at the Red Lion public-house - each man took his sack down, filled their nose-bags, and hung them to the horses' heads; Tilbury had a much larger quantity than the rest; I should think full a bushel - during this time, Pratt, the ostler came up; Tilbury gave him his sack, he took it away into the stable; I waited till they went away - and did not apprehend them, having nobody to assist; they were all within three yards of each other, and followed Pratt up to the house; the cart was about ten yards from the stable; I got up and followed Pratt to the stable, then went back and laid down again - they went into the stable, and afterwards into the house; I stopped till they went away - which was about a quarter-past five o'clock; but did not go into the stable; the sack has never been found.</p>

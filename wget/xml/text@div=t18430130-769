                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Marriott, and carry on business in High-street, Bloomsbury; Lonsdale was in our service, as bar<lb></lb>man for about three months. On the 26th of Dec. eight shillings and three sixpences, marked, were given to me by my husband, about five o'clock in the afternoon—I cleared the tills, and put the marked money in—I left the bar—there was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in one till, and two shillings and two sixpences in the other—I saw Beresford, the inspector, in front of the bar after I put the money in—three customers came to the counter—I saw them served—I did not see what they had—after they were served, I ran to the tills, and there was no disturbance in the tills, and no increase—the silver was not moved—my at<lb></lb>tention was only drawn to the silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the C division. On this day I went with a gentleman to the prosecutor's house, a few minutes before five o'clock, in consequence of a communication I had with him a few days before—I was in disguise—I had been in seven or eight minutes, when two persons came to the wholesale counter—one called for a glass of spirits—a quartern of liquor was drawn by Lonsdale—while he was serving them across the counter, directly he drew it, he whispered to them—one of them put down a shilling—he dropped it into the till—the moment the money was given—he gave a shilling back and some halfpence—Robins then came in—they were all three together—Lonsdale, without asking a question, or any thing being said on either side, took a small liquor-glass, drew it full, and set it on the counter—they were all close together—Robins put down a sixpence on the counter—Lonsdale took it up and dropped it into the till—he then put his left hand into the halfpence, shook them, and never looked at his hand at all, but put some halfpence down, and took out the sixpence, and laid it down beside them—Robins took them up, and as he left the bar, put them into his right hand trowsers pocket—I went out at another door close by, and seized him with his hand in his pocket—I found 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a sixpence on him—I then took Lonsdale—in going down Queen-street, Robins asked him whether he thought it would hurt his character, or whether he could get bail—he said, "Hold your tongue, you b----y fool; whatever you have to say, say it irt another place."</p>

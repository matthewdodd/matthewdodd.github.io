I am ticket-collector at the Waterloo-station; the prisoner was ticket-collector at the Richmond-station—I had explained to him his duty when he took that appointment—there are instances in which insufficient tickets are taken—persons sometimes take third-class tickets, and ride in second-class carriages—he was in the office nearly a week before he went to Richmond—he was to collect tickets there, and if there were any excess fares he was to receive them, and pay them the next morning—the excess fares were to be entered on a sheet immediately after receiving them, and those sheets would be exhibited at the Richmond-station.</p>

I can say there have been omissions, and they have said,"We omitted to put this as we had so much;" I believe that it has been often—Sunday is a busy day; and on Saturday evening, if it is fine, many persons go down and sleep there.</p>

               <p>Richard Price. The Prisoner and her Husband worked Journey-work with me; they lodg'd in my House, and had a Room at 2s. per Week. My Wife gave the Prisoner the Things mentioned in the Indictment, for her Use; and she carried them away and pawned them, unknown to either her or me. When we asked her for them, she first said she knew nothing of them; afterwards she said the Things were full of Milk at her Nurse's. But when I bid her Husband get my Goods, he told me his Wife had pawned them. Upon this I called her down into my Parlour, and charged her with having pawned them, and she down'd on her Knees, and confessed she had pawn'd some of them at the Anchor, in White Cross-Street, and some in Barbican. This Confession she made last Sunday was a Fortnight, but, as she had Children, I was tender of prosecuting her; and she took hold of my Coat, and said she would die by my side, if I was resolved to prosecute her. Afterwards, when she found I did not prosecute her, she told me she would prosecute me, and came several times to my Door, and called out - Dicky Price, why don't you prosecute me? I was forced to come from the Tavern one Night, to get her away from my Door. The Goods are in Court, and here are the Pawnbrokers, to whom she had pawned them. I was present with my Wife when she lent the Goods to the Prisoner, and she has used them an Hundred and a Hundred Times in my Sight</p>

            , Constable. On Sunday the 10th or 11th of May, Mr Price sent for me to take up the prisoner; he called her down Stairs, and she fell on her Knees and begged Pardon. She own'd she had pawn'd the Things, and said they should be fetch'd out of Pawn the next Day. After this, she came to my House, and said, that as Price<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220004"></xptr> had not prosecuted her, she would prosecute him, for making up a Felony. * <rs id="t17400522-3-verdict17" type="verdictDescription">

On the 8th of October, the prisoners both came together into the shop, they asked for a sixpenny powder puff. There was five tippets on the counter; Donnavan stooped down; I perceived the tippets falling off the counter; Donnavan ran out of the shop and Johnson attempted to go out; the tippet was lost and has never been found; I am certain it was there when they came in; I detained Johnson and Donnavan returned. Johnson went to the door and called Sally to a woman. I value the tippet at thirty shillings.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of October, in the afternoon, I was sent for to take these two women in custody; they said they had lost a tippet. I searched Donnavan, I found no tippet in her pocket, I took her to the watchhouse and came back and searched the other, I found four one pound notes. I asked Donnavan why she did not deliver up the tippet; she said, would the gentleman forgive her if she delivered up the tippet; I said, I would see; she said, first she must go down and speak to the woman below; she went to Johnson, Johnson said, you are an old thief, and if you turn nose I will turn upon you for the gold ring; then Donnavan denied any knowledge of the tippet.</p>
               <p>Donnavan's Defence. I had two glasses of liquor when I met Mrs. Johnson, and my stomach was uneasy, I went out of doors to discharge my stomach, I never went away from the door.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence. I treated her with a glass of liquor, and she in return treated me. I went into the shop to buy a powder puff.</p>

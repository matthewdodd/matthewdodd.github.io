            , cry'd out, D - n ye, we are all taken! Put the Candles out, and draw your Swords, which they did. He then stepping back, his Coat hung by the Hatch, and several within made passes at him with their Swords, till at last more coming to his aid, he got loose by tearing his Coat, and went out again. The Gamesters <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172201120008"></xptr> follow'd'em to the Door with drawn Swords. The Mob increased, and Oaths, Curses, and Brickbats, were continually flying about. The Proclamation against Riots was then read; and telling them they had a Warrant against them, askt if they'd surrender, who answer'd, Yes, if you'll have our Swords in your Guts. The Gamesters then shut the Door, and from within broke open the Window themselves, and from thence flung Brickbats, Drinking Pots, Piss-pots, and other Things, at the Prisoners, and those that came with them. They were then oblig'd to send for some of the Guards to their Assistance, and when they came, one of'em got in at the Window which the Gamesters broke open, and open'd the Door, and they went in to search the House. The Mob then without cry'd, Now we have'em all safe together! and then threw in the Brickbats, and other Things, which the Gamesters threw out before. The Solidier then flasht through the Wicket, but that he, Vaughan, never gave him any Orders to fire. Cholmley said, that he and several others being commanded by Mr. Burt and Mr. Cartwright to assist'em in the execution of 2 Warrants, obey'd. That they were upon their Duty in aiding proper Officers at Vandernan's House, but wanting more help, and their Lives being in danger, they were oblig'd to send for military Force, by which additional strength, most of them entered the House; but that he (this Prisoner) and some of the Soldiers did not go in at all, but staid without. In a little time, Burden and Ringrose assuming themselves to be Colonels, came and drew off the Soldiers from the Door. The Mob then cry'd out, The Colonel's come, and the Soldiers are going, now let us murder the Dogs! This Prisoner then went away, and did not hear the Gun fir'd.</p>

Accordingly they went to several lewd Houses, from whence they took divers into Custody, and at last came to Vandernan's. As they were coming down the Play-house Passage, they saw Vandernan's door open, and somebody came out; they stept up before the Door was shut, and thrusting their Staves betwixt the Door and the Jamb, got in before it could be shut, they then came to the Hatch which was open too, but they were forc'd back by the Gamesters, who having put out the Lights, came with their drawn Swords and pass'd at him over the Hatch, but the Hatch being pretty high with Spikes at top, he couch'd down so close under it, that they could not reach him, but he felt the Swords upon his back. At last he crawl'd away on his Hands and Knees, and getting up, engag'd them with his long Staff, which they within quickly caught hold of, but he having the longest end, and poising down hard upon the Hatch to wrench it from them, and they likewise bearing down hard at the other end, broke the Staff between them, he then got off, and they consulted what to do, and at last agreed to send to Somerset- house for the Guards. Those within then broke open the Windows, from whence they threw Brickbats, drinking Pots, and a Chamber Pot full of Piss, with several other things. He (this Evidence) then fasten'd the Window shutter (which hung by hinges at top) and they within force'd it open again. Proclamation was made. The Guards came, and one of them said, I my self will get in at the Window which he did, and then went round and open'd the Door. This Evidence and several others then went in and Search'd the House, and found several Gamesters who had hid themselves in it, Some under the Beds, some in Closets and other Holes. While they were employ'd above stairs, he heard some call from below. Cartwright, Cartwright, come down, come down, or we shall all be Murder'd. They then came down into the Gaming Room and brought the Gamesters all with them, and those below told him that Burden and Ringrose had rescu'd a prisoner. Coming in the Entry, he heard those without cry Now we have the informing Dogs! Murder them, Murder them! Ringrose seeing this Evidence through the Wicket, push'd at him with his Sword, and said ye Dog! I'll Murder you to chuse.

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, carrying on business at 33, Bread-street, Cheapside—I was returning to my warehouse on 16th Janunary, about ten minutes past 4—a boy was at the door, not the prisoner—when I entered the warehouse the prisoner was there—previous to going in I saw a piece of cloth in the lobby of the warehouse—that is not at all a usual place for cloth—I did not know the prisoner at all—I asked him what the piece of cloth was doing outside—he made no answer, but immediately ran out of the warehouse—I caught him in Friday-street, and gave him in charge to an officer in plain clothes—the boy outside was with his foot on the step, in the act of making off with the piece of cloth—the cloth was leaning against the door at first—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it is my property—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is the value of it—the prisoner said nothing in my presence when taken in custody—when I came out of the warehouse the other boy had gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the service of last witness—in con<lb></lb>sequence of a ring at the warehouse door I came from the cellar, and found the prisoner in the warehouse—that ring indicated that somebody had come in—when you open the door it rings a bell—I asked the prisoner what he wanted—he asked me if there was any clerk there of the name of Anson or Ansell—I told him no, and he asked me whether I was sure of it—I told him I was—Mr. Rawlinson then came in, and the prisoner ran away directly—we had lost a piece of cloth the day before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 472). About half-past 4 on 16th January I was on duty in Cannon-street West, and saw the prosecutor coming down with the prisoner in custody—I had seen the prisoner before, and I immediately crossed the road and asked the prosecutor what he had him in custody for?—he said, "For stealing a piece of cloth"—I said, "I am a police-officer, I will take him in custody "—I said to the prisoner, "You have heard the charge made against you, what have you to say?"—he said, "It is quite right; I have nothing to say to it"—I found there pocket handkerchiefs on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I met a young fellow going towards Friday-street, and he asked me to go with him; he asked me to go to this shop. I went in, opened the door, and rang the bell, and asked if a man worked there; I forget the name; the boy said he did not work there. The prosecutor then</p>

               <p>came in and said something to the boy, and I ran, and they ran after me; I said, "What do you want?" and they took me in custody.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt, Council for the Prisoner. Tell the Court what you know, not what you was informed? - This piece of ribbon was missing, and I went to her, and from under her cloak, under her right arm, I shook this piece of ribbon; the next witness saw her take it, there was fourteen yards, or rather more.</p>
               <p>Court. What may it be worth a yard? - It cost one and twenty pence a yard, I am sure of the ribbon by my husband's writing upon it "21," the word and figures,</p>
               <p>"18 yards," also are his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the prisoner say when the ribbon dropped from under her cloak? - She denied it; I immediately took her into custody, I am sure it dropped from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It was between six and seven? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you had candles on the counter? - Yes, I was on the right hand, not far from her.</p>
               <p>Had she frequented your shop? - I never saw her in my shop before, I saw nothing of this transaction before I was told of it, there were four customers in the shop when I came up to her; I suppose there might be eight or nine at first, but not near her; I came from behind the right-hand counter, she was served at the left-hand counter; there was nobody near her when I came up to her, she had a black cloak on, but not a long one; I saw it drop from her, it was rolling from her right heel.</p>
               <p>Is not it a common pattern? - I can swear both to the figures and the words.</p>
               <p>Have not you sold a great many ribbons of that pattern before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Is not that a usual length? - It is half a piece.</p>
               <p>I suppose other shop-keepers mark their ribbons in the same manner? - I do not know what other people do, I never saw any marked in the same stile that that is done.</p>
               <p>How long before this evening was it that you saw this ribbon in the drawer? - I had taken it out of the window before candle-light that very evening.</p>
               <p>Was you before the Magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>The Magistrate thought very slightly of the circumstance; as it was then made out in evidence did not he? - I did not understand him so.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to take bail? - I never heard a word about it.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to the last witness, I remember seeing the prisoner perfectly well; she came to our shop on Saturday the 27th of November, between six and seven, I served her, she asked for ribbons, I shewed her several drawers, she did not buy any; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080156"></xptr> fixed on one, and asked the price of it, she took a piece with her left hand; I do not recollect the price of it, I was so confused, but I saw her put her right-hand and take a piece out of the drawer, and conceal it under her cloak, the piece she had in her left hand she gave to me; I went and informed Mrs. Bambridge, she immediately went to the prisoner, and shook her, and the ribbon fell from her; I was by, it appeared to fall from under her petticoats: this is the piece of ribbon, I saw her put it under her cloak, but it dropped from under her petticoat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You was very much confused? - Yes, there were one or two more women there, and a man came into the shop, I missed two or three pieces more; I am sure the prisoner was the person; I saw the piece under her cloak; my mistress was at the opposite compter.</p>
               <p>Was not you directing your observation to your mistress? - No, I could not, there was another lady stood before me, they were at the other counter, about a yard and a half off.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it dropped from under her petticoat? - I am not sure, but it so appeared.</p>
               <p>Which side did it drop, near the ladies, or near the door? - Near the ladies.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into the shop to buy some ribbon, and that young lady shewed me a box, that was too low a price, she shewed me some at another price, I agreed for two yards at one shilling a yard, I laid down two shillings, I thought she was gone round to cut it off, and she went round to tell her mistress she was robbed; she said she missed a piece of ribbon, says she, whether it was the lady that went out, or this lady, I cannot say, but I suspect this lady; I believe there were ten or twelve people in the shop, they took me backwards and stripped me, and found nothing at all upon me; when they came back, they found such a piece of ribbon; they kept me from ten minutes after five till eight.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Bambridge. Did the ribbon drop before you searched her? - From my shaking her; she went into a little room, and I followed her, missing other things, but no other than this we found upon her or near her.</p>
               <p>Court to Miss Oliver. You did not suspect any of the rest of the company? - No, I told Mrs. Bambridge I saw her take it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a very good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am seventy-five years of age. On the 3rd of June I got into an omnibus in Piccadilly, about five o'clock—I had a reticule in my hand, containing the property stated in the indictment—I dropped is as I got into the omnibus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am time-keeper at the White-horse cellar, Picca<lb></lb>dilly. It is my duty to watch the omnibusses—on the 3rd of June I ob<lb></lb>served this old lady get into the omnibus, and while getting in, she dropped her reticule—I observed the prisoner (who I have known six or seven years, or I may say ten) pick up the bag and offer it to the lady—he had an orange basket on his arm—she did not observe him, and when he saw that she did not miss it, he slily concealed it under his basket, crept under the pole of another omnibus, and was gone instantly—I had to order a coach on, and then went and looked after him—I saw the lady immediately after get out of the omnibus and speak to a policeman, and I told her what I had seen—the prisoner was not there on the Monday following, which is the day he is generally there—I found out where he lived and went there, as he did not return—I gave him into custody at the White-horse cellar the following day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you an officer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. I have not been a witness many times—I was never here before—I was at the Westmin<lb></lb>ster Sessions—that did not occur while I was time-keeper—it is about ten years ago—I have been assistant to a constable—I have not been at all on jobs of this sort while I have been time-keeper—should say it was a brown bag that I saw the prisoner hold up, but I won't swear to the colour—it was not at all like the brown paper bags in which they put up oranges for customers—I should say the lady's bag was made of silk, and the bag he puts oranges into is made of common brown paper—I should say the colour was not similar—she omnibus did not drive off immediately—it remained there I should say five minutes afterwards—this was done momentarily—he was gone immediately—I searched every public-house about and could not find him—he crept under the pole of the omnibus and I lost sight of him, and did not know which way to follow him—I knew him so well that I made sure of seeing him again—I did not know where he lived till I en<lb></lb>quired,</p>

               <p>but I made sure of his being there on Monday morning—this was on Saturday—when I went to his lodgings on Monday they told me he had been ill at first, and afterwards that he had gone to be shaved—when I took him to did not tell me he had been ill on the Monday—his party told me so, but he did not—he was there as usual on Tuesday—I should say he had been there six years, and if I were to say ten years—I should say he had—he sells oranges, fish, and lemons, and is very well known in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 45, Parker-street, Drury-lane—my hus<lb></lb>band is a labourer. The prisoner has lodged with me from last Christmas twelvemonths up to the time of his being taken into custody—I remember the Monday after the robbery—he was taken very ill on Saturday evening—he came home between seven and eight o'clock, which was his usual hour of returning—I fetched him six pennyworth of castor oil on Monday morning—he was very ill on Sunday with a pain in the chest—he is a very ailing man—he took the castor oil on Monday morning and staid at home all that day—I remember Mills coming to took after him on the Monday afternoon—I cannot tell at what time—the prisoner had then just gone out—Mills asked it a person named Horrogan lodged there, as he wanted him to go very particularly with him—I told him he was not within, but if he was I thought he would not be able to go with him—I did not know Mills—he did not state who he was—when Horrogan came home I told him a person had been for him, and what he had said—he went out on the Tuesday morning as usual—he is an hones, hard-working man, and has a wife and family.</p>

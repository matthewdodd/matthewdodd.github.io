               <p>I keep a private house, No. 12, Middle-row, St. Giles's, and likewise a public house. I let the prisoner a ready furnished lodging in the public house, between the 1st and 5th of May, 1789; I lost the things in the indictment; he continued in the room about a twelvemonth; he quitted them the beginning of April last: he had been questioned concerning arrears of rent; I desired him to quit the room, and he did not; afterwards he quitted the room, and left the key in the door; I went up, and missed the things in the indictment; I never saw them since; when I took him into custody, he denied some articles, and confessed to some.</p>

            . On the 13th of March I employed the prisoner at the bar to work for me; I am a Lighterman: my lighter was at <placeName id="t17590425-11-crimeloc58">Bear-Key</placeName>

Amsynk and Drusina, merchants; to be put on board a Hamburgh ship. About ten at night I went down near the lighter, and saw the prisoner in a part of it which I thought was not proper; so I went up into the crane and watched him, and saw him come out of my lighter with a parcel of sugar in his hat; he was got up Bear-Key-Gateway before I could get out of the crane; I went and told the constable of it, and had not been in the house I believe above ten minutes before the prisoner came in; I pulled off his hat, and there was sugar all round the inside of it; then I gave Mr Carter the constable charge of him; I found a bill and a large hammer in the lighter; I do not know whose property they were; I found a vessel in the lighter with the head out of it, and some sugar was littered about the lighter; I am charged with thirty pounds weight, at eight pence a pound for what was missing. I was sixty yards distance when I saw him out of the crane.</p>

               <p>I ask'd my prosecutor for six-pence to go and buy something for supper; he let me have it; I went home to my wife; then I went to see if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250014"></xptr> it was stood; to know when to call him; this is out of spite, because I summoned him to the Court of Conscience once for my money, and he never paid me a farthing; I never took a morsel of sugar in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Have you any malice to this man?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, none at all; he says he summoned me to the Court of Conscience when I had paid his wife; and the rascal took the advantage of it, and wanted me to pay him more money than was his due; I paid him three shillings more than I owed him.</p>

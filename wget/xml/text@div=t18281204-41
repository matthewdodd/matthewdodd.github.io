A few months before the marriage; I had known her husband about the same time: I do not know when they separated, but they lived together some months - I have no reason to know that they have been separated for ten or eleven years - I have not heard so; I have not seen him for the last seven or eight years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known her? A. I believe I had seen her about three years before - I had only known her this year, about six weeks before I married her; I got no money with her - I did not get 900l., nor one farthing; it was a match without money - I know of no other motive but affection to assign on my part; I do not feel myself bound to tell whether it was a love match - I believe it was on the 12th or 13th of July, that I put her into a mad-house; we were married on the 29th of June: I had the certificate of a medical man - she gave me reason to suppose she was going to perpetrate some fatal act, but whether on myself or any other person I could not tell; I did not let her out of the madhouse - I left my family to act for me; I was out of the country at the time, and my family had medical men to see her - my father acted for me; I had never been married before. I mean solemnly to depose on my oath, that before I married the woman at the bar, I had never been married - I swear I got no money from her; she lived in a house at Clapton; it was a furnished house taken for her - the furniture was returned to the person she hired it of; I visited her there - she had a servant, and her son lived there; she told me she had been married before, but her husband was dead: she did not desire me to make inquiries whether he was alive or dead - she prevented me from it; she implored me not to make inquiries as to her circumstances or history before I married her; or rather not to divulge what she told me respecting herself - she begged me not to mention any thing to any body respecting her circumstances; she implored me not to make inquiries respecting her - her history was very long.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these circumstances, which were not to be divulged, any thing relative to her having a former husband? A. No, none whatever, nor as to a doubt of his being alive; I had no reason to believe that she had a husband alive; I did not make any inquiries in the neighbourhood - I had no doubt of her having been married.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she wear stays? A. Yes - there was no money found in her stays; I never got a shilling with her - she begged me to keep her history secret; she said her husband's name was Smith - that he was executed for forgery, and that was the reason she did not wish her story to be known; I am not certain whether I asked her where, but I believe she said at Newgate - I took her without a farthing of money; I sent her to Dr. Munro, at Clapton - I continued to cohabit with her for the fortnight, and slept with her the night before I took her to Dr. Munro's; I breakfasted with her the same morning: I did not tell her where I was taking her - she thought I was going to the house she lived at; she did me no mischief - I had lived with her till then.</p>

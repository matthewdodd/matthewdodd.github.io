               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Do not tell us what happened when you was absent. - My mistress sent me out to run after them, I went and returned, and this piece of blue sarsnet had come from the weaver's just before; I took it in; I followed the prisoners, I did not stop them, but returned and went out again, and I brought them both out of a hair-dresser's shop; and coming along the passage at the hair-dresser's, the prisoner Carter dropped this piece from under her clothes.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the prisoners at the bar are the same persons that came into your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260025"></xptr> shop, and enquired for the sarsnet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you positively swear that that roll that dropped from the prisoner Carter was your master's property, and was in the shop when the prisoners came in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do you know it by? - By the number at the end.</p>
               <p>Have you examined the texture of it? - No, I swear by the number.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoners say when you charged them? - They could not speak at all.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was the hair dresser's from your shop? - About forty yards in the same street, it goes into Oxford-market, I took them into the shop, and sent for a constable, and the young woman said to the old one, see what you have brought me to now, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>When did you first observe that roll to fall from Carter? - It came from under her cloaths, either her cloak, or underneath her petticoats; I believe the young one went back to my mistress, they were taken and committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long might you have been engaged in the stuff shop, after you left the mercer's shop, before you passed these people in the street? - Perhaps ten minutes.</p>
               <p>So that what had passed, during that ten minutes, in the other shop, you cannot tell of your own knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>You say Day came back in your absence on some business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard your master give an account of that? - No.</p>
               <p>The barber's shop has a passage in common with that house; does not it lead to some other places in common use, some necessaries? - There is a passage that leads to the necessary.</p>
               <p>Carter had been at the necessary at the barber's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might she have been there? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Long enough to have thrown down the piece in the necessary, I take it? - She had thrown the paper down the necessary.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I would not swear any thing but what I know to be true.</p>
               <p>Then you know nothing about the paper being in the necessary? - The boy found it.</p>
               <p>You say Carter, if she had that piece of Persian in the necessary, had certainly an opportunity to have thrown it down? - I suppose she had.</p>
               <p>Had you left it folded up in the same package it came in? - I had taken out the bill of parcels, and tied it up.</p>
               <p>It seems very singular, that you should know a piece of Persian, which is very like all other pieces? - I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Shew me the mark by which you swear to it? - We had not another piece in the shop.</p>
               <p>That is true, but other shopkeepers had many; now this mark is made by somebody before it comes to your shop? - By the weaver; I know the number, it is two thousand two hundred and twenty-two.</p>
               <p>What does that import? - It is only to distinguish each piece from one another.</p>
               <p>Then after the Persian had been sold, the stick would have been applied for whatever purpose you chose to want it? - The stick is generally thrown backwards.</p>
               <p>Is not an old roll applied to a new purpose? - Not in our shop.</p>
               <p>May there not be an infinite multiplication of these four two's in the mercor's shops in this town; I ask you this upon your oath, without referring to the bill of parcels could you have told me there were four two's upon it? - It is always the case.</p>
               <p>Answer my question? - Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>Do you swear positively? - I swear that positively, because I had compared them with each other when I opened them.</p>
               <p>Whether independent of the bill of parcels you knew there was 2222 upon it? - I could.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear that positively? - Yes, I do swear it positively.</p>
               <p>Are there any other marks upon the roll? - Only the selvage.</p>
               <p>That is common; is there any other mark upon it? - I do not know that there is.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260026"></xptr>Did not you see the mark? - I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>Did not they ask for a petticoat? - Yes, Miss, Day gave my mistress an order for a blue silk petticoat.</p>
               <p>Did not she leave two shillings earnest? - Yes, she did, and gave me a false direction.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I went there, and somebody told me she did not live there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I submit there is nothing to charge the prisoners, and I would not advise them to make any defence, for this man had been absent ten minutes, and the piece might have been sold for any thing he knew; all that this man says is, that it was there, and that he afterwards found it in a barber's shop; how it came there non constat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Day. I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Carter called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I think you may lay aside the capital part of this case, this was immediately known; it could not be done so privately but it must have been observed, or what occasion was there for that immediate suspicion; the pursuit commenced immediately: and in this case the apprentice is not brought here, nor the wife; why are they kept back? they might have informed you that they saw it taken, which would have taken away the capital part; therefore, in my apprehension, you may find

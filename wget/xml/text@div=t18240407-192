On the 22d of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 38, Edward-street, relative to a burglary. I believe it to be the prisoner's house - it is within thirty yards of my own. I had missed six beer casks from my yard on the 2d of December, which were safe the night before. On going to the prisoner's house, the headborough, Gillen, went into the yard, put his staff into the water-butt, and found one of my casks - it was sunk being full of water. I went up stairs, and found another one in the back room, which is a bed-room - it was a nine gallon cask, and the one in the water-butt held twelve gallons. I also found thirty staves of casks, which I know to be mine by the marks on them; they would make more than two casks - they were different sizes, and might belong to four - there were more than hoops for two casks. The prisoner kept threatening me with an action; I replied that he need not talk, for I had found some of my casks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You missed them on the 2d of December - A. Yes - a man named Walker was in bed in the room where I found one. The prisoner threatened me with an action for breaking into his house, and said he would blow our brains out, if he had a pistol.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOND. I am constable of St. Ann's. I went with Blabey. I was in the back room when the cask was found up stairs. We took Walker into custody - he did not claim it - he was liberated before the Justice. I found a bunch of keys, a stock, and centre bit, in a cupboard in the front room, where the prisoner's wife was in bed - a crow-bar was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You found the staves in a room where a man was in bed - A. Yes, I saw no cask found there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you search the room alone - A. Blabey searched as well. He might have found it, but I did not see him; I was in the front room most of the time. I only saw one cask.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had entered a room in which he was sitting - A. Yes, we burst open the street-door, but the door of the room he was in was open - he said,</p>

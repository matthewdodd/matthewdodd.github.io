                  </hi>. My husband keeps a public-house in Blackfriars-road—the prisoner Quebeck is the man who came with M'Carthy on the night of 25th November—a pint of half-and-half was called for—Quebeck gave me a half-crown—I gave him the change, and put the money in the till—in consequence of something which was said to me, I took it out again and threw it on the fire—it immediately melted through the bars—I had invited the two prisoners to go and sit down in the concert-room—the prisoner said, "No, we are on business; some other night"—they drank the half-and-half and left—about half an hour afterwards, M'Carthy came in and gave his name at Driscoll—he had a glass of ale, and I said, "Your friend came in here about an hour since, and passed me a bad half-crown"—while I was talking Quebeck came in, called for half a pint of porter, and gave me a penny—I said, "The last time you were here this evening you managed to pass me a bad half-crown, and now your friend has come and passed a bad shilling"—</p>

               <p>M'Carthy said, "I have not been in before, and I have no friend;" and Quebeck said, "He is no friend of mine; I never saw him before"—I gave them both in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. This is the fragment of a bad shilling, and here is some molten metal, of precisely the same kind as the bad money is made of, and it is the same quantity as you would expect to find if a bad half-crown was thrown into a fire, allowing for what would adhere to the cinders and coals—it requires a very little time to melt these coins, but you cannot melt a silver coin.</p>

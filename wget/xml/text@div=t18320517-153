               <p>JOHN DELBRIDGE. I am shopman to Mr. Cording, a pawnbroker, in Aldgate. The prisoner came there on the night of the 18th of April, and brought this watch, on which I lent 7l. 10s.; he gave the name of John Aaron, No. 16, Essex Street - I am sure he is the man; he said it had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170087"></xptr>belonged to his father, who was lately dead; and that he had been unfortunate in life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Look at me; I never saw you till I was at the office? A. I am positive you are the man, you were taken two days after; I gave you seven sovereigns, and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is your shop from where the prosecutor lives? A.About a quarter of a mile; it was pawned between eight and and nine o'clock in the evening - he was in the shop nearly a quarter of an hour, I had several people there; I asked if he was a lodger, and put L. for lodger on the duplicate.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was he in the shop? A. Yes, and close to a gas - he had not the same dress on then; I had not seen him before, but I am certain of him - I described him to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. HECKSHER. I took him myself; there was no officer employed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there any other lodgers in the house? A. No, there is one female servant; it is Miss Benjamin's house - her brother and sister live with her - the female servant attended to my room - the prisoner might have seen I had a watch in my room as he went up stairs; I am a watch-maker, and have a great many watches there - there were four together - I missed one; I took the prisoner four days afterwards; I missed the watch at eleven o'clock at night - it was from Mr. Delbridge's description I took the prisoner; he had gone away that night and we saw no more of him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had not I given notice to go away? A. I believe he had; I missed the watch on the 18th, and can be on my oath I had it in my hand at one o'clock - he left about two in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BENJAMIN. I live with my sister. The prisoner lived there, and left about two o'clock on the 18th of April; he said he would go, and asked for three days wages, which I paid him - he had lived with us seventeen years off and on, and behaved honest; we had some dispute that day about his being gone two or three hours to Billingsgate; he did not return till near two o'clock, and then left; he took some aprons and other things with him - I did not see him go to his room to fetch them, the maid is not here; the prisoner went up and got his clothes; the prosecutor's door is generally closed - he works at home in general.</p>
               <p>MR. HECKSHER. I had been called out in a hurry; I shut the door but did not lock it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is there no one else in the house? A. There is a boy, but he had no business up stairs; he could go up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 23, Green Street, Holborn—I am fireman at the Criterion—I was on duty there on Tuesday morning, 12th November, between 5 and 6—I have a lobby at the back entrance, in Jermyn Street—I saw the prisoner and a boy loitering about—I went into my lobby, turned down the gas, and watched them behind the glass door—they passed my box and looked in, but the gas being down they did not see me; I could see them plainly—they went straight from my gate to the post-office in Jermyn Street, kept by Mr. Clark; the prisoner lifted the small boy up to the fanlight, and the boy forced his way in; I heard the breaking of glass as he went in—the prisoner stepped from the shop door and stood on the kerb, looking first one way and then the other; I walked towards the shop, and the prisoner walked towards me; I met the constable Hammerton; he said "What glass is that broken?"—I said "At the post-office; collar him; the other one is in the shop; I saw him put him in"—the prisoner said "Not me; sir; I did not break it; I have been talking to that man," meaning me—the constable took him in charge, and I went to the shop door and stopped outside; I took the constable's rattle and sprang it, and the boy ran out of the shop and ran away; I ran after him, but could not catch him.</p>

When I first saw you and the boy I was coming down the Haymarket to go to the Criterion—you walked towards me, then went back into the Haymarket and spoke to another man—I then went to my lobby at the back and then saw you and the boy come back again—you stood in the doorway of an empty shop next door to the post-office—I watched because I had an idea you were going to get down into the base<lb></lb>ment of the Criterion—the distance from my gate to the post-office is about 70 or 80 yards—there was a lamp burning at the post-office—you were not standing by my side when the constable came up—I did not call police till I sprang the rattle and then the policeman had hold of you—it was about four minutes after I saw you lift the boy up that the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 281). I was on duty in Garden Court between 5 and 6 on this morning—I heard the sound of glass breaking—I ran into Jermyn Street and saw the prisoner coming away from the post-office towards me—the last witness was coming in the opposite direction from the Criterion—he made motions to me to take the prisoner—I said "Where was that glass broken?" he said "At the post-office, and there is another man in it, take him and collar him"—I did so—he said, "What are you taking me for?"</p>

               <p>I said "I will tell you directly when I know a little more about it—I took him towards the post-office—the witness said "Bring out your rattle and let me spring it, as there are three of them in it, this man has put another one in the post-office through the fanlight"—I took out my rattle and tried to spring it but could not, and the fireman sprang it for me, and just as we got to the post-office door some one looked out at the door—I made a rush to the door—the prisoner pulled me back, and my lamp having gone out I could not see and the person who came out ran away—I took the prisoner to the station, he gave his name but no address.</p>

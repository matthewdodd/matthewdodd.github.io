On the 11th of May, I had been out, and returned about ten o'clock at night - the shop was not shut; I shut the shop door and bolted the bottom hatch, the other half was latched. I went down into the cellar, came up and sat down to supper - my brother alarmed me, and on going into the shop I found three pair and two odd shoes stolen from the window. The person must have put his hand round into the window. I went into the street and found the prisoner in custody; the shoes were produced next day; the prisoner lived about a quarter of a mile from Staines. My wife was at home.</p>

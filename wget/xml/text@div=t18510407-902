                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Elliott, a cheesemonger, of Portland-place, Edgwure-road. On 4th March, I was behind the counter, Mr. Elliott was in the shop, and he called my attention to the prisoner who was leaving it—I pursued him into a coffee-shop, in Church-street, Pad<lb></lb>dington, and found him in a corner very pale and agitated—I asked him if he had stolen some eggs—he said, "No"—I took him back; a lad went with us; and Mrs. Elliott said, in the prisoner's presence, she had missed a parcel of money—I went back to the coffee-shop, and saw a parcel on the table, containing gold and silver—I took it back, Mr. Elliott counted it; it contained six sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, two half. crowns, four shillings, six sixpences, three fourpenny-pieces, and one half-penny.</p>

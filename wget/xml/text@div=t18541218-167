I recollect on Saturday morning, 2nd Dec, about 3 o'clock, being in Charles-street, Drury-lane—Lavell was there—I saw the prisoner Jones also—he went into a house—I went up close, and turned my lamp upon his face—that is all I saw of him—I feel confident that is the man—he went into a house in Charles-street—he was no great distance from Lavell—I cannot say the distance; a few houses off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police constable, F</hi> 142). I know these two men—I have seen them in the company of each other for twelve or eighteen months, in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane—on the morning of 2nd Dec. I was in Charles-street—I saw both tie prisoners there—I can swear to both of them—I saw Jones about 2 o'clock, going into a house, and another man—the other man I could not identify—I believe Jones to be the person I saw go in, because I put my light in his face.</p>

What the sergeant says is false; he never saw me in his life; I do not know where the place is; besides, I was not there, I was in bed. I know no more of it than you do, or any one else here.")</p>

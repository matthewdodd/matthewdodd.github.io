In consequence of information I watched the side-door of Mr. Dixon's house, at Twickenham, on the evening of 10th Jan., and about a quarter to eight o'clock I saw Redknapp go in with a basket, and come out again in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour with apparently the same basket—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked her what she had got, and she said, "I have a bit of bread and cheese"—she said she had been charing at Mr. Dixon's all day, and this was for her supper—I opened it, and it consisted of 5 lbs. of bread, 1/2 lb. of mutton, 3lbs. of artichokes, 2 ozs. of cheese, and some potatoes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said they were given her by Miss Rixon, not Dixon—I asked her if she knew the cook, she said she did not—I asked her if the cook gave her the articles, she said, "No"—she said the victuals were put up for her in the basket on the table—she afterwards said, "I may as well tell the truth, the cook did give it me," and the basket belonged to the cook—I went with her and Conday to the house, and saw Preston, who is the cook—Conday asked her if she gave Redknapp the things; she said, "Yes."</p>

I received information from Mr. Dixon on 4th or 5th Jan., in consequence of which I placed Chandler to watch the house—on the evening of 10th, a little before nine o'clock, I found Redknapp in his custody—I examined the basket and found what Chandler has stated was in it—I asked where she got the basket from, she said from Mr. Dixon's—I asked who gave it her, and she said one of the servants—I asked who, and she said she did not know—I told her I should take her to Mr. Dixon's house, and she said, "Well, it is no use telling a lie, it was the cook gave it me"—I went to Mr. Dixon's, saw Preston, the cook, showed her the contents of the basket, and she said the woman had been at work, and had no sapper, and she gave her these to take home for her supper—I said I should send for Mr. Dixon; she said; "If you will give me the large piece of bread I do not mind Mr. Dixon seeing the rest"—the mutton was about the same in quantity as now, but it is more dry and shrunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Fortescue House, Twickenham, and keep a school there. Preston was my cook—in consequence of information, I gave the police orders to watch my house, and about nine o'clock in the evening of 10th Jan., I was sent for to the kitchen, and found Chandler, Conday, and Redknapp there, and the contents of the basket—Preston had no authority to give anything away, and Redknapp had no authority to take any away; she had been working at the house that day—my sister, Miss Dixon, was visiting at my house; the cook had charge of the pro<lb></lb>visions—the artichokes and potatoes were raw.</p>

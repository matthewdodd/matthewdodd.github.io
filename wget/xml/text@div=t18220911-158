I searched all over Bromley for them; I found three pieces afloat by Lowe's wharf, about two miles off - I found the other by the side of a saw-pit, cut in three pieces. The prisoner was at work at it. One of the three pieces was cut into rafters - I asked who ordered him to cut it - he said he was ordered, but he did not know who by. I sent for a constable, and got one, and found him still there; but he had cut off the pieces where the hook went on, while we were gone; which was a mark by which I knew them; he said he was told to cut it off, but he did not know who by; we left him, and went down to the water side, about fifty yards off. On returning to the saw-pit, we missed the piece he had cut off; he said he did not know where it was. I gave him in charge. I can swear to the timber by a mark, and by a rope which I had put on myself, and the piece he was cutting, was marked 25 ft.; which is the depth it was to be driven into the ground. Lowe, the owner of the saw-pit, came and asked when I missed the timber? I said that morning; Lowe then said it had been there three or four days; but I had seen it safe the day before; the tide would float them up there in three or four hours.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bromley. On the 18th, about five o'clock in the evening, I was fetched to Lowe's wharf - I found Coursey on the wharf, and the prisoner sitting on the timber; Coursey gave charge of him. I asked who employed him; he said between five and six o'clock, a stranger came down and asked if he was a sawyer, and employed him to cut that piece of timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Lowe has ran away - A. After the second examination he did; the prisoner had liberty to cut for other people; he was not employed by Lowe; he did not alter the timber while I was there. Lowe was present when I apprehended him, and did not claim it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence stated, that Lowe had ordered him to cut it up.</p>

            . He never said he had it from Lowe; but that he did not know who employed him to cut it up. - I am a sawyer. I helped the prisoner to cut a piece of this timber up; Lowe employed us about nine o'clock in the morning. I do not know where he is. I should have been on the spot when the prisoner was taken, but was gone to a funeral.</p>

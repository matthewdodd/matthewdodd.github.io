                  </hi>. I live at 26, John-street, Bedford-row, and am a leather<lb></lb>bag manufacturer—On 13th June, at night, I notioed the staircase window; it was shut—that was before 10 o'clock and after 9—on the following morning I got up about 6 o'clock—the staircase window was then open—I went into the drawing-room; the parlour and drawing-room folding-doors were open and all the silver lay about on the table, chairs, and ground—the things that were scattered about were fruit-baskets made of silver, silver candlesticks, and several dozen knives and forks and spoons—they were all scattered about—upon looking, I found to be missing Mrs. Berge's and my jewellery; several brilliant brooches, and five or six brilliant rings; and all kinds of diamond rings—at the time I thought it was only about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery, but it is more than 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—it was private property—they would go into a very small compass—I missed this knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) from the kitchen; it is my property—I am quite certain of it—</p>

               <p>I have a large garden in Germany, and I have always a pleasure in gardeuing, and a few months before I left Germany I bought this knife in Frankfort, and used it every day—I bought it in July or August last year—I used it every day to cut my grapes and other things in gardening; all kinds of things—I am sure it is mine—here is a mark on it; this nail; it is a silver mark—it is English manufacture—a week or so afterwards the constable brought a screwdriver to my house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 20). On 27th June I went to 9, Holborn-buildings, to a room on the second floor—I can't say it is a brothel—I found the prisoner in the room and there was a woman there—the prisoner was drunk, naked, on the floor—I searched the room—in the cupboard I found this small screwdriver—there was a table in the room—I looked in the table-drawer but I took nothing away at that time—I took the prisoner and the woman into custody—after taking them to the station, which was about 3 o'clock, I went to Mr. Berge's and had some conversation with him, and he went with me to the room I had taken the prisoner from; and on searching the room I opened the drawer in the table, and as soon as I did so the prosecutor saw the knife and said, "That is my knife"—that is the knife which I have produced to-day—I took it to the police-station and kept it in my possession—I showed it to the prisoner at the station—he said, "That is my knife M—I afterwards took the screwdriver that I fouud in the cupboard to the prosecutor's—I saw two marks on the folding-doors leading from the drawing-room to the back-parlour—they had been broken open—they exactly fitted the screwdriver in every way; at the point—I showed the screwdriver to the prisoner but he said nothing about it—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of a knife was the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A pocket<lb></lb>knife—I believe I saw this knife in the table-drawer the first time; I am not quite sure—it was about 3 in the morning when I took the prisoner—we had a candle, because we needed it—the court is very close; it is rather dark in that place—the cupboard is on the right hand side of the fireplace, and the table is on the left, as you go in at the door—the room is not very large—I do not know where the prisoner's clothes were, for I left him naked in the room while I went up to another room, and he was dressed before I came down again—Sergeant Chance was with me—we went to Mr. Berge's before we went to the police-court; at 7 or 8 o'clock I suppose; we waited till he got up—the woman was remanded twice and ultimately discharged—the prisoner was examined five times; he was remanded not exactly for want of further evidence, but to see if we could trace the property—we did not succeed—I am not quite sure whether I have ever seen any other screwdriver of the same sise as this—I daresay there are plenty; I have seen various sizes—any other of the same size would make a similar mark.</p>

On Thursday, the 30th of April, I went with a pair of boots into Lincoln's Inn-fields, at about a quarter-past six o'clock—my father is a boot-maker—they were his boots—I was taking them to a customer—I was passing by the end of Angel-court, Long-acre—Leader came and took the boots from me, and another man held me by the arm—I cannot speak to him—Leader ran up Angel-court—I cannot say whether the other one did or not, nor what became of him, I was so confused at the time that I did not see—it was quite day-light.</p>

               <p>JOHN EVANS. I am a stable-keeper and let out horses. On the 15th of October, the prisoner brought the mare to my stable to sell. The prisoner said, that he had known the mare ever since it was two years old. I knew Palmer very well; he brought him with him. I gave him 34l. for it. I sold it again for 35 guinease. I shewed Mr. Dester the same mare that I bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Cooke is my nephew. Palmer was a stranger to me, he cannot be found. A man will not buy a horse of a stranger, without somebody warranting it. The prisoner is a stay-maker.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLAY. I am an officer. I went with the prisoner to apprehend Palmer; he took me to several places, we could not hear any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He did not take me to any place where I could even hear of Palmer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Palmer called on me with the mare, and said he wanted to sell her, he said it was his own colt. I knew him, and went with him. About a fortnight after, I found it had been stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenhithe, in Kent, and know the defendants. Martin is a butcher there—Robert Ware works for Martin, and George jobs about—they are both journeymen butchers. On Saturday afternoon, 3rd Sept., I was standing at the corner of pay house, between 4 and 5 o'clock, which commands a full view of the, river—I saw what appeared to be the carcase of a bullock, which a man, named Edward Taylor, was drawing out of the Thames on to the shore, with a horse, on to dry ground, three or four yards from the river—I went up to the spot in four or five minutes—it was a white bullock, and part of one of the horns was sawn off smooth—I do not what that indicates—the defendants were all three there—the Wares were skinning and dressing it, and Margin was standing by—when they were chopping the horns off, I saw a great deal of matter run from the nose—I thought they were merely getting the hide, and went away—I heard Martin tell them to take care is dressing it, for it was too good for dogs' meat, and that he had sold worse meat than that in his shop—in five or ten minutes I heard a rumour—I went back, and found the defendants still there—I asked Martin if they were dressing it to send to London—to the best of my recollection, he said, "I have nothing to do with it"—I said, "It appears that you have; and if you dress that, and send it to London, I shall write to the Lord Mayor about it"—a man named Robins and the people who were helping him, jeered me a great deal, and told me to do as I liked—I went to the corner of my house, away from the crowd, where I could see what was going on—when the dressing was complete, some cloths were brought from Martin's shop by, I believe, his boy—I saw him come out of the shop with them—I could see the shop and the shore too—the boy took them down to where the beast was, and some skewers too—I saw them hang the beast up by three poles, and chop it down the back to divide it—Martin's cart was then brought, without any horse, and the four pieces, it having been cut into quarters, were put into it, in the cloths—it was dragged by the two Wares and other people past my house to the railway station, Martin following—I went in and got a cup of tea, and then went to the station, and met the two Wares coming back with the cart—I did not see anything in it then—I found the same parcels on the platform at the station as I had seen in the cart—there was no direction on them—I then went to Dartford, to get the Inspector of Nuisances—then I went to the Inspector pf Police, who took me to the Inspector of the Board of Health, who said he could not interfere—on the next day, Sunday, I came up to London, by the half past 1 train—I went</p>

               <p>direct to the Mansion House; it was then about 3 o'clock, and the Lord Mayor had just gone to church, in state, it being the Thanksgiving Sunday—I mentioned my business, and was directed to the Smithfield station, and Inspector Teague went with me to find the market beadle—I then went back to Greenhithe, and in the course of the evening saw Martin in the parlour of the White Hart—he asked me if I had been to London—I told him I had, respecting the meat—he said, "We shall do you yet; how will it be if the direction is altered? the telegraph is a good thing that way"—I said, "I understand that you have sent your man up to alter the direction, or to get it sent elsewhere"—he said nothing to that—on the next morning; Monday, I saw George Ware, of Greenhithe, and asked him why he was not going to London, because he had told me on Saturday night that he had sent the meat up on his own account, that he would bear all the responsi<lb></lb>bility of it, and should go to London, and draw the money for it—he said, "There is time enough yet"—it was then about 8 o'clock in the evening—I saw him again, and said, "You are not gone to London yet, George"—he said, "No, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> has gone"—I said, "I thought it was yours, that you took the responsibility"—he said, "No, I only said that to mislead you"—I saw Martin and Robert Ware coming from the station, between 6 and 7 o'clock that night—they had both come from London—Martin said, "A great deal of good you have done, going to London, haven't you? we have sold the meat, and got the money for it; you could not stop it after all"—after that I saw Robert Ware coming out of Martin's shop—he said to me, "A great deal of good you have done; we have sold the meat, and got the money;" and then he said to his wife, who was present, "You take care of that sove<lb></lb>reign I gave you; I have got some more in my pocket"—I saw Martin again that evening, in the White Hart parlour—he said that the meat was passed by the Inspector of Newgate Market, and he had sold it to a butcher for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that just as they were closing the bargain, an officer came from the Lord Mayor, and said that some old woman had written to the Lord Mayor, and that he, the officer, would like to see the meat first—Martin also said that he had killed worse meat than that, and sold it in Newgate Market—he also said that I had robbed them of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he had been to Mr. Pearson, at Guildhall, to prosecute, and he would spend 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before it should be dropped.</p>

               <p>twelve years ago—I was discharged from that, not for doing wrong, but something perfectly right—they appoint a high constable every year if they like; they do not discharge any of them, but they appoint another in their room—they did not discharge me—no complaint, that I know of, was made against me—there was a complaint of my appropriating money, but I was honourably acquitted without the Chairman summing up—it was only made by four parishes—there are five parishes that might have complained, but the fifth could not, because they did not pay me the money; if they had, they would hare complained the same as the others did—I do not consider there to have been any complaint against me, as it was done out of spite—I was not imprisoned at all for it—I have been imprisoned for contempt of Court and for debt too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Forrester, a coal-merchant, of Greenhithe, and have been so twenty-six years. On Saturday afternoon, the last day of September, I saw the dead body of an animal drawn out of the river on to the shore—I saw the defendants there—Robert and George Ware cut the fore feet off and Robert Ware cut the bullock's throat—I cannot say what quantity of blood came, but there was no living blood; it was black as far as I could see—the skin was taken about half off, while I was there—I saw Robert Ware cut part of the skull off—Martin was there, and said he would have it taken down to the slaughter house, dressed, and sent to London, and be would give them a note where to send it to—I said, "Martin, I will not have any more beef steaks out of your shop;" but that was only a joke, and I went away to my employment—I saw Mr. Fulljames there—I was there perhaps half an hour—Martin was there all the time I was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boatman and waterman at Greenhithe. On Saturday, the last day of September, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I saw a bullock in the river—I was afloat close to it, and laid hold of it and fastened it to a buoy—it was a white one, and apparently dead—part of one of the horns was sawn off, apparently—I did not then know what that meant—in the afternoon I went out again to the buoy and brought the animal ashore—I then went to Ware, the butcher, and asked him to come and see if we could get something for the skin and fat, and I thought we might get something for the flesh for dogs—I went up to Mr. Humphreys, and asked a man to come and look at it, and when I came back, Robert Ware said that he would take it upon himself, and give me something for my trouble.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>—on Monday morning, 2nd Oct., I went to my work as early as half past 4 o'clock, and found Robert Ware waiting outside—he asked me if I was not Mr. Webb—I said No, that I was his foreman—he said that he had a body of beef for me—I asked him what sort of one it was—he said that when he packed it at Greenhithe, it was sweet, but whether it was sweet or not now he did not know; and I was not to sell it for human food unless Mr. Pocklington thought that it was fit for human food—I asked him what sort of one it was—he told me that it had jumped overboard, and if Mr. Pocklington did not think it was fit for human food, I was to send it to the boilers, and it was to be boiled for fat—he waited a good while—Mr. Pock<lb></lb>lington had been, and asked me if the meat had come—it had not—he came again, and followed it in—he examined it, and I asked him whether it was sweet, which it was my place to do—he said, that the fore quarters were sweet, but the hind quarters stunk—I asked him to let me send it to the boiler's; he said, "No, I must take it"—he is inspector of the market—a bullock of 120 stone is such a thing as we do not see once in six months—it was very fine, with two inches of fat upon it—Robert Ware told me that the fat fetched 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a stone—it was not dressed as bullocks usually are; it was mangled, chopped down very badly—they could not chop a bullock of that weight, in a field—if it had been sweet it would have been worth 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to boil down for fat, to grease railway engines—I know Martin; he is a very respectable butcher—he has sent meat twice; once was about twelve months ago—Robert Ware never sent anything before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Ware tell you that he had calculated how much fat the bullock would make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, 15 stone at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a stone—the hide was worth 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would the bullock be worth, not for human food, hide and horns, and all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Altogether it was worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Pockling<lb></lb>ton inspects the meat every morning; sometimes he rejects meat—it some<lb></lb>times is sent up from the country fresh and sweet, and gets tainted on the passage, especially on Monday mornings, when it has been sent off on Satur<lb></lb>day—the blood dripping from it after it is cut up, has nothing to do with its being fresh.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of meat at New-gate-market. On Monday morning, 2nd Oct" about hall-past 6 o'clock, I went to Mr. Webb's, and saw two fore quarters hanging up, and two hind quarters lying down—I examined them—they were in a very bad state, stinking, and not fit for human food—I said, "This meat has been smothered on board; it has not been killed at all in any shape whatever"—I had heard from the Lord Mayor that there was a beast coming up from Green-hithe, but I knew from the appearance of this that it had been smothered; I will be blindfolded and tell you, without seeing the lungs or any part of it—this had been trampled upon and bruised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the sign on the haunch of a bullock, which shows that it has been smothered, supposing it not to have been trampled upon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would look very wet and damp—seeing the state that this meat was in at 7 o'clock on Monday morning, it could not have been in a perfectly sweet condition on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Have you not known fresh meat to turn green in twelve hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from thunder and lightning; from lightning in particular it will turn green in six hours—fresh meat will not turn green in twelve hours by the action of heat alone, without thunder or lightning—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230136"></xptr>
               <p>rather <hi rend="italic">muggy</hi> weather, and the meat would not improve by lying at the Bricklayer's Arms from Saturday night to Monday morning—it is my duty to visit the market at 5 o'clock or a quarter past, and I am sorry to say that I have taken away 136 quarters of beef in the last six weeks, with the lung disease, and mutton as well.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Fisher with you that morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him afterwards, took him to it, and showed it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose in an animal which had died from suffocation, the flesh would be more likely to get bad than another? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, became the blood is not drawn from it, and still more if it was trampled on—if a man does not mind a beef steak being tough, it would be bad on account of the animal having been suffocated, and it is likely to mortify in a very short time—if you cut beef steaks, like the savages do, out of the rump as soon as the animal is dead, it is quite unfit for human food—I should say that it is unfit at any time, if the animal dies from suffocation—if a bullock jumps overboard and is drowned in getting to shore, I should not be afraid to eat it.</p>

            . I have two Shops; I came out of one of them into the other, and I saw that Man, the Prisoner, come out of the Shop, and I saw him put something into his Pocket, it was about three o'Clock in the Afternoon .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him?</p>
               <p>King. He was gone three or four Yards, I followed him, and took these two Books out of his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him, or he to you?</p>
               <p>King. He fell on his Knees, and desired me to be favourable to him, but at Guild-hall he denied them.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Will you ask him any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask what was the first Book he took out of my Pocket?</p>
               <p>King. I took Swift's Tale of a Tub from him, and returned it to him again.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say in your Defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Them three Books were my own, I went into that Gentleman's Shop with an Intent to sell them, I knocked three or four Times, could find nobody, and came out again from the Shop; he came about three-score Yards after me, and took them from me, and swears these Books were his.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body to prove how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, my Lord, I have not.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner was known in Court, and said to be an old Offender.</p>

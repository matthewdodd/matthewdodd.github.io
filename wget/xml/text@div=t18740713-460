On the night of June 7th, about 10.30, I was on duty in Holborn—I had been observing a lot of disorderly boys and girls for half an hour, outside Featherstone Reuts—they were pushing one another about, to the great inconvenience of the foot passengers—I had attempted to disperse them two or three times—I crossed the road to dis<lb></lb>perse some big lads and girls, and saw the prisoner throw something along Holborn, and immediately after that I heard a crack, as though glass had been struck—the prisoner ran away to Fulwood's Rents, and crouched down on his knees behind some people who were standing at the corner—he put his head round the corner, peeping in the direction in which he had thrown—I went up to him, and told him I should detain him till I ascertained whether he had done any damage—he threw himself out of my hands on to the pavement, and began swearing, and said "I will stab your b----y----"—I did not catch the last word—he then delivered a violent blow on my right shoulder, and I lost the use of this arm instantly, and felt a very sharp pain in my side—a minute or two after that the sergeant called my attention to a large cut in the collar of my coat, 4 or 5 inches' long, and then I found I had been stabbed—I put my hand under my coat, and found a flow of blood—I was taken to King's College Hospital, and remained there till the 29th—I described the prisoner to Moran—he was brought in among others the same night, and I identified him immediately—I did not know him before—he appeared sober, but I only saw him for half a minute.</p>

I am a costermonger, of Fox Court—on the night of 7th June I saw the prisoner throw himself out of Jacobi's arms, at the corner of Fulwood's Rents, and make towards a lodging house—I followed him—he threw himself on a table, and said that he had done it—a man in the kitchen asked him what he had done—he said that he had stabbed him—I saw this knife picked up open; there was no blood on it—I had seen him in that house about 7 o'clock; he was in a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about some<lb></lb>thing, and was mad—he was sober when he was taken <hi rend="italic">two</hi> hours after<lb></lb>wards—a lot of policemen came up, and of course they took the wrong man.</p>

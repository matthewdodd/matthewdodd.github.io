            . I live in Bloomsbury. I saw the prisoner strike Mr. Gardener, and afterwards give the handkerchief up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the handkerchief laying by the mob, and picked it up - the gentleman came and said,"Have you got my handkerchief?" being rather in liquor I said No, but said if he would tell me the colour I would give it to him - he did so, and I gave it him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE LOCK. The prosecutor was rather before the prisoner, coming for my assistance - he pointed him out, and I took him - he said he had found it.</p>

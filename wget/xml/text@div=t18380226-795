                  </hi>. I am waiter to Martin Sanderson; he keeps the Boar and Castle, in Oxford-street, near Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner came there on the 6th of February—he was quite a stranger—he asked for a glass of cold gin and water—I gave it him—he asked for sugar, lemon, and a tea-spoon—I served him with that—I had some suspicion all was not right, and I waited outside the door till he left the room—he came into the passage, and bid me good night—I ran to the table, and found this metal spoon which I now produce, in the glass, in place of the silver one—I ran after him, but lost all sight of him—I am sure of his person.</p>

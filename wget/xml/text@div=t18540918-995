                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Beadon, a licensed victualler, in Walbrook. About 1st Sept the prisoner came to my master's house for a glass of ale—I served him—he paid me a shilling—I put it into the till, and gave the prisoner change, and he left—I saw him again on Saturday, 9th Sept., at my master's house—I am sure he is the same man who came at the beginning of the month—when I put the shilling into the till at the beginning of the month there was no other shilling there—the barman, Sharp, came into the bar in three or four minutes after I put the money into the till—I did not receive any other money after I put that shilling into the till—no other money was put into the till while I was there—I left about half past 7 o'clock.</p>

               <p>I was at the Rose and Crown, Tottenham Court-road on the 2 d of June; the prosecutor came in and complained he had been robbed; Mr. Taylor came in with him; Lorrell described the woman to Taylor and me, and the watchman; by the description we knew her, she was a neighbour's child; we went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020040"></xptr> in search of her and the coachman; I went into many two-penny lodging-houses in St. Giles's, but could hear nothing of her; I came back again to Mr. Porter's, the Rose and Crown: Mr. Lorrell and Taylor were there; they said the coachman was at the Blue Posts, the corner of Hanover-yard; I went there and they gave me charge of him; I took him to the watch-house and confined him there; then we went in pursuit of the woman; we went different ways, and one of the watchmen took her and brought her to me; I took her to the Queen's Head in Charlotte-street and examined her closely about it; she desired to speak with me in another room; we went into another room; then she pulled out of her pocket twelve guineas and a half and sixteen shillings; we sent for the coachman over from the watch-house, and he acknowledged he received a guinea of the girl; she confessed that she had given him a guinea out of the money that she had taken out of Mr. Lorrell's pocket.</p>
               <p>Did she say what she had done? - She declared she had taken the money out of Mr. Lorrell's pocket while he was asleep in the coach, and that she gave the coachman a guinea; the coachman, Sullard, acknowledged the same, and offered to put the money down again, which he did; but to the best of my remembrance I did not receive his money; he had changed the guinea; he paid half a guinea and the rest in silver at the office in Litchfield-street to me.</p>

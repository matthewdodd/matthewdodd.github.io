                  </hi>. I live at 24, Haggerstone Lane—on Wednesday, 29th January, I was coming home from my club, a little after 12 o'clock—I was in the Kingsland Road—I saw two or three men and two women there—they had got the Woman, Mary Wetherall, down, knocking her about—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—on the morning of Wednesday, 29th January, shortly after midnight, I was passing along the Kingsland road—I went into a fish shop to have a bottle of ginger-beer, and as I was leaving the shop up came two men and two women and said, "Here is Paul Sheen; let us pay her"—the prisoner was one of them—I had seen them before, but never spoke to them—my name was Sheen before I was married—I had never quarrelled with them—with that one of the women made a tear at my bonnet—I stood back; I don't wish to tell lies; and I took off my cloak to fight the woman, but before I had time to defend myself I was knocked down—they took hold of my hair and held me down, and caught hold of my throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at brother's, James Godwin Welch, a hosier and glover, in Bolingbroke-row, Walworth-road, St. Mary, New<lb></lb>ington. On the 31st of December, about a quarter to two o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop to buy some silk handkerchiefs, at about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I showed him a box containing about ten handkerchiefs, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and upwards—he said they were too high—I had occasion to get into the parlour to a lady who was buying some gloves—the prisoner went out of the shop before 4 went into the parlour—I turned my back to go into the parlour after he left the shop, and he came in again, and took the handkerchiefs off the) counter, and carried them off, box and all—a man followed him—I did not go out of the shop—I went to the shop-door, but he escaped—the hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs</p>

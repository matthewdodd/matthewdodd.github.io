I keep the Maypole beer house, Brockley Lane, Deptford—on this afternoon the prisoner and his mates were drinking there—one of them wanted me to trust him with half a gallon of beer—I refused, and told them they had had enough—I went to the door, called Bridge, and told him what had occurred—the prisoner followed Bridge and struck him—I did not see what they did, because my wife shut the door and pulled the blinds down—a minute or two afterwards I looked from the window in my back yard, and a man not in custody had got the policeman's staff—he said, <hi rend="italic">"Fred</hi>, help to get my staff," which I did, and we put them out of the yard—one of them got Bridge by the hair, and pulled him down in the coal shed and misused him—I kept one out at the gate, and one struck me—I saw the policeman kicked while on the ground, not by the prisoner, but by the others—I never saw the prisoner after he struck the first time—there were five altogether—I know one by sight—the constable was in a dreadful state.</p>

On the 5th of March I missed the articles stated—I had seen them safe about a quarter of an hour before twelve o'clock that day on the floor—part of them were in drawers—the dressing-case and Macintosh were not—at two o'clock that day the pri<lb></lb>soner came into the coffee-room, sat down, and called for some beer and the newspaper, while myself and two other persons were dining in the same room—he was taken into custody in the house, about half-past two o'clock, and a satin waistcoat and silver watch found on him in my pre<lb></lb>sence—the other clothes were lying on the table—the waistcoat was in his hat—the dressing-case was lying on the table in the bar-parlour—on opening the bundle, it contained the other articles—it waft tied in a black silk handkerchief, which has since been given up to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the White Horse public-house. The prisoner came there on the 5th of March, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, and asked for a glass of half-and-half-and a newspaper, which I served him with—there was nobody but him in the coffee-room then—I was afterwards in the kitchen, which is on the first floor, and heard somebody coming down stairs—I went and found the prisoner coming down stairs with two bundles—he was on the first-floor—he had a Macintosh on previously, and I saw he had thrown that over the bun<lb></lb>dle on his arm—it was not on his person then—I said, "Halloo, what have you there?"—he went down stairs, threw the bundle down, and ran away into the street—I followed him, and called to the cook to take care of the bundle—I gate an alarm in the street, stopped him, and a young man ran with me into Dean-street, and into a green-grocer's shop—I collared him, took him back, and gave him in charge—two or three pairs of gloves and a watch was taken out of his pocket, and a satin waistcoat out of his hat—he then wore mutaschios, which he had not on before the Magistrate—I never lost sight of him till he was stopped.</p>

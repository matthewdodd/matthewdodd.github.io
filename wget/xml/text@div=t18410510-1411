I am in the service of John Austin, a silversmith and jeweller, in Oxford-street On the 24th of April, the prisoner came to our shop about half-past one o'clock, and selected some watches and chains to be sent to No. 66, New Bond-street—she wrote this direction, "La Baron Mandeville"—I took three gold watches and three gold chains there—the watches were worth, one eleven guineas, one 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one ten guineas—the chains were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and the other 42.—I took them to the house—I found the prisoner in the front drawing-room—I opened my parcel on the table—she asked me the price of the watches—I told her, likewise the price of the chains—she said Madame was sick—she went and tapped at the door leading into the back drawing-room—she then went in and closed the door after her—in a few minutes she returned again, bringing the watches with her, and asked me the price of each of them again—I told her, and the prices of the chains also—she took the three watches and one gold chain, leaving two with me—she went with them into the back drawing-room, and I saw no more of her—I waited about three quarters of an hour, till Mr. Purday from our shop came up—inquiries were then made in the house, and the prisoner was not to be found—there is a door leading out of the back drawing-room, through which she might have gone down stairs, and out of the house—I saw her on the Monday after in custody at Vine-street station—the chain she took away was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these are two of the watches and the gold chain—we have not recovered the other watch.</p>

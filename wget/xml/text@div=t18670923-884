               <p>on that night that it came from about the spot where the house is—I did not go there because I could not trace the sound, and I had no means of crossing the canal unless I had gone some considerable distance to a bridge—if I had gone round I should have gone to another sub-division—I did not like to interfere with my brother constable unless I was certain, and I was not certain anything had occurred; it would not be enough excuse for me unless something had occurred—I have heard cries of distress in that neighbourhood, but not of murder—the Commercial Road is at the extreme corner of the left of the plan, it is not represented there—I am well acquainted with the neighbourhood, and know every street and turn of it—Rhodeswell Road does not lead into the Commercial Road—the sounds I hare heard were like drunken prostitutes—I have been in the force a little over two years, and I have been the keeper of a lunatic asylum—the sounds of distress I have heard were prostitutes crying, "You b----"that does not mean, "You bitch"—I never heard cries of, "You b----bitch, and you b----b—"—I have heard one prostitute calling another so—I never heard it on that side the water—I heard it about Christmas time, when I was in the Commercial Road, when one prostitute has been fighting with another, and I have taken them in custody—I have heard cries of "You b----b—"and "You b----a—," and such like expressions—I can recognise any of the prostitutes' voices who I know when I am on duty—I have never heard cries of "Murder!" in my life during the time I have been a policeman—I told nobody that night of the cries I heard; I made no report of it—I did not believe that anything had occurred, but I heard of a party being accused, and then I mentioned it at the station—I heard that a woman was killed, and I said that it must be about that time—that was the first time I mentioned it to anybody except to my wife.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I practise at 12, High Street, Stepney—on the morning of 24th July I was fetched by a constable, and proceeded with him to the prisoner's cottage—when we got to the bottom of Lower North Street I saw the prisoner sitting on a chair—it was about half-past five o'clock—he had a red handkerchief round his neck—I pulled it away and looked at the wound, which was about two inches long, or it might be rather more—it was not very deep—on removing the handkerchief it bled rather freely—I did not take it right off; I merely pulled it away a little—there was blood on that portion of the handkerchief opposite the wound—when I first pulled it away I did not notice the cut on it—I placed the handkerchief against the wound; I saw it was not very dan<lb></lb>gerous, and left him sitting there and went into the house—I went up stairs into the room—from the time I saw the prisoner to the time I got into the room two or three minutes might have elapsed—I had waited to dress, and it was about half-past five when I arrived—this plan shows the state of the furniture, the bedstead, hearthrug, and the entrance—I went up stairs into a bedroom on the right-hand side, and found the deceased</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230057"></xptr>
               <p>lying on the floor on her back, with her head to the wall, her feet extend<lb></lb>ing towards the door, and her arms outstretched—one arm was resting on the hearthrug—a sheet was thrown over the body, which was clothed in a shift—the head was lying on a pillow and some other things, and part of the head was resting against the rail of a chair, the back of the head—in the throat was an extensive wound, extending from about two inches below the left ear in a semi-lunar shape across the throat, about an inch behind the windpipe—it was between four and five inches long; it had a jagged appearance, and there were two slight incisions running into the main wound, one above and one below, on the left side of the throat, each about half an inch long—they were not deep: they were quite superficial—the chief wound was about two inches and a half deep, wounding the spine, dividing the carotid artery, the jugular vein, and the nerve en<lb></lb>closing the sheath—the external jugular vein was cut through; the other jugular vein and the nerve are enclosed in a sheath—the wound extended across the throat, dividing the windpipe—I felt that some of the vertebrae had been wounded—I introduced my finger, and felt distinctly that the bone of the vertebra had been wounded—a wound of that sort would produce death very quickly indeed, within a minute probably, but it might be longer—the windpipe being divided, a person could not call out—the knife was shown to me by the constable; the blood on it was then dry—I took out the blade and examined it—I will not swear whether there was any blood on the handle, as it was very dirty at that time; it has been cleaned since—I think a person inflicting such a wound upon themselves must be in a state amountingsto frenzy or madness—it is possible that such a wound could have been inflicted by the deceased upon herself in a state of extreme excitement amounting to frenzy—the blood in the throat was very dark and coagulated—there was a good deal of blood on the shift—it was dry—I did not turn the body over—I noticed blood towards the corner of the hearthrug, and blood had been spurted on to the lower part of the wall, near the fireplace; there were several large spots, some of them were larger than a shilling—they were dry—there was a consider<lb></lb>able quantity of blood on the floor, which was dry; there was also a good deal of blood extending into the corner by the door, that was dry—there was no liquid on the floor—the blood was not dry on the hearthrug, but all on the boards was dry—it is difficult to judge of the quantity of dry blood on the floor; it was in a semi-circular shape—there was a good deal of blood on the seat of the chair; it was firmly congested, but not dry like that on the floor; it was covered over with a black handkerchief or apron—I examined the legs and feet, and felt them from the toes up be<lb></lb>yond the knees—they were cold and becoming rigid—I turned back the sheet and the chemise, and examined the abdomen; it was warm—the arms were outstretched in the cold, and were becoming rigid—they were cold—the hands were covered with blood; there was a good deal of blood on them, smeared; that was dry—from the state of the body and the ap<lb></lb>pearances I saw, I think death had taken place at least two hours; it might be more—the blood on the shift and in the room was very dark in colour, but I would not give any opinion from the colour; I speak merely from the dryness; you cannot depend upon the colour of the blood.</p>

               <p>—I was the first medical man examined—I heard the evidence of some of the others before the Magistrate, but no one was examined before the Coroner except myself—I heard Dr. Taylor and Dr. Wilkes examined before the Magistrate—when I was giving my evidence before the Coroner, before I heard any of the other medical men, I said, "I think the deceased must have been dead one hour; it might be more"—I adhere to that, but I do not think death had taken place within the hour—I think what I said was in answer to a question; the Coroner asked me whether she might have been dead an hour, and I said, "Yes, an hour, it might be more"—I rather think I said that—she might have been dead an hour of course—the internal carotid artery was divided, all but a small portion of the back of it, which was not cut through.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might a person having inflicted that sort of wound upon herself sitting on a chair, in her struggles have thrown herself on her back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might fall on her back in her movements after the wound—the blood in the wound was coagulated—there was a little from the different vessels—I do not think one witness said that blood was <hi rend="italic">blubbering</hi> from the wound, I think he said from the windpipe—blood issuing from the living body coagulates very quickly—I felt the abdomen warm—the feet were cold—that might be if a person had gone to sleep with their feet exposed—you might find the coldness in a living body, but not the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>; I mean rigidity—there is a difference of opinion as to the time it takes for rigidity to set in—I was down there about half-past five—it would take me two or three minutes to examine the prisoner, and to go up into the room—I know it was half-past five, because I left my house about twenty-five minutes past five—I looked at the clock in my own room, and also at the Church clock—I stopped to examine the prisoner, and sent him immediately to the hospital—he remained there I think till 9th August, more than a week, under the care of a medical man—I should say that his condition was not dangerous, but they would not have kept him there if he had not required medical treatment—I should say that he had not lost a great deal of blood; the external jugular vein was divided—blood might or might not flow from that—I had no difficulty in stopping it with a handkerchief, but if it was not stopped a good deal of blood would flow, and it would become dangerous—I was anxious to get him to the hospital to get him attended to—if he had been left alone and untended by a skilled medical man it is quite possible that he might have died from loss of blood—I cannot say that it is extremely probable—the external jugular vein might be divided without danger to life, because coagula would form, which would stop it—the internal jugular vein is below it, you must cut through another layer of muscle before you get to it.</p>

Murder! murder!"—I got out of bed, threw up the window, looked out, and saw old Mr. Wiggins in his shirt, with his trousers under his arm, standing outside the gateway in North Street—it was shortly after five o'clock, I know that because my husband had gone to his work, and my clock struck five after he went, but I cannot tell how many minutes—I went down stairs, and saw the prisoner on the opposite side, with his two hands to his throat, going up the street—I went down to the cottage, went into the down stairs room, and old Mrs. Wiggins was there, and Mrs. Dunn—Mrs. Wiggins had blood on her hands and on the feet of her stockings—I did not notice how she was dressed—I went upstairs and noticed foot marks of blood on the stairs—I went into the room where the deceased was; no one was there; a sheet was over her—I saw a pair of women's drawers lying in a corner of the room by the side of the fireplace, with a great quantity of blood on them—they were on the left-hand side going into the room, by this projection by the side of the fire-place—I also saw a new pair of women's boots inside the door going in; there was nothing on them—I saw the wound in the neck—there was a dreadful lot of blood on the shift, and it was torn down the front—I did not feel the body—there was some bread and meat on the table, and a can with part of a pint of beer in it, about half a pint—I did nothing to the drawers, nor did I interfere with the body—I went down stairs, and saw Mrs. Dunn wash old Mrs. Wiggins's hands, and I also noticed a great quantity of blood on the feet of her stockings—Mrs. Dunn took them off of her and put on her boots without her stockings—I did not notice whether the blood was wet or dry—there was more on her right stocking than on the left—it was on the sole of one, but mostly on the ankle of the right foot—I saw Mr. Horton come, I had then been down stairs a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I went up into the room again, and, after Mr. Horton gave his sanction for the body to be moved, I assisted in moving it into the bed—I moved one sleeve of the chemise from the left arm, but could not get the arm straight, as it was stiff and I could not straighten it; and I removed the sleeve and straightened the arm—the sleeve had got down as far as this on the arm.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. On the morning of 24th July I was on duty temporarily at the London Hospital, taking duty for a friend—I was there when the prisoner was brought in, between seven and eight o'clock, I should think nearer seven, but cannot say the exact time—he was dressed, and had this red handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) round his neck—I took it off—it had been worn with this portion where the large mass of blood is, towards the wound, which was on the left side of the throat, a little more than an inch and a half below the left ear and a little behind, and extending across the throat to about an inch or an inch and a quarter past the middle of the throat—the bloody part of the handkerchief covered the wound—it was deepest towards the left extremity; it was through the skin and the tissue immediately beneath the skin, and as it passed forward round the throat it became very superficial, so that when it reached below the middle of the throat it was not through the skin—external jugular vein was divided a little nearer the extremity than the middle of the wound—it was not dangerous under proper care—from its position, I believe he could have inflicted it upon himself—my opinion is that it was inflicted from the left towards the right—there were two slighter wounds on the throat, one was near the middle of the throat, scarcely extending through the skin, and between, the greater wound and the angle of the jaw—it was only supers<lb></lb>ficial—it was about an inch, or from an inch to a inch and a quarter long—the other was above the greater wound in the angle of the jaw, and was very superficial—it was about three-quarters of an inch long—there were also some slight scratches about the angle of the jaw on the left side—they were exceedingly superficial—on his left thumb was a superficial cut across the palm surface—it could be inflicted by this knife—the prisoner remained there five or six days to my knowledge, but I was only there temporarily—the wound was healing at the end of that time—this handkerchief was taken from his throat—it is in the same state now, with the exception of the blood being dry, but a portion of it has been removed—I noticed that it was cut through these folds when it was taken from him, or rather before I took it off, and that made me take it off carefully—sixteen folds of the handkerchief are cut through—there are one or two exceedingly small spots of blood on the edge of the cuts not penetrating more than one fold—there is a slight spot on the second, but it does not go deeper—all the rest are clean, as far as I can tell by examination—the instrument inflicting the wound must have been bloody, and I should have expected to find blood on the handkerchief—if the knife had commenced with making the wound, then the wound must have bled—it was a wound which would bleed im<lb></lb>mediately</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230061"></xptr>
               <p>mediately—if that part where the cut is was against that part of the throat where the wound is, I should expect to find a considerable quantity of blood on the handkerchief.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that he put it on tighter to stop the bleeding—he said that he returned home late the pre<lb></lb>vious night, and asked his mother to call him in the morning, and had then gone into his room, and, as he had to go out early, he did not go to bed, but laid down on the hearthrug before the fireplace, and his mother called him in the morning; he got up, and, finding it too early to get out, laid down again, and the woman he was living with came and sat by him and asked him to forgive her; he refused to do so, and turned on his right side, with his face towards the fireplace, and went to sleep; that she was sitting behind him and promised to call him, and the next thing he became conscious of was some one at his throat, and he found it was the woman; that her left hand was on him, and she was using the knife with her right hand; that he struggled away from her and gave the alarm to his parents, and then went out into the street to find a neighbour, but, finding him too drunk to come, he returned to the house, went back into the room, and then the woman was dead or just dying—that was all he said—he made no other statement but that—he said that her left hand was on him, but did not say what part of him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's shirt—here is a collar to it with a small cut on it on the button side of it, the right side as worn—there is no blood on that cut—the collar is in creases, parts were covered, and in some parts the handkerchief was against the throat—the creases are still here—if this cut was made by the knife going through the cut into the wound, I should expect to find blood upon it, or if it was against the place where the cut was made—there is blood round the button, but there appears to be none on the button, and there appears to be a good deal of blood round the collar and on the back of the shirt—besides that shirt, the prisoner was wearing a flannel shirt without a collar, and a jersey over it—the blood on this shirt was chiefly on the left collar—I have alluded before to some sprinkling on the sleeve, I do not know whether I shall allude to it now—it was a slight sprinkling on the sleeve—here is the blood at the front of this flannel waistcoat—this blue guernsey has a few spots of blood only on it—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the trousers; they are marked with spots of blood on the legs, but they are not quite so distinct as they were—they might be accounted for by blood dripping from the neck—the soles of his stockings were saturated with blood, partially but not absolutely dry—I examined his boots; there was nothing to strike my attention in them.</p>

               <p>discover whether the wound was inflicted by the prisoner or by another person; that was in answer to a question—the question was asked me, whether there was anything in the wound which would enable me to say whether it was inflicted by himself or another person, and I said, No, the appearance would be the same—I heard Mr. Horton examined—I never saw the body of the deceased—I understood the questions you put to him—I think a minute is an extreme time for the power of locomotion to continue, supposing the wound to be self-inflicted; I think a minute is an extreme time; I think syncope would follow sooner than that from the loss of blood from the carotid artery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Reading from Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence, p.</hi> 513.) "Wounds of the carotid arteries are often pronounced <hi rend="italic">instantaneously</hi> mortal. A wit<lb></lb>ness may deliberately state that the person could not possibly have sur<lb></lb>vived an instant. This is a very hazardous opinion, for it occasionally comes out on inquiry, that if such a wound had been instantaneously mortal, then, in defiance of rational probability or of the strongest pre<lb></lb>sumptive evidence to the contrary, the deceased must have been murdered. A medical opinion of this kind has not only been refuted by circumstances, but by the evidence of eye-witnesses. A medical witness is then com<lb></lb>pelled to admit that his rules for judging of the mortality of wounds are wrong, and that the person may have survived for a longer or shorter period. There are several cases on record which show that wounds involving the common carotid artery and its branches, as well as the internal jugular vein, do not prevent a person from exercising voluntary power, and even running a certain distance. Mr. Clegg, Coroner for Boston, informed me that in 1863 he held an inquest on the body of a man who committed suicide by cutting his throat; the common carotid artery and the jugular vein were cut through to the bone; and, in spited the loss of a large quantity of blood, the man lived half an hour. In a case of murder perpetrated at Kingston in March, 1831, it was proved by medical evidence that the deceased died from a wound in the throat which cut through the right carotid artery, jugular vein, and windpipe. The wound had been inflicted while deceased was lying in bed. Her body was found in an adjoining room, and the circumstances showed that after receiving the wound she had been able to rise from her bed and to stagger or run to the distance of about six feet. In the case of Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Danks, Warwick Lent Assizes, 1832, it was proved that the deceased had died from a wound in the throat inflicted by the prisoner which divided the trunk of the carotid artery, the principal branches of the external carotid, and the jugular veins. The evidence rendered it probable, if not certain, that after the infliction of this wound the deceased had been able to run twenty-three yards and to climb over a gate, the time required for the performance of such acts being at least from fifteen to twenty seconds. Most medical witnesses would have probably given an opinion that the deceased could not have moved from the spot where such a wound had been inflicted; but it was clear that she had gone this distance. There was no dragging of the body, and no motive for its being dragged by the prisoner and exposed in an open road where it was found. Such cases as these show the necessity of caution in giving an opinion respecting imme<lb></lb>diate death from wounds. When the internal jugular vein has been the principal vessel involved in a wound a similar question has presented itself. The power of moving has been exerted to a considerable extent." I suppose you agree with that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you asked me whether a person</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230063"></xptr>
               <p>might survive a minute, and then you read an extract which says that a person will not die in an instant. I have heard that there are cases on record where both the carotid arteries are cut, that the person has moved to the next room and climbed over a gate, one case says survived half an hour; that I am certain could not have been unless the blood had been stopped, you have read several instances, I cannot give a general answer to them. I agree that the case where a woman had her throat cut and climbed over a low fence and ran twenty-three yards is perfectly authentic; I also believe the case in Regent Street, which is quoted, that is authentic.</p>

I can swear before God and man that I never had the knife in my hand to cut her throat or mine. On the morning of the accident I was lying down asleep when this was done.

I went up stairs again and told Agnes Oaks the time; she said, 'You are in no hurry; lie down a little bit longer.' I laid down and went off to sleep, and while I was asleep she cut my throat with a knife. I got up and went into the next room, called up my father and mother, and told them that she cut my throat; my mother and father got up.

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and have been Professor of Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital upwards of thirty years—I am the author of <hi rend="italic">Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence</hi>, quoted yesterday by Mr. Ribton—I have been in Court during the whole of this trial—I heard Mr. Horton's description of the wound in the deceased's throat, and I agree with him that a person in a state of frenzy or delirium might inflict such a wound upon herself—I have seen the knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, assuming that the wound was inflicted by the deceased herself, must the vessels have been cut first, or the injury to the bone have been done first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe the injury to the bone was done first—I believe the injury to the bone could not have been done after the vessels of the windpipe had been cut through—after the windpipe and the blood vessels had been cut I do not believe there would have been power to produce that injury to the spine.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230067"></xptr>
               <p>had the power of motion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might have had to some slight extent—death would have followed such a wound as that, within a very few seconds in my judgment—I have heard Mr. Horton's description of the state of the body, and, considering the age of the woman, and the time of year, my opinion is that she could not have been dead less than two hours when he first saw her, and I should suppose a longer period, from three to five hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that mean a person dying a natural death and retain<lb></lb>ing the blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Dying in a state of health and retaining the blood; it makes a great difference where they die quickly: where they die suddenly they die with the full warmth of the blood, and it takes a long time to cool—in my opinion the loss of blood does not affect the cooling of the body—applying my judgment to this particular case, a woman in good bodily health of that age has died suddenly, and I give it as my opinion that her body would take from three to five hours cooling, the abdomen retaining its warmth and the arms and legs being cool.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the legs and arms being rigid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Dr. Wilkes, of Guy's Hospital, and myself have paid particular attention to the period when rigidity commences, and when the body commences to cool—I say that a person dying under such circumstances might have the power of motion to some extent, but she would not have sufficient power to move a chair, or to use any exertion, beyond running for a few yards and falling—Inspector Brady brought me the prisoner's clothes and his boots; I have examined them carefully—I have examined this red hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and at the place where the cut is, there is a stain of blood, on the outer fold, which has dried, and there is also a slight stain on the inner fold, but not as if it had been received through the other fold; they are quite separate—there are sixteen folds altogether, and on fourteen of them there are no marks of blood; I have examined it minutely by the micro<lb></lb>scope—supposing this handkerchief was worn in the ordinary way at the time it was cut through into the neck and the knife drawn out, I should expect to find marks of blood on the edges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it have been that the power of the knife, or of the person using it, being exhausted by so many folds, that when it reached th'e skin it only grazed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Wearing it round the seek, I cannot see how any knife could have produced that cut without cutting the neck—I think he could not have cut through this handkerchief, and yet made a superficial wound; my opinion is that this was cut when it was off the neck, or low down from the neck—these others are cuts which I have made—the plunge of the knife strong enough to have severed these folds must, I think, have penetrated the throat deep enough to draw blood, be<lb></lb>cause it is cut at the edge of the handkerchief, and there must have been great play of the knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You heard the description of the position of the wound on the man, given by Mr. Dove, under the left ear and extending beyond the middle: in your judgment does this cut correspond in any way with the cut on the throat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; if it had been in any way in con<lb></lb>tact I should certainly have expected to find a quantity of blood in the folds—I believe one of the stains of blood here was quite dry when the cut was made—I find a cut on the shirt, but no blood either inside or out<lb></lb>side, and, supposing it to be worn next the skin, and the cut made by penetrating through to the neck, I should expect to find blood on it—I find the prisoner's stockings stained very much at the soles with clotted and dried blood—there are one or two spots on the instep, apparently</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you the soles of each stocking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they are stiff with blood; there is a mark on the lower part of the instep, a rouud spot of coagulated blood, which has fallen on it when the boots were not on—the boots came up higher than that; they came above the ankles; here are one or two spots left oa the other stocking.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now look at the boots? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have examined them very closely, and only find some dirty matter on the sole; all the upper leather is free from stains—I have examined the interior of both boots, and can see, upon a general examination, no appearance of blood, but part of the interior has been scraped and removed with the dirt, and a very small quantity of blood was found in tho scrapings derived from both boots; there was only enough to enable me to say that there was blood there—I could only find that by scraping the inside and testing the residue, the greater part of which was dirt and leather, but there was nn indication of blood—I have looked at the inside of the boots as far as I can see, but have not cut them to pieces—as far as I can see, there is no appearance of blood—I did not destroy the boots—the large quantity of blood on the stockings was at the the end, but the heel part is quite stiff with blood—there is not any on the inner heel of the boots, or only a mere trace—I examined the knife, and found blood on both sides of the blade, partly coagulated, and the coogulum carried to the back part of the blade, show<lb></lb>ing that it had been very deep in the wound—the handle was loose, and there was blood on the iron pin which goes into, the handle, but I could find no blood on the handle.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose if a person walked where there was blood on the floor, their stockings must necessarily gather some of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and in walking in that part of the house where there was no blood, the dust would get on and cause the blood nearly to approach a state of dryness; treading about on the floor would absorb a portion of the blood and dry it, and if the boot was put on after a good deal of walking about it might leave very little trace inside the boot—I never saw the body—I am forming an opinion from the statements which I have heard from the witnesses—the evidence given by Mr. Horton is very clear, but, as a general principle, I am better able to speak from what I see with my own eyes than from trusting to the observation and memory of other people—such cases do not occur very often, but I have some experience in cases of violent death—the last edition of my work was published in 1865.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I read it yesterday, I will read it again: at page 518 you say, "Wounds of the carotid artery," &amp;c. (<hi rend="italic">Reading the former extract as far as</hi> "the person may have survived for a longer or a shorter period")—that was written by you in 1865? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I adhere to it now.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Jn the case you were referred to by my learned friend, Mr. Ribton, was the windpipe severed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not—the case was read yesterday—the power of motion a good deal depends upon whether the windpipe is severed, and I believe that every case must be judged by its own special conditions; in that case, too, a medical man was called id and there was no bleeding for a long time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the artery cut and the windpipe not severed, how long would motion last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not motion, it is merely life; a person can<lb></lb>not live with the carotid artery cut, beyond a few seconds, and when the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230069"></xptr>
               <p>windpipe is cut, the gush of blood generally gets into the open aperture and the person is suffocated, even if he does not die from loss of blood—I was not examined before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that if the windpipe is severed death is instantaneous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When the jugular vein and the carotid artery are cut at the same time, generally so; I know of no instance but one where there was a little surviving; one instance I have recorded here, which you read yesterday, where a person moved two yards, a sort of spasmodic motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At page 513 you say, "There is one circumstance which requires notice in relation to severe wounds in the <hi rend="italic">throat</hi>, namely, that although a person may have the power of locomotion he may not be able to use his voice so as to call for assistance. It sometimes excites surprise at an in<lb></lb>quest how a murder may in this way be quietly committed without persons in an adjoining room hearing any noise, but the fact is well known medi<lb></lb>cally, that when the windpipe is divided, as it generally is on these occa<lb></lb>sions, the voice is lost?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is the undoubted distinction which exists, that where the windpipe is cut the voice is lost, provided the jugular vein and carotid arteries are not cut through; this applies to ordinary suicidal wounds, where the carotid artery and jugular vein generally escape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "Such cases as these show the necessity of caution," &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">at before, down</hi> to "considerable extent?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but in that case the windpipe was not wounded, nor the carotid artery cut—I think great caution ought to be used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that the injury to the bone was done first; might not the knife have been plunged into the neck with such violence as to reach the bone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The injury was in a different situation, as I gather, and there had been a stab down there first—the first plunge of the knife might have done it if done by another person—the knife might be plunged in with such force as to injure the bone, which, was injured—when I say that I agree with Mr. Horton that a person in frenzy or delirium might inflict such a wound, I refer to unnatural strength, and to mental infirmity also—such a degree of force was used that nothing but frenzy, delirium, or the act of an insane person would give; in fact delirium and frenzy are kinds of madness; they give spasmodic strength.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In cases of suicide, are not wounds often of a very fearful character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but not involving the spine and vessels.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see the deceased about half-past seven on that morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she had been moved on to the mattress—in laying her out on Thursday morning I tore her shift—this is the shift that is covered with blood—she remained in it till the next morning—I tore it to get it off her right arm—I rather think it was off the other arm—I was forced to tear it because I could not raise the weight of her body—it was made to open a little in front; there was a small place to open, but whether there was a flap to it I do not know—I tore it down the middle, nearly to the bottom; there was no other tear in it that I noticed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you can tell by looking at it whether it has a flap in front? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might—I did not tear it quite to the bottom, but I am not sure there was only a slit in the frout before I tore it fur<lb></lb>ther—I think it was torn in front, and I tore it more to get it off.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not much; I was not well acquainted with her—I have spoken to her—I was there the night previous—I never heard her use the expression, "I feel I could make away with myself"—I never spoke to her till the night previous—</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. TAYLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment would the blood spirt out in such quantity as to produce what you have seen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would de<lb></lb>pend on the position of the person making the blow—if the person was behind I should expect not, but if the person was in front it would; the moment the carotid artery was cut the blood would spirt out—there might be some in front of the clothes of the sufferer if standing up, or on each side of the neck if lying down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I can say that I am entirely innocent. I never lifted my hand or finger to her till I found her cutting my throat; I shoved my hand up and got my thumb underneath the knife and got it cut. I tried to halloo, but could not. I took my handkerchief off and went out of the room, and I saw her drawers and put them to the wound. I went into my mother and father's room and gave the alarm. When I went into the room again she was sitting against the wall, with blood coming out of her windpipe as thick as my finger. I was in my stocking feet, which is the reason of their being saturated. I put my shoes on, which laid under the table, and went down stairs, went into the street, and Dillon was looking out at the window. The deceased was not laid out on the hearthrug; I will be on my oath before God and man she was lying with her back against the wall, and as the blood came from her so came her body down, and there I left her; her head was at the side of the chair. I went out of the room, and she was sitting on her bottom, her legs not stretched out at all. There was no pillow, only my jacket, which had been on tho hearthrug, with a lot of blood on it. When she got out of bed and asked me to forgive her her shift was not torn. She had pawned and sold every<lb></lb>thing she could make a penny of. I never accused her of anything, and never struck her till Saturday. When she asked me to forgive her I told her I could not, and she said, "I will tell you all I have done." I can be on my solemn oath I never had the knife in my hand from when I had my supper over night till my mother saw me pick the knife up. I said, "Oh! mother, here is the knife she has done it with," and put it on the table. I can be on my solemn oath, if I die to-morrow, I am not guilty of the death of Agnes Oaks.</p>

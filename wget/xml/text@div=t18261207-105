            . I am the wife of Samuel French- we live in Earl-street, Lisson-grove. On the 20th of November I was in the street with my child, who was crying - the prisoner asked what was the matter; I said she wanted to go into a yard, and she asked me to go into her yard; I went in, and put down a bundle, containing these articles, at the privy door; I saw her take them - I followed, and had her taken; the officer, who has the property, is not here - he said, in the prisoner's presence, that he had found them under her bed - it was my bundle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. J. H. ALLEY. Q. Were you ever in her house before? A. No. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She went into my yard; I did not see her for half an hour, and know nothing of the bundle - she was drunk.</p>

            . I am a soldier. On Saturday the 3rd of June me and my comrade were walking up Fleet-market, just before we got to Turnagain-lane, my comrade said, look there: I saw the two prisoners, one of them had a blue coat on, he had a piece of quilting waistcoating under his arm, his name is

            ; the piece was sticking out at the end of his coat; the other was not walking far distant behind him; my comrade and I proceeded up the lane after them; they turned their eyes upon us and hastened; we followed them up the lane into Skinner-street, and they went down Snow-hill; I halloaed out halloa; he threw down the piece and made his escape; Dennis, that was walking behind him, went immediately and picked it up; I ran up to Dennis, who had picked it up, and collared him; he immediately struck me and dropped it; I called for assistance; my comrade picked up the piece and followed me on the other side; some person standing by said do not let him go; there was a constable fetched in a minute; the constable came and took him to his house; he asked me to put my name to the piece, which I did; he then took him to the Poultry compter. After we took the prisoner to the compter the constable went to a place with an anchor over the door, at the bottom of Fleet-market; I believe it belonged to them; we were going home; we met Dunning that had the piece first in Cloth-fair; we followed him till he halted at the Catherine Wheel, Bridgewater-gardens; my comrade kept sight of him while I went for a constable.</p>

               <p>Q. You were with Mumford - A. Yes; we were both together. I can only state what my comrade has stated; I know that to be truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it - A. Between five and six o'clock, on the 3rd of this month; as we were coming down Fleet-market, I saw these two men coming across the green market; the prisoner Dunning, in the blue coat, had the piece under his arm, he was making towards Turnagain-lane; I said to my comrade, look here; we followed them up Turnagain-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they are the men - A. Yes, I am certain these are the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the property drop - A. Yes, and I saw the other pick it up; my comrade ran towards him that picked the quilting up and collared him; he dropped the quilting, and struck my comrade in the face; my comrade called for assistance; some gentleman called do not let him go; I picked up the piece of quilting; a constable came up immediately. We afterwards met Dunning in Long-lane, we followed him till he went into the tap-room of the Catherine Wheel, Bridgewater-gardens; I kept him in sight while my comrade fetched a constable; I am positive that is the man that threw the piece of quilting down, and the other man picked it up.</p>

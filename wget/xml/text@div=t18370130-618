                  </hi>. I am an operative smith, and live in Providence-place, Cambridge-row. On Sunday night last I was in Whitechtpel, and met the prisoner—I had not been drinking—I proposed to accompany her home—she said it was at Westminster—we took a cab in St. Paul's Church-yard—I went to a room which she represented to be hers—she said it was Pye-street—we had some eatables in going home, and there was a pot of beer brought, but we could not drink—we drank nothing in the room—I considered myself perfectly sober—I took my trowsers off—I had my rule in my right-hand pocket and my purse, containing two sovereigns and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I felt the other things when I took them off—I deposited them under my head—the money was safe when I was paying for the refreshment we had—I went to bed—I awoke between four and five o'clock in the morning—I think I went to bed about three o'clock—the prisoner did not come near the bed—she was up busy in making a fire—I expected her to come—I had not given her any money—she had asked me what I intended to give her—when I awoke, about five o'clock, she had made her exit, and I found my money and property had been taken, with the exception of my rule—I found a policeman in Strutton-ground—I directly afterwards went home towards Whitechapel, and met this girl about the place that I started from with her the night before—I am certain she is the person—I gave her in charge.</p>

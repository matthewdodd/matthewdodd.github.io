                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Park Place, Kilburn, in the Parish of Willesden—on Thursday night, 24th January, about 11. 50, I went to bed leaving everything safe and shut up, as far as I can remember—about 5 o'clock in the morning I was awoke by the constable, and came down—I found that the house had been broken into through the closet window on the ground-floor—that had been all right at night, I believe—I found the front door open; that must have been opened from the inside—there was a chair in the passage, which had been taken out of the parlour, and used in unbolting the door—I missed two overcoats, a jacket, a shawl, two scarves, a pair of trousers with four copper coins in the pocket, a pouch, a meersohaum pipe, and a shirt—I have since seen the whole of the property, with the exception of an overcoat—the value of the articles is about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

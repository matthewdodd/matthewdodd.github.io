For about ten days before 29th July, I and three other constables were watching the Red Hart public house, Fetter Lane, and also No. 7, John Street, Clerkenwell, where Hughes and Kite lived (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>), and saw Hughes and Kite go out daily and go to the Red Hart—they always left in the morning and stayed at the Red Hart till night, coming out at intervals to get food—I saw numbers of people who I knew in communication with them, one of whom was the prisoner Williams, who has just been tried, and the others were people who I had seen at police courts charged with uttering bad money—I saw them go to the Red Hart on 29th July; they were in and out till 3 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—Reede and Kent entered the Red Hart between 3 and 4 o'clock, while Hughes and Kite were there—they all spoke together, and Kite went out somewhere and returned and spoke to Reede and Kent, who remained together some little time, and a man not in custody came to the door of the Red Hart, looked up and down the street, nodded his head, and Kent and Reede immediately left the house—a policeman followed them down Fetter Lane and Fleet Street to St. Clement's Church in the Strand, where Reede passed to the left side of the road, and Kent remained in the right—I took Reede, and said "I want what money you have about you"—he said "I have got no money," and commenced struggling—I said "Let's have it"—he thrust himself out of ray arms and his hand went to his mouth—I saw some florins in his mouth, pushed him into a tailor's shop, caught him by the throat, and said "If you don't spit them out I will choke you"—he got from my grasp again, and I believe he swallowed them, as he did not spit them out—he then submitted to be searched, and I found only three half-pence on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge, and am a general merchant. I employed the prisoner to pawn some silk goods for me at Mr. Upsall's, on the 13th and 14th of June last—the first parcel was four hundred yards, pawned for about 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the latter parcel was rather more—the prisoner gave the duplicates into my hands—they have never been out of my hands—they are in the name of "John Taylor, by Shields"—the prisoner had no right to have any money upon them, but as pledges—he had no right to redeem them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you state before the Magistrate that they cost you 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—it will appear by the invoices, that they cost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-yard? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> This cost near 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I have not had the invoices for months—we were not in partnership—he had no interest in the business—he was employed as a friend—I did not think it a re<lb></lb>spectable way of raising money myself—he never pawned any thing for me before, to the best of ray recollection—I remember giving him some guns to pawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. We jointly took the premises at No. 12, Diana-place, New-road, in October, 1833. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You took them, I did not—I do not owe you any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you deny that your agreement and mine was to take that house, and if the officers of the Excise should come and find the illicit still, I should stand forward, and you would keep back, and supply me with money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You carried on an illicit still; I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you supply him with money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—if there had been any profit, I should probably have received it—all connexion ceased between us at the end of May last year, and what money I lent him, I considered lost, and <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> gone—I was not in partnership with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you and I take a public-house in John-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I advanced money to John Lynch to take the house—the pri<lb></lb>soner introduced me to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There was a partnerhip between the prosecutor and myself, and the profits were to be equally divided between him, and Lynch, and me—with the money we got for these silks, we took the house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was no partnership whatever—I know the whole gang of them, and I shall rout them out—the prisoner stated last year, that he had no claim on me—and in January last he went and took these goods—he got a per<lb></lb>son to personate me, and to state that I had lost these duplicates.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110194"></xptr>
               <p>goods, and he signed these affidavits that the duplicates were lost or mis<lb></lb>laid—I gave him the goods in the prisoner's presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the prosecutor. I went with the pri<lb></lb>soner to pawn the last parcel of goods—I received the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and handed it to Mr. Taylor, and the prisoner handed him the duplicates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He always knew me and Mr. Taylor to be in partnership. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not know how you were situated, whether partner or servant—I did not consider you a partner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he not to be a partner when Taylor was in difficulties, and bear the brunt then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never understood it so—I never knew any thing about it—the prisoner was sent to prison for being found at work in the illicit still, on the premises—he acted as a manager there—I never saw Mr. Taylor but once there—I am a clerk, and have 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I know there was a still carried on, but how I do not know—I believe the prisoner never used Taylor's name.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, in a long address, stated that the prosecutor and himself were engaged in various transactions together, but made no allusion to the charge in question.)</p>

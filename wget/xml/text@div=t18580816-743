                  </hi>. I am a shipping agent, of 86, Fenchurch Street. On 21st July, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Leadenhall Street, walking along by myself, and met the prisoner in company with another female, named Vining, who is not in custody. One of them, I can't say which, asked me for something to drink—I took them across to the Sussex Tavern, and gave them some ale. Directly after we came out, I felt a jerk at my watch chain—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket, with two guards attached to it—I immediately missed my watch, and called out to a policeman on the opposite side—the women had not time to get away—the policeman was directly opposite, and he came and seized them. I heard the prisoner throw the watch down an area grating, where it was after<lb></lb>wards found—I heard it go down; I did not see it go. I gave both the women in charge. I saw my watch again before the magistrate; it cost 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You knew the other woman, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: I had seen her before; I have not frequently been with her. I did not see you with my watch in your hand, or see you throw it away. The other woman was not so close to me as you were. I had been drinking; I was not drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you at all intimate with the other woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I only knew her by walking up and down Leadenhall Street—I have been in company with her on several occasions, so far as giving her something to drink, and she never offered to take anything from me. The prisoner was a stranger to me, and she was the nearest to me at the time this happened—we were all three on the grating at the time I heard the watch drop—I don't think it could have been dropped by the other woman—she was dis<lb></lb>charged before the Magistrate—the prisoner declared that the other knew nothing about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said I knew nothing about her. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, you said the other knew nothing about it—that was in the morning, before the Lord Mayor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 585). I was on duty in Leadenhall Street on the morning of 21st July—I saw the prosecutor, the prisoner, and ano<lb></lb>ther woman come out of the Sussex Tavern, and go down Leadenhall Street just before me—when they got to the bottom they all three stood on the area grating. The prosecutor sung out to me, "Policeman, I have lost my watch"—I went across and he said, "This is the young woman that has got my watch," pointing to the prisoner. I got hold of her right hand, and she took it in her left hand and threw it down the area before my face—I said, "There is your watch down the cellar"—I told Turner to go and get it. I took both the women into custody. The prisoner said, "You would not have had the watch if the other one had been as sharp as me."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you say to the other woman, "<hi rend="italic">Gipsy</hi>, we have you <hi rend="italic">to rights</hi> this time;" and did not she say, "Not exactly"?✗ <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I said nothing of the sort—I knew nothing of her.</p>

By virtue of which he was apprehended in his House, his Closet search'd, and a quantity of Papers found with double 6 Penny Stamps upon them, which were suspected to have been Counterfeit; as likewise a Puncheon, by which the said Stamps were made. The Prisoner did not deny but those things were found in his Possession; and likewise that he had uttered divers Parcels of Paper impress'd by the said Puncheon; and besides his own Confession, a quantity of Paper impress'd by the said Puncheon was produc'd in Court, and prov'd to be uttered by the Prisoner. But the whole Tryal turning upon this Point, of the Prisoner's making use of the said Puncheon, knowing it to be a Counterfeit one. The Evidence for the Queen produc'd several Quires of Stamp'd Paper in Court, that bad been made use of formerly in Evidence to convict several Persons; which Stamps were compared with the Puncheon, and found to agree exactly with it. It farther appear'd that the said Puncheon was compared with those made according to the Proclamation, and those used in the Stamp Office, and was found to disagree from them all. The Prisoner, in his Defence, alledg'd, that he made use of the Puncheon as appropriated to the Use of the Office, and not as a Counterfeit one; and produc'd Evidence, who prov'd that the Puncheon was return'd to the Office, (by one Mr. Harris, deceas'd, formerly a Commissioner of the said Office) and with it a Crown Stamp, a Half Crown Stamp, and a Six Penny Dye, which were laid before the Commissioners, and given by them into the Charge of the Secretary, and were by him wrap'd up in a Paper, in which Paper he inserted the several Particulars, and after sealing up with the Commissioners Seals, deposited in a Scrutore belonging to the said Office, from whence the Prisoner took them; he as well as the rest of the Commissioners having each of them a Key, by which they could have access to any thing in it at pleasure. The Secretary being ask'd, whether he was told by Mr. Harris that the said Puncheon was a Counterfeit one, reply'd, that he gave him no such Information, neither did he take it to be a Counterfeit one, for if he had he should have made a Remark upon it when he laid it up.

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Briggs; on Tuesday, the 28th of February, the prisoner was sent for pollard, and brought it home between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; there were six quarters, which is twelve sacks; one was shot in the bin, and two set in the sacks, at the end of the bin, in the stable; and the other nine carried into the granary, just across the yard; I saw them unloaded about four o'clock; I cannot say to half an hour; the next morning, when my master and I looked the pollard over, we missed one sack out of the stable; my master was very particular, and made me measure that out of the bin; he had given a strike and a half, or two strikes, to the horses, and the rest was there; then we looked in the granary, to be sure it was not there; and there were nine and no more; about half an hour afterwards, I went to Mr. Howard's, just opposite, across the road, and he shewed me a sack of pollard standing in his house; the sack was marked G. and M. Martin; there are two brothers partners; the sacks were very much marked, and this was marked like them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You knew Mr. Martin? - A. Yes, one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. They supply a great number of farmers in your neighbourhood with pollard? - A. Several farmers deal with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Howard here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear to the pollard? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I know the prisoner; he was carter to Mr. Briggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever employ him to bring any pollard from Mr. Martin's? - A. Yes; on the 27th of February he came to me, and told me he was going the next day to the mill, for pollard, and asked me if I wanted any; I told him he might bring me one sack of a bettermost sort of pollard, and I gave him 8 s. on the tap-room table, to pay for it; I used to pay 8 s. for it; on the 28th, between five and six in the evening, he brought it; I was at home, but I did not see him bring it; he came to me from the bar, and told me pollard was fell, and returned me one shilling; I gave him sixpence and a pint of beer for his trouble in bringing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Briggs know that you were employing his carter? - A. I don't know that he did; I had employed him before, and several neighbours round he had brought pollard for besides me; my wife is here, she saw him bring the sack of pollard; Mr. Briggs and Hogsflesh came the next morning, and saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It is not at all unusual for the servant of a neighbour's team, when he goes to the mill, to bring some pollard for the neighbours? - A. Yes, it is a general way.</p>
               <p>Q. And he had brought many times for you from the same mill? - A. Several times; I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no secret of this? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: On the 28th of February, the prisoner brought the sack of pollard on his back; he did not come into the house, but took it to the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the pollard and the sack that Mr. Briggs and Hogsflesh saw? - A. Yes, my husband gave him eight shillings the over night to bring it, and he returned one shilling the next night; we always paid ready money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time was it when he brought it? - A. It was day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. And you live directly opposite Mr. Briggs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Briggs.) Do you understand the marks of Martin's sacks? - A. They are generally very full of marks with his name, 
and the sack that was found at Howard's was marked in the same way.</p>

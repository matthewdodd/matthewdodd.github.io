                  </hi>. I am a currier, of 30, West Street—I was near Wichelo's shop—I saw the prisoner come out, and saw Mrs. Wichelo come out, calling "Stop, stop, this is bad"—the prisoner turned round, as if to see whether there was anyone about, and then went on rather quickly, and then commenced running—I ran after him and stopped him—he said, "What do you want with met"—I said, "You have passed a bad two shilling piece, and I shall take you back to the shop"—I was going to lay hold of him, but he struck me in the face and knocked me down, and got away—I pursued him a second time, he was stopped after I had followed him about 200 yards—a man got hold of the collar of his coat—he struggled and we all three fell, and he got away again, after butting me three or four times in the mouth with his head, and loosening my tooth—I called out to a number of men to assist me, and said I was a special constable, as I was, but they would not—they said they hoped he would get away because he was a plucky one—I pursued him again for 300 or 400 yards, and then from exhaustion he had to give in—I got up to him, two constables came, and he was taken into custody—I sat down on a door step exhausted, and I saw a motion of the prisoner's arm, like throwing something away—I did not see anything fall from his hand, but I heard the sound of money.</p>

On 4th March, I saw the prisoner running, and several persons after him, crying "Stop thief"—I followed, and when I came close to him he stopped—the last witness came up immediately after, but was so exhausted he was not able to speak—I told the prisoner I should detain him and see what he was wanted for—when Linus was able to speak he said he had passed a bad two shilling piece in a house in High Street—the prisoner put his hand in his trousers pocket and threw away several pieces, some coppers and four white pieces, similar to this in size—some boys came up and ran away with them, and nothing was left but 31/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—there were a good many people about, close upon 100—I took the prisoner back to the shop, and received this florin from Mrs. Wichelo—I found two penny-pieces on the prisoner at the station.</p>

               <p>How did you know it was the lead belonging to the church? - It was the same I have seen I suppose hundreds of times, and I have a piece which I found under the porch, and another piece where it was fastened to, that fits; I have swore to it.</p>
               <p>Yes, but we must know why? - Because from the nature of the lead, and it fits so exactly the fastenings, these are what I found in Wingfield Plain; these two ends, one I picked up under the porch, and the other I took from the top of the porch, and they fit the nail holes of the lead which I found on Wingfield Plain.</p>
               <p>(The lead handed to the Court.)</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Prisoner. How can you have the face to say that? I said I was going to sell the lead; you never asked me; Mr. Strike and Mr. Milton behaved like gentlemen, I resolved them every question.</p>

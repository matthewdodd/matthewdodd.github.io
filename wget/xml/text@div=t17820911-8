            , Clerk, sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the two prisoners at the bar?</p>
               <p>I cannot say that I know the prisoners. On the 7th of August I had been out of town with my wife and daughter to dine with a family on Epping Forest. We were returning in the evening, at about half past nine or a little more, we were stopped coming down <placeName id="t17820911-8-crimeloc44">Islington Hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17820911-8-crimeloc44" type="placeName" value="Islington Hill"></interp>
                  <interp inst="t17820911-8-crimeloc44" type="type" value="crimeLocation"></interp>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t17820911-8-off40 t17820911-8-crimeloc44"></join> by several footpads; we had passed thro' the turnpike a very few yards, I suppose thirty or forty yards: the doors of the post-chaise were opened at one moment by a man on each side, they demanded our money and watches: the demand was made with circumstances of a very alarming nature indeed, for their language was exceedingly dreadful, by the man that opened the door on my side, that demanded my money, I gave him for answer, he should have it in a moment, I begged him in the meantime not to alarm the ladies; I put my hand into my right pocket, and pulled out my money, gave it him; he was disatisfied with it. I gave him full 4 l. I cannot tell exactly what it was, I gave him above 4 l. between 4 l. and 5 l. He said damn you, you rascal, you have not given me all your money, and having a hanger in his hand, he pulled back his hand in the action of going to stab me, and with a great deal of force. I begged him not to injure me, for I had given him all my money, and he should search me if he pleased. He was still discontented, but he forbore then to strike me; he called out to the man that was with my wife on the other side of the chaise, Damn you Jack, what are you about, search the seat, for he has not given me all his money. The man replied, I will be with him presently. A very few moments passed, in which the man that had taken my money was proceeding to look at it in his hand; he told me I had given him nothing but silver; I assured him he would find gold, and I hoped he would be satisfied. He asked me then how much there was - I told him I seldom knew exactly how much I had in my pocket at any time.</p>
               <p>During this time, the man at the other side had been rifling the ladies of what he could get; and that man came round to my door, I believe the same man; by which time, the person who had taken my money had looked at it, and I fancy knew what he had got. I then saw a new face present himself at the door, who I believe to be the man that had been on the other side; and at that instant that I saw this new face, I saw the man retreat a step back, that was the man that had come from my wife's side of the chaise, and he lifted up a hanger, I believe with both his hands, and he seemed to lift it up with very great might. I had not time or space to escape any blow; my right hand happened to be across the door, which was open, and he levelled at my right hand, and instantly, in the same moment in which I saw him retreat back and lift up the hanger, I felt the blow across my hand in the wrist, and instantly my hand dropt down. He cut it half through; he said not a word to me before the blow nor after; nor was a word said to me by any of the parties: they retreated behind the chaise.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110014"></xptr>Feeling myself in this situation, I said to my wife, he has cut my hand off. It was very fortunate for me that we were not above a mile from my own house. If I had been kept five minutes longer in the chaise I must have died, if I could not have had relief.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you form any guess about the prisoner at the bar? - That will put me under the necessity of troubling your Lordship how I came to be the prosecutor in this indictment. These men came forward, first by the evidence of an accomplice, and then by their own confession.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the name of the accomplice? - Milbourne my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was it that they made this confession? - They were taken up at Justice Willmot's office. I was sent to by the magistrate after the first Wednesday that they were brought there. There I saw the witness Milbourne and these two prisoners at the bar; they were under examination for a charge of murdering Mr. Hurd: when that charge was done with, the prisoner Caddie spoke thus to the magistrate; I know I am a dead man, therefore I care not what evidence is sworn against me; but there is a gentleman in court whom I know very well, and who has committed to Newgate two persons for a fact they are not guilty off, which fact he said was committed by himself, Stunnel and Milbourne.</p>
               <p>Did he say this in the hearing of Stunnell? - Yes my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did Stunnell say? - He confessed the same thing. I begg'd the magistrate to suffer me to interrogate them, having a good many doubts on my mind which I wished to clear up by the manner of my examination; and, my Lord, I did examine them one after another, in that way you may suppose a man may do that had some idea that this might be a game played upon him in the examination, with the the greatest care and caution I could bring it forward. They instantly and without hesitation disclosed to me in their answer every minute circumstance that passed in that robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you examine them separate? - They were in the room together, but I examined them one after another to the parts of the transaction which I knew each man, if he was concerned, could be able to answer. I should further acquaint your Lordship, that previous to my coming, the examination of the evidence Milbourne had been taken on paper, and before he had been brought forth with the others, and after these two prisoners had voluntarily and minutely confessed in their answers to me every circumstance, the confession of Milbourne taken before, was then read, and they agreed that it was true: one circumstance alone my Lord, has hung on my mind, I always supposed there were more in number, my wife supposed the same, and the post-boy concurred in the idea. In our idea there were five.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you found that belief upon, were there more than three that acted in the robbery? - As to myself I could not take upon me to speak, because I saw but the man at each door; but my wife saw them come up to meet the chaise just a moment before they stopped, and she thinks she saw five hats, and the post-boy thought the same; and these men persisted in it to me that there were but three.</p>
               <p>MILBOURNE sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the two prisoners? - Yes Sir, the two prisoners and myself met that evening, in order to go out on the road; I believe on Wednesday evening, we had not been gone out long before we came to the city-road: there we saw a post-chaise and pair going towards Islington. On which we agreed to let it go over Tottenham Court-Road, and there to stop it; but before it came to Tottenham Court-Road, thinking we might be seen going through Battle-bridge, we stopped it about fifty or sixty yards below the turnpike. I stopped it, Caddie went to the right-hand door, Stunnell to the left, Caddie demanded the gentleman's money, and told him if he made any noise he would cut him; and the gentleman kept talking: the gentleman gave them his money, which Caddie looked at; Caddie replied, this is not all. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110015"></xptr> gentleman said it was, Caddie said you have more behind you, and insisted upon searching, but did not; Caddie asked Stunnel what he was doing on the other side, Stunnel said, let me come, which he did, and he instantly made a blow at the gentleman; the gentleman cried Lord you have cut me, then we shut the doors and went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We have nothing to say, and no witnesses.</p>

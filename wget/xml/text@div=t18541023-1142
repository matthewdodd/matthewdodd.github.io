                  </hi>. I am a widow. I had the care of the deceased child, Charles Wall, for four months—on Friday, 29th Sept, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was at my house, No. 35, Lower Cornwall-street; Mr. Jabez Bartlett knocked at the door—the prisoner was by his side—he asked for a ring of Mr. Anstey's, the prisoner's husband—I said, "Who is Mr. Anstey? I do not know him"—the prisoner stepped forward, and said, "It is my husband, you long <hi rend="italic">cow;"</hi> and she said, "You lie, you have his gold watch and chain"—I had said nothing between her calling me a <hi rend="italic">cow</hi>, and her saying that—I said, "Oh, you wicked, false woman, bring your husband to my face!"—she afterwards said, "Well, never mind, let us have some thing to drink," and put her foot on the mat, over the threshold of the door—I had never seen her before—I was standing inside the door; she said to Mr. Bartlett, "Come in"—he said, "Not without this person's permission," or "consent;" I am not certain which—I said, "You will do nothing of the kind;" he then took hold of her arm, and pulled her away—she stood out<lb></lb>side, using very bad language—she then came back again, and made a blow</p>

               <p>with her fist; I suppose it was meant for me, but it fell on the child (which was on my right arm), on the right side of its ribs—it was a very violent blow—the child screamed; it was nearly eight months old—the prisoner then put her foot up to kick me, and I stepped back, and it just brushed my dress—Bartlett was not holding her at that time—he pulled her away the first time, but she broke from him—I went in and shut the door, and the prisoner broke the window—the child had been well up to that time; there was never any mark on it before, but directly I went in I saw a mark on its arm—it was very cross all night, and next morning as I lifted it out of bed it screamed—I saw a bruise on its side, level with the mark on the arm as if the prisoner's hand had slipped from the arm to the ribs—I sent for a medical man on that Saturday morning—his assistant came on the Saturday, and on the Monday morning the surgeon himself came—the child died on Saturday, 7th Oct.—the child never got better after the blow—the surgeon's assistant is not here—he sent some medicine on the Saturday, and an embro<lb></lb>cation to rub the place—I applied the embrocation—the child was very bad on Sunday, I could not get him to take anything—he was very cross, and as I moved him he seemed frightened—the bruise was very dark on Sunday—it was between red and purple—it got worse during the Sunday—I think it was between 12 and 1 o'clock on Monday when Mr. Arthur came—I had continued to apply the embrocation every four hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 2nd Oct. I examined the child; he was suffering from phlegmonous erysipelas—that is rather a serious form of erysipelas, it goes beyond the skin, and affects the cellular tissue—there was a slight discoloration on the right side of the chest, apparently where there had been a slight bruise—in my opinion, that bruise was the cause of the erysipelas—I have not had many cases of erysipelas coming from a slight braise, but I consider that the erysipelas was produced by the bruise—it does result from bruises under certain conditions of the atmosphere—in damp weather very trifling causes will give rise to it—I do not know that a bruise on a young child would be more likely to produce erysipelas than on a grown person—the bruise that I saw would be very likely to be produced by a woman's fist; it did not appear to be a severe one—the child got progressively worse, and died on the 7th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion of the body—in my judgment the cause of death was erysipelas, which gave rise to other diseases; it produced inflammation of the pleura, and an infusion of serum into the cavity of the chest—the brain was also affected, from sympathy—it was very highly congested, and its membranes also—there was a little effusion over the surface of the brain, and the ventricles—there was no mark on the head to account for that; the whole of those ap<lb></lb>pearances would be accounted for by the child receiving a violent blow on the Friday, producing erysipelas, and the erysipelas producing the other symptoms—in my opinion, the blow was the cause of the erysipelas, and the erysipelas gave rise to the other symptoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The proximate cause of death was erysipelas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is no doubt of that—it sometimes arises quite independent of any blow, from the constitution being reduced to a state of debility, and from intem<lb></lb>perance, exposure, or any previous indisposition—I do not recollect ever seeing erysipelas in a child without a scratch or injury of some kind—I have never seen it produced in a child by cold—I have seen it arise from strain<lb></lb>ing, or from a scratch, from a bad habit, or scrofulous blood—I did not see the child till Monday—erysipelas had then set in twelve or fifteen hours—it is very uncertain how soon it comes on after the infliction of a blow—if I had been called in on the Saturday, I should have applied a lotion to prevent inflammation of any kind—I did not anticipate erysipelas—a lotion, such as was applied, was very proper under the circumstances—I did not see the child on Sunday, nor did my assistant, as he considered it a trifling case, and of little consequence—I do not know what medicine he ordered; I saw the lotion—the blow itself certainly could not have caused death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has your assistant been with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six years—he has been apprenticed, he has passed his examination at the College and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230088"></xptr>
               <p>Hall, and is a legally qualified man—it was a soothing lotion—lead and oil; nothing else—there is a difference between a lotion and an embrocation; a lotion is applied with a piece of rag or lint, and an embrocation is generally rubbed in with the fingers—I do not think that rubbing would be more likely to produce inflammation than laying on a lotion, because the skin was not broken—embrocation is sometimes given for the purpose of excit<lb></lb>ing action, but that is a stimulating embrocation—if I had seen it myself I might have ordered it in the form of a lotion—I do not think it possible that the erysipelas was superinduced by the rubbing of the embrocation, not with such an embrocation; but with a stimulating embrocation, such as ammonia, it might—the use of rubbing in a cooling embrocation is to assist absorption—probably if I had been there myself, I should have used a lotion, or a fomentation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you to say, that when you saw the child first, the erysipelas had shown itself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it might have been there twelve or eighteen hours—I think it must have taken place on the previous day—of course in that state the rubbing in of an embrocation would not have been proper.</p>

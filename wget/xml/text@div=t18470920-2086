                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, 484.) The prisoner was taken into custody last Wednesday week, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—about half-past ten I went and searched his lodging, at 74, Napier-street, Hox<lb></lb>ton New-town—in a cupboard in the second floor room I found his cotton cloth, a quantity of piece of cloth of all colours, and some slate-coloured lining—he was then in custody—I saw his wife there—he had told me he had a wife, and had given me his address at the station, but did not describe what part of the house he occupied—the things I found were shown to him at the Mansion-house while he was under examination—he made no statement about them—I did not tell him where I had found them—it was stated in the exe<lb></lb>mination before the Lord Mayor—I saw no other woman at the house—there were some women up stairs, but I did not see them—I did not go up—I saw a woman there, and asked her if her name was Colmer.</p>

                  </hi> To the best of my knowledge, the property produced be<lb></lb>longs to Messrs. Silver—we have had cloths similar to the whole of these pieces—the prisoner had access to the room where these cloths were cut—I cannot say whether he was employed in cutting cloths of this description—I believe this black cotton to be Messrs. Silver's—we use a great quantity of it—this was made expressly for us—I cannot say whether it was made for our house alone—the prisoner was not employed by the day, only at piece work, and had been for three or four months—this black cotton is finished in a particular way, to imitate linen.</p>

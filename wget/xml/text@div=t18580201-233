                  </hi>. I am barman at the Gentleman and Porter, Kingsland Road. On 10th Dec, the prisoner came there between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—I had known her before—she asked for a quartern of gin—I served her—it came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, I did not notice it being a counterfeit—I was very busy at the time—I gave her change, and she left before I found it bad—I found it was bad in about five minutes—I took it up stairs, and locked it up in a box—on 4th Jan., the prisoner came again between 10 and 11 o'clock at night; she called for a pint of beer, and gave me a counterfeit half crown; I recognised her when she came—I tried the half crown in the detector, I found it was bad, I asked her if she had any more; she said, "No"—I noticed that she gave me the half crown out of a piece of white paper, which appeared to me to have more in it—I spoke to Mr. Wingate, and I told the prisoner that the last time she was there, she gave me a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—she denied it—I fetched a constable, and gave her into custody—I gave the two coins to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 40, Hercules-buildings, Lambeth. On Monday afternoon, 9th Dec, between four and five o'clock, I got into an omnibus at Charing-cross, to go into the City—the prisoner got into the same omnibus, near the Bank or Cornhill, with a man and another woman, who was dressed exactly in the same way as the prisoner—the other woman took her seat exactly opposite me, and the prisoner sat next me on my left side—I sat next the door of the omnibus—the man sat next the prisoner, on her left side—I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, in I should say two minutes after she had entered the omnibus—it was a pocket in my cloak, on the left side—the prisoner then leaned across, and spoke to the female who was opposite me—the prisoner had seen me put my purse into my packet after paying the conductor—when I felt her hand in my pocket, I moved, and she suddenly withdrew it—she then made a second attempt, and I distinctly saw her put her hand in and take out the purse, and she then leaned over me, looking out at the door of the omnibus—I trembled so dreadfully at the moment that I could not speak, but I touched the conductor's hand, and bid him stop the bus—I allowed her to</p>

               <p>take the purse when she made the second attempt; there were three shil<lb></lb>lings in it—the conductor stopped the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> and I got out directly—before I got out I laid my hand on the prisoner, and said, "You have robbed me; conductor, take this woman in charge; she has stolen my purse"—she was then sitting in the omnibus, and I was standing on the step—the conductor found my purse on the floor of the omnibus, between where the prisoner and the man sat—I decidedly acquit the man of taking it, because I distinctly saw the prisoner take it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a policeman was passing at the time, and took her into custody—the purse was found empty—the omnibus drove on with the man and the other woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I was conductor of this omnibus on the day in question. I was called by Miss Byron to stop the omnibus against St. Mary-Axe—she said she had been robbed of a purse, and wished to give the prisoner in charge—a police-sergeant being handy, I called to him, and she was given in charge—I looked into the omnibus directly the prisoner got out, and picked up this purse, and gave it to the constable—it might have been two feet and a half inside the omnibus, right in the middle of the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> between Miss Byron's and the prisoner's feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Miss Byron get out at St. Mary-Axe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when she got in she did not tell me where she wished to stop—the prisoner got in at the top of Cornhill, right opposite the Bank—six persons got in at Cornhill; it is the place where the journey is divided—I go on to Mile-end—I did not see any communication between the prisoners and the others—no person got in between the Bank and St. Mary-Axe—the prosecutrix did not charge any one but the prisoner—it was a darkish night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Court. Q.</hi> Did you observe any persons who got in at the same time as the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was another female got in with her; they were led in by a gentleman, who told me to leave them at Leman-street, White-chapeli—I cannot say whether the man got in, I did not notice—the other persons that got in were in single parties—the one who got in with the prisoner got out at Jewry-street, Aldgate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 71). I happened to be on the spot when the prosecutrix got out of the omnibus, in Leaden hall-street—in consequence of what the conductor said to me, I took the prisoner into custody—the prosecutrix told me that the prisoner had robbed her of her purse—she said that while she was sitting in the omnibus she distinctly felt, and saw her hand in her pocket—the prisoner heard this—I asked the prisoner for the purse—she said she had got nothing belonging to anyone</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185012160003"></xptr>
               <p>—I then asked the conductor to hold the prisoner while I searched the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he rather hesitated—I then asked the prosecutrix and her sister to hold him—the conductor made an attempt to go to the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I told him to wait, that that was my duty; but while I turned round to ask the ladies to hold the prisoner, he reached himself in the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> and I saw him take the purse from where the prisoner had got up and shook herself before she got out—he gave the purse to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you find on the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She produced 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper at the station—she was searched by a female, and nothing else was found—I distinctly saw the conductor pick up the purse and shake it; and I said to him, "There is the purse in your hand"—a female sat right opposite the prisoner, and a man sat on her left—there were two or three more at the top end of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—one of the ladies said she saw the prosecutrix drop the purse—I asked her to come to the station and state that—she then hesitated, and said to the one that sat opposite, "Did not you see it?"—she said, "No"—I asked for her name and address, and then she said, "I did not see anything."</p>

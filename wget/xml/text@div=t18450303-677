                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Tottenham; the prisoner was my carter. In consequence of circumstances, I marked some pieces of paper, and directed my son to place them somewhere on Tuesday, the 11th of Feb. On the Wednesday he brought me a nose-bag full of corn, with some of the papers which I had marked in it—I can swear to the papers—the corn consisted of black Tartarian oats, with a few peas and beans—I grow these oats myself—there are very few of any kind grown about us, and very few Tartarian oats—I believe they were mine—there were a few peas and beans mixed with it when it was given out at night—the corn and the mixture exactly correspond with what I gave ont—there was very nearly half a bushel—the prisoner was going out on the Wednesday, to take a load of beans to Newington—he was then to go on to Truman's for grains.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On the Tuesday evening I found a sack with some corn in it under the manger in the stable—the prisoner is the only driver my father has—I put some papers in that sack amongst the corn—on the same evening I found the corn was gone out of the sack, and put into the bin, in a bag—the prisoner started about one o'clock the next morning, to go to London—I was there when he went—he had two nose-bags of food for his horses, which were allowed him—they were behind the cart—I looked for the corn in the bin, and it was gone—I gave him the corn that was in the nose-bags the night before—it was the same corn as I had found under the manger the night before—I followed him, and asked him for the bag—he offered me one with corn and chaff in it—I said I did not want that—I then looked, and saw a bag under the load of beans—I took it out, and brought it home to my father's—I had given him all the corn the night before, but he should have given it to his horses the night before, and should have had that morning each of his nose-bags about a quarter full—it should have been mixed with chaff, and I found one bag with clear corn in it, and the papers were in it.</p>

               <p>Clark. I took it to be Mr. Tipper's Handwriting, otherwise I should not have paid the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Councel. Did he bring any other besides this ten Guinea Note?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, the Day afterwards (New-Year's-Day) he brought another for 50 Guineas, and I paid it to him.</p>
               <p>Councel. You keep New-Year's-Day as a Holiday; did he make no Excuse for coming then?</p>
               <p>Clark. He said his Master was going out of Town, and desired it might be paid.</p>

               <p>Mr. Goodeve. No, I am of Opinion they are not, for this Reason; this seems to be wrote after some Copy, and is a stiff Sort of a Hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ellis. I observe there is a Sriffness, as if the Person was got into an unusual Course: It wants the Freedom of an Original; they are pretty well done, but there is a Heaviness which will be in all Copies.</p>

               <p>Witness. No, I believe not. The Prisoner was employ'd by my Master (Mr. Tipper) to write and improve me in Accompts: He had a very good Hand at imitating, for I have heard him say, he could do any Gentleman's Hand if he saw it but once, to such an Exactness, that it should not be distinguished from the Original. I saw him counterfeit a Gentleman's Hand from a Frank so nicely, that I could not discern the Difference.</p>

               <p>Mr. Tipper. I am a Tobacco-Broker. The Prisoner was recommended to me as a Person out of Place, and wrote a good Hand. While he was with me he behaved very well, and I had not the least Reason to suspect him. On the 30th of Dec. last I had Occasion to go down into Essex, and left the Prisoner in Care of my House: I returned on New-Year's-Day at Night, and the Prisoner had left the House and taken the Keys away with him, so that I was forc'd to set a Ladder up against the Window, and put a Boy in.</p>

On the 9th of November, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) they were on the leads of the house about ten minutes before I missed them, I saw them there then, that was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw the prisoner go up stairs into his own room; he lodges in the house; I heard him go over the leads and then I saw him come down stairs with a bundle; I ran up stairs and saw my property was gone; I went to a pawnbroker's in the neighbourhood, who told me the prisoner had left his coat there, and that when he came to fetch his coat he would give us intelligence of him; he came to the pawnbroker's about five o'clock, and was stopped. I saw the cotton stockings taken out of his pocket, and the shirt off his back, at the justice's.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Where was you when you saw me come down stairs?</p>
               <p>Knight. I was in my own room; the prisoner's room is above mine; my room door was a-jar; we can hear every foot that goes on the leads.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of October, between four and five o'clock, I believe it was, but cannot be particular to the time, I saw the prisoner go up stairs into his room as I supposed, and I heard him go upon the leads which are over my room; I saw him come down stairs very soon after, with a bundle in his apron. There was nobody else besides the prisoner went up or down; my room door was at that time between open and shut. Mrs. Knight ran up stairs and cried, Oh, Mrs. Yorke, my stockings are all gone! Having observed the prisoner came home the night before without his coat, I concluded he had pawned it at a pawnbroker's just by, where I knew he had before pawned some things; we went to the pawnbroker's, and he promised us that when the prisoner came for his coat he would let us know. Accordingly the same night he did come, and they sent for the prosecutrix and me, and I saw a pair of cotton stockings taken out of his waistcoat pocket, and the shirt taken off his back.</p>

               <p>I was informed by the prosecutrix of the fact. I met him, and I laid hold of him, and endeavoured to secure him, but he made his escape. I saw him again about eleven o'clock, and then I secured him; he had this shirt on, and a pair of cotton stockings in his jacket pocket (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix, The stockings which I lost were of the same colour and the same rib; though there is no particular mark, yet I know them to be mine; they are the same, there were no others there; the shirt I can swear to, because it had never been washed before.</p>

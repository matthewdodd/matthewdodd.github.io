I was taken very ill in February last, I took the prisoner in to take care of me for a month, and I have had her ever since with me out of charity, till taken up by a constable, having lost the things mentioned in the indictment, out of my room; we lived and lay together in one bed; I can't tell the very day they were missing, it was one afternoon when I was out, about five weeks ago; the first thing I missed was my petticoat, I would make her tell me where it was; all I could get out of her was, it is safe, and when the other things were missing, that was all the answer I could get of her, till she was taken up, upon the account of some things belonging to Mr. Hughes; this was about a fortnight after I missed mine; then I insisted again to know where my things were gone, and she wrote a paper for me to go to Mr. Bruin's on Snow-hill, and there I might find them pawn'd; I went, and found them.

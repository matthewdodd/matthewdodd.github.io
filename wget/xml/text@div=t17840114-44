               <p>Sanson. Just as I had served Moore with half a yard of mode, I saw Partridge move towards the goods and move back again: I did not see her take any thing, but I suspected half a minutes she pretended she had lost gold ring.</p>
               <p>Court. At she went to the place where those modes lay was she long enough to have taken any thing? - About half a minute; just as she had dropped her gold ring Mr. Pritt came down and called for a cansole to look for the ring; he gave gave her the rings, and I put the mode into paper, and Moore paid me for it; I said to our apprentice, says I, I verily think that lady has stole something; and he said, no, they are very; creditable ladies; says I, then I will tell; Mr. Pritt I did so, and he desired me to go and call them back; as soon as I got out of the shop he called me back again, and told me that the apprentice said it would offend them; but I said, I may as well watch them Mr. Pritt, and by that time you will see if you have lost any thing; I followed them and they had got as far as the ruins, when a woman joined them: she was dressed like Mrs. Stokes, but I did not see her face; they went to the top of Bow-street, into Hart-street; when I saw where they went in, I directly ran back to Mr. Pritt, and we both went there and got other assistance and got into the room; and there were all four, and the mode laying on a round table, and when we got in, Gardner said we should not search the house, I got out and got two more men; and Mr. Pritt was forced to let them in at the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Then she was but a little while towards the place where the goods were? - No, but a little while.</p>
               <p>She did not attempt to go out after? - No, she was looking for her ring.</p>

               <p>I was called upon by Mr. Pritt to go and take the prisoners; I called upon Moses Morant at the office, and went together, and when we got up to the top of Bow-street, I saw the last witness standing, he told me it was next door to the publick house, that to Mrs. Gardener's house; I opened the street door, and I went into the parlour; Partidge was first, Stokes was rather further off, Gardiner next to her, and Moore, next to her, the mode say much in the state it does now; upon seeing her in the condition she was in, so big; I sold her to keep her hands from her pockets; that I should not hurt her; I took her towards the fire place, and I found some lace in her pocket and this Persian; then I searched Mrs. Moore, and in her pocket I found this mode and this Persian, and other things that were not owned.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass about that mode? - No, not when I went in, they were alarmed.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by any of them? - Not in my hearing, because when I got into the room, I moved Stokes towards the fire seeing the condition that she was in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What kind of a room was it, large or small? - Not over and above large, a middling sized parlour, the house is next door to the Bear in Hart-street.</p>
               <p>I should have thought you would have heard any thing that was there said? - I heard nothing said.</p>

               <p>Did you hear any conversation pass about that piece of mode, by any one of these prisoners? - No, I heard Mrs. Gardiner say she could tell who brought the mode there: they were just going to drink some brandy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You heard no conversation at all? - None at all.</p>
               <p>And you was there the whole time? - Yes, I was one of the last that came out of the house.</p>

               <p>PRISONER PARTRIDGE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I hope I may have leave to speak: we went into the shop, and when we came out we met with this woman, Mrs. Stokes, and seeing her, very bad, and so big, Moore asked her what was the matter, she said she believed she was in labour, and she was going to Long-acre; she walked with us till we came to Mrs. Gardner's door, she was bidding two ladies good day, and Mrs. Stokes put her hand against the rail of the Bear publick house door, and Mrs. Gardner asked her, to step in, and then they sent for some brandy; I never saw the mode till this gentlemen, clapped his hand upon it, and said was his; we was not near the mode, it was on the table, and we were nearer the fire.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. It seems to on this indictment you cannot find at the three prisoners guilty, for Stokes was gone out of the shop as soon as the two others came in; and the shopman says he had his eye upon her the whole time, and he does not think it was possible for her to take any thing without his seeing her; you will therefore direct your attention to the evidence, as it relates to Moore and Partridge.</p>

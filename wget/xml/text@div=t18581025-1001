               <p>having got that, he then goes to the receiver's office, and obtains the money mentioned in the imprest—on 18th September, the prisoner brought me this report—it is his writing, except this in the corner, which is mine: "Police-constable 54 reports being sent to Birmingham with an imprest to apprehend a convict whose licence is revoked"—the convict's name is not mentioned—that would be contained in the warrant—on the production of that, I asked him for the warrant—he said, "I am expecting the warrant di<lb></lb>rectly, it is not signed yet; but I want to draw the money before they leave the office at Scotland-yard"—that was between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, as near as I can remember—I then signed the imprest—on the following Monday or Tuesday, I saw the prisoner on his regular duty, and asked him the reason he had not gone the journey that I signed the imprest for—he said that he was given to understand that the convict was ill and in the infirmary—I saw him again on the Wednesday, and asked him the same question—he gave me the same answer—I saw him again on Friday, the 24th, and said, "Gymer, when are you going that journey?"—he said that he did not know—I said, "Unless you go to-morrow, you bring the money in," which he promised to do—that would be Saturday, the 25th—I saw him again on the Sunday morning—he had not brought me the money, and I sent for him to come to the station—when he came, I asked him the reason he had not paid me the money as I told him—he said, "I have paid it into the office"—I understood him to mean the office at Scotland-yard—I said, "To whom did you pay it?"—he said, "To Mr. Goulden; I was not aware that you in<lb></lb>tended me to bring it in here"—that is the chief clerk in the receiver's office—he pays out money, and would receive it back—I said, "If you have paid it to Mr. Goulden, I am satisfied: I do not want to have any respon<lb></lb>sibility on my shoulders"—I then inquired what had become of the imprest: "Has Mr. Goulden given it you back, or has he given you any receipt for the money paid in?"—he said, "Mr. Goulden tore up the imprest with the Commissioner's signature on it"—on the following Monday, I made inquiries at the receiver's office, and, on returning to the station, sent for the prisoner, and said, "Gymer, I am given to understand you have not paid the money in to Mr. Goulden, as you told me you had"—he said, "No, Sir, I have not"—I said, "Why did you tell me you had? where is the money?"—he said, "I have it here in my pocket"—I told him to put it on the desk—he took out his purse and took out of it, I think it was, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and the remainder in silver, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—he said, "I have not enough, but I will bring it to you immediately"—I told him to leave the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the desk and fetch the other 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then said, "Gymer, yon have told me an untruth in this matter, and I must report you for it"—he said, "Do forgive me, Sir, and I will tell you all about it"—I did not answer—he said, "Some time since, I had a misfortune, and lost my purse with 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, through a hole in my pocket, and many of the men know that to be true"—I said, "I cannot overlook it; you must see me again to-morrow morning, and I will see what I can do with you"—he said, "Do, Mr. Mitchell, forgive me; if you take me before the Commissioner, I shall be dismissed"—at the time of this conversation, I had not made inquiries as to whether he had any authority to go to Birmingham at all—on the afternoon of that day, I went to Bow-street, to make inquiries—that was Wednesday, the 29th, and on the following morning, the prisoner came to me—I said, "Gymer, I am given to understand you had no authority from the Court to draw the money"—he said, "No, Sir"—I said, "Neither is there a prisoner at Birmingham to be apprehended"—he said, "No, Sir, there is not"—I</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to Mr. John Ray, the receiver for the metropolitan police—it is part of my duty to give money out—on 18th September, the prisoner came to the office, which is in Whitehall-place, and produced this imprest—when a document of this kind is produced for my signature, I advance the money—here is a blank here for the signature of the Commissioner of Police—when the prisoner brought it I said, "You have not obtained the signature of the Commissioner"—he said, "There is no one there"—it is my practice to pay the money in cases of emergency, when the signature cannot be obtained, in order that justice may not be defeated, and the Commissioner's signature is obtained afterwards—I saw the prisoner sign this document, and paid him 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and three sovereigns—he has paid me money since on some other accounts—I knew that he had been employed on this service several times before—this is the</p>

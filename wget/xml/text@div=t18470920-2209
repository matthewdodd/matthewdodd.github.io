                  </hi> I keep the King's Head public house, at Knights-bridge. On Thursday evening, the 4th of Dec. last, I had a large party in my house,—the prisoner was there, and two persons named Scully and Potter—I did not see them come in, but I saw them all three in the house in company together—I had seen the three in company together at my home many times previously—the prisoner and Potter had slept in my house three or four nights previous to that—they knew my house well—they had been in the habit of sleeping there for three weeks at different times—I saw the prisoner and the other two on the night of the 4th as late as twelve o'clock—I did not observe either of the three leave—I cleared my house about one in the morning—I was the last person up—I made the bar safe, and left the bar window safe when I went to bed—I left some silver and copper, and some articles of plate, cigars, and cheroots, in the bar—I was disturbed about four o'clock in the morning by Oram—I went down into the bar, the window was open, and the shutters of the bar-parlour down—that must have been opened form the inside—I found some of the silver gone, and some things tied up in a handkerchief ready to be taken—I missed some silver and copper, some articles of plate, cigars, cheroots, a great coat, and a handkerchief—the articles tied up ready for removal had been displaced from where I had left them the night before—whoever committed the robbery must have been in the house I should say, and afterwards broken out—there was no appear<lb></lb>ance of external violence—I sent for a policeman—some of the property has been returned to me from this Court. When Scully and Potter were tried here—the prisoner was taken last Saturday three weeks.</p>

                  </hi> I am a porter, and have lived at No. 7, Fulham Bridge-road for seven years. I have a slight recollection of having seen the prisoner lodging there—I could not be quite positive he is the man, because I only saw him once, and then it was rather dark—it was about six o'clock one evening near Christmas—to the best of my belief he is the man—a policeman came there to look for him a very short time after the robbery.</p>

I had the money in the morning of a shop-keeper in rag-fair; I had laid none of it out. As soon as they had the money they all ran down, and I ran after them. I was almost distracted about my money. I could not tell where they were gone; some of the neighbours took notice of them, and told me where they were. I found the little one in the necessary; she said you Dutch bougre what do you want with me, do you want my life or my child's life. I said give me my money; she said you Dutch bougre I won't give you a farthing, I wish I had more of you, do you want my life or my child's life, she said again. She said what she would do to me if I did not go out. I was afraid and went away, and she went out. They saw some of the neighbours run after them, and then they ran into the house again. The woman of the house asked me what was the matter, I cried and took on so. She bid me look over my money, and see what I had lost. I took my money out to count it, then Green came up and took a guinea out of my hat and ran out. They all ran out again. The constable took them in the street, and searched them, but did not find any thing upon them. I did not get any of my money again.</p>

I believe the prisoners live all higley pigley in that one room; my window is opposite theirs. I saw them all in the room, when they called him up. I heard the Jew cry out give me my monies, give me my monies. I saw Willoughby and Charlotte M'Cabe run out of the house into the next house. I did not see what became of the others.</p>

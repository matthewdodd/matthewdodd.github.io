                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. Gardener was a carman in their employ—his duty was to go out with a pair of horses and a van, and collect the goods—he was allowed to take two bags of provender for the horses when he went out in the morning, and when he returned to fill them again; two bags each time he went out—he had no right to take any other provender—I have ex<lb></lb>amined some mixture of oats, beans, cut clover, and chaff, produced by Goddard—it corresponded with what was left in our bins—I cannot swear to it—Garde<lb></lb>ner is a married man, and I believe has a family.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 167). On 6th May, at half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the two prisoners draw up their vans and carts between the foot of London-bridge and the railway-terminus—they got out of the vans and went to a beer-shop—Gardener came out, took a bag from the side of his cart, and took it and filled a bag at Groves's van, and then he put it back again—I went and asked him if both the vans belonged to the same company—he said, "No"—I asked what he had been doing with the bags—he said it fell down, and he picked it up again—Sergeant Andrews was coming up Duke-street, and he took Groves into custody—Gardener was about to get up to the box of his van, and I told him he was to go to the station—in going there he said, "Well, I own I did give him a handful or two"—"Groves," was on the one van, and "Eastern Counties Railway" on the other, from which the mixture was taken—I showed the mixture to the witness Whitehurst.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 212). About the end of last month I and the prisoner lodged at West Smithfield—the prisoner left the house about 3 o'clock on Saturday, 29th March—he occupied the bed room on the third floor, and I slept in the same room, but not in the same bed—I had a chest of drawers in a back room on the second floor, where I formerly slept—they were not looked—the prisoner had a box in that room—I saw my coat safe on the Thursday or Friday as the prisoner left on the Saturday, and missed it between 12 and 1 o'clock on Saturday—on 1st April I looked at the prisoner's box, and found one of the hinges broken; I raised it up, and saw my coat—I then borrowed a bunch of keys of my landlady, opened the box in the presence of Mr. Paget, and found my coat and two stones in the box—the constable took it, and the prisoner—I value it at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my waistcoat at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at the house in question, it is a coffee shop and lodging house—I was present when O'Brien opened a box, and took out a coat—the landlady was also present, she lent him the bunch of keys, and he claimed the coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this coffee and lodging house. The prisoner lodged there for a fortnight—he went away without giving me any notice, or his brother either—I saw him leave, but did not see whether he had anything with him—I lent O'Brien my keys to try them to the pri<lb></lb>soner's box, and was present when the coat was found—O'Brien had com<lb></lb>plained to me, in the prisoner's hearing, of losing his coat—that was about an hour before the prisoner went away—he did not pay his rent before he left—I did not ask him, because the Post-office was responsible for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had the misfortune to be robbed before the prisoner came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I missed a dress, a veil, and a pair of gloves—I did not accuse anybody in the house, it was a servant who had left—the prisoner's brother was security for the rent—one brother lodged with me for a week, and he disappeared in a similar way one Saturday, leaving word for me to keep his room open for him, but instead of his returning, his brother came and said that, as I had given such satisfaction to his brother, he wished to place a younger brother under my care; that he would be answerable for him, and I should know where to find him as one of the Inland clerks in the General Post-office—I have seen the brother since, he is a clerk in the Post-office—the prisoner came to me to know how he had behaved himself, and the next time he called was to tell his brother in law that he had ✗ to Liverpool, as he did not wish to see anybody—I have never had any <hi rend="italic">tiff</hi> with him, nor have I had occasion to scold him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 109). I took the prisoner in St. Hartin's-le-Grand, on the evening of 2nd April, and took him to the station, where O'Brien was—I found some things on him which do not apply to this case—O'Brien charged him with stealing his coat—he made no answer—I went to the coffee-house, and got a key, which opened the box, and there found O'Brien's coat, and two large stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

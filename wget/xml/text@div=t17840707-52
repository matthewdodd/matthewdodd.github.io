               <p>I live opposite to the prosecutor, I know nothing of him, I observed three men in company near the shop on the 18th of June last, and one out of the three went into the prosecutor's shop, and took out a large lump of sugar, one put his hand into his pocket and gave the other something seemingly to go and buy something. I called to the prosecutor and told him, he pursued the man, I do not know that the prisoner was one of the three men I saw, Mr. Todd returned with the prisoner, I gave the alarm directly.</p>

Send direct Pinchon and Johnson, Cable Street, London, 500 crystals, 500 powdered borax, samples in bair Is, letter follows to day"—on the following day I received the letter produced—I sent the goods to Pinchon and Johnson, amounting to 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the invoice to Smith Brothers, and have never been paid—J find the prisoner has sold the goods considerably under cost price; he had no authority to sell to Pinchon and Co. at 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.—he never told me he had received the cheque from Pinchon and Co. for the goods; I heard of it afterwards—the endorsement on the back of the cheque produced to me is in prisoner's handwriting—on 16th June I received this letter from Smith Brothers, signed G. Reid (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the lust bag of borax had been sent out, and gave particulars, of other orders asking for further supply</hi>)—an order was enclosed for goods value 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent off the goods accordingly, addressed to Smith Brothers; in the other case they were sent direct to the people, and at the same time I gent goods to the prisoner to the value of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he had said in his letter there were other small orders—I believed the orders to have been genuine, and upon that belief I forwarded the goods—I have since learned that neither the London and Westminster Supply Association nor the Civil Service Supply Association</p>

               <p>had given orders as stated in his letter—on 28th June I received telegram "Half-lump, half-powdered, for Stores; got orders yesterday for a ton of powdered"—I also received another order enclosing cheque that was in Payment for goods that had been dispatched in May—I received this letter of 8th July: "Dear Sir,—Our Mr. Reid left London for Bir<lb></lb>mingham on Monday night, and will pay you a visit before he returns. You may expect to see him on Thursday or Friday next, when he will make arrangements. We beg to enclose a bill for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which our Mr. Reid will explain." I produce the bill dated 8th July drawn by Fleming, accepted by Smith Brothers at two months—that bill was subsequently dishonoured—it was sent down by them, and I signed it, and on the Thursday or Friday the prisoner came down to Liverpool, and I saw him, and he then gave me an order in the names of 20 or 30 respectable firms in London—I had a conversation with him about the bill—he said he had left town on the Monday that I received the letter from Smith Brothers saying "Our Mr. Reid will call upon you, etc.," and added "That has been sent up in my absence; I know nothing about it; I will make inquiries when I return"—I explained to him that the bill was of no use to me, as I expected cash, and he said he would see about it when he returned—at that time he referred to an order of Mr. Leigh Cande, of Dunkerque—I asked him whether he was a reliable person, and he said he was—upon that I sent the goods, and sent. the invoice to Smith Brothers—he said I should receive the cash immediately on the receipt of the goods—I have not received it—the Monday afterwards, 29th August, I received from the prisoner this other bill for 1,000 francs, drawn on Ricoto and accepted by "Whitehouse, payable at 42, Rue de Moscow, Paris—I passed it through a bill-broker in London—I did not supply any more goods until after 12th July—in the middle of August I came to London and went to 39, Wilson Street—I found it to consist of two front offices on the ground floor, level with the street, and some back premises and a long passage—I saw Some empty barrels, and found a few samples of sardines and pickles—tie name of Smith Brothers was on the door—I then saw the prisoner, and told him I did not like the bill which was running, and that I would take 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the other goods—he said that he had bills owing that would become due before this bill matured, and he could not possibly let me have any more; he told me to call again in two or three hours, and he would try and get the money for me—I went into the City, and when I came back I saw the prisoner sitting on a stool in his office eating a bun—I asked him if he had got the money—ho said "No," he had not been out—I asked him what he had done with the goods, and he said "I hare sold them"—I asked him what he had done with the money—he said "I have spent it"—I parted with the goods believing the orders were genuine, and that Smith Brothers was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> firm doing a genuine business—putting it down at the lowest figure, after deducting commission, etc., I have lost 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the prisoner—I saw no person of the name of Smith.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner read the letter of appointment from Fleming of 19th April, stating terms of remuneration.</hi>) There were no fresh terms—it was cash on delivery, or 14 days' credit where you could not get the cash—we have different scales of commission—the letter of 1st July ("My terms ought to be strictly adhered to in both cases a month, and now it is nearly two months") refers to the boxes—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was in payment of the previous amount, and had nothing to do with Pinchen and Johnson's—I sent you a receipt for the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on 9th July—J had it in a safe three weeks, and then put it through the bank and it was returned marked "No account"—I was advised to wait till the bill was matured—I saw you in August, and offered to take 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in settlement of all you owed me—at the end of July or beginning of August my suspicions were aroused, and I wanted a substantial guarantee before we resumed business—you gave me a list of firms you said you could get orders from, and you brought two orders to substantiate your statement—I have got nothing by the orders you got for me—you got a very good order from the London and Westminster, which was supplied, but I never got the money, and so with the Civil Service and other stores.</p>

Mr. Clark keeps a tally shop and asked me to issue books to anybody who came into my shop who wanted goods on that system, and no doubt some of them gave me false addresses, and I could not look after them. I went to the Magistrate and tried to get a detective to take one man who gave me a false address.

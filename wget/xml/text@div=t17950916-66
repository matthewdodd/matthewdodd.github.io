             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer; I produce the property in the indictment, all the articles, they are all here. On Monday the 7th of this month, I was going up the Old bailey, and I perceived the woman prisoner with something in her apron and the man along side of her; I had a suspicion, I went up to the woman, and the man went a little way on; I asked the woman, good woman, says I, what have you got here? says she, I have got some linen; I asked her how she came by it? she said the man had given it to her to carry, and was to give her eighteen-pence. I immediately called the man to come back; he came back to me; I asked him whether he had; he denied it. I then took them both to the counter; he denied knowing any thing of the property, or that he ever hired her to carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they walking and talking together? - I thought there was some conversation, but I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that he knew the woman? - No, he denied knowing her. The next day they were taken before Mr. Alderman Lushington; the woman gave just the same account she had done before. Mr. Alderman Lushington ordered them to be advertised; and on Friday Mrs. Parry came before the alderman to claim the property; and I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. If you please to remember when you took hold of Mr. Bacon, you said, where are you going to? I don't know what answer he made you, and then you turned round and said to me, what have you got there? and I said, it is that man's; and then he went on a little way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bacon. The articles I never see till the man called me back.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know the gowns it is property I am entrusted with; I am a <rs id="t17950916-66-viclabel381" type="occupation">laundress</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950916-66-victim756 t17950916-66-viclabel381"></join>, and these are all one lady's things together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. I was coming from Whitecross street, through Paul's-alley, and nearly at the top of the alley this man overtook me, and he had a bundle in this check apron, under his left arm; he asked me where I was going? he said he was going to Drury-lane; and I lived in Shire-lane; so under the gateway he asked me if I would carry this bundle? I said, I did not care; and he gave me the bundle into my apron, and he came down Aldersgate-street, and into the Old-bailey, and then that gentleman stopped him, and asked him where he was going? and with that he said to me, what have you got there? I said, I did not know; says he, whose is it? says I, this man's. With that he made off a little, and Mr. Jostling called him back, and took us both to the counter; and he said he would give me a shillings or eighteen-pence, it being fair time; and he being my own son-in-law, that has worked on his own account for some time, a taylor, I did not know but it was for his own work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bacon I am innocent of this affair, as false as there is a God in Heaven. I left my own house, where I live in Barbican, No. 52, going down Snow-hill I heard some man calling out after me, Bacon! I immediately stopped, and it was Mr. Jostling, and he said to me, Bacon, do you know what these things are that this woman has got tied up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160198"></xptr>her lap so very close? and I said I did not know one article there, you may depend upon it they are not mine.</p>
               <p>Court to Jostling. What time was it you met these people? - Between four and five, or nearly five.</p>

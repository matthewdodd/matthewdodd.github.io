On Sunday the 14th of September ( after she went out between 9 and 10 o'clock, and as she was to have gone on the Monday, they thought she was gone for good) he and Mrs. Dawson went up to see if she had taken her boxes away; they found her two boxes, one lock'd and the other open. The first thing they observ'd was a handkerchief with new linen in it, cut out into short lengths; upon which he was desirous of looking whether he could find any marks, and upon looking found one; there were 24 yards of it originally. He produced a piece of about three nails, and shew'd a mark that he said he could swear was his mark; that she had taken the key to let herself in. She having many followers he thought best to keep her out when she was out, upon which he fastened her out. She came that night, he look'd out and told her he did not look upon her as his servant, and desired her to call in the morning for her wages. When she came he desired her to walk up stairs that he might search her box. He shew'd her the linen and ask'd her how she came by it, she said she bought it of a linen-draper in Covent-Garden, but she could not tell his name, sign, or street. He sent a person with her to see if she could find out the shop, but they returned and she could not find it. He sent for a constable, and before the alderman she confessed the fact. He said she had been his servant about seven months, and had behaved well, till about the time she had warning given her, to go away.</p>

               <p>The prisoner in her defence said, she knew nothing of that cloth being put into her box. They told her if she would own where she had it from, they would forgive her, and, in her fright, she said she would pay for it, rather than be in trouble; that she did not say she bought it in Covent-Garden, and that her master said he would not pay her her wages, till he knew where the linen came from.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor being ask'd if he had paid her her wages, said he had not, but was then ready so to do.</p>

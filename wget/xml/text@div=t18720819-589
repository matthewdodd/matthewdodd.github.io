                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's servant, living in Clarges Street—on Tuesday morning, 30th July, I was in the Brompton Road at ten minutes to one o'clock—Hazle, who was with two men, left them and accosted me, and wished me to treat her—I refused, and she asked me to go home with her, which I refused also—we walked a few yards, and she struck me on my face with her umbrella, and began halloaing—I ran backwards, and several young men came round me and knocked me down—I got up and tried to get away—Winter ran across the road after me, and I was knocked down a second time and stunned—I can swear that Winter was one of those who ran after me, but I cannot swear that he struck me—I was picked up by a policeman, and then missed my watch and chain, and locket—the policeman took me to the hospital—I was taken to the station next morning, and saw</p>

               <p>the prisoners and several young women, but no men except Winter—I picked Hazle out as the woman who struck me first—I identified Winter as being there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were three women—Clara Phillips was not one of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a photographer, of Lloyd's Place, Brompton—on the night of 30th July I was in the Brompton Road between 1.5 and 1.10 o'clock, and just as I was going to turn down Lloyd's Place I saw Tebbey standing by the female prisoner—two other girls were by—I saw Hazle strike Tebbey with a parasol or umbrella—she knocked him down—he got up and she knocked him down in the road again—I went to her and asked her what she was knocking the man about for, and she struck me and called out "Harry!" I think, and twelve or fourteen men, who were nearly 100 yards further up the road, came down to the scene, and I told Tebbey to run if he could—I ran and called "Police!" and Tebbey ran—as he ran I saw him knocked against the steps and knocked on the pave<lb></lb>ment by a man, but I was nearly twenty yards away, and could not see who did it—I saw a policeman come up, he removed Tebbey in a cab—I pointed out to the police a girl named Green, who was standing by, but not who had anything to do with it—she is not here—I am positive Hazle is the woman who used the parasol—I am not positive about Winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hazle. Q.</hi> Can you swear I knocked the man down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was not the female who stood with you—I cannot describe your dress, I only go by your face—you do not look able to knock a man down, but I have seen you before do something very nearly the same—I have no animosity against you, I never knew you to speak to you—I am quite sure it was you—I did not notice that Tebbey had a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear any altercation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I heard no words used, but all of a sudden she struck him with a parasol and knocked him down in the road—the first time she fought him off the kerb with her hands up, and the second time she fought him off the kerb into the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no recollection of seeing Clara Phillips there—I have seen her outside here—I only knew her by sight—if she had come into sight I should have recognised her—Tebbey did not fight Hazle, but he went into the road; it did not look like fun; he came back in a sort of expostulating way, as much as to say "What are you doing that for?" there was no quarrel before, so far as I could see—I have often seen the men together who came up: they live near about, I believe—I have seen them with Hazle before.</p>

My husband is a milkman, of Exeter Place, Chelsea—on this night I was in Brompton, on my way home—I heard a noise and saw Hazle strike Tebbey with her umbrella, and then I saw her knock him down; she called some name which I cannot recollect, and Winter rushed out and struck Tebbey, and thirteen or fourteen of them were together—I knew Winter quite well by sight, I used to live opposite him, and know his appearance quite well—I saw him hit the prosecutor—I was speaking to Edith Wallace, and we gave our names—I have never had any quarrel with Winter—I am living with my husband.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a cabinet-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you follow any other line of business? - A.Carpentering.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you ever in this Court before? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you were at the bar of this Court? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a wrong accusation, no doubt - your wife was with you, was not she? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade were you carrying on at that time? - A. No illegal trade, nor no practice.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you charged with, it was very wrong I know? - A. If my Lord says it is lawful for me to tell you, I will.</p>
               <p>Court. It is lawful.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What were you charged with, when you were at the bar? - A. What was I charged with, why, with robbing a man of some Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. A countryman, may-hap? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a lodger of your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not sleep in your house? - A. Yes; one night, and enjoyed his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Not long, though it seems - may-hap you have lodgers in your house at this time? - A. How should I know at this time in the evening - brow-beating me in this way, after I have been robbed and stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me a direct answer, have you any lodgers in your house? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you had any lodgers in your house? - A. Why, last night.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers had you in your house last night? - A. How many had I, why, I had two.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the only time that you have been in this Court, for frisking the countryman of some Banknotes? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Try your recollection now? - A.No, I will leave that to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in this Court before that time? - A. Have I ever been here before, yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the Court had you the luck to be in then? - A.Where I stand now.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never at the bar but that time, when you and your wife were tried for robbing a countryman of Bank-notes in your house? - A. You will recollect it was by Clerkenwell-green that he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh, I beg your pardon, you took him upon the green to frisk him, did you? - A. The plain story is, I have been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q.Let us see whether you are or not, that plain sort of man-how many times have you been at the bar of this court? - A. That is not material.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh, yes, it is, very material, you may depend upon it? - A. I should be glad to know when you will have done with me.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you would, but I have not done with you yet? - A. You will not get any thing out of me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been at the bar of this Court? - A. I shall not tell you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then I must apply to his Lordship.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are bound to answer the question? - A. I will not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. But you must? - A. Why, I have been here twice, and if I had not been acquitted, I should not have been here now.</p>
               <p>Q.Then what did you mean by telling the Jury you had been there but once? - A. You want to expose me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it always been your good luck to be acquitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round a little to the right - do you know Mr. Townsend? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a very remarkable man - upon your oath, do you mean to swear that you have never been convicted? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that, in the face of Mr. Townsend? - A. Yes - the fact is, I have lost my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you been convicted? - A. I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you been convicted? - A. If you talk to me for an hour, it is of no use.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems to be of very little use, for your character is sufficiently exposed? - A. That is very immaterial to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you never been convicted? - A. To please you, I will say, I have been convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, you have indicted this man at the bar for a burglary, did not you? - A.I know the man is indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that you have indicted him for a burglary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, as you have been here before, you know the slang phrase a little? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know, that for a burglary, there is a little trifling reward of forty pounds? - A. I never had an instance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had the luck of it yet, and you won't to-day, I promise you-You never heard of a reward upon the conviction of a man for burglary? - A. I must be stupid if I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You came here for the public good, no doubt? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He had no woman with him when you apprehended him? - A. No; there was a woman taken up the same day as the robbery, but I do not know her name; she is out-side the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this is an indictment for a burglary? - A. Yes.</p>

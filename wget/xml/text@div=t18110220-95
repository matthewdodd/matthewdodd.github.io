            . I live at 58, Featherstone-street. The prisoner has lived with me five years; I entrusted him to receive money for me of my customers. I lost a great deal of property, and I did not know how I lost them; I sent Mrs. Palmer to buy a plate of tin, and a sauce-pan, with a view to see whether he would bring that money to accompt. This was on the 12th of January, about the middle of the day. I staid till she came back with the articles, then I went home; the prisoner was in the shop, I saw him; he throwed down two shillings; he said he had sold a three quart saucepan, and did a job in the bargain. That is all he gave account for. This was on the Saturday, on Monday he was taken up.</p>

            . On the 12th of January Mr. Dowding gave me one shilling and sixpence, I was to buy a three pint saucepan and a sheet of tin. I gave the prisoner a shilling and six penny pieces, and got the saucepan and the sheet of tin. I did not mean to buy them, only to try whether the man was honest.

                  </hi>. On 22nd Dec. last I was married to the prisoner at Shoreditch church—I had known him for about eleven months; he was lodging at my sister's—he represented himself to be a single man—I had not been married before—I lived with him about seven months; during that time I never heard that he had been married—I have had one child by him, which is four months old—I was in a very good situation, as servant-of-all-work—I did not hear the prisoner had been married, till the Sunday before he was taken into custody—I was not living with him then—I had left him because he would not provide a home—I had no food nor coals in the house—he would pay no rent, my mother lent me money to pay.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This wedding was brought about by an elder sister of hers, who keeps a tobacconists and newspaper shop in Leather-lane; it was at her request I went to lodge there, she thought I was paying my addresses to her, but when she discovered that it was to her younger sister, her resent<lb></lb>ment knew no bounds; my second wife asked me whether she should leave her situation or give up my company, as her mistress had told her if she kept my company she must leave; I told her she had better consult herself; I did not wish to meddle with family matters; I found her a lodging, where she was for some time; she gave me to understand she was likely to become a mother, and I consented to marry her, and the marriage took place; my first wife was in the habit of keeping company with a man named Jarius, a horse-conductor, and another named Crawford, who met her on particular occasions—she bad been an abandoned woman.</p>

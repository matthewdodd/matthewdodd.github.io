I lived at 7, Star Place, North End, Fulham, but removed last week—I am a labouer—on Saturday evening, 28th March, between 10 and 11, I was in the Chipperton beer-shop, North Road—I saw the prisoner come in, followed by a gentleman—the gentleman turned round and said, "What do you follow me for, my good man; why don't you go about your own business?"—I could not hear the reply—the prisoner struck the gentleman on the top of the head with his closed hand, and he fell on his back—the prisoner then picked him up and sat him against the door—he did not remain in that position long—he rolled round and went into the yard through the doorway, but he fell down the steps on to the bricks which the yard is paved with—I cannot say whether he was stunned, but it was a heavy blow that knocked him down—after he fell down the steps the prisoner caught hold of him by the legs, and dragged him out of the yard into the road—the prisoner had a horse and cart at the door—I caught hold of the horse's head and pulled it round—my wife and sister screamed, and I ran out and left the man on the path—I pulled him out of the road</p>

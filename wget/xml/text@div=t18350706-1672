The prisoner lodged a month with me—on the 29th of June I quarrelled with my wife, and when I went home at eight o'clock that night, the prisoner was gone, with my wife, and all the articles stated—I went with the policeman to No. 1, tarling-street—we went up stairs and knocked, and the prisoner came to the door in his shirt—I saw the articles in the room—I said, "These are my goods, and I will have them"—the prisoner said, "I will see you d—e first"—I went in and found my wife undressed, and my child was asleep on the bed.</p>

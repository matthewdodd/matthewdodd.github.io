                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 15, White's Yard, St. Luke's, in the employ of Mr. Axford—I know the prisoner by sight—on 1st Decem<lb></lb>ber, about one o'clock midnight, I went into the Red Lion public-house, at corner of Bath Street, Old Street, with a friend, John Tibbett, who had been drinking, and was evidently drunk—I told him to take care of him<lb></lb>self, as he was in rather queer company—I did not mean the prisoner, but the woman who was with him—the prisoner asked me if I was a policeman, or a <hi rend="italic">copper's mark</hi>, which means a spy—I said that I was neither one nor the other—my friend was hustled by the two women and tried to leave, and the prisoner put his back against the door—I do not know whether the women were with him—they were talking to others as well—I asked the prisoner to let me go by, he refused and I shoved him on one side—the woman he cohabits with caught hold of me and scratched my face—I tried to get away, she made a kick at me and fell—she caught me by the jacket and pulled me down with her—she was drunk—as I fell the prisoner came behind me and stabbed me two blows—I hallooed out that I was stabbed, and he deliberately pulled the knife out and put it in his pocket—the second blow went through my clothes and a handkerchief into my hip-bone—I fell down insensible—I was taken home and Dr. Jarrow attended me—when we first went into the public-house the prisoner was exhibiting a knife four or five inches long, with a black handle, something like a Spanish knife—I was perfectly sober—the prisoner was not sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At which compartment did you enter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The large compartment—the prisoner and the women were in the private box, the small one—that is divided by a wooden partition—my friend said, "Do not stop here, come round to the private side"—we had the conversation</p>

               <p>in the private box, which was overheard—we remained in the private box three or four minutes—when I entered the box where the prisoner and the women were, I did not try to force myself into his company—I did not want to fight him—he did not tell me he did not wish to have anything to say to me—I was perfectly sober—I told him I did not care for him, nor yet for his company—I went into the private box because it was my friend's wish—my friend was very drunk—it was not me who pushed the prisoner out at the door, I pushed him on one side—he was very drunk—I had been into two public-houses before the Red Lion, but only had the share of a pot of porter and the share of a pot of <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi> between ten and twelve o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Red Lion, Old Street, St. Luke's—on 1st December Trahers came in with a friend—the prisoner spoke to him by the private entrance—he came round from the big box into the private box, and forced himself into their company—of course they told him they did not wish to have anything to do with him, they did not want him there—the prisoner said, "I do not wish to have anything to do with you"—Trahers said that he did not care for him, he would fight anybody in the room—the prisoner said, "I am only a boy to you, I cannot fight you"—the prosecutor's friend went out, and he was going to follow him, but the prisoner stood against the door—he pushed it open and they both went outside together, and I saw no more of it—I saw a woman, but she did not interfere inside—I cannot say that the prisoner was exactly sober, he was capable of taking care of himself, and the prosecutor was about the same—I saw no blow struck by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had the prisoner been there half an hour before Trahers came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were then three or four people in the compartment where Trahers and the woman were—I saw no knife in the prisoner's possession—the persons all went out of the private part, but those in the public part kept there—the governor said, "You had better shut the door; it is just upon one o'clock"—there were men in the bar—I heard somebody, not the prisoner, say, "If you interfere with me I will let you have it"—I do not know the prisoner's voice—the prisoner stood against the door when Trahers was leaving, but not quite close—I do not know whether he endeavoured to prevent his leaving; he might ask him to stand on one side.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 86, Central Street, St. Luke's—on 1st December I examined Trahers—he had a punctured wound on the right buttock, an inch and a quarter deep and two inches long, and on the left side below the flank bone he had a wound half an inch deep and an inch long, and a superficial wound on the right eyebrow—they were done with a sharp cutting instrument, which had passed through his jacket and shirt, and through a pocket handkerchief—he lost a very great deal of blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professor of mineralogy, and live in Oxford-street. On the 15th of March I left my shop for a minute or two—when I returned I found the prisoner in the shop, standing against the counter—he offered an old silver coin for sale—in consequence of what my wife said to me, I asked the prisoner if he had seen any person go in or out during the time he had stood in the shop—he said he had not—I then made a search, and told him I had lost four watch keys, and asked if he had seen them—he said, "No"—I kept him there for about half an hour, and sent for a policeman, who found these four watch-keys' on him—they appear to be mine—they are plated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called in—the prosecutor said he had missed four watch keys off his counter, and from the short period he had left the shop, he suspected the prisoner must have them—the prisoner said I might search him—I pulled his jacket on one side, and found the watch keys under his arm.</p>

I felt in my pocket, and missed ten sovereigns out of fifteen. I followed, and never lost sight of her; she crossed the road: I caught hold of her, and said she had robbed me. I took her down the street to a watchman - she put seven sovereigns into my hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't hurt me;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Justice must be done;" I took the sovereigns in my hand to the watchhouse, and said,</p>
               <p>"Before she is searched I will see what I have about me; here are seven - I have five left, and three are missing;" they began to search her; she took out three sovereigns, a shilling, and some halfpence from her pocket - they made up what I had lost.</p>

She did not deny having taken it.</p>

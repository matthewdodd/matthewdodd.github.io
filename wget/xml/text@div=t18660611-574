I live at 7, Gurling-street, Blackheath-hill—on Friday night, 18th May, I was at the Yorkshire Grey public-house, about 12 o'clock—we were all turned Out—two men named Diamond and Sexton were fighting together, and two other men named Quibble and Jeffreys, and while they were fighting, the prosecutor and the prisoner got fighting—a constable then came up and started them all away, and Brown and Jeffreys went away with two young women home—I went into the stables to feed the horses, and soon afterwards the prisoner came in to me and asked me if I would take care of a knife and sixpence for him till the morning—I took the knife and sixpence, and went home—he slept in the stable—I gave the knife to a constable the next morning when they came to my house.</p>

I was at the Yorkshire Grey at turn-out time, whilst Diamond and Sexton were fighting—the prisoner came up to me and said, what was it to do with me, and knocked me down—I was very tipsy at the time, and I don't know who stabbed me—about ten minutes afterwards I found myself stabbed—one stab against my heart, one on the side, and one on the wrist—I was bleeding, and was taken to the station—I was at the hospital three weeks—I am not well—I am not able to do anything.</p>

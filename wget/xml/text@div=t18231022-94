I was cleaning the bar window, between eight and nine o'clock, and saw her in the act of throwing a knife at me, and lowered my head to escape it - it went through the window, and fell into the court. I went on with my work, and in about a quarter of an hour breakfast was ready. I went into the tap-room, and she was cutting bread and butter; she had a knife in her hand, and said, if I said that again she would stick the knife into me.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you said - A. We had had a few words about a female servant, and I said I did not care a d - n about any woman; she said, if I repeated that she would stick me. I made her no answer - my fellow-servant came and caught hold of her, when he heard her say this, as she was making a stab at me - he held her for a moment, and thinking her temper was cooled - he let her go, and she immediately came and made a stab at me as I was in the box. I saw her coming - I rose up, and she stabbed me in the left arm; and using a bad expression, said,</p>
               <p>"I'll do for you." I think the blow was aimed at my body, but I received it in my arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who is Ann - A. The female servant; my wife had accused me of improper conduct with her; she came to me for 5 s., which I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220038"></xptr>allowed her. I desired Yates to go to the back door, and call Ann - she asked what I wanted with Ann.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say I want her to use her, to be sure - A. I never said</p>
               <p>"use;" my wife asked for 5 s. I allowed her - I said she should have it in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say Ann was going away for a week, and you wished to accompany her - A. No; she was bothering me about Ann - I said I did not care a d - n about any woman - she might have struck me in the moment of irritation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after she was cutting the bread and butter did she cut at you - A. She had not put the knife out of her hand. I will not swear there was not more irritating language passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Upper East Smithfield. I had a quantity of brick materials, and part of a forge, in my premises, in Glasshouse-yard—on the 30th of Sept. I directed Arnold to go down, take down part of the forge, and put the bricks in the deposit cellar—he said, "Will you let Trevi<lb></lb>lian help me?"—I said, "Yes"—in the evening they called, and said they were getting on very well; they came again, and said they had done it, taken them down, cleaned the bricks, and put them into the deposit cellar, and they had turned out very well—I heard reports, and went down to Wood, the carman—he told me something—I went to Mr. Harwood's house, where the bricks had been sold, and Trevilian was working there—I spoke to him—he said he was very sorry, that he and Arnold had sold the bricks for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to Mr. Harwood, and he was working part of them then, and Arnold and he divided the money, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. apiece—Trevilian begged earnestly for mercy, and hoped I should not prosecute him—I told him I must—<lb></lb>as soon as I had locked him up, I went home, and sent for Arnold—he came in—I had the policeman there—I said, "Is it true'that you have packed the bricks up in the vault?"—he said, "They are there"—I said, "Have you sold any?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You have," and I gave him in charge—he begged for mercy, and said he hoped I should not hurt him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker. Trevilian came to me on Tuesday evening, the lstof Oct., and told roe he knew a person who had got a few bricks to sell—I asked what be wanted for them—he said 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Do you think they are worth the money?"—he said, "Yes, I know they are"—I said, "If they are worth the money, buy them for me, you know better than I do"—he said, "How am I to convey them down?"—I said, "There is Mr. Chatham has got a horse and cart, I dare say you can get them by that"—the next morning the bricks came, and were got down by Mr. Chatham's man—I never bought bricks before—I was repairing—I left all to Trevilian.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mineral-water traveller, of 128, Caledonian Road—on the evening of 5th February I was in Great Suffolk Street, Borough soliciting orders from my old customers—I had come by <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> from London Bridge Station; it was about 7.30—I was walking along Suffolk Street and these three men followed me; Reets and Hatfield got my hands behind me and held me there and pressed me back and Smith put his hands in both my pockets—they did not say anything—I struggled as hard as I could—they pushed me into the doorway of a little cigar shop—I had 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pockets, they took 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and left one in my pocket—my money was safe when I got out of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and was walking down the street; I felt them take it—this did not take two minutes—I had never seen them before—they all three ran away—I only had an opportunity of seeing them while they were doing it—I have no doubt at all about their identity—I went to the Borough police-station and gave information, and then went home—I afterwards had a telegram that same evening—I went to the station and there recognised the three prisoners—they were in a passage-way with several others—my money consisted of three or four half-crowns, two or three florins, and the remainder in shillings—it was about 7.30 in the evening as near as I can recollect.</p>

I do not travel for myself, for a Mr. Tucker—I had not been to work that day, I was to start on the Monday—I had been laid up for a month—I had been into two public-houses, one at the corner of Southwark Bridge Road, about 6.15—I was there about ten minutes—I had nothing to drink there—the other was the Duchess of Edinburgh in Great Suffolk Street, a new house, about 7 o'clock—I had a glass of ale there, nothing else—I was then walking along Great Suffolk Street—the cigar shop that they pushed me into is at the corner of a little narrow turning; there was no man in the shop, only two young ladies—I did not go in there after this, I went to the police-station—I think it was about 10 o'clock when I saw the prisoners at the station—they told me to go to the Bermondsey police-station and I went there; that was the fault of the people there—there were five or six other men besides the prisoners when I picked them out.</p>

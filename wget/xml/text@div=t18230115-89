            . On the 19th of December, the prisoner came into my father's shop, King-street, Smithfield, for a half-quartern loaf, and gave me a shilling; I thought it was bad, and took it to my father, who asked where she got it; she said, in the market, that she lived in St. Giles's, but could not tell the name of the street, she mentioned two or three places; my father desired me to search her, but she resisted so much, I could not - he then attempted it, and I saw a paper in her hand, which she took from under her arm; I soon after saw the same paper on the ground with another bad shilling in it.</p>

            . I am a constable; the prisoner came into my shop, and offered a counterfeit shilling; my daughter brought it to me in the parlour; I went forward and asked if she had another, she said,</p>
               <p>"No," I said, that was bad, and I should not suffer her to go, but should search her; she made a great resistance. I found nothing in her pockets, I wished my daughter to search her bosom; she forced her arm down her bosom, and took a paper from under her arm, she dropped it in the struggle; it contained a bad shilling; I marked them both, and produce them; she gave me two false addresses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a walking-stick manufacturer, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. I have a manufactory in Turville-street, about 400 yards from my dwelling-house. On 6th Dec., I fastened it up at half-past eight o'clock at night—all the articles were secure—I went there from information about nine the same evening—I missed all the things mentioned in this indictment, partly that evening and partly the next morning, and the things were all strewed about—amongst other things a cash-box was gone—I saw that again about eight days afterwards—it was produced by Sergeant Teakle, and the same evening I saw these two sticks—I can identify one stick, and this other I believe to be mine—I lost two dozen of this description—I know this cash-box, by a bruise it has at the bottom from a fall—the value of all I lost was about 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my warehouse is in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a parasol-maker, and live in Talbot-court, Gracechurch-street. I had heard of this robbery, and on the morning of Friday, 13th Dec., I met a man named Gerrard, whom I knew from his using a public-house—I had some conversation with him about the rob<lb></lb>bery, and in consequence of what he said I went to the prisoner's house which is near to the Loggerheads, at the back of Shoreditch Church—a sort of smith works at the house—I got there about one o'clock—I saw the prisoner there, and the man who was with me told her he had brought me to look at the sticks, and ferrules, and stick mounts—I do not know that she made any answer, but she stood by—the goods laid on the bed, covered with a cloth—I believe the man took off the cloth—I saw the goods, he offered them to me for sale—he asked if I would buy them—I asked him how many there were—he said about two dozen—I said I was not prepared to buy them then, but I would let him know in the course of the day—I saw this stick that the prosecutor has identified, and about two dozen others—there was some whispering between the man and the pri<lb></lb>soner, but I do not know what they said—I did not say anything to her about coming there again, but I agreed with the man to meet him the same evening at a beer-shop in Kingsland-road: the prisoner heard that—I saw caps, and collars, and ferrules on the bed—I went directly to Mr. Thorp, and communicated all this, and also to Sergeant Teakle—I went in the evening to meet the man, and he did not come.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 8). I saw the last witness on 13th Dec.—I went to the place be has described, but I found no property—the prisoner was at home, I asked her if the room belonged to her—she said it did—I went into the cellar and found these two sticks—I returned and asked the prisoner where the other sticks were—she said she did not know, and she did not know these two were in the cellar—I then looked under a child's bed which was by the side of her own bed, and found this cash-box which Mr. Thorp immediately claimed—I told the prisoner the charge, and said I must take her—she made no further remark—I did not ask her about the cash-box.</p>

About half-past two on the morning of the 19th of January I was on duty in White Lion Street, Spital-fields—I saw the prisoner coming from the prosecutor's shop, 25, White Lion Street, which is at the corner of Wheeler Street—I saw him stand in a dark corner of a door—I passed down the street, stood back in an<lb></lb>other doorway, and watched him—I saw him go into Commercial Street, turn round, cross over to the opposite side, and come back to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's shop—he then went to the corner of Wheeler Street, out of my sight—I went through Church Street Passage and saw him standing at the shop in Wheeler Street, with a shutter down in his hand—the window was broken, and his hand was partly in it—these boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were outside the shop, on the stones, under the window—I took hold of him—he immediately said, "Look here, here is a window broken"—I said, "Yes, it is you that did it"—he said, "No, you can say what you like, I did not do it"—I took him to the station—I searched him and found this knife and tobacco box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pane was forced open, and there were three marks on the window-frame which exactly corresponded with the knife.</p>

I am employed by the Treasury in the Mint prosecu<lb></lb>tions—on the morning of 6th April I went to 3, Alfred Place, Salisbury Street, Bermondsey, with Inspector Bryant and other officers—I saw the prisoner's side face at the window, as I was going up Alfred Place—there is a little fore-court in front—I opened the gate and went in—the house had two rooms—I knocked at the door—the prisoner put his head out of the window, and then came down—I said "Well, Goodwin, I want you, you are suspected of dealing in counterfeit coin; I come here with a warrant, you are entitled to have it read, if you like"—I saw a file on the table at that time, and I picked it up—when I said he was entitled to have the warrant read, he said "What is the use of that, Mr. Brannan"—it was about 7.30—he was partly dressed—I heard footsteps up stairs and I ran up, leaving the prisoner in Bryant's custody—I was a very short time there when Bryant said "Brannan, come down; I think you will find what we came for down here"—he directed my attention to half a bag of plaster of Paris, which was on a little shelf—I was going out, and Bryant pointed to a saucepan which Stood by a little water-butt—the prisoner said "You b old villain, if You find anything in that saucepan you must have put it there yourself"—I had not mentioned the saucepan before that, nor had anyone else—I went to the saucepan, it was full of cinders—I brought it in and emptied the contents on the table, and I found this little water proof bag, which con<lb></lb>tained 26 counterfeit half-crowns, 6 florins, 60 shillings, and 42 sixpences:</p>

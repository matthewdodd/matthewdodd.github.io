                  </hi>. I live at Grange-road, Bermondsey. On a Sunday night, at the end of last month, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was coming down Bermondsey New-road, and turned into a gateway to make water—while there, I was attacked by three persons, who came from behind me—they laid hold of me, caught hold of my watch, and made a tug—the prisoner was one of them—I had never, to my knowledge, seen him before—it was a bright moonlight night—I cannot tell which of them it was that laid hold of my watch—they got the watch away, it broke from the guard which I had in my hand—they knocked me down, and robbed me—they were all close together—they got 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a crown-piece, two half-crowns, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, and a knife which was in the same pocket as my money—they took the watch before they threw me down—I hallooed out for the police, and two of them ran away—I was down when the policeman came—he went after the prisoner, and brought him back—I went to the station, and saw this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which is the one I lost, found on him—I have never seen the watch or other property since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Bermondsey, and am an umbrella-maker. I know this knife to be the prosecutor's—I have had it in my hand a great many times—we did not work together, but he is a friend of mine, and came and sat down two or three hours where I was at work.</p>

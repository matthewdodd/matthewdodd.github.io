               <p>On Sabbath-day evening, about five and twenty minutes after seven, I had notice a window was broke; I thought it was one of the Meeting windows, but on examination I found it was not; I went out immediately into the yard, and met a suspicious person at the Meeting-yard door; I looked at his face, he looked at me at the same time; I came in, and then went up stairs; and there is a window just above these stairs; I looked through the window, and I saw a man there, looking about the corner of this house of the prosecutrix's; I thought good then to go and get an assistant; I went to the person who attends the place with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130023"></xptr>me, and I told him, there is a suspicious person in the yard, if you will go along with me, we will see the event of it; immediately when we went out in the yard there was a whistle, as an alarm, from some, I suppose, belonging to this connection; we went and searched this window, and the door likewise, and we found nothing amiss; and while we were searching the window the prisoner burst out of the parlour, through the window; he had bolted himself in; I seized him directly, and with the assistance of the other servant we dragged him out of the house, and we carried him from thence into the vestry: after I had delivered him up to some people to keep him safe, I went back again to see how the house stood; under the window we dragged him out of I picked up a silver watch; this was immediately as I was coming back to get ready some little refreshment to the minister, as is customary after divine service is done; I picked up the other watch by the door of the vestry, through which the prisoner had passed; this was the outer vestry, and he was in the inner vestry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say, before the magistrate, that you found me under the window? - I did not; I am sure he was actually coming out of the window: my Lord, I have sworn it, and would testify the same again.</p>

               <p>Was you ever in that place of worship before? - I frequently frequent Mr. Romaine's, in Blackfriars, and these people are of the same persuasion; I live at No. 20, Cow-cross-street.</p>

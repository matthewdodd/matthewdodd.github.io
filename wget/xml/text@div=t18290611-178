On the 21st of April I had been out, and when I returned, I put out my money on the table; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110078"></xptr>one of the sovereigns, which a child of mine had made a mark on - I had some altercation with him about it; it was thrown into the till by itself - I know this is it; I should know it if it was among thousands; the prisoner had 4s. a week, and board and lodging - he was with me on the 21st of April.</p>
               <p>ANN BRONKHURST.

               <p>JOHN ROBINSON. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found on him thirty-one sovereigns and 11s. 7d.; I asked him what he had got - he said a little money, 7s. or 8s., and twenty sovereigns; here is the marked sovereign among them.</p>
               <p>ADOLPHUS BRONKHURST. This is the sovereign - it has a spot of quicksilver on it; I saw it put into the till, and it was missed next morning.</p>

               <p>ANN BRONKHURST. The two children were sitting by me, and one said, "See what George has done," and he said he should soon take the nose off; I put the sovereign into the till, and missed it in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Sometimes the prisoner has bought things for you? A. Yes - he bought bread, butter, and other things - it was generally out of the money he took in the day; I had the highest opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor has been in the habit of giving me money to get change; they gave me two sovereigns one night, and I could not get change - I gave my mistress 1l. 19s. 6d., and said I would owe her 6d. till the morning; I have sold them a great deal of earthenware - what money I got I took care of: I have sold a great deal to the neighbours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Secretary to the City of London Freehold Land Society, No. 79, Fairingdon-street. On 24th Nov., in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the office—he asked for a copy of the rules of the society—the price of them is 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me half a crown, to pay.—I took it, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was just dusk—the clerk was gone to turn the gas on—when the prisoner got the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he said he was told they were but 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, Can't you let me have them for 2<hi rend="italic">d?</hi> I said, We don't wish you to have them; and I was about to take up the money, and he said, Never mind, he would take them—I had been about to take the money up, and give him the half crown; but he put down 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he would take them—I looked at the shillings he had put down, but it was dark; and I tried one with my teeth, and found it was bad—the prisoner had left the room, and was going down—I, knowing the clerk was in the passage, called to him to stop him—during that time I still kept the whole of the money in my hand—I proceeded down stairs, and by that time the prisoner had stopped near the front door—he said, What do you want with me?—I said, Just come back, you have changed one of these</p>

               <p>these things; I had been out of employ ten months, and was not able to shillings—I directed the clerk to fetch an officer; and when the prisoner got up stairs, I asked him who sent him for the rules—he had told me before that he had been sent for them—I asked him who was his master—he said he had no master—I said, You said you were sent—he said, So I was, in a manner of speaking—I said, What do you mean by a manner of speaking?—he said, I want them for my brother and myself—I said, Where does your brother live <hi rend="italic">V</hi>—he said, I believe in the country; and after that he said he was at work at Sydenham, as a carpenter—I asked what he was doing—he said, Nothing—the officer arrived soon after, and I gave him into custody—when the prisoner came into the room, I took the money which I gave him out of a bowl, in which there were two shillings, two sixpences, and some coppers—I have no doubt for a moment that the two shillings I gave him were good—the bad shilling that he returned to me struck me directly I had had the bowl in my hand.</p>

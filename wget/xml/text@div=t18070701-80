               <p>Q. Was the lead that was so produced to you by the officer, such lead as you had about the premises. - A. I had great reason to believe it was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You are the superintendent on the building. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the building done on contract. - A. No, there is two master plumbers employed. We have a quantity of old lead, and we have erected a casting house there. The old lead is delivered to the two master plumbers, and they melt it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 26th of May the two prisoners were employed there. - A. Yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weaver, and live at 54, Green-street, Bethnal Green. On Tuesday, 1st June, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the street by my house, and saw the prisoner coming along the street standing in a cart drawn by two horses, one before the other—he had no reins attached to the horses, and I did not notice any whip—he was going about three miles an hour—as the cart was coming along, my grandmother, Sarah Millo, was trying to cross the road by herself—she was eighty-three years Old—she was about a yard from the kerb she had just left—I thought she was in danger, and cried out to the prisoner, "Stop!"—he hallooed out, "<hi rend="italic">Whoa! whoa</hi>!" and jumped out of the cart immediately—his crying out did not have the effect of stopping the horses—several of us hallooed out together, which made the horses go faster—the first horse knocked my grandmother down, and the wheel passed over her—the prisoner did not jump out before my grandmother was knocked down—it was almost instantaneously—as soon as she was knocked down, he jumped out—I picked her up—she was unable to speak—I took her into a doctor's—he was not at home, and she was put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and taken to the London Hospital, but she died before she got there—the body was left there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk-weaver, and live at 56, Green-street. On the evening of 1st June I was at work in the shop, and heard the prisoner calling out to his horses, "<hi rend="italic">Whoa</hi>!" which caused me to look through the window, and I saw the young man in the cart with a whip in his hand, and the deceased was about five yards away from the front of the leading horse—she was in the act of leaving the kerb to cross the road, behind the cart that was standing close to the kerb—she attempted to cross the road, the leading horse knocked her down, and the wheel passed over her left side—it went over her clothes, but I cannot say whether it went over her person—I did not see that the prisoner had any reins—I helped to take the woman to the doctor's—she was insensible—when I first saw the horses they were going at a very slow walking pace, but there was so much hallooing from the persons by who saw the danger, that no doubt it caused them to go faster.</p>

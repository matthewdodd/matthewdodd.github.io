                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On the 18th of June, I was lodging at the Neptune coffee-house, and saw the prisoner there—I went with him to the Royal Crown—I had two sovereigns in ray left hand trowsers' pocket—the prisoner sat at my left hand side—after some tune I missed the two sovereigns—I told the prisoner I had lost my money—he said perhaps I had dropped it—Caroline Fox, who was there, gave me information, but not in his presence—the prisoner told me to look for it—Turtle, who was there, said he had seen the prisoner's hand in my pocket—a policeman was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the public-house—the prisoner sat on the prosecutor's left-hand side—I kept touching the prosecutor's foot under the table, to draw his attention, as I observed the prisoner trying to put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket—I saw him at last put his hand in, then draw his hand up to his waistcoat, but I did not see him put it into his own pocket, it was done too quick—his hand passed by his right-hand waist<lb></lb>coat pocket—the prosecutor missed his money—I told him to lock the door, for I knew where the money went to—the prisoner was searched in</p>

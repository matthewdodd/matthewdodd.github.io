                  </hi>. I live at 71, Beresford-street, Woolwich, and am the wife of Henry Thomas Young—on the evening of 12th September, I was going to a butcher's shop in Beresford-square, and a dog came running up to me—I stooped down to pat the dog, and felt something touch my elbow—I turned round to look, and saw the prisoner at my side—he held his head down, and walked sharply away across the road—I missed my purse which I had put in my pocket the moment before—I ran across the road, stopped the prisoner, and taxed him with taking my money—I said, "If you will give it to me I will let you go"—he said nothing, but ran away as hard as he could—I met two policemen and said, "Run, for that man has taken my money"—I have no doubt in the least that the prisoner is the man; I could see his countenance—they caught him about three minutes afterwards—he did not get out of my sight.</p>

I took the prisoner on Saturday the 12th, about half-past 10 o'clock—I saw the last witness running after him—she gaud, "Stop that man, he has stolen my purse"—the prisoner continued running; he looked round, and seeing me after him, be ran much faster than before—I caught him about a hundred yards from where I saw him first—I told him he was charged with stealing the purse—he said he did not know anything about it—I took him to the station, and found 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his pocket—he said there that he was running to catch the train at the Dockyard—he afterwards said he was running to catch the boat to North Woolwich, to go by the train to London.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the defendant Lawrence - A Yes, I understand he is a working watchmaker. On the 21st of April, last year, he came to my mother's shop, he brought two chains and wanted four pounds ten on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they the appearance of gold chains - A. Exactly; it was impossible at the time for me to discover the fraud. I asked him what they weighed, his answer was, two ounces, or exactly the weight which they did weigh; I put it in the scales and found it correspond exactly. If I had considered them to be base metal I should not have thought them worth two shillings. There is one I cleaned up, it does not look half so well as when brought in; they are made precisely the same as a gold chain, I lent him four pounds on them; Lawrence was alone at that time. On the 6th of May he came again alone, he brought me two more chains nearly the same passed as before, I lent him four guineas on them, they had the appearance and fashion of gold chains so as to deceive me. On the 3d of June he came again and brought two more, he got four pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190062"></xptr>on them, they were exactly like the others: on the 10th of June he came alone and brought two more, he had three pound ten on them; on the 20th of October he came again and brought three chains, I lent him six pound on them. On the latter end of that month I had occasion to go to the drawer, I had a great quantity, upon that I opened them, I found the deception, they had changed colour, I found they were base metal. These chains could not have been made for any other purpose than to deceive, they are not fit to wear for in two or three days they would turn black. The prisoner never redeemed any of them.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of the discovery you made you caused Raxter to be apprehended two or three days afterwards - A. Yes. These chains were so made that they deceived me with aquafortis. At the time I took some of them in I tried them with aquafortis, and they deceived me. There is not a grain of gold in the metal; I had an essay made, I should suppose there is some pewter mixed with it.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the prisoner Raxter coming to Mr. Read's to pledge chains - A. Yes, she came first to me on the 11th of April, last year, she brought one chain, two pound I lent on it, she said she brought it from her brother. At the time I received it it appeared to me to be a gold chain, I weighed it, the weight corresponded with the weight of a gold chain, it is not a gold chain. On the same day the prisoner Lawrence came and brought two others, I lent him four pound on them; the chain that she and he brought were of the same appearance and make, and every thing exactly the same. On the 18th of April Lawrence came and brought two other chains, I lent him three guineas and a half, I weighed them at the time they appeared to be gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they gold - A. They are not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 11th of April was it pawned by Lawrence or Raxter - A. By Lawrence, I did not see Raxter that day. On the 25th of May Lawrence came and brought one chain, upon which I lent him one pound fifteen shillings, I weighed that. On the 13th of October he came again; brought two gold chains, for which I lent him four pounds. On the 22nd of September, last year, the woman Raxter came, brought one chain, upon which I lent her a guinea and a half, I weighed that, she gave the name of

            , and said she brought it from her brother. On the 30th of the same month she brought another chain, I lent her two pound, and the 3d of October two chains, four pound, on the 7th of October she brought three chains, I lent her six pound eight shillings; on the 27th of October two chains, I lent her three guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe after that Mr. Read made a discovery of these things not being gold - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take in all these chains upon the footing of their being gold - A. I did, I weighed them all as gold in the presence of Raxter and Lawrence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were ever any of them redeemed by Raxter or or Lawrence - A. No. On the 2nd of November Raxter came again, we stopped her, I went out and shut the door and brought a constable in, I found the prisoner Lawrence at the door, he ran away, she was examined before the alderman on the 6th of November, and while she was being examined Lawrence was apprehended in Guildhall-yard upon this charge of fraud; Lawrence then said the chains were his, and he had sent Raxter with them. All the chains were precisely the same sort of metal; I was deceived.</p>
               <p>MR. READ. Q. Your young man has told us that he went out to fetch a constable the last time Rexter came - A. Yes. I told her I stopped her in consequence of her bringing a great number of chains, she said they did not belong to her; I told her if she could produce the person to whom they did belong, that was all I wanted; previous to that she said they belonged to her brother, she then said they belonged to a friend, she did not know where he lived for the last three years. While she was under examination at Guildhall the officer proposed to go out into the yard, as it was most likely the man was waiting about there; in consequence of that my young man went out and he was brought in; he said the chains belong to him, she did not contradict him; he did not tell where he lived that time, said he was a journeyman watch-maker.</p>
               <p>HENRY CHAMBAUD. I am a working goldsmith. I have examined a few of the chains, when you see a few of the chains you see the whole, they are all alike, they are made in imitation of gold, I have no doubt for the express purpose of deception; they are polished, the expence of polishing them is a needless expence, unless to make them pass for gold; gold chains are not polished. I have essayed one of them, there is not a grain of gold in them at all.</p>

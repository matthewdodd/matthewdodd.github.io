                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live in Plummer's-row, City-road. The prisoner was our porter for twenty-one months—he lived and lodged in the house—about eleven o'clock on Sunday, the 21st of July, he came home after having been out—in consequence of something on the Monday morning I sent for a policeman, and went with him and the prisoner to the prisoner's bed-room—I directed the policeman to search his boxes—one was locked, and the other not—the policeman asked him for the key, and he gave it him readily—he unlocked the box, and found the articles stated, which are my property, and had been in the shop.</p>

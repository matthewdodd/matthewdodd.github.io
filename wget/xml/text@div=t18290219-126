            . I am a servant out of place. I saw Mr. Simpson in Ludgate-street, and saw the prisoner's hand in his pocket: as I laid hold of him he had got the handkerchief out, and was concealing it; when I took him he dropped it: I took him on to Mr. Simpson, who claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You was on the other side of the way? A. Yes; just by the church; I went right across to him - there was another lad with him.</p>

No; I immediately laid hold of the prisoner, and another struck me on the head with a stick; the man who took my watch was standing it to the prisoner; then the prisoner got away from me, and I followed him across Whitechapel-road into Fieldgate-street, and there the watchman took him and brought him to the watch-house; I never lost fight of him; I have never seen my watch since.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Hart. Q. What are you? - A. A tailoress: Last Saturday night was four weeks, the prisoner was coming through Black-lion-yard, with some meat in his hand, he was before me, whistling and singing; when I came to the corner of the yard, there seemed, as I thought, as fight; the prisoner said, please to clear the way; then a man came up and struck him on the head with a stick, which knocked his hat off, and then he ran away; this man in blue, the prosecutor, then came up and laid hold of him; he said he would have him right or wrong; he said he would have his life; that is all I know.</p>

            Was there any body in company with the prisoner? - A. Not a soul, only me behind him, it appeared to be a fight; I did not know the young man before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020217-29-verdict155" type="verdictDescription">

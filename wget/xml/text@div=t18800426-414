                  </hi>. I am a commission merchant, of 87, South Oastle Street, Liverpool—in September, 1879, the prisoner accepted this bill, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Macedo at Couvilha, in Portugal, dated 2nd September, 1879, upon W.

Dyson and Co.—it is discounted "Gleim, Brettauer, and Co.," for collection by Smith, Payne, and Co., at their district bank, King Street, Manchester—it became due 9th September—on 24th December, I saw the prisoner in London—he said, "I shall not he able to meet this acceptance at maturity; if you give me another acceptance, I shall be able to discount it, and with the proceeds take up this bill for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I received ibis letter, dated 24th December, from the prisoner, en<lb></lb>closing this acceptance for 433<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., asking me to return it accepted wrote this letter in reply, enclosing the bill accepted: "We have your letter of the 24th inst, and herewith return the enclosed draft for 433<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., account Macedo, which kindly discount, and take up your acceptance for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., due 99th inst, as arranged.

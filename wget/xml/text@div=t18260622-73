            . I am married - my husband is a porter and carman - we live at Charing-cross - the prisoner is my brother. On the day after Christmas-day I went to my brother's room to dinner, and Mr. Butterton said"Mr. Dexter, never want money while there is any thing that will fetch it, as I know I shall get it again." I was here before when Mr. Eady robbed my mother; I never heard of John Dexter being here before - it was in the other Court - he has been out of the country, but I think not quite seven years.</p>

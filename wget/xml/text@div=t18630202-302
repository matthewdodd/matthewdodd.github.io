I am a clerk in the service of the Midland Railway Company at their office at the Castle and Falcon, Alderagate-street—the prisoner has been in their employment for about two years as a canvasser for orders—he occasionally collected money for the company—in July last an account was owing from the Equitable Gas Company—I made out this invoice, and gave it to the prisoner to collect the money—it was his duty to pay it over to me at once, on receiving it—he has never accounted for it—I spoke to him about it, and in the first instance, he said the foreman of the works was down at Brighton, doing some work there, and he could not see him—I told him to call again—he represented that he had done so on another occasion, and then said they objected to the charge; that the rate was too high—I asked him several times about it, and he always denied having received the money.</p>

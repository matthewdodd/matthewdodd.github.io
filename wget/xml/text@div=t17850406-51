               <p>I live at Edmonton, I am a plumber and glazier, and I happened to be the constable; the prisoner Sams came to my house, to know if I would buy some lead, that was the 2d of March, he said a gentleman had failed in the house, and his mother had washed for him, and the gentleman had given them lead out of a cooler, he said the plumber at Endfield would not give them money enough, and his father was at the Rose and Crown, I told him to bring it, and he brought it the same morning; I informed Mr. Erwood the Churchwarden; I opened the lead, and saw what it was, and in going out of the house, along with the prisoner Sams, he pointed to the other prisoner, says he, that is my brother, he was waiting at the corner of the street for Sams, the lead was three quarters weight, he brought it to me wrapped up in a garden matt, Anderson directly as soon as he saw Mr. Erwood and me coming, ran up the street, he was stopped; I examined it afterwards, and it is the lead that came off that dormer window, which the prosecutor mentioned; I have the particular marks of the dots of the solder, which I can mention, the nails in taking if off, are drawn out, here are the nails that answer to the solder.</p>

            . I am a constable. At about ten o'clock in the morning of the 23rd of May, I was just going out of my door, and saw the prisoner at the bar running from the corner of Limehouse Causeway; I stood at the corner of the house seeing him run with a hat in a handkerchief in his hand; I was preparing myself to have a run after him. When I heard the cry of stop thief, I immediately pursued him, and when he had got about half way across a field, he threw away the hat, which I picked up in pursuing him. In a moment, I missed him, and found him again up an alley, where there is no thoroughfare. On searching him, I found a socket chisel on him, which has been bent for the purpose of prizing things. I took him to the watchhouse, and gave the hat to the night-beadle. We went afterwards, and found marks where the window had been prized up, which this chissel exactly fitted. The window had one line broke, and would not slide easy.</p>

On 31st Oct., about eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another person in White Lion-street, Pentonville, at the door of a marine-store shop—he was speaking to the other person, who went away, and the prisoner went into the shop—I went away, came back in about two minutes, and met him coming out of the shop with these two pick<lb></lb>axes, without handles, under his arm—he said he had been working at a sewer, at Holloway, and gave a false name and address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Jonas and George Gregson, contractors for the Birmingham Junction Railway—the prisoner was in their employ, as a labourer, at a shed at Ball's-pond—he had to stop after the other men were gone, to trim lamps—he had nothing to do with the pickaxes—these pickaxes produced belong to Messrs. Gregson—there is "O" on them in white paint, which has been tried to be rubbed out—they have a peculiar eye—we had seventy-two, and missed three—they were ordered specially; I never saw such anywhere else.</p>

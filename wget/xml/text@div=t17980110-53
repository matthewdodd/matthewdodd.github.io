               <p>JOHN BECKHAM sworn. - I am a patrol; on Tuesday the 26th of December, I was going down Cow-cross, between five and six in the evening, I saw three men running down with firkins of butter upon their shoulders, there were three, I am sure, there might be more than three, they were coming from St. John's-street; I called at a house in Cow-cross, to call my partner Coltman, we both ran down Cow-cross, to the corner of Benjamin-street, they were then out of sight; we turned up Benjamin-street, and went through Falconer's-alley, one end of Falconer's-alley came into Cow-cross; I turned my head round, and looked down Sharp's-alley, and saw a man running along with a tub upon his shoulder, he was about thirty yards from me; he turned down Jacob's-court, and we ran down Jacob's-court after him, and saw a door open, we ran in there, and into the fore room, the door was open, there were four men in the house; I saw two tubs standing in the corner of the room, and one of the men was knocking one of the tubs to pieces, the woman at the bar was in the room, blowing the fire, I asked her whose property those were, and I think she said, they belonged to her, I will not be certain; I was rather afraid of myself; because I had not a cutlass, nor a stick, I believe she said it belonged to her, I cannot be certain; then they all asked us to drink, and she amongst the rest, I told her I would not drink any thing; three of the men then went out, the other man was the prisoner at the bar, he remained in the room; my partner went out after the other men, and left me with the prisoners, I secured them and the butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, that the prisoner was one of the men that you saw running with the firkin upon his shoulder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a court is this? - A.There is only that one house inhabited; I had known the woman before for these six or seven years, she has lived about the parish these six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that she lived in this house? - A. I knew she lived that way, but I did not know she lived in that house; she is a disorderly woman upon the town, I have seen her go into the court several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had that court been deserted? - A. About a week or more; Coltman came back, and we took the two prisoners to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is Long-lane in the City of London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not this court in the City of London? - A. No; in St. John's parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that as a fact? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw but three men? - A.There might be more.</p>
               <p>Q. And the three men, when you went into the room, ran away? - A. Three of the men ran away; I do not know that they were the same men.</p>

             sworn. - Beckham called me, and I went after him to see for these men; I went with him down Cow-cross, toward's Sharp's-alley, and he had lost sight of them; we went into Falconer's-alley, and then we turned to the right-hand out of Falconer's-alley; I saw a man coming out of Sharp's-alley, and turned to the left-hand, towards Jacob's court, he had a tub upon his shoulder; we went down Jacob's-court, and crossed over the street after him; we turned down Jacob's-court, and there was a door open, and we went in, we lost sight of him, I suppose, for a yard and a half, or two yards, so that I did not see him go in, the passage door was wide open, the parlour door was not shut, but put to; we went into the room, there I saw four men, a woman, and two firkins of butter; I asked the woman whose property that was, there was a man knocking one of them to pieces, he had got two or three of the hoops off, and the head was dropped in upon the butter; she made a reply, that it was her's, and she said, d-n it, let us have some gin; I said, I did not want any, I had got a shilling, and if I wanted gin, I could buy some for myself; I proceeded towards the butter that stood at the corner of the room, and three of the men went out, I went out after them, and was knocked down by a brick-bat, or stone, or something of that kind, I suppose it to be a brick, it came from a man who stood about a yard and a half, or two yards from the door; when I went out, on the right-hand side, there was no lamp in the court, but one at the end of it; I got up again, and called out to my partner, to detain the two prisoners that were in the room, and seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100075"></xptr>no more of them, I came back again, and went into the room; my partner took the man, and one of the firkins of butter to the watch-house, and left the woman and the other firkin in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner that was knocking the firkins to pieces? - A. No, it was one of the three that went out; we have got the butter in our possession now. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Savage. These are my firkins, they have my mark upon them, S. A. in a circle.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. All your firkins are marked in the same way, I suppose? - A. Yes; but there is a chalk mark upon the back of these, they were going to two different houses, one is marked with a D, and the other with an I, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you mark them yourself? - A. No; I saw my man mark them, I am sure they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What butter was it? - A.York butter.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Coltman). Q. Did you know the woman prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where she lived? - A. I did not know where she lived at that time, I believe there were no other inhabitants in the court but herself; she was the servant, I believe, of the man who rented these houses before.</p>
               <p>Jones. These are part of what was delivered to me by my master.</p>
               <p>Coltman cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did not you ask whose house it was? - A. No; the first question we put was, whose property that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that poor boy at the bar stand? - A. Just opposite the door; the person that was working at the butter I knew very well; the prisoner, at Hatton-garden, said, that he had heard a noise, that the patrole were gone in, and he went in to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. The poor man might have run from the house if he had pleased? - A. I do not know but he might, if my partner had not come back again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Leigh's defence. Coming home on Tuesday evening, I saw this woman standing at the corner of Jacob's-court, she caught hold of me, and asked me if I would give her any gin; I said, I would; I gave her one shilling to go for some gin; while she was gone for the gin, in came these three people with the firkins of butter; these two patroles followed them in at the same time; they ran out directly, and I never saw them after; the three men stood some time talking to the patroles before they made their escape.</p>

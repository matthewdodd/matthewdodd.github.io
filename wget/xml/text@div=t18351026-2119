                  </hi>. I am a cork-cutter, and live in Fenchurch-street, in the perish of St. Catherine Coleman. On the morning of the 8th of October, about a quarter before six o'clock, I went down-stairs to open the door to Bull, who came to work—when I came down-stairs to open the door I saw a man in the cork shavings, under the bench of the workshop—he appeared to be asleep—it was the prisoner—before I awoke him the constable came in—I had sent for him—we awoke the prisoner—one of the officers was at the door at the time Bull rang to be let in, and Bull and the officer shook the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house—he appeared to be asleep all the way almost—we looked about, and found a great many things missing, particularly from the dining-room—my family consists of myself and my housekeeper, and I had a friend at my house—the housekeeper went to bed last the night before—I had not been awake long before I came down—it was not very dark when I got up—it was a little after six o'clock—I saw Bull when he came in—it was light enough to see his features—I was the first person up in the morning—I did not know any thing was stolen at that time, but they sent for me to come to the watch-house, to see the prisoner—the officer searched his pockets, and found a silver snuff-box and some other little trifles.</p>

               <p>a quarter before six o'clock—master had got down-stairs before me—I heard the workman ring the bell—I did not see master open the door—I did not see the prisoner before he was taken away—as soon as he was taken out of the house, I looked about and found two squares of glass broken, and an entrance made at the back—one square was broken in the counting-house window, and the other in the counting-house door—they were not taken out, but broken quite sufficiently to put a hand through—the counting-house window is in the yard—the counting-house door opens into the shop-there is a fastening to the counting-house window, which they could undo, by putting a hand through the broken window, and open the sash, and then get into the counting-house—I know that window was fastened the night before—I examined the house, and missed twenty-two pieces of bed furniture out off the dining-room, a silk shawl, a silk pocket-handkerchief, and other property, which the officer has—the value of all the property, I suppose, is between 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not removed from the house—there was a silver cruet-stand and other things—a bag, containing some of the property, was found in the shop—the bed furniture was in that bag—the bag belongs to the prose<lb></lb>cutor—it was very near the street door.</p>

Mr. Hum took the candle and saw him himself—I stopped at the street door to look for an officer, and</p>

               <p>saw Briggs, the watchman, walking towards our house—I made a signal to him, and he immediately came into the shop, and in my presence took the prisoner out—I delivered him to him—after he was taken away, I went back into the yard—I found the yard door shut, but not bolted—when I got into the yard, I found a few particles of glass under the count<lb></lb>ing-house window—they appeared not broken by accident, as the nearest corner to a brass fastening within, was cut out—any body could get into the house by these means—in coming round again into the passage, I found a corner of a square of glass cut out nearest to the lock of that counting-house door—a hand could be put through there to open it, as the key was in the lock—the prisoner is the man who was under the bench—I did not know him before, but I believe I have seen the same man looking at the window, as I thought, like other persons, looking at the men at work—when I found him, he had the appearance of a man being fast asleep from liquor, or something—as soon as he found an officer was coming, he began to tumble himself out of his place, and got up.</p>

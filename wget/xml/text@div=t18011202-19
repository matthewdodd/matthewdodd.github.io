             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Burbridge, No. 7, Little Bath-street, Cold Bath Fields, and a customer to Mr. Aris; I know the prisoner was his journeyman, and on the 30th of October I paid him a guinea for Mr. Aris; this is the bill, and he made a memorandum, received one pound one shilling.</p>
               <p>(To Mr. Aris). Q. What did the prisoner say? - A. He said he had received this and several other sums and had gambled it away, but as soon as he had received his bounty, as he had enlisted as an East India soldier, he would pay me; I have found upwards of nine pounds deficient.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I lost some out of my pocket and some at gambling; I never intended to defraud any person, and was afraid to go home to my master, so I went and enlisted in the 77th regiment, and meant to pay him every farthing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. In the night of the 2d of July, 1790, I went with Mr. Taylor to make a seizure, in consequence of an information; we were to meet two other officers, in the fields between <placeName id="t17980418-79-crimeloc413">Camberwell</placeName>

I said to Taylor, here they are coming, now we want our companions, but we must do our endeavours to take them if we can; I was laying beside a gatepost, and I jumped up and caught Hart's horse by the bridle; I told him we were officers, knew him perfectly well, and should seize his horses and his tobacco; he then said, d-n your eyes, you are officers are you, you b-s, come up here, and we will give it them, says he, speaking to his boy. Mr. Taylor took hold of the horse's halter that he was leading, and I struck at Hart with my stick; by striking at Hart, I got the bridle into my own possession; I hit him again, over the knee, with my stick, and told him to get off; the boy then coming up to his assistance, struck me on the head, and nearly knocked me down, with a large loaded whip; Hart then cut at me several times with his whip, and as I recovered again, I called to Taylor to help me to get him off the horse; Taylor came up, and fired his pistol at him, behind him; now, you b-s, catch me if you can, says he, and set spurs to his horse, and rode away with one horse, and the boy with the other, leaving one horse and five bags of tobacco in my possession; we then came across the fields, to go to Kennington Common, and then Hart and the boy met us again, with their horses unloaded, and said, now you b-s,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180075"></xptr>we have you, and swore at us very much; I told him, if he advanced a step further I would shoot him. Taylor was leading the horse, Hart and the boy turned about and rode off, the boy went down by the brick-fields, and Hart went back again; I pursued the boy, the horse with the bags we had tied up to the pales; while I was pursuing the boy, Hart came and cut the bridle, and got the loaded horse away from us; I pursued the boy, he jumped off his horse, and we seized it.</p>

               <p>Q. He had no fire-arms? - A. No.</p>

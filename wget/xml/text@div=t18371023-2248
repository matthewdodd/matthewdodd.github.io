I was sitting at my tea and was called out by Mrs. Durant—I went to assist the little boy—the prisoner had him in a very rough sort of manner—I went and said, James, you naughty boy, what have you been doing to this man?" when I went to his door he kicked me, knocked me down and kicked me in different parts—he kicked me about the ground, turned me over and stamped on my chest—I com planned to Crawford, who was the first policeman who came, of the prisoner's conduct.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 253.) I was called on on the 13th of October—there were a number of people there—I met Mrs. Williams outside her own door—she showed me some bruises about her neck, and face, and shoulder, and pointed the prisoner out, she said he had knocked her down with his clenched fist, and when down had kicked her and turned her over—I went to the prisoner and told him the charge and that I should take him to the station-house—he said that neither two nor three policemen should do it—he then attempted to get inside a door which he was standing at—I laid hold of the collar of his smock frock—somebody in the rear called out, Policeman take care, he has got a knife"—the prisoner heard that—I had hold of him at the time, and just at that moment he pulled a knife from under his smock frock this is the knife—he made a thrust at my body—I avoided that by bending my body, and the knife went against the wall, and with my left hand I laid hold of his hand which the knife was in—all this was done in silence—on laying hold of his hand, before I could prevent him he drew the knife up and cut, with a slant cut, the flesh of the joint of</p>

               <p>of my finger—it was his act—I had hold of him by the right hand by the collar, and laid hold of his right hand with my left hand by the wrist, and he suddenly drew his hand up and made a cut at the hand I held his collar by—I am of opinion he cut me to try and get out of my band, to get into his own door, as he did afterwards—I am of opinion it was to get my band from him—I believe it was intentionally done—it cut the joint of the first finger of my right hand—it was not a very great found—the skin was cut off—there is a scar now—I had the hand on his collars—I think it must have been the right hand he had the knife in, bet I am not positive—I had hold of his hand with my left hand—he drew his right hand up, being stronger than me in the arm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it not have been in trying to get out of your grasp that the knife went up and cut you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider, from the violence of the thrust that he made at me, that it was intentional—to the best of my opinion, it was to try to loosen my hold of him—one of the neighbors lad hold of him by one hand and I the other—he was indoors, and he dropped the knife on the floor and I picked it up—he had got out of my hand and gone indoors—I took him to the station-house, and if Hi searching him I found this sheath in his trowsers a pocket.</p>

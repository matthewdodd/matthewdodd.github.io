                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joshua Dawes, a porter, of parker-street, Drury-lane. On Tuesday, the 29th of March, I was in a public-house in seven Dials, with my infant—it was then three weeks and two days old—it was registered— it had not been christened—it was called josephDawes—I saw the prisoner in the public house with a soldier she what a fine baby you have got she asked me to let her hold the child and took it out of my arms I wanted to give it to my husb and who was present he was near enough to prevent its being taken without my will if he chose she replied," I will take it" we were a quarter of an hour there i went away for about ten minutes, upsatirs with my little girl, and when I came back the prisoner was gone I hade left it in care of the prisoner, my husband and the soldier—I found the child again on Saterday, at Croydon—the officer came on Friday morning and told me of it—I saw it at Bow-street—this is the child now in my arms.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Eleazar Heyward, a farmer at Croydon. On Tuesday night, the 29th of March, between ten and eleven, I heard a child cry—I went out and saw the prisoner sitting on the shafts of a cart, opposite my house—I asked her what was the matter—she said "Nothing"—I asked her how far she had to go with that infant-she said "To Linfiel"—I asked her if she was going to walk—she said "yes"—I asked her to come in and warm the child—she came in, and said she had been confined in Lambeth workhouse—I asked her how old the child was—She said Three weeks—I asked her why she came out so soon—she said they wanted to take the baby from her, and send her out as</p>

                  </hi>. I received information and went to the An. chor at Croydon, and found the prisoner there with the child—I asked her if it was her child—she said not—I asked where she got it—she said at a A public-house from a man and woman there, who gave her the child to hold, that they went away for half an hour, and did not return—she went out walked about for three quarters of an hour, returned, and asked the land-lord if anybody had inquired for the child—he said no, and she took it home with her to take it to Linfield—in taking her from the station to the Union workhouse, she said if I wanted to know anything, she would give me a great deal of trouble, and I might go and find it out</p>
               <p>----—<hi rend="smallCaps">HALE</hi>. I am master of Croydon workhouse. On Thursday afternoon, the 31st of March, the officer brought the prisoner there with the child—she gave her name Mary Ann Dunn—it was my duty to enter her name and the child's name in the admission book—I asked her about the child—self said it was her own—I asked her what name I should put down—was it christened?"—she said it was no name—I said I must enter it as Dunn only—she said "No, don't enter it as Dunn, it is not my child"—she seemed very much excited at the time, and afterwards she seemed very penitent, and said she would tell me the truth—that she had been very much excited by being questioned by so many, but the fact was she was in a public-house drinking with some people, they got tipsy together, and that the mother gave her the child to hold while she went out—she did not return in half an hour, and she went out for about half an hour looking for her—she returned again, and the landlord said nobody had been in<lb></lb>quiring about the child, and she said, "Unfortunately, not knowing what to do, I took it down to my parents at Linfield, I was taken befor a Magistrate, who said I had better return to London, and I was returning when I was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Sugar-loaf public-house, King-street, Drury-lane. I remember the prrisoner, the mother of the child, and two men, coming into my house on the 29th of March—the prosecutrix was carrying the child—they were there two hours and a half—then a soldier came in—they might be a little fresh, all of them, but not intoxicated after they were in some time a fiddler came in and played, but I stopped him—I remember the prosecutrix coming and calling out for her child—the prisoner was gone then and the child—the prisoner never came to make any inquiry afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> She was quite tipsy. I was not in liquor at first. I was in company of a young man at the time—the mother was showing the child, and put it over the table. I said, "What age is it?" she said three weeks. I looked at the young man with me and said, "Three weeks old, and the mother tipsy;" she said, "Will you take it?" I took it in my arms; she said, "Come with me to the Sugar Loaf public-house." I went there with her; she and I were out together; she had the child in her arms afterwards, and when we came back the husband was gone out; she said to me, "Take hold of the child." I took it, and she never came back to me. I sat there half an hour, and said I should not stop there any longer, and I went home. I did not know what <hi rend="italic">to</hi> do with the child; she has told a great many stories, but that is the truth.</p>

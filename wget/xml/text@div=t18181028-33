            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 27th of October, about ten minutes after eight o'clock in the morning, I was alone in the shop-the prisoner came in. Three men had come in before-one of them went out before the prisoner came in, the other two remained till the prisoner came in - They appeared to be acquainted. One of them asked for a pair of gloves - He laid a whip on the counter. I showed him some gloves-the other man had a great-coat hanging on his arm, and stood behind the one who asked for the gloves, the prisoner walked up and down the shop. After I had shown the gloves, the man with the great-coat said he would go and get the cart ready. He took up the other man's whip, and went out-then the prisoner came, spoke to the man, and said the gloves were good ones, and walked about the shop-the stockings were on the other counter, which was behind the men, and near to the prisoner. I showed the man three different pairs of gloves, he paid for one pair, which came to 3s. - all three then went out together. Immediately after they went out, I missed twelve pair of stockings off the counter. i got the boy next door to mind the shop, and went to look for them up the Old Jewry, which is two doors from the shop, and saw the four men turn out of Dove-court into the Old Jewry - I knew them again, I am certain the prisoner is one of them. I stopped at the top of the court. Just as they came up to me, I laid hold of the prisoner's coat, and said, "You have got some stockings of our's." One of the men ran up against me, and pushed me from the prisoner, he got away. I followed him, calling Stop thief! he turned back into Grocer's Hall-court into the Poultry, and was stopped opposite the court. I saw him drop the stockings at the bottom of the court, I picked them up. I never lost sight of him, and am certain he is one of the men. I do not know what became of the other three men. I did not see the stockings taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I am certain he is the man - I took particular notice of him. My master's house is in the parish of St. Mary Colechurch.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JONES. I live in Grocer's Hall-court. I heard the cry of Stop thief! ran out, and saw the prisoner run down Dove-court. As he passed me he dropped the parcel-the last witness picked it up. The prisoner ran into Keats's shop - I never lost sight of him. Kelly brought the bundle into the shop, and said the prisoner was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280015"></xptr>man who robbed him, and that three others were with him - He denied it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Elizabeth Inwood, who keeps a shop in Chapel-street, Westminster. On the 24th of March the prisoner came in, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a good shilling—I gave him change—he said if I gave him the shilling back, he thought he had halfpence enough—I returned him the good shilling which he gave me—he then took out a handful of silver, and put the shilling I gave him with the others—he then said, "I see I have not halfpence enough," and gave me another shilling, not the one I gave him back—I tried it with my teeth—directly he saw me do that he snatched up the change, and ran away—that shilling turned out to be bad—I gave it to the policeman—I ran after the prisoner, and told a boy to stop him, but he got away—I am sure he is the person—on the 31st he came again, about nine o'clock in the evening, for half an ounce of tobacco—I directly recognised him, called my mother, and she came and attended to him—I was so frightened I could not serve him—he paid with a good half-crown—I gave him two sixpences, and 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change.</p>

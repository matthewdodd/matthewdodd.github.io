                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 413). On 19th October, about 2.45, I was near Bromley church—I heard a noise, jumped over a wall, and found the prisoner and two others in a piece of waste ground, railed in, at the side of the church—they ran into a corner, and tried to escape—I ran after them, and seized the prisoner by the throat, and knocked another with my staff—he seized my staff, and ran away—I kept hold of the prisoner, and found these two bottles of wine, and this clock by him—I sprang my rattle, but it broke—it was some time before another constable came—I took the prisoner to the station, and then went back and found that the church door and the vestry door had been broken open, two money-boxes broken open, and a clock taken from the vestry—this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was found by the clock and the wine—it corresponded with marks on the church door—a cupboard and a box in the vestry were broken open—I found on the prisoner 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, which was smothered with some white stuff, similar to the disinfecting fluid in the money-boxes in the church.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sexton of Bromley church—I locked up the church and vestry about 12 o'clock in the day—the boxes were then perfectly safe and fast; and in the cupboard, which was broken open, there were, I think, four bottles of wine, and two decanters—these plates and this clock were also safe—they were the property of the churchwardens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going home past the church, and heard cries. I got over the fence, and saw two men getting away, and another wrestling with the policeman. I went to help the policeman, and he said that if I attempted to move he would knock me down. The white stuff in my pocket was tobacco ash.</p>

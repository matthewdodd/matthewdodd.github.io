                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Anthony Fricker. I have been separated from him fifteen years, and since then I have gone by the name of Small—I had a house at No. 108, Park-street, Camden<lb></lb>town—I left it in possession of a person named Marquess and my son—it contained the articles named in the indictment—I went to Church-street, Soho, on Thursday, the 27th of December, and did not go to the house again—my son was coming daily to receive money from me for hit sup<lb></lb>port—I imagined every thing was safe—I went there on the Monday after my son was taken up, and every thing was gone.</p>

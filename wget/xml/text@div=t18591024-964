                  </hi>. I am a boot maker, living at Stratford. On the morning of 4th October, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was at Leytonstone at my shop—I saw a number of boots there—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were on a stand by the door, with a lot more—I did not see them again till 2 o'clock, when a policeman brought them to me—I gave no authority to any one to take them away.</p>

On the morning of 4th October I was in the Forest, Wanstead Flats, about half-past 10—I saw the prisoner with two boys—they had a basket carrying—I called to them to stop, and I saw the prisoner drop some boots—I took her into custody—I told her the charge, and she said she knew nothing of it—I took the boots to the shop of last witness.</p>

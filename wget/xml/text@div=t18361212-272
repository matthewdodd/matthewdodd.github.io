                  </hi>. I am servant to John Cook, who keeps the Bull and Anchor, at the corner of Dean-street, High Holborn. I have known the prisoner about six weeks—he frequented the house—on the 9th of Decem<lb></lb>ber,</p>

               <p>in the evening, he came and had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of liquor—he asked me to give him change for a sovereign to pay the reckoning—I threw down a half-sovereign and a shilling in part change—he took it up, and then threw down a medal while I was getting him the remainder of the change—I took it up, and told him it was not a sovereign—he then took it in his hand, and looked at it for several minutes—he then went to the door, and threw something away, which I suppose was the medal, as it was not found on him—it was a common penny medal—he came back to the counter, and said, "Well, I have not got a sovereign then?"—I said, "Be so kind as to return me my half-sovereign and shilling?"—he said he had not got it, and Mr. Cook came, and he repeatedly said he had not got the half-sovereign and shilling—Mr. Cook said he would give him in charge unless he pro<lb></lb>duced them—he then said he would not give Mr. Cook a chance, and went out at the door and ran away—a person at the door picked up the medal—we followed the prisoner into Gate-street, Lincoln's-Inn-fields, where he was stopped by the policeman, who searched him, and found the half-sovereign and shilling on him.</p>

C. upon one of them, the other is taken out, but it is the same cloth.</p>

             M'Carty. I am wife to the prosecutor, I was out along with him at the time the things were lost. The prisoners were seamen, and lodged at my house at the time they said they were going to the India-house to receive a great deal of money, but they came no more; we had the things advertised, by which means we came by these again.</p>

            . I was sent for when the prisoners were taken, and seeing one of the shirts marked C. C. as advertised, I let the prosecutor know of them. I found in Donaldson's pocket sixty-five bullets and some gunpowder, they had three pistols upon them.</p>

               <p>When we came to that house we lodged there two or three days, we were quite strangers, we got a little fuddled, and went away; we met with one Cotton, and gave him 12 s. for the shirts, and 3 s. for the neckcloths. He told us he was bound for Liverpool. We went to Greenwich to the other man's house on Friday night, we were going on ship board on the Monday: we told him we had no money, I gave him my watch for security for the reckoning. He took us up upon suspicion, because he saw pistols in Robinson's pockets.</p>

                  </hi>, I let my shop, 8, Gibson Street, Lambeth, to James Adams, a watchmaker—on 5th July, about three a.m., I awoke as the clock struck three, and was not awake three minutes before I heard some<lb></lb>thing drop in the shop—I opened the door gently, went half-way down stairs, and saw the parlour door open, which belongs to Mr. Adams—I called out, "Who is there, you thieves? "—two young men came through the parlour from the shop, and ran through the passage into the street—I followed them in my night-clothes to the corner, calling "Police! stop thief! "—I cannot swear to them, as they hurried through so quickly—I have seen the prisoner about the streets—he is about the size of one of them—I followed them and saw a policeman follow close upon the same men who went out at the door—I did not lose sight of them—I had seen the parlor doer safe at twenty minutes to twelve, and the outer door was fastened—I went into the shop and saw two clocks and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> Lying on a jacket, and about half an inch of tallow candle burning on the counter—they bad drawn the padlock from the staple, and I fonud it under the door—I also found this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which fits the frontdoor, and another key, which they had hidden under the mat With the padlock.</p>

Last Friday morning, about three o'clock, I heard Mrs. Tapley calling, "Stop thief, "and saw the prisoner running and a boy after him, three or four yards from Mr. Adams's shop, just off the pavement—I called, "Stop thief"—he ran to William Street and was pursued by Riley, who brought him back—he had this street door key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand—I examined Mr. Adams's parlour door and found a staple under the mat—I saw the prisoner searched, and this hammer of a watch, sixpence, and three halfpence found on him—I am sure he is the person who came out.</p>

On 5th July, about three a.m., I heard some one calling, and saw the prisoner and another man running about 120 yards from Adam's shop—I followed and took him—he took the key out of his coat pocket and passed it behind him to the other hand—I seized his hand and took it from him—I searched him at the station and found the hammer of a repeater watch on him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a watchmaker, of 2, St. Alban's Terrace, and have a shop at 8, Gibson Street, under Mrs. Tapley—on 4th July I left off business at half-past eight, locked the door with a key, and then put a padlock on—at 8.30 in the morning T found the shop had been broken into, and I missed seven or eight pairs of earrings, part of the works of a watch, and a silver ring—I have recovered two clocks—this hammer of a repeater corresponds with the other part of a repeater which was under</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

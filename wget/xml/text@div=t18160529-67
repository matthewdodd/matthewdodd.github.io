I then catched hold of him by the neck that moment; he threw something out of his hand at the time. I believed that my watch was gone for I heard something fall. I called to the watchman, and they did not come. My wife was sitting up for me, and she heard my voice, and she came, and saw me with a fast hold of this man. There was a man and woman pulled the prisoner, and told me to let him go, but I would not, and took him to the watchhouse, and then I found my watch in my pocket, but my chain and seal gone. I afterwards went back with a candle, and looked, but could not find them.</p>

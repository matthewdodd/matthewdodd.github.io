                  </hi>. I live at Llandilovawr, Carmarthenshire. I am a Magistrate for Pembroke—the prisoner is my brother-in-law—my sister is now dead—I had assisted him with money to a considerable ex<lb></lb>tent before her death—I ultimately found that he was committed to Car<lb></lb>marthen gaol for debt—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a bill</hi>.)—the acceptance on this is not my hand-writing—I did not authorise the prisoner to sign it for me—I found that it had gone to Biddulph's bank—I went to Carmarthen prison to see the prisoner—I said, "I find you have forged my name, and you must abide by the consequences, for I will never pay one farthing of the money"—he made no reply—there was no one with me at that time—I left him—that was about the 8th or 10th of September, 1887—I went and saw him again five or six days afterwards, with Mr. Lewis Morris, the prisoner's attorney, but said nothing to him then—this acceptance bears a resemblance to my signature—the body of the bill is the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After that trial on which a verdict passed against you in Carmarthen, you paid for a <hi rend="italic">habeas</hi> to remove him to London, and being in custody on civil process, have you indicted him for this offence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—he has lived twenty years in Carmarthen, and carried on business in a large way—I have not obtained any property from him—he gave me a nominal security—I will show it if you wish it—I do consider it nominal, as it is worth nothing—it is a mortgage, but there was a prior mortgage, which exists to the full value—I had it given me on the 8th of June, 1837—I did not know of the prior mortgage at that time—Mr. Biddulph claims it—his clerk told me so yesterday—the mortgage was for money I became security for before—I know that a fiat of bankruptcy had been issued against the prisoner—this deed recites three prior mortgages for 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but there is another which I did not know of—there is 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cannot be sold—he has only a life interest in it—I cannot tell the value of it—I entered into a bond of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him, to a person named Moss—I gave a note of hand for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a person, which I paid—this mortgage was given as a general security for all debts I might have to pay for him—he owes me money now—there is a time limited in the deed—I have not sold the estate, as there is a prior mort<lb></lb>gage—I had become security at the time he executed this—1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the amount he is charged by that mortgage—at that time I had not advanced</p>

               <p>more than 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I was security for more—there was a bond for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a note of hand for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Jones's, and a bill of 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Wilkin's bank—it was an accommodation bill—I never had a farthing of the interest paid me on this mortgage—it was about 1829 I was security for the 600.—I know the bond was before 1830—I found he was in difficulties, and got the security to indemnify myself if I could—I went to the prisoner's office on that occasion—I did not tell him if he would give me the security to enable at to cover the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I would do any thing for him I could—he did not tell me he should want the use of my name for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cold him he must pay the securities off, for I would not be responsible for soy money for him—I make ft mistake—I meant to say I would not be re<lb></lb>sponsible any longer for the amount which I was security for—that he must pay them—what I meant to do was to go to the parties, and ask them to call the money in—I was not a creditor at that time, only a security—I lever knew that he had the signatures of three-fifths of his creditors to his certificate—I heard he was to be discharged from prison in September, 1887—he told me so when I saw him in prison—I heard it rumoured in; Carmarthenshire that he was likely to be discharged while he was in Lon<lb></lb>don—it was not on that that I came up and indicted him—on my oath, I did not come up with in a week of the time I beard it—I heard it on my way up from Carmarthen—I live twenty-five miles below Carmarthen—I was coming up to get these indictments preferred against him—it was some time in October, not before, about thirteen months after I had seen him in prison—I went to the different holders of the bills, to declare them as for<lb></lb>geries—I went first to him in prison, to know if the bills were still in ex<lb></lb>istence which he had forged—I knew of the bills by the holders apply<lb></lb>ing for payment—the first application was in September, 1837—that Was not about the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on which the action was brought—the bill was not due at the time I went to him in prison, but I was told there were bills in existence with my signature, which I was not aware of—it was neither of these bills I was applied to for payment of—it was a third bill—that was at Carmarthen—I have kept some cases back—William Phillips holds one, and Posthumous Phillips the other—I am not aware that they are any relations to the man I gave the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go to get the <hi rend="italic">habeas</hi>—Post-humous Phillips is a maltster—the bill be has is for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been called on to pay it—I have not paid any part of it—I have taken no steps on it—the other is for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—William Phillips is the holder of that—those bills are signed by procuration—I do not know what drawing by procura<lb></lb>tion is—I have never seen those bills—I was called on to pay them twelve months ago.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why have you not preferred charges for those bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not care which, I left it to my professional man to choose—my present at<lb></lb>torney lives in London—I did not direct the two bills of Phillips's to be brought to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the bill on Morris, which induced you to send Mr. M. R. James to the prisoner in gaol, due in October? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was for another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I never heard any more of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there seems to have been thousands according to your state<lb></lb>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I did not send Mr. M. R.

Biddulph—I have heard it pronounced a forgery—I made a demand, both on the drawer and ac<lb></lb>ceptor, when it became due—we gave notice of the bill being dishonoured, which the prosecutor never attended to—he called some few months after<lb></lb>wards, and requested I would show him the bill, which I did—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he told me it was not a forgery—I told him the prosecutor had said the bill was a forgery—he replied, there was a con<lb></lb>spiracy, he believed, got up against him, but it was no forgery—that there was an attempt to transport him, or something of that sort—I did not call his attention to the signature of the acceptor, and he said nothing about the acceptance—I do not know who brought the bill to us—it was passed to the credit of the prisoner's account—the prisoner, I believe, did not bring it to me.</p>

Biddulph sent this bill to the Bank of England shortly after it was drawn—it would be in the Bank of England in September, 1837—we applied to Mr. James for it on the 20th of 21st of September, for the first time, it was due on the 17th of Sep<lb></lb>tember—I am positive we did not apply before it became due—the prisoner has carried on a very large business as long as I have known him, and bore the character of an honest man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, living at Haverford-west In November, 1837, I went with Mr. James to Carmarthen prison, to see the prisoner—Mr. James said to him, "John, are you prepared to pay these crooked bills?"—the prisoner said he was not—Mr. James then said, "You must take the consequences"—allow me to explain that I was going to the gaol on my own business, to see Mr. Harris, and Mr. James asked me to accompany him—this occurred just as we left—a great deal passed before, but nothing more about the bills.</p>

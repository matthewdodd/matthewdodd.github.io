                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hill Mortimer, and live at Kilburn; Emily Barber was in my service as housemaid for four years—I thought highly of her, and she was a good deal about my person; she left on the 9th of last June; I occasionally missed wine and little things while she was there. On the 25th of July I had a dinner-party—I went to my closet, and missed a great quantity of glass, and from a china-closet missed a great quantity of things—I then missed some pieces of lace and cambric from an<lb></lb>other place—I missed some valuable tea from my bed-room—I went to Mrs. Faulkener's, of Notting-hill, where Emily had gone to live—I saw Emily—she said, "How do you do? I hope you are very much better; I have not been happy since I left your house"—I said, "Emily, I am sorry to say I have been robbed of a vast quantity of glass, china, lace, and cambric"—she said, "Glass and china, lace, and cambric; I never saw any at your house"—I said, "You forget yourself; have you any of my things in your box?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Have you any objection to my looking into your box?"—she said, "You may, with the greatest pleasure"—I said, "Perhaps Mrs. Faulkener and her daughters will accompany us"—Emily then said, "No, you shan't look into my boxes without a search-warrant"—a policeman was then called—he went up stairs—Emily gave some things to him from her own box, and said, "These are my mistress's"—I have looked at them all, they are mine—I have brought a great many things to match with them—I went to the police-office at Kensington with her—I asked what she had done with the other things that I had missed, and she said they were at her mother's, Sarah Barber—I went there—the policeman said he came to look for stolen goods of mine—Sarah and her daughter-in-law said they had not anything in the house—on which the policeman searched Emily's boxes, and found some soap, candles, and other things—I saw a great quantity of linen—there were some things in the window-seat, two bottles of sauces, a candlestick, some glasses, soap, and a lantern were found in the cupboard in Sarah's room—she said she knew nothing of them—she did not open her daughter's boxes—that she knew nothing of those things which were found in the cupboard—I can de<lb></lb>cidedly say these things are mine—these glasses, which were found in the cupboard, my husband bought at the Duchess Dowager of Rutland's sale—I have brought some others to match them—I have missed them from my stock—this tumbler I know—these two bottles were found in the cupboard—one contains whiskey—I cannot swear to these bottles of sauces, they were found in a box at Sarah's—I did not know the boxes.</p>

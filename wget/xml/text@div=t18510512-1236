                  </hi>. I am an iron-master, in partnership with Thomas Howard, carrying on business at the King and Queen iron-works, Rotherhithe—we have iron come alongside our wharf in barges—I had missed some heavy pieces of iron cut off the ends of bolts, in consequence of which I went with inspector Monaghan, on 5th May, to the prisoner's shop, which was about 300 or 400 yards off, a marine-store shop—he and his wife were there—I asked him if he had bought any heavy pieces of iron—he said, "No,"—the iron he had bought was lying about the shop—I saw several pieces of light iron, hoops, and nails—I saw Noakes search a heap of iron behind the counter, and pull out this end of a bolt (<hi rend="italic">produced)—I</hi> said that was the description of iron we were in search of; it was underneath; he was several minutes before he found it—he continued to produce pieces of heavy iron—I said, "That is my iron," and asked the prisoner when he bought it—he said, "On Friday last;" and he did not know the name of the parties, but be should know them again; that he objected to it, and they said it was all right, he was perfectly safe; it was their perquisites—I asked him if he had a book, and he brought a few leaves of an old book—I found 2 cwt 20 lbs. of iron, worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; which I believe to be mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector, M</hi>). I accompanied Mr. Raven<lb></lb>hill to the prisoner's shop—we both asked him if he had bought any iron lately—he said he had, pointing to some old nails and iron-hopping behind the counter—I asked him if he had bought any heavy or thick iron—he said, "No," he believed not—I pulled some of the iron down from the heap, and Noakes pulled out a lump of iron—there was 1 1/2 cwt. or 2 cwt. on the top of it—he found all these lumps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the heap—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner why he put it there—he said he did not know—I asked him if he kept a book—he said, "yes"—! asked him if he made an entry of things he purchased—he said when he purchased anything particular he entered it—I asked him to let me see his book—he produced it—I asked if he had made</p>

               <p>any entry—he made no answer—I looked in the book, and said, "There is no entry of any sort since 19th April; do not you know who you bought this iron of?"—he said he thought he should know them if he saw them; he bought it on the Friday, about one o'clock (that was the 3rd)—I asked him if the parties came together—he said one came first, and the other a few minutes afterwards—I asked if he made any inquiry where they got it—he said, "Yes," he thought it was rather <hi rend="italic">queer</hi>; and they said it was all right, it was their privilege, and he need not be under any fear—I asked what he gave for it—he said, "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. no, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable at Edmonton: On Monday, the 21st of October, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go into a second-hand shop in Edmonton; I went in after him, and this bundle was open, and seeing this valuable bridle I suspected that he had robbed some stable; I looked at it, and he said, will you buy it; I said, no, I had no occasion for such a thing; he said, if you will, you shall have it for half a-guinea; I told him if he would tie up his bundle, I would take him to a gentleman whom I would shew it to. I then took him to a Magistrate, and stated my suspicion; he said there he had got them at a raffle at Plymouth; the Magistrate ordered me to take him to the cage, and to bring him up in the evening; on going with him to the cage, I met the prosecutor in pursuit of him; the prisoner had the prosecutor's jacket on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the bundle contain? - A. This bridle, a pair of reins, a pair of bus, a bearing-rein, a new saddle-cloth, a pair of stockings, and a handkerchief; when I met the prosecutor, I took him back again to the Magistrate's; he confessed immediately that he had stole them, without one word of hesitation.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The jacket is mine, and the stockings and handkerchief; the other things were in my custody; here is all the things I lost.</p>

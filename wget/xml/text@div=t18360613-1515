I live at Pear-tree-court, Shoreditch, and am a widow, I went out to work at half-past six o'clock in the morning on the 5th of May—I left a metal tea-pot and a half-crown there—I came home in the evening, and then missed them—I got information, and went with an officer to the play-house—at the Standard, in Shoreditch, I found the prisoner, and gave her into custody there.</p>

By the different customers enquiring for the goods repeatedly, and the prisoner at the bar not coming to his usual employ, and the customers expressing that they delivered the goods into the hands of the prisoner, I suspected the prisoner to be the offender. I went in search of the prisoner in order to enquire about the goods; I found him in the Seven Dials, on the 7th of June, with the officer Manning; we immediately took the prisoner to the first public house, which was the corner house, we searched the prisoner and found various duplicates, the officer has them. I asked the prisoner whether these duplicates I refer to were my property or not? He said they were.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you promised him any favour? - By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said it would be better for him? - By no means. I delivered him into the hands of the officer, and he was committed. The property is deposited in the hands of the pawnbrokers, who are present.</p>

I was in the counting-house during the time the prisoner was looking at the boots—I looked out of the door once or twice, there was apparently something suspicious—I kept on the alert; after she had remained some time my daughter went round the counter and stopped her, and said she suspected she had got a pair of boots—she said she was perfectly wiling to be searched, but when she got in the counting-house she refused to be searched unless there was a policeman sent for—I said she should be accommodated, I would get one—I then looked and saw a pair of boots fall from her—she asked me if she might sit down—I said yes—she sat down and then I saw another pair under where she had been sitting—she begged to be forgiven, and said it was her first offence.</p>

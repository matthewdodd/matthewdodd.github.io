                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live at No. 163, New Bond-street, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On Saturday afternoon, the 14th of Sept., I was up stairs in the sitting room—at ten minutes past five o'clock I was called down, and found the prisoner in my shop—my fore<lb></lb>man man said, "This gentleman wishes to see some watches"—I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner—he said he wished to see a watch similar to one his brother, Captain Phillips, had bought, and described it as a very expensive watch, but his brother gave but twenty guineas for it—I said I had no watch of that descrip<lb></lb>tion, the one he described would be thirty guineas—he looked at some watches—I said I had one I could let him have for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and directed the foreman to get it from the window—he could not find it—I went myself, and pointed it out to him—I showed it to the prisoner—he said that would not suit him, he would go and fetch his brother, with the watch he had purchased at my house some few years since at twenty guineas—five minutes after he was gone I missed a gold watch from a tray I had shown him, but I had pre<lb></lb>viously suspected him, and sent my foreman out to follow him—nobody had entered the shop after I had showed him the tray, and before I missed the watch.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought I had at the time, but I cannot be sure—he was not more than ten minutes in the shop—nobody but my foreman was in the shop—my back was turned while I went to the window—I speak to the prisoner from my recollec<lb></lb>tion of him—I think I recollect his hand—if a man has a clean hand I am not suspicious of him—there was not anything particular about his hand—it was not particularly dirty nor clean—I am confident he is the man—he was dressed nearly as he is now—I think he had on the same coat—I did not notice his neckcloth—I think he had a crape hatband—I did not observe whether his hat</p>

               <p>was white or black, and am not sure his hat was on—my attention was fixed on his hand, to see that he did not take a watch—I sent a lad to send the foreman back, and the lad followed him—he did not return for an hour—the foreman is not here—he could not have taken the watch, for he was not near the tray after giving the watch into my hand—the foreman could not handle it after giving it to me—it was not the one the foreman brought to me—he was about six yards from the watches—there was a partition between him and the watches, as he was in the inner part of the shop—he was before me, and the prisoner behind me—the partition runs across the front of the shop—I showed the prisoner from ten to sixteen watches.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 17th of Sept. I was on duty in the City-road, and the prisoner was given into my custody by one King—on looking at the book I found he answered the description of a man who had stolen a watch from the prosecutor's—Mr. Payne attended at the Police-court, and identified him.</p>

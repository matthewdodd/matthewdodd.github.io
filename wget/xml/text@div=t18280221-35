On the 14th of January, I went out about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, leaving my till locked; I locked my shop door, and then locked the parlour door outside. I rent the house, I left two female lodgers up stairs. I returned at twelve o'clock and found the parlour door ajar - I am certain I had locked it, and I had the key in my pocket: I pulled it open, and saw the prisoner standing in the parlour with his right hand resting on my drawers, and his face towards the door. I said "O, it is you is it, I must stop you:" I I knew him before by sight, but not by name - I shut the parlour door too, but he burst the door from me, and I collared him; he kicked my legs till he kicked the skin off: I called Stop thief! and held him for about two minutes; he then pushed me down the kitchen stairs a step or two- I lost my hold and he got away: the neighbours all saw him run away, but nobody stopped him. I recovered myself in a few minutes and followed him to the bottom of the street; he turned down Swinton-street: he was not taken then, but for another offence. I found my till open, which was in my shop, and the halfpence were gone out of it which I had counted in the morning - I keep a chandler's shop; there were about 3s. in pence, halfpence, and farthings: the till was open, but the lock not injured, nor was the shop door lock injured. I missed nothing but the copper - I locked the till the last thing before I went out, and put the key into my pocket: I had put the silver out of it into a drawer in the parlour - I found that safe. The shop door was locked inside, and the parlour door too - none of the drawers were broken; the parlour door was forced open, but there were no marks of injury on it: the shop door was not broken - If I had had the presence of mind, I could have locked him in the parlour. I knew him before, he once before opened my parlour door and looked in at me as I sat there - I cannot be mistaken in his person. I understand he is a bricklayer or slater.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you see me at the shop door when you came in? A. No - you were in the parlour: he did not speak a word to me that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you would serve me directly? A. No - you did not ask to be served with anything.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When she laid hold of me she said you have robbed me. I said what do you mean; she immediately collared me and said I must stop: I said I would not, for I was no thief: she scuffled and fell down, I walked out, and ran away.</p>

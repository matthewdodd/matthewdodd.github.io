I am the prisoner's husband—on a Tuesday night, at 7.15 p.m., I was standing at the bar of a public-house—the prisoner came in saying "Revenge is sweet," and struck me in the jaw with a knife—I said "Oh!" and then I got another one and fell, and was picked up and carried to the hospital, and was there a week—I had had no quarrel with her.</p>

I was house-physician to the hospital when Melton was brought in, suffering from an incised and punctured wound below the right ear about an inch and a half long and the same deep—there was also a superficial wound on his left cheek, extending from the angle of the eye to the centre of the radius of the lower jaw—the wound in the neck was serious—it was in the neighbourhood of the external carotid artery—this knife is exactly the sort of weapon which would produce it.</p>

               <p>On the 7th of June, about ten minutes before ten, I was stopped by these prisoners at the bar; two of them seized me, and robbed me, they took from me one guinea in gold, four shillings in silver, and four-pence in halfpence, a pair of leather gloves, a leather olive coloured glove, a horn comb, and tin case, a linen handkerchief, and a pair of silver buckles; I believe that was all; I swore to two men Smith and Barker that robbed me, and the other was in company at the same time; the reason that I would not swear to one of the gentlemen was, because I was cautious.</p>
               <p>What clothes had they on? - The man in the middle had a light coloured coat on, the right hand man had such a sort of coat as the man in the middle had on; Smith had a loose brown coat, I can swear to my gloves.</p>

               <p>Court to Holmes.

               <p>They were taken out of my shoes.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark on them? - Yes, neither of them have the tongues in, that they had when they were bought, they have new tongues.</p>
               <p>What sort of a stick was it the man struck you with? - It appeared to me to be a club-stick, with a knob at the end of it, of some sort.</p>
               <p>Jury. Which man was it that took the buckles out of your shoes? - Barker and Smith, I think Barker stooped first.</p>
               <p>Was the hat before your eyes all this time? - I shifted it a little over my left eye, that was the time I saw Gahagan stooping down to

               <p>You are sure it was you yourself that put the hat aside from your eyes? - Yes, I did it by shifting it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barker. When we were before the Justice, they asked him why he could not swear to us; he said we held his hat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230043"></xptr> so over his eyes, that he could not see us? - I told them I did not chuse to swear to them then, but I should chuse to see them again first, and this is the second time that I have seen them.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Gahagan called two other witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Thorpe, of 13, John-street, Deptford—the back windows of our house overlook the arches of the Dept-ford railway—on the afternoon of 2d May, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw the two prisoners bring the old college-man along, one having hold of each arm—I saw them push him down near the railway arch, and I saw Murphy take something from him, I could not see what, while Coppell was in the next arch looking out to see if there was any one coming—I stood looking at them—I saw them both come together and look at the old man, and look at what they had got, and then I saw them go away—I could not see what they had got—I saw no more of them till I saw them at the police court—I am quite sure they are the women—I went down to the old man; he was quite insensible.</p>

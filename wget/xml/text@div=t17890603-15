               <p>Are you positively sure and certain they are the men? - They are the men.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see them before? - No, never before.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you take them up? - On the next day, Monday; this was on the Sunday night; I work at the Tower, I was driving a cart on the Tower wharf; I saw these two men fast asleep on the wall; I looked at them, and I struck my whip at them; one ran away as fast as he could, the other I took hold of by the collar, and cried stop thief, and he was taken on Tower-hill; I took them to the justice in East Smithfield; there was no money found upon them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Arnold. When we was taken up on the Monday Morning, there was another man taken up with us, and he swore to the other man.</p>
               <p>Walker. No, I never swore to him, only these two; there were four or five of them, but I could only swear to those two; I could see more behind, but only these two came to me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you any doubt about the men when you first saw them the next morning? - I was very clear they were both the men, from the first to the ending.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Kinley. What makes him know me in particular, before any other man, because the last hearing before Justice Smith, he swore to another man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never swore to any other men but them two.</p>

               <p>I had been on board a ship, I went into the Castle and Lion, and there I staid till after eleven, for it rained; the next day, looking out for work, being tired, I sat down on the logs, as the sun shined warm I fell asleep; this man came and struck me several times with the whip, and said I had robbed him; he stood hesitating with me a quarter of an hour, before any body came round; at last the crowd came round, and a man took me; he was very much in liquor then, he could hardly walk; at night there was two more taken up, one he swore to, and the other he would not; then we were sent down for another hearing, and he did not appear, and we were sent down for Monday, if we could have got our friends to come before the Justice, but they came for us on Saturday evening about six, and we were fully committed.</p>

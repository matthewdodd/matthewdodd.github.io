On the 9th of January we had company at my room, and they all staid all night; the prisoner was one of them; he was there in the afternoon of the next day - I laid down on the sofa to rest, and fell asleep - he was then in the room with my wife and her sister; my writing-case was then on the sofa, with two sovereigns and a half, and seven shillings in silver in it, and also a gold breast-pin - when I awoke, I found them all three in the room - they were awake - I had slept from two till five o'clock - the prisoner said he had been to Bermondsey while I was asleep; I did not miss my case till next morning; the prisoner came in soon after, and I asked him if he had taken it in a joke; he said he had not; I heard of it on the 9th of March; he kept my sister-in-law company up to that time; but there had been a dispute between him and me, and he did not come to the lodging later than a week after the case was gone, as my sister-in-law left then. On the 9th of March Lyles gave me information, and I took the prisoner up on the 10th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. You say your house is in St. John's, Clerkenwell? A. Yes; I believe that to be a parish of itself. Mrs. Watson told me that on the day of the robbery, she saw a man come out of the house with a portfolio; the street-door is generally open, as the house is in a yard; the prisoner lent me 9s. on the 9th, and I have not paid him. I quarrelled with him, because he was impudent to my wife - I did not miss the case till I wanted to use it; I did not suspect him, as he was represented as a man of property.</p>

            . I am a servant, and now live with my aunt, in Charlotte-place, Bermondsey, but six weeks ago I lodged in Norwich-court, Fetter-lane - the prisoner once lodged there. About seven weeks from this time, he gave me this writing-case - he said he bought it to keep writings in, but it was no use to him - I went to the Albemale's Head public-house, St. John-square, to inquire for the prisoner, and said he owed me a little money, as he had given me a writing-case, I should set it off against it - Sampson, the landlord, who was present, came to me afterwards, and I took the case to the Albemarle's Head - Forse saw it, and said he could swear to the case, but the ink-stand was gone.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not that mark merely a scratch? A. No; my wife is confined; I have not brought her sister-in-law here, because I considered that she knew about it; I accused another person of it, as the prisoner urged me so to do; that person, and the prisoner, had both seen me put the money into it, the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the afternoon, that the prosecutor had his party, he asked me to lend him a few shillings to procure refreshments for the company; I lent him 6s.; I was there next day; his wife's sister let me out in the afternoon, and also in the evening.</p>

On the day of the party; I borrowed it of him, as I had nothing but a cheque - I afterwards received two sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and one shilling for the cheque; the other six shillings belonged to the engineer, but was in my case.</p>

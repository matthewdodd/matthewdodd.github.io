            . I am a Policeman. On the night in question I saw the prosecutor in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, in company with the prisoner Bacon - she had hold of his arm; Lee was walking close behind him- I saw them go away together down Essex-street, and in about forty minutes the two female prisoners came back, went into the house where they live, and in about twenty minutes, or hardly so much, the prosecutor came and appeared looking about for somebody; I asked him if he had lost any thing - he complained of his loss to me; I went with him to the house I had seen the females enter- I knocked at the door twice; Moore asked who was there - I called him by name, and told him to open the door, which he did; I immediately went into the room - he followed me; he had nothing but his shirt on - I went into the room, and told the two female prisoners they must consider themselves in custody; the prisoner Cotter was also in the room - he was dressed; I saw some papers burning on the fire, and the covers of a red leather pocket - book - I produce one piece which I took off the fire; I could not save the papers - the two male prisoners said they knew nothing at all about the circumstance; Moore keeps the house - Bacon and Lee live there; Moore's wife was in bed, under a kind of counter in the room - I know there is a crack by which I could see into the house when the shutters are closed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080013"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Are there not oyster barrels by the shutters? A. Yes, but that does not impede the view - Moore appeared to have just got out of bed; I believe Cotter lives with the prisoner Lee- I have taken oysters outside the window, but was never inside the house; it is an oyster-shop, but not an intermediate beer-shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many other persons lodge in the house? A. I cannot say - I do not know that any women lodged there except Moore's wife; it is a lodging-house - I do not know how many rooms there are; I only went into two - the prosecutor appeared to me as if he had been drinking, but capable of conducting himself; I saw Bacon with him - I do duty in that street; I first saw them about half-past one o'clock or a little later, in Wentworth-street - a good many men and women are about there late at night; I make it a practice to notice every party I see.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor did not complain of being robbed till you asked him about it? A. No, he began his conversation with me by asking if it was not a very fine morning - I suggested to him that he had been robbed; I was in my uniform - he merely passed me, and said it was a fine morning; I followed him, and asked if he had been robbed, as I thought it singular he should be wandering down the street, and he appeared to be looking for somebody - his looking at every house as he passed made me speak to him; he was not looking at one house more than another - he appeared as if he had lost something, and was endeavouring to find it; I could not tell whether he was looking for assistance or not - if I had seen him go into a house with the prisoners I should have stopped him; there were not many people about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor tell you he was so drunk he was utterly incapable of telling you by whom he had been robbed? A.He did not - that I swear; he was not very drunk - he did not appear to have been drinking to excess at all, but to have his perfect senses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was he able to speak? A. Yes, and walk as straight as a man could - he gave me a correct account of what took place.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went into the house after Cotter, and took one piece of the pocketbook off the fire; before I went in I looked through a crack in the shutters, and could see the prisoner Cotter with a piece of paper in his hand, and heard him say, "In what manner have you got rid of him?" I could not see any body but him - the reply was that they laid him flat on his back and left him; that is all I heard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had you taken any oysters at the shop that night? A. Yes, I had them outside the window - Cotton was not with me; Moore helped me to them - he was dressed then; when I looked through the crack Cotter stood about two yards from the window; there is glass to the window, but whether the sash was down I cannot say - I was sober; I do not know whether I was looking through glass or not; the window was up when I had the oysters - the shutters were up when I saw this; I looked through an aperture in them - I went into the shop afterwards, but did not notice whether the sash was down; if the glass had been down I should think I could not hear distinctly; I was not above half a minute looking through the shutter - I heard what was said quite distinctly; my eye was to the crack, and my ear close to the shutter - there was a candle standing on the counter; Moore's wife was under the counter, in bed - I do not know how many people lodge in the house; knowing the prisoners before made me notice them; the crack in the shutter was large enough to put a penny-piece through - it is a bow-out window, with a front window to shut upthe shutter is in front of the bow; it is a sash window.</p>

            . These are two pieces of my pocket-book - I know them by the look of them - the particular marks I had on the book are burnt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to say you had nothing that day but a glass of rum and a pint of porter? A. I had some beer on board the ship before I left, but nothing but my allowance; that was all I had - I had drank no liquor but a glass of rum; I do not know the name of the street I took that in - my ship had come up the day before; I drank nothing in the prisoners' company - they wanted me, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to the prisoners, when you produced the sovereign in the house, that that was the only one you had, for you had been robbed of the rest? A. On my oath I did not say any such thing, nor any thing like it; I left my ship between six and seven o'clock, and went up Holborn, but being a stranger I cannot tell the names of the streets I went to - I have been a seaman ever since I was twelve years old; I was in Holborn about nine or ten o'clock - I was going to see my cousin, who I learned was gone to Gravesend; I came away down homeward again- I called at no house; I strolled about some time - I passed through smithfield; I never sat down - I walked about, and intended to go to my ship - I was paid that afternoon from the ship, and received six sovereigns; I left one on board with a shipmate, named Grant, and changed another after I came on shore, and another after I saw the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how had you five when you saw the prisoners? A. I had four sovereigns in my pocket-book when I was robbed; I was sober - I do not know what became of the change of the first sovereign exactly; I believe the change was taken out of my pocket before I saw the prisoners - I told them I had been robbed, but did not tell them that was the only sovereign I had left; I was robbed in a house in that same street, I think - I do not recollect that I have sworn I did not go into any house; I was in one undoubtedly - I went with a woman I fell in with in the street; she was showing me the road where I was to go - a person like me might lose their way in London; I did not give the woman any money, nor any thing to drink - I did not go into any public-house with her - I might be there an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Three hours? A. I cannot tell, but I was sober and knew what I was doing - I will not swear that it was in the same street that I was robbed in; I was robbed of my pocket-book and money the second turning below Whitechapel church - I was robbed before that in a house, and lost about 14s.; I cannot say exactly how much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you could not tell what became of your change? A. I say that still, because I lost it - I had no money before I was paid; I changed the first sovereign down by the London-docks - I think I had about 14s. left; I cannot tell how much I spent - I spent it dif<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080014"></xptr>ferent ways; I might go into a shop, and get something to eat - I might have bought a biscuit or so; I got different things to eat - some bacon, bread, and potatoes; I swear that I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you from half-past ten till half-past one o'clock? A. If I could repeat every street I was in, I could tell you.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time of night was you in the house with the woman, where you suppose you were robbed? A. It might be between ten and eleven o'clock, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you look at your pocket-book from the time you left your ship till you went with the officer? A. I did, as I took the sovereign out, and there were four remaining; I changed the first sovereign at a public-house, but did not drink there - I paid for what I bought to eat with the change of that sovereign; I took that sovereign out of the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you went to search the oyster-shop, Moore's wife was in bed under the counter? A.She might be, but I did not search the room - I did not notice whether the window was down.</p>

This is a lodging-house; there are eight rooms in it, and a good many more young women live there - I know nothing of the robbery; we got up to get something to eat, and saw the prosecutor standing there - he said he had been robbed; there was a lot of people round him - he was washing his face with a handkerchief; somebody gave him water to wash it with.</p>
               <p>Cotter's Defence. The Policeman saw me come home; directly I got in I asked for a light to go up to my bedthe people had not got the light before the Policeman came to the door and knocked; this man let him in - he searched the girl and searched me; he found 11/2d. on me - they laid hold of the two girls, and I walked behind; if I had not been innocent I could have got away - I was eight or ten yards behind them all the time.</p>

            . My nose was bleeding, and I was washing my face when the prisoners came up; I do not know what made my nose bleed - I received no blow; I rather think I was robbed of the 14s. in the same street - it is a very long street, but I might have turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Bacon a good character, and one deposed the same for Lee.</p>

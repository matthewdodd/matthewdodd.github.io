I am cashier at the Nine Elms station of the South Western railway—the prisoner was a carman in that employment—his duty was to deliver goods and to receive moneys if there were any stated on his sheet, and on his return to pay the moneys into my hands, making certain demands for expenses—his sheet was called a dock voucher—this is one of them—he had to pay tolls in passing through the different gates, and also to pay for refreshment for his horses—on the 6th September he gave me these two tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—his demand was for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for tolls in the Commercial-road—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. appears to be demanded on the Mackworth Arms gate—I remember his saying he was sorry that one of the tickets was torn, and I told him to be more careful about them or I could not pass them—it was in such a torn state that I could hardly endorse his name on it—he said he had put his hand in his pocket and it had come to pieces—I believe it was a wet day—I endorse the carman's name on the tickets when I receive them—I enter them in my toll book and pay him the money—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on that occasion—I know his handwriting—I could not swear to this being his writing—it is very like it—it did not attract my attention at the time—it is not my duty to investigate these matters, as the tickets are always ex<lb></lb>amined afterwards—the date on one of the tickets has evidently been altered—his destination on that day was the West India Docks.</p>

I am a collector of tolls at the Mackworth Arms gate, Commercial-road; it is a private gate—this ticket was dated by me 20th April—from the appearance of it, it must have been issued to a chaise or private carriage—it contains my handwriting on it—we invariably use blue ink at our gate—the alteration is made in black ink, which we never use.</p>

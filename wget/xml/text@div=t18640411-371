My husband keeps a chandler's shop at Sand's-end, Ful<lb></lb>ham—on 25th February I was serving in the shop when the prisoner came in and asked for some bread, bacon, and half an ounce of tobacco, which came to 7 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him change and he was about to leave when I saw the half-crown was bad, and called my husband who was in the parlour—the prisoner had then gone out of the shop—I gave my husband the half-crown and called the prisoner back—we told him it was a bad half-crown—he said so he had been told over the road, but he took it, and we had a right to have it as he had it—my husband sent for a policeman, and while he was gone the prisoner put the change and the goods on the counter—when he came back with the policeman the prisoner said he would have the bacon and he gave my husband a shilling and that was a bad one—we told him so, and he said he thought we were having a game with him—he was given into custody and the two coins handed to the policeman.</p>

I have heard what my wife has stated—it is correct, but the prisoner had more conversation with me—I heard my wife say, "This is surely a bad half-crown," and I came out of the parlour, took the half-crown in my hand, and she went out and fetched the prisoner—I asked him if he knew it was bad—he said, well, the person over the road told him it was bad and he paid them with a sixpence, but he could not see why I should not take it as well as him—I said it would be very bad for him to take the goods and the money too, and I asked him if he was going to pay for the goods with good money, or give them to us back with the change—he said he should not, and I went for a policeman—when he came in the prisoner gave the things back—he seemed to be a hard-working man, and I was inclined to forgive him—my wife said: "Let us take the tobacco back and he can pay for the bacon"—he then gave me a bad shilling—I said "This seems to me to be a great deal worse than the half-crown"—he said: "You are having a regular game with me"—he passed that in the police<lb></lb>man's presence, and I said he must be given into custody, and he was taken away—going to the station he threw something away but I could not find what it was—I found a piece of rag but could not find anything else, the mud was so deep—I heard something fall; that drew my attention to it—the road man scraped the road the next morning and found a penny-piece—that was all they could find there.</p>

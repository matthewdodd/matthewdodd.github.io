                  </hi>. I was the boy of the Trinity lighter, and knew the de<lb></lb>ceased—I bad slept on board this night; we were moving all night, it was a flood tide—we had been four and a half hours under weigh—we came from Graysness Point, we had loaded at Crayfordness, and were coming up to London with ballast—when we got to Woolwich Reach it came on foggy, my father was at the tiller—I do not know where Abbott was standing; I had just hauled up the sail, according to my father's orders—it had been in use, but I had just taken it off—while I was coiling the rope, standing in the hold, there was a collision, a fearful crash—I saw a steamboat and was knocked insensible—the lighter sank, and Abbott and my father were drowned—I was thrown into the water, and when I came to the top I saw a plank, grasped it, and saved my life—this was between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning—it was daylight, but the fog came on thick before the collision, so that we could not see the lighter's length ahead of is—we could not see either shore, right or left—this was just off Charlton, imme<lb></lb>diately below Victoria Docks—we were in mid-stream just before the fog came on, and the tide was running up, that was our proper course—I cannot tell whether she had altered her course when she was struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the steamer stopped at once, after the accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was picked up by one of the steamer's boats—we were fully loaded with ballast, sixty tons is a full load; more than a foot of the lighter is out of the water when fully loaded—there is only one most, the sail was rolled round it—we took the soil down because there was no wind, and we had no use for it—the fog came on about half an hour before we were struck—it came on gradually, but all at once it got very thick sud<lb></lb>denly—we had no fog-horn, or whistle—we had one light on board to put up when we are at anchor, that was not put up—Abbott had not gone down to get his breakfast after the sail was fastened up, we had no <hi rend="italic">grub</hi> at all in the lighter—I am sure he was not below, because I left him ten minutes before that, and whether he went forward, or stood in the sheets, I do not know—he could have gone down without passing me—my father had not left the tiller, I saw him there just before the collision, and when I was picked up my father's cap was picked up with me, and the lighter's boat did not sink</p>

               <p>—if I have said that Abbott and my father were down below, I was not in my proper senses, and I do not remember saying so—I was examined at both inquests—I believe the defendant was examined on both occasions, but I was only in the room at one inquest while I gave evidence—I only saw him at Abbott's inquest.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a lighterman for twenty years—on Friday morning, 25th March, I was in a sailing barge, at anchor, just by where the accident happened, 200 or 250 yards to southward—I saw the Trinity lighter, from ten to fifteen minutes before the accident, driving up nearly abreast of where my barge was lying, very slowly indeed, as it was nearly slack tide—it was 7 o'clock, or a little after—I was standing in my barge scuttle, smoking a pipe—there was no fog on the south shore, where I lay—a fog was rising from the north shore, and driving from the north side, towards the south—the deceased's lighter was nearly in mid-channel—it was hazy in mid-channel; but there was no fog, it had not got so far then—there was no wind—the lighter was in her right position; her head was to the southward—I saw the screw coming down above Hook's Ness Point—that is about 200 yards from where I was lying—when she was about two lighter's lengths I heard them sing out on the steamer "shard-a-starboard!"—the screw might be two or three steamer's lengths from the lighter—she was going very fast, from seven to eight knots an hour, it appeared to me—that would be very fast—I was about 150 or 200 yards from her when I heard that, and could see her plainly—a very few seconds after that she went in collision with the lighter, and nearly over it—I could hear the report of the collision quite plain, and the lighter went under the water directly—the fog then came over from the north shore, and I could fee no more; but I heard the screw let go her anchor—the fog came over like a black smoke at the moment she struck the lighter, and I could see no more—the fog cleared off at high water, about an hour afterwards—I could then only see the top of the lighter's mast—I saw one piece of her floating, when I went away in my barge—I do not understand the speed of steam-boats, and am not a good judge of it; but it was impossible for the lighter to have got away—she was struck on the starboard quarter—I could not see anybody on board her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am surveyor to the Trinity House—on 1st April, after the lighter was raised, I made a survey of her—she was then ashore for repairs—she had been afloat eleven years—she was in first-rate condition before the accident—the mast was broken in two pieces, and there was an opening of 7ft. on the starboard side aft—the whole of the planks outside were cut down to within 3ft. of the keel—the ship's bow had gone across her, cutting the deck asunder, breaking the beams and carlines, and breaking the sheer straight and gunwale, on the port side—a speed of seven or eight knots would cause that—the lighter was literally still—it would</p>

               <p>take more to knock her under, with all that ballast she would not fall away—I am supposing the steamer to be empty—if the men had been in the lighter cabin their bodies would have been literally smashed, because the cabin is so small, that the bow of the steamer went right into it, and like<lb></lb>wise the planks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

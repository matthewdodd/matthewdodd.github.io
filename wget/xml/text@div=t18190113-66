On the 2d of January, about eleven o'clock in the morning, two men came for a pianoforte, which was on the ground-floor. I took them into the back parlour for it, and left the street-door open. I followed the men out, and immediately missed the clock off the mantle-piece in the front parlour - I saw the footmarks where the clock had stood - I had seen it safe just before. There was time for a man to go in and take it while we were in the back parlour. I ran to the door, and told the people of the robbery. The men could not take it; I was with them all the time. I saw the clock at the watch-house about a week after.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 2d of January, I saw the prisoner and another man in Castle-street, about a quarter before two o'clock - they went up Nottingham-court, which is about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house - the prisoner was carrying the clock, concealed in an apron. I laid hold of him, and asked him where he got it? he said a gentleman gave it to him at Charing-cross to carry to Holborn. I took the prisoner, and my brother took the other. I advertised the clock, and no owner coming for it in the course of a week, the men were discharged. I afterwards showed the clock to Brunton. On the Wednesday following my brother brought Jones into the watch-house, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night. I cannot find his companion.</p>

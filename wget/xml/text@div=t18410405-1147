                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. William Blackmail Noble and another, who keep the Friern Dairy-farm. The prisoner was in their employ in January last—here is a paper by which he was engaged at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, and the further sum of 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per quart on all the milk he sold above sixty quarts per day—it is signed by him, and dated the 23rd of November—it was his duty to take out the bills to the customers, and it was my duty to make out the bills—I made out this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) to Mrs. Bass for one week's milk, ending on the 2nd of January, and on the Monday following I gave it to the prisoner—it is one of the printed forms of the farm—when I made it out, the first item on it was an arrear of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was for four weeks previous, and immediately after that was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that week's milk, making a total of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—our collector received this bill back from the customer—the words "J. Tolhurst," on the bottom of it, are the prisoner's handwriting—the bill is not now in the state it was when I delivered it to the prisoner—the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. have been erased, leaving on it only the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that week's milk—here is the bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) for the week's milk up to the 9th of January, to Mrs. Bass—I made out a bill to the 9th, and delivered it to the prisoner on the Monday as usual—this is not the bill which I delivered to him—the arrears of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. have been omitted, and the total also, which was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., leaving on it 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. only—on the 16th I delivered him this other bill—it is not now in the same state, the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. have been erased—this bill of the 9th of January is in the prisoner's writing—here is no erasure on this—the prisoner had no proper access to any of the bills of the farm—he has never accounted to me for these sums received—I do not know when he left.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mrs. Bass, of Hatton-garden.

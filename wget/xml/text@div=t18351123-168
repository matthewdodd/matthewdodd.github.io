                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Richard Redman—he is a linen-draper, living at Lewisham. On the 11th of November, the two prisoners came to the shop, and asked for some patch-work pieces—I looked about for some, and found there was none—I then missed a shawl—the prisoners were in the shop at the time—they went away, and I went after them—I caught Dunn, who went out of the shop first—Keefe had spoken to Dunn while they were in the shop, and asked her what she touched the shawls for—told her she would tell her father, and sent her out of the shop, and keefe went in about five minutes—I followed Keefe—she saw me, and ran behind a carriage—I then returned, and found Dunn nearer to our shop than where I left Keefe—I asked her what she had under her tippet—she said a shirt, which her father had just bought—I asked her to let me look at it—she said she should not, and ran away—I ran, and caught her, she threw the two shawls down, which are my master's—she said, "Take me, take me, but let the other girl go.

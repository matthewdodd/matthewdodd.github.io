On the 21st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170042"></xptr>September, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, leaving no person in the house. I locked the door, and took the key with me. I fastened the windows and doors. I returned again before nine o'clock-it was quite dark; I found the door ajar-it pushed back as I put the key in; I immediately pulled it to and locked it. I called Lee, my next-door neighbour. I unlocked the door, and entered with the watchman, Lee, and another man. We found the counterpane, and several other things were thrown down stairs; we found the drawers had been opened on the first-floor, and some of the things thrown down stairs, and others moved about. We found the prisoners in the upper room. I secured them, and asked them what brought them there? Scott said, distress - We gave them in charge.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LEE. On the 21st of September, about nine o'clock, as I was going to bed, Nixon alarmed me-it was quite dark. I found the things laying about on the floor, the drawers broken upon, and things thrown down stairs. We found the prisoners up stairs.</p>
               <p>DIX MOORE. I am a constable. I was sent for, and took the prisoners into custody - I took the property out of the passage.</p>
               <p>THOMAS VANN. I am constable of St. Luke's. I assisted in taking the prisoners to the watch-house, and took the property out of the passage. I have had it ever since. There were no marks of violence on the doors.</p>

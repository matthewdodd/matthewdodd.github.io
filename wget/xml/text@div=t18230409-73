I went into a public-house, the prisoner rushed in after me, and said, I had better give them some. I told the landlady to give them half a pint of gin - I pulled out my purse and paid for it. I then had 1 l. 18 s. 6 d., and came out, they rushed out after me. The prisoner thrust her hand into my pocket, and took my purse and money out. The others pushed against me. I called the watchman and pursued her - I am sure she was the one who took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You recollect receiving a sum of money from Bousfield and Fitzgerald to prosecute me - A. I have not received money to prosecute her. I swore to Bousfield and Fitzgerald at the watch-house; they were in her company.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half past two o'clock, on the morning of the 1st of March, the prosecutor called to me, and described the prisoner to me. I knew her by his description. I took her at night, and said,</p>

               <p>"Now Kit you have done him." She smiled, and said she had. I said,</p>
               <p>"He thinks worse about the purse, than about the money." She said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, it was as pretty a steel purse as ever a man put into his pocket; and Barry, you shall have it to-morrow night."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left him in company with five females; and why does he not swear to the other two, who are in the prison, as well as to me - he is paid not to prosecute them.</p>
               <p>MURRAY re-examined. The bill was thrown out against the other two. Their friends came home to me several times, and asked me to take money not to prosecute them. I said I must do my duty; and one night a friend came and offered me 5 l. I said, if they gave me 10 l., I would prosecute. He put down 16 s., and said, that is yours. I took it up, threw it down, and said, I would not have it - he went away, so I put it in my pocket.</p>

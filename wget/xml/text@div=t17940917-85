               <p>Q. Were these articles lost from your house? - Yes, they were; where my wife is; she is on her death-bed now; she did not know any thing at all about it till these duplicates were lost and found again; I hired her as a servant; I gave her so much a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things missing while the woman was with you? - I never missed them till the duplicates were lost and found again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you with the duplicates? - She went out that night and lost them, and a fellow servant went out that same road and picked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the duplicates in her name? - They were all in her name.</p>

               <p>Cabuac. I produce one cotton gown, a muslin neckcloth, two salts, a pair of ribbed hose, and a damask napkin. I did not take them all in, I only took two of the articles of that woman at the bar; the muslin neckcloth the 26th of August, and a napkin the 6th of June; I knew her person, she had used the shop for some time; they were pawned in her own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the duplicates which the constable has got correspond with the other two things; namely, the two shirts and the gown? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I know this neckcloth to be mine; I will take my oath of it before any justice in the world; I am sure it is my neckcloth; it has no name on it; it is the size, and I missed such a one; it is gone out of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say of that napkin? - As to the napkin I will not swear to it all; I missed such a thing, but I will not swear to it at all.</p>

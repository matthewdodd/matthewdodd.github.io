                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Donnell; we keep a brothel. On Saturday night, 23rd Dec., the prisoner came to our house and brought a woman—he asked for a room, and I showed him one—I asked him for the money—he gave me half a crown—I sent my daughter to get change; she came back and said it was bad—I gave it to the pri<lb></lb>soner, and asked him to give me some other money—he said he had no more—I sent for a policeman, and gave him the half crown—before the police<lb></lb>man came I saw the prisoner put his hand in his pocket and throw a bad shilling on the ground—I heard it fall, and when the policeman came, the young woman who was with the prisoner took up the shilling, and gave it to the policeman—the prisoner was taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 108). On Saturday night, 23rd Dec., I was called into Mrs. Donnell's house—I found the prisoner, and a woman in the room with him—Mrs. Donnell gave me this bad half crown—she said that the prisoner had dropped some money on the floor—I told the young woman to stoop down and see if she could see any, and she found this shilling—I found a half crown on the prisoner—I took him to the station, and found eight shillings and three half crowns in his inside waistcoat pocket, wrapped up in paper—he had outside pockets, but there was nothing in them—he refused to give his address—I asked him where he got the money; he made no answer—on the 26th, he said he picked it up in the street—when I took him into custody he had had a drop to drink, but he was sober.</p>

               <p>night, the 23rd; and on Tuesday, the 26th, I took him to the Court—in the meanwhile he had been locked up in the cell—I had not been in attendance upon him—I will undertake to say positively that I asked him at the station where he got the money—the sergeant and two men on the reserve were present at the station when I did so—I found only one pocket handkerchief on him—I went to see where he lived—I did not go to his master—I never saw him before that evening to my knowledge.</p>

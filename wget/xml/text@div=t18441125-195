                  </hi>. I live at No. 29, Gibson-street, in the parish of Lambeth—it is the dwelling-house of my father, William Ridg-yard, the elder—he is the tenant of the whole house—the prisoner is my brother—he did not live in the house—he did so about a year and a half ago, but had left, and had been forbidden the house—on the 13th of Nov. I had sixteen sovereigns of my own, and seventeen half-sovereigns of my father's, safe in a box which was locked, and was kept in my bedroom in the upper part of the house—on the 16th of Nov., about half-past eleven at night, I discovered that the lid of the box had been moved, and the bot<lb></lb>tom wrenched out, and the money all gone—I also missed a shirt and</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Spinks, a dyer, and lodge in the prosecutor's house—on Thursday, the 14th of Nov., I saw the prisoner unlocking the room door where the last witness slept—he went in, and remained about half an hour—the door was not closed—it was ajar—I was standing in the passage on the same floor—ours is the next room—I heard him come out—he shut and locked the door, and went down stairs—I saw him clearly, and am certain it was the prisoner—on Satur<lb></lb>day, day, the 16th, my husband went out at the street door, about twenty mi<lb></lb>nutes past three, and I heard a man come in and go up stairs—I heard him unlock this bedroom door, and go in—I did not hear him come out—I do not know who that was—I was in the adjoining room all the evening.</p>

I knew him by sight before, and knew he was the landlord's son—he was in the habit of coming to the house latterly—I saw him for about a month coming there often once or twice a day—he used to stand outside the door, and when he saw a lodger go in or out he used to <hi rend="italic">whip</hi> in at the door—he was not in the habit of doing so to the family—he used to go down into the kitchen when he came in—his father works at a shop-when he is at home he resides in the parlour—I never saw the prisoner in the parlour—he used to go down into the kitchen—his father and mother sleep there—she used to see him come in sometimes—he did not find his mother in the kitchen when he went there—I do not know whether there was any one there.</p>

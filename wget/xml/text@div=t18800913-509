                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker in Pulford Street, Pimlico—on Sunday night, 25th July, about 10 minutes or a quarter past 11 o'clock, I was in Bessborough Street with Mr. Emmett—I had been out for a walk and was coming home, and opposite No. 9 I saw some persons; I could not say how many, because we were bounced upon; there may have been eight or nine—Emmett was knocked down on the door-step, and then Jackson and Gorman were on to me, and I was knocked down and kicked all over, my eye was cut and bleeding—I was held down, I had hold of Dixon with my right hand and he had hold of me—I was trying to get up—some of them said "Keep the b——down"—my watch was pulled right away from the chain, the swivel broke—I did not see who did it—I knew the prisoner before for nearly two years by hanging about the corners of the streets—a constable came up in four or five minutes—Dixon was standing alongside of me and I gave him into custody—I gave the others in custody next day as I came from the police-court.</p>

It was a fine night—there were gas-lamps in the street—I had been over to Kennington Oval to see a friend with Mr. Emmett and Mr. Jones—we went into one public-house and had a pot of ale between four of us—we were walking together in Bessborough Street, I met two other friends and stopped and talked to them, and Emmett and Jones went on ahead—I did not give a description of Jackson to the police<lb></lb>man that night—he was near my house when I charged him on the Monday—I had known him by sight, but not to speak to—I had some money in my pockets on this night—I did not lose any—my watch was taken—I have not got my chain hero.</p>

I was close to Emmett when he was shoved into the doorway—I did not interfere in his behalf—Gorman and Jackson then attacked me, kicking me about the legs and trying to knock me down—I don't know where Dixon was at that time, I did not see him then—after I was knocked down I had hold of him, and he was holding me across the shoulders, and when I got up I stood alongside of him till I gave him in charge—T told the policeman he had knocked mo down—I missed my watch when Mr. Jones came up, about a minute or two afterwards—I did not feel anything at my chain.</p>

I am a coachman, and live in Pulford Street—I was in company with Watts on Sunday evening, 25th July—I went with him to Kennington Oval, and we had a pot of ale there between four—we returned as far as Bessborough Street—I and Watts were together; the other two had gone" on ahead; a mob of young fellows came across the road and attacked us; they asked me what I wanted and who I was, and I was pushed down in a doorway—a handkerchief was taken from my breast pocket—after I got up I saw Watts's hat on the ground; he was lying on his back on the ground; there were three or four about him, and Dixon was holding him down; I could not recognise the others—I picked up Watts's hat and ran for assistance—I got assistance directly, Mr. Jones and a policeman, and returned in a second, and Watts was then standing up and Dixon by his side—I saw blood coining from his eye.</p>

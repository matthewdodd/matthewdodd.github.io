On the 19th of November, I left two cruet-stands on a shelf in the coffee-room, at eleven o'clock at night, when I went down to supper - I left no one in the room; I went up again in three minutes, and saw the prisoner with the two cruet-stands in his hand - he was coming out at the door as I went in; he then placed them on the table and walked out - I do not know whether he had taken them up to look at, or whether he was going to take them away - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280109"></xptr>shelf they had been on is about a yard and a half from the door - he was going out; I caught hold of him - he got from me, and broke the window and ran out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Do you know that he went there to measure a gentleman for some clothes? A. No; he had these stands in his hand - he was not disguising them - I do not know what he meant to do with them; he ran when he had broken the window - he gave his address, but I forget it.</p>

             (police-constable C 152). I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running; I stopped him and took him back - he seemed very much confused - he said a gentleman appointed to meet him there to pay him a bill.</p>
               <p>The prisoner stated in his defence, that he had gone there to meet a gentleman on business; and no one being there, he had taken the stands up to look at.</p>

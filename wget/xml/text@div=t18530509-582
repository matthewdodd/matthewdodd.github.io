On Sunday night 10th April, I went to bed about 9 o'clock—before I went to bed I went into my back room, bolted the back door, and everything was then safe—the next morning, I was called up by a lodger—I then found the back room window was half out, it had been left safe the previous night—I found the things piled up ready to take away—this saucepan had been taken out—it is mine, and had been left safe the night before.</p>

On Monday morning 11th April I went down stairs about half past 5 o'clock, and went in the back yard—I met the prisoner coming out of the yard, with this saucepan in his band—I questioned him what he did there, his answer was, "Nothing"—he put the saucepan down in the street on the stones, and ran away—I awoke my neighbours, and acquainted the police—I had not known the prisoner before—I am sure be is the person, I gave a description of him to the police.</p>

I know the prisoner; he offered me a watch to sell in a cook's shop, in the street where I live; he came in the cook's shop, he asked me to buy an old watch; I looked at the watch; I bid him ten shillings for it. He came to my house the next day, and in my room he again offered me the watch; I looked at the watch; I told him I could not buy it, it was not good. My box was open, he could then see my pearls and watches. I told him I had got good watches; he went away. I did not see any thing. On Saturday night, the 5th of March, I was at the Synagogne.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your things - A. On that 5th of March. A week after I had seen the prisoner at my house, from the information of Rachel

             I and two officers went to the prisoner's lodgings, Tower-hill; we there found the prisoner and part of the property.</p>
               <p>WOOLF SOLOMONS. From the information of Mrs. Davis, on the 26th of March, in the evening, we found the prisoner in his room on Tower-hill; he was at supper, with a great coat on his chair by his side. I asked him who the coat belonged to; he made no answer. I took up the coat, and out of the pocket I pulled out these four bunches of pearls. The prosecutor was with us; he identified the property. The prisoner said he found them.</p>

            . I accompanied Woolf Solomons and the prosecutor. I told the prisoner I wanted him. I looked on the ground; I took up that coat. I said to the prisoner, is this your coat; he made no answer. I put my hand into the pocket, and pulled out four bunches of pearls. Pincas said he lost four bunches, four large single beads, and some loose ones. The pearls found on the prisoner perfectly correspond with the account of the prosecutor. These are them. The prisoner said he knew nothing of the other property. I conveyed him to the Compter. It was by Mrs. Davis's directions I went to this place.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; he lodged in my house. On the 5th of March, he came home with a lanthorn in his hand, between eight and nine at night; he asked me to lend him a piece of candle, which I did. He went out with it; he returned home in less than half an hour, with a bundle with him; he appeared all in a tremble and a perspiration. On the next day at breakfast, the prisoner said there had been a robbery at Mr. Moses's, he was glad of it; he was a bad man. When the prisoner came home with the bundle he went out again, and left the bundle behind him. He returned, and took the property away at eleven o'clock at night, the same night. I then said, halloo, what are you doing; I have lost my husband through a lodger, and I will not lose my liberty through lodgers. I gave information to the officers.</p>

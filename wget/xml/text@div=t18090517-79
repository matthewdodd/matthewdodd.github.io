               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 9th of May, the prisoners coming to your shop - A. Yes; they came to the door together, Conner came in and asked for a couple of black puddings, she paid my little girl in halfpence, two pence; she stopped there some time, and Mrs. Ryan came in, and asked for a quartern loaf, that came to fifteen-pence three-farthings, she laid down two sixpences and two-pence halfpenny, she said she had no more money; I told her to owe me the farthing till she came again; she then took a small pocket book out of her pocket, she told me to take a six-pence out of it to take the farthing; I sounded the six-pence, it proved to be a bad one; I told her to owe me the farthing still; then the two woman pushed one another by the arm; then Conner called for a half quartern loaf and a couple of eggs, that came to nine-pence halfpenny; she gave me two six-pences, I gave her two-pence halfpenny; they both of them turned to go out of the shop; I followed them round the counter, and sent my little girl after my uncle, to come to my assistance;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170052"></xptr>my uncle came, is name is Adams. We pursued them; they turned to the right, going out of Field-lane to go into Holborn; they made a stop about three doors round the corner, both together; I said to my uncle, these are the two women that gave me the bad money. Conner made to run away, I took her by the apron, and held her till my uncle came to me; my uncle took them both in custody till the officer came. I saw them taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the six-pences - A. I gave them to the officer, and a shilling that I picked up; that was the shilling that Mrs. Ryan dropped out of her hand when the officer came. That is the shilling that she offered me first.</p>

            . I am a commodore of the merchant's births at the India House. In June last, Messrs. Brown and Rogers, had a great quantity of romalls in my room that they had purchased at our sale; they are prohibited to be used in this country; they are pieces of handkerchiefs. In the latter end of June, I received a packing order from Messrs. Browns and Rogers, ordering fifty pieces to be packed out of two seperate lots, respectively numbered, 1366, and 1397; they were to be put in a trunk, on which were to be put the marks and figures spoken of by the last witness; they were accordingly packed in a two feet six inch trunk on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180039"></xptr>28th of June, fifty pieces; the trunk was numbered and marked as directed. As soon as I put the goods in, I locked it down, which was with a good deal of exertion as it was quite full, and took three or four to held it, while I locked it; I put the key in my pocket, and the trunk maker was in waiting, and he immediately put the mat on and nailed it, and corded it, and the trunk remained in my possession until the 19th of July, on which day it was called for, and I myself dragged it to the loop-hole of my room, to put it into the cart; this is the top of all the warehouse, and I lowered it down to what we call the lobby, where they are delivered, they are then weighed; an officer weighs them. This was on the 19th of July. During the time it was packed up, it was as far from the loop hole, as I am from you; in a public room where there are servants of the company and merchants continually backwards and forwards. At the time I so lowered it to where it was weighed, it was in the same state to all appearance, as when the packer left it. I look at that trunk, and swear it is the trunk; I swear to the mark and number, because I marked it myself, a thing I don't often do; but I did this. I have since seen the goods that were found, they are similar romalls.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HIGHBY. I am a looker to the Customs, on duty at the East India Company's warehouses. I saw the packing in a trunk of some India silk romalls on the 28th of June last; I counted out fifty pieces of romalls pullicatis; they were to be packed in a trunk, marked O with an X run through it, and numbered 301; it was packed for Messrs. Brown, Rogers and Brown. I saw Mr. Pryor the last witness pack these pieces; there were five other trunks of nearly the same size. The trunk produced has every appearance of being the trunk alluded to; I believe it to be the same, and have no doubt about it. After it was packed, on the 19th of July I received my orders for the delivery of it, from the customers, and I delivered it into a cart from the loop hole of the West area, on a lower tier than that on whcih it had been packed; I saw it put into the cart myself.</p>

            . On the 19th of July, I received from Mr. Goble six trunks; this paper, is a cart note, called a shipping note, without which I could not receive them; I received it from Messrs Brown and Co; I saw these things in the cart and took them out of the cart; I did not tick them off. I remember that there were six trunks, I know that particularly, because it was a wet day, and we were obliged to cover them occasionally with a tarpaulin. These were three bales besides the trunks; they were all for Brown and Co; they were all for the same proprietor, and were to be shipped on board the same lighter, and were so. I will not swear whether I saw any of the prisoners in the lighter;

             I might have seen, but the other was not there. When I saw them in the craft, I did not make any particular remark; but they were stowing them away. The lighter lay at the further end of the Custom House Quay, right under the crane, No. 4; all the cranes are numbered.</p>

On the 19th of July, I put some goods, on board a lighter of ours, she was lying under No.4 crane; the goods consisted of trunks and bales, I think there were six trunks. I look at the trunk produced, it has the same mark and number. Rawlinson, Bonner, and Leanord were stowing away. I gave directions how they were to pack the trunks, I told them not to put the bales at the bottom, and Leonard said what odds, and the other men could hear him. They were not stowed, as I ordered them to be, they put the trunks on the bales instead of the bales on them. After all the things were on board, I took up the tarpaulin, let down the hatches, and put over the hatch bars; I did not lock them; the trunks were below. This was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of the 19th.</p>

            . I look at that trunk, I saw that and five more on board a lighter of Mr. Olivers, lying near the crane, No. 4, Custom House Quay; they were stowed, I did not see them stow them on board; I did not observe the stowage at that time; I had given orders for the trunks to be put below the bales. On the next morning I found that they were not so, but that they were at top, contrary to the orders I had given; I saw them on board the lighter between twelve and one on the 19th. I had one key of the batch bars; they were not locked, until they were locked in my presence, about seven, or between six and seven; there are two keys, and I had both after they were locked down; and I made the man that locked them, shake the locks to see if they were safe. The lighter was then put out of the birth where she lay, and another lighter estern of her, was put into her place, and this was put more forward in the river, a lighter's length further out.

             was employed in that, the other prisoner was not in that lighter at all. About nine, I gave orders that he and Rawlinson should be out for the night, to take charge of that lighter; I told them that I should be over in the morning between four and five, and that I should appoint another man, so that we might put her down against tide, in the tier below the Tender; I mean by against tide, in expectation of tide. The ship Scicily, lay just below the Tender. I gave the prisoners no more orders about what they were to do than I have described. I appointed the two of them to be with it, knowing it to be of great value. Peg was to be a watchman, and was to be with it all night. I had not mentioned that they were of great value to either of the prisoners; not having the keys, they could not get below, as I imagined I had the key of the scuttle, and the keys of the bars, and I thought they could not get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180040"></xptr>down below. I saw the lighter again at eleven at night. Having loaded a craft, I went down to see if all was safe at eleven o'clock at night again. When I got-down by the water side, I heard two men, Rawlinson and Peg, talking to a man named Bonner; on hearing their voices, I told them that was not their charge, and told them to go to their charge. Bonaer was on board a barge alongside, and these two men were talking with him; I don't know whether they were with Bonner in his barge, but I know they were off their own lighter that they had charge of; they were either in Bonner's barge, or in a lighter lying by. I told them that was not their place, and they ought to go on board their own lighter. They went on board in consequence of what I said to them. Consistently with their duty, they could not be away from their charge. I next went to the lighter at about a quarter before five in the morning; the prisoners were neither of them there. I unlocked the stern scuttle, and went down below; I saw the six trunks all lying at the top of the bales; that was the first time I knew that my orders had not been attended to in that respect, I saw every thing right as I thought. I made some inquiries. I saw the prisoners at a quarter after five or half after; I was in the lighter when they came; I sent after them, they were both together, I believe I accused them of being absent from their charge. I then gave Rawlinson the keys of the lighter and the shipping note to deliver the goods. I employed Peg in other business; he went down with the lighter with Rawlinson and two more men. The lighter had got to go the distance from about this to St. Sephulchre's church to the Scicily. I went to the searchers office about twelve; I met Mr. Oliver, and Mr. Wolfe coming down the gateway; Mr. Wolfe is the searcher of the Custom House. I then received some information; I then learned that the property had been taken from the lighter. Maize the watchman was there. He stated some circumstances that occured to his observation; he spoke of some persons that he had seen, and his description of those persons corresponded with the two prisoners at the bar, Neither of them was present, or in sight.</p>
               <p>SIMON MAIZE. I am a watchman of Portsoken Ward; my station is at the corner of Swan-street, facing John-street in the Minories. On the morning of the 20th of July, I observed three men coming towards me at aboat a quarter before four, they came up John-street towards the Minories; at that time in the morning, it was broad daylight; John-street is the direct road from the Custom House Quay, and a person coming from the Custom House would and must come up that way. Two out of these three men had bundles, the third had nothing that I could perceive in his hand; he was in company with them. They came to the corner of America-square; and then the third man came into the Minories, towards Tower Hill; then they made for Redlion Court that is rather higher up in the Minories; the other without the bundle, came up the Minories towards my box; he passed me, and addressed me; he said it is almost four o'clock watchman is it not; I said yes, it is very near. He then went down the Minories as if he was going towards Tower Hill; the course that the took was apparently towards Redlion Court. I know the man by his features, and I know that he was very much dishaped by his walk, very lame, and very much knock kneed; Peg is that man I have no doubt at all that he is the man. After he passed me, I went down Goodman's yard; thinking I should see those two with the bundles go by again. When I got down to the bottom of the yard I did not see anything of them not just then; I then went into Redlion Court and there was Rawlinson with one of the bundles; there were Rawlinson, Peg and another man with the bundles; the other man had the other bundle. With that I went up to Rawlinson with the bundle, as he stood right facing me; he had the bundle in his hand, I asked him what he had there, and he said nothing of any consequence; with that he threw the bundle down, and made his escape; the others threw their bundle down, and all three made their escape just at that time. They ran away as fast as they could; the court is not very long. I took up the two bundles, and threw them into my box. Just as I got to my box, one of the patroles came up, his name is Hargraves; he asked me what I had got, I told him I did not know, but I gave them to Hargraves, and after that returned to my daty. In consequence of information, which I had, I went to the Custom House and described to Waller the men whom I had seen. in consequence of further information, I went down to the London Docks, and in the London Dock No.2, I found one of the prisoner's lying on his back; he did not appear to me to be asleep; it was peg. The officer roused him; I told him he was one; I saw as soon as he got up on his backside, that he was one of the men. He had the same features to me, and stood on the same legs. I afterwards saw him on his legs, and was then more sure of him. When all three had thrown down the bundles, and ran away; they all ran the same way. We took Peg into custody, and went to his lodging; we afterwards took a boat at St. Catherine's stairs, and went to the Scicily; she was lying just below the tier. When I got to the Scicily, I was told to look round, and I saw Robinson in the craft eating a bit of biscuit. I pointed him out to Forrester, and he was secured. I am sure he is one of the men; I saw him in America-square. I described them before I saw them.</p>

We found nothing there relating to this charge. When I returned to the watchhouse, the two bundles were there. I examined them, and discovered their contents; Maize described the persons of the prisoners at the bar, which description they answered when they were taken. In the bundles I found twenty-two pieces of silk handkerchiefs. I was in company with Maize when the prisoner Peg was in his sight afterwards, and at the time he saw Rawlinson I was ordered to have a strict guard over him, that he might not make a bolt; I had not laid hands on him nor taken him into custody; Maize said that he was confident they were the men that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180041"></xptr>had seen in the early part of the morning. When first Maize came on board, Flam on was eating a bit of biscuit with a piece of boiled meat, beef, I believe; and was sitting down, and he knew him almost immediately.</p>
               <p>ROBERT OLIVER. I am a lighter-man. On hearing what had happened, I went on board the Scicily; I saw Rawlinson there; I asked him if he was not a pretty rascal, to rob his own charge; he said, that the goods were all right, and that he had never left her; I believe this was about twelve o'clock, or a little after; it was before he was apprehended. I went on conversing about the circumstances of the transaction; while I was so conversing, the trunks were brought in for examination. Rawlinson then said that he had left the craft for a little while, and had been on shore; I think he said, to Dark-house-lane; that is near Billingsgate. I did not pay much attention to him. After that, I saw the trunks examined; the one in question appeared to have been opened; by looking at it, I could tell that; the matting seemed all torn, and the nails were only here and there placed in the iron hoops. I have no doubt of its having been opened; I was perfectly satisfied of that. When we took the matting off. we observed that the lock was broken off; I looked into this trunk, and there were only eleven pieces; there ought to have been fifty; thirty-nine were missing; their place was supplied with old rope and old tarpaulin.</p>

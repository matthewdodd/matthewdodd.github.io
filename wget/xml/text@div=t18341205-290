On the 9th of December, at half-past eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came in and stood at the bar where I was serving—he asked for two-penny-worth of rum, which I supplied him with, and he gave me a crown-piece—I flung it on the counter to see if it was good—I told him it was bad—he said he wished he bad a thousand of them—I had not change for it, and gave it to my master—he thought it was a good one, as he took it of me—I had bit it before I gave it to him—the prisoner received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, sold went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the coroners for the county of Middlesex—I held an inquest on the body of Lucy Redhead, on Saturday, 28th March—Mary Ann King was called as a witness upon that inquiry—she was sworn, I have here notes of the evidence which she gave and which I took down—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Mary Ann King having been sworn, said, 'I live at 78, Euston-road, and the deceased, Lucy Redhead, lived with me as general servant. The deceased had had a cough for some time, but she never had any medical attendance; she left my service this day fortnight, on 3rd March, the deceased received a blow from a person named England; she never laid down in her bed after the blow, and never did any work after<lb></lb>wards, she never complained to me before the blow. She did the work for a 10 roomed house, and never gave up, on 23rd March, England came to my house and asked for me. I was dressing in the next room, and heard the conversation in the next room. Mr. England afterwards struck me on the chest, and also the deceased, the deceased went to fetch a policeman; she sat on the window ledge the whole of that night, because she could not lie down in bed, she remained in the same state, and two days afterwards she spat blood. She went once to the University College after that; she fell up against a large dining table when she was struck, she wore stays"—There was a post-mortem investigation at my instance, made by Mr. Devereux a gentleman in the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Clarendon-square, Somerstown, and manage a loan office—in the early part of last year, Mrs. King the defendant called upon me, and after some negociations I consented to lend her 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a bill of sale of some furniture—it was executed, deducting 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest—she was to pay me by instalments of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—at that time the furniture was at 44, Clarendon-square—she then lived in that house—I went there and saw the furniture—I told her if there was any rent due to let me know, and I should pay it for her—the bill of sale was executed in August last year—I think about the beginning of March this year, informa<lb></lb>tion was brought to me, and I went to the house in Clarendon-square—I found nearly the whole of the furniture gone—all the best of it was gone, leaving the rubbish—after making inquiries, I found that it bad been taken to 78, Euston-road—I got Mr. Hay and three carmen to go with me between 6 and 7, on Tuesday evening, 3rd March—I knocked at the door and asked for Mrs. King—I was directed to the first floor—we all went up, and I just knocked with my knuckle at the door—a little boy opened it with a candle in his hand—he said Mrs. King was not in—she was in the back room when I first entered—she came out—I removed the furniture—it took us half an, hour or it might be three quarters, with the assistance of the men—I saw a young girl sitting on the sofa with some children—I believe it was Redhead, the deceased—a policeman was sent for. by Mrs. King, when he came we showed him the bill of sale, and he went away—he said he could not inter<lb></lb>fere—I never touched Mrs. King during the whole time I was there—the other men were in the room the whole time—it is not true that I struck Lucy Redhead a violent blow on the chest—I never touched her on the chest—I never touched her—I was not near enough to her to strike her—the men were in the room, and by the door the whole of the time—I swear I never struck Mrs. King.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Lucy Redhead speak to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did not till afterwards, when I asked her who she was—not before the policeman came—she was desired by Mrs. King to go out and fetch a policeman—Mrs. King had her back against the door to prevent us removing the things—I afterwards saw her on the floor—she slipped down and I helped her up—there was not a struggle and a scuffle between us, more than I lifting her up and putting her on a chair or a box—there were no screams of murder that I heard—the children were making a noise—Mrs. King afterwards said she had been badly advised, and she was sorry she had removed the things—I did not charge her with stealing the things—I said it was very bad of her to take them away—she did not say they were her daughter's at that time—I think Lucy Redhead was out of the room when Mrs. King was on the floor—I don't know—the table was not always between me and Lucy Redhead, because when she came out to go for a policeman, she had to pass me—I do not know Mr. Dobbin, Mr. Knight's agent—I was at Westminster when the action was tried—I believe a man named Dobbin was examined there—he gave me the information, that the things were taken away from the house—he said they were distrained for rent, and the things had been taken away—I believe he said they had been given by Mr. Knight to the daughter—I will not be positive—I had known Mrs. King some little time</p>

               <p>before this transaction—I never saw her husband when he was living—she kept a chandler's shop in Wells-street, when she borrowed this money of me—I told her the furniture at Clarendon-square was worth between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was afterwards arranged that the furniture at Wells-street should be included in the bill of sale—I know nothing of Mrs. King's sister dying, and the orphan children coming to live with her—I did not take away a single article of wearing apparel on this occasion—I have not had to pay for the removal of those very articles—I had a summons to go to the police court—I employed Mr. Begbie on that summons—I asked him to go—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have been written by him, but not by my direction—I instructed him to get an adjournment on 7th March—a witness could not come because the Princess came into London on that day—before that summons I was served with a writ at the suit of Mrs. King, and I received this letter from her attorney—that was before the adjournment, the writ was served on me some time after the receipt of that letter—it might have been the 12th, I cannot say the day—I knew there were actions pending—I believed by the daughter and by Mrs. King—the officer brought me this summons on the Thursday evening, about half-past nine—I told him I could not attend because I was summoned to the Divorce Court—I did not know I was summoned to give evidence—I thought it was for a juryman, and I also said it was out of the district, and there must have been some mistake—the officer might have said, "Mind I have served you, and you stay away at your peril"—I had a subpoena from the Divorce Court just before, and I showed it to him—I never heard of Lucy Redhead's death till I saw it in the papers—my solicitors, Walker and Twyford, applied to Mr. Tillett, and I went with them before him for a summons—it was refused because the case was pending, and we were to wait till that was over—after that we went to Mr. Knox, the Magistrate—I went with Mr. Ribton twice, I believe—Mr. Knox refused me the summons—I did not. afterwards threaten Mr. Tillett with a mandamus—Mr. Ribton did, I believe—it was then adjourned over from the first inquiry when Mr. Hay and I were ex<lb></lb>amined, until after the trial at Westminster Hall—I was examined on oath at the trial, and so was Mrs. King—a sum of money has been paid in respect of that action—I forget what; it might be 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a great deal of money—I don't know how much—an execution was put in my house by Mrs. King—my solicitor paid the amount—he had the money—I was not at home all day—they were in and out of the house in about five minutes, I think, or something like that—I took away everything from Mrs. King's, except her wearing apparel—I took no linen whatever, or clothes—I realised about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the goods that were left in Clarendon-square—the furniture might have come away in three vans, but there was not a van load altogether—I afterwards got paid back a sum of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. running from August to March—Mrs. King said she could not pay 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and asked me whether I would allow her to pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and sometimes she paid 100. sometimes 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and sometimes nothing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I did not get this last item of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from her—I paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the court for her—there was a distress in her house—the execution creditor finding that I paid the money for her, abandoned it, and the court gave it up to me again—it was her debt, not mine—I did not make any other charge but the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not charge her a guinea for the inventory—I stated before the Magistrate that I had not touched Mrs. King to strike her—after the action was tried I attended the adjourned hearing before the Magistrate, at the Marlborough-street, Police-court—I don't think I was examined on the second occasion;</p>

               <p>my men were, and they had been examined at the trial—I did not hear the Magistrate say he would give me no assistance at all—the girl on the sofa was a little thin girl—I have stated that the table was between me and the girl all the time—I was not in the room at any time without Mr. Hay, and the men being present—they were there from first to last—they followed up the stairs close behind me—Mrs. King said that evening that the furniture belonged to her daughter—I heard of that before about 12 o'clock, from a man named Dobbin, I believe—I did not know his name.</p>

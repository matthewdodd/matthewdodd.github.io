We walked about, 'till two the next Morning, and met nobody, and so we sat down under White Chappel Mount, until Day break, and then we saw the Prosecutor, with a Woman, upon which Farrel said, let us go up - Here is a Chance - You are not afraid Tom? And then he gave me a Pistol: Hooper stepped up to the Prosecutor first, and clapped a Pistol to his Mouth, and swore G - D - your Blood, I will blow your Brains out. Hooper was in a light grey Coat, and a brown Frock and a white Waistcoat. Farrel had a Red Soldier's Wastcoat (for he belongs to the third Regiment) but he had pulled the Lace off: He searched the Prosecutor, and took his Buckles, which were afterwards found upon him, and I took the Prosecutor's Hat and Wig.</p>

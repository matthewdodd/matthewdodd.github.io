            . I am a watchman; and buy old clothes, and old rags, and such things. I met the prisoner with this coat, in Cheapside, last Saturday morning about nine o'clock. He asked me if I would buy it. I went with him down Pater-noster-row, and in a little court that goes from thence to St. Paul's-church-yard, there I bought it, and paid him the money, fourteen shillings; but told him I would not part with him till he sent for a surety. We were in a public-house; he wanted to break thro' the window; I held him, and the man of the house assisted me. I brought him before my lord-mayor; my lord ordered the coat to be advertised, and Mr. Cannicot came and described it before he saw it; and I went with him to Mr. Wrights. (Produced and deposed to by Cannicot.)</p>

               <p>My brother was a coachman; I had this coat of him; he was coachman to Mr. Hutchinson in Southampton. I offered it to this man; am a bricklayer; my brother has been dead some time; I am a Guernsey man.</p>

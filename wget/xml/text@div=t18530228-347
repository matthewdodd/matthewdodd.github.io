               <p>I enter my accounts regularly, I am in the habit of keeping accounts with regard to those rents, so that I could turn to any particular item I might require—I did not give the prisoner in charge for forgery, but for obtaining money under false pretences—I had not seen Ludford before I gave the prisoner in charge—I have since—I had no personal knowledge when I gave the prisoner in charge that the money had not been paid to Ludford—I did not give the prisoner in charge for felony—I knew that I had lost, because there was a great deficiency in the rents—I did not know that I had lost this 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe the policeman took the prisoner at his employer's—Mrs. Harris is not my heiress—she does not come into possession of those houses at my decease unless I choose—I had no dispute with the prisoner; I gave him in charge because the rents were deficient, when I sent to demand the rents the man had paid.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lighterman; on Sunday the 7th of December, about half-past ten in the forenoon, I was near Mr. Watkins's wharf; I saw the prisoner come in a boat and take a sack of grain out of a barge, which lay at Mr. Watkins's wharf. put it into the boat, and rowed up the river with it; I know his person perfectly well, having frequently seen him working on the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you attempt to stop him? - A. No, I had no suspicion at the time, knowing the man; I thought the grain might belong to his employer, and that he might have orders to take it.</p>

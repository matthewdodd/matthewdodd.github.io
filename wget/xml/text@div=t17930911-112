             fifteen pounds on account to pay to him, sometime in the month of April last.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing done by him when you had given him the fifteen pounds? - He brought back to me a receipt signed Howis, by which I supposed he had paid according to which I had given him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the particular directions you gave him at the time you put the fifteen pounds in his hands? - I ordered him to pay so much on account to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever paid money to Howis before? - I told him to pay to Mr. Howis fifteen pounds on account of the thirty, and this was the receipt he brought back.</p>
               <p>The receipt produced and read as follows:</p>
               <p>"Received April 16th, 1793, of the Hon - ble Gen - ll St. John, the sum of fifteen pounds on account for bills deliver'd for Self and Co.</p>
               <p>Howis."</p>
               <p>The first discovery I made of his not having paid the bills, was on the first of July, when I discovered he had not paid some other bills, I then went to Howis to enquire if he had been paid; I found he had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe during this time the man lived with you, you had some particular instances of his honesty? - I always looked upon him as an honest man till this occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether he did not deliver to you a purse of gold that very likely might have been lost?</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot go into that evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know a man of the name of Kennedy that was in the habits of seeing the prisoner? - I never heard of such a man.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any demands on General St. John for the fifteen pounds for which the receipt was given and is the subject of the present prosecution? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You was an oilman, and General St. John was a customer of your's? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Thomson was a butler of his? - He came to my house very often, perhaps once or twice a week during the time the gentleman was in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the receipt, is that your receipt? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive about that time any money at all of Thompson, as from General St. John? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that writing any way like your hand? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Does it resemble the hand writing of any of those persons who are employed in your trade? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner write? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name Kennelly who had been a servant to captain Chinnery? - I know two persons of the name of Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. General St. John whom I had the pleasure to serve at that time, gave me thirty pounds and some other money to pay some bills; fifteen pounds I was to pay Mr. Howis oil man of Germain-street. Fifteen pounds on account of bills delivered to Mr. Barnett of the Haymarket; I believe this was on a Tuesday in April; and I had also to pay some other bills that were then due; there was a person named Kennelly called on me that morning; he was formerly servant to Mr. Chinnery; I had been in Bath different times along with that man, we had been three or four seasons successively together; this man being out of employ at this time, and as I was going out with different tradesmens bills, and as I wanted to go to several places, I asked him to go and pay two or three bills for me; the one was to Mr. Hall, and the other was to Mr. Howis; accordingly I had some business at the bottom of James-street, and an order down in Pallmall; I went from there to Mr. Barratt's, I paid fifteen pounds on account there at the same time I delivered that bill. This man comes to me at the bottom of the Hay-market, at the sign of the Swan; a person was present who see him deliver the bill to me as paid, and likewise he told me that he had paid sixteen shillings for half a dozen packs of cards, I did not suppose but that the sixteen shillings was paid for the cards, neither did I suppose but what that bill was paid, or certainly I should have made very particular enquiry, and got it settled. General St. John generally paid the yearly bills soon after Christmas; had I had the least suspicion that that bill had not been paid it would have been a great obstacle on my mind, very interesting indeed; for I did expect that the General would send for Mr. Barratt, Mr. Howis, and other tradesmen for to pay them. I honestly declare that I thought the bill was paid, neither did I know to the moment the charge was made against me. I must rely on your lordship, and the mercy of the jury. Had I the least probability that the bill had not been paid, I would never have suffered it to have gone so long and not to have paid it, for I really considered the General every day would have settled these bills, but I most assuredly knew nothing that the bill was not paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110178"></xptr>Court to General St. John. When this matter broke out, did the prisoner at the bar set up that excuse that he has now mentioned? - No, he never told me a word of it at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason was, I was so flurried in my mind that I did not think of it till I saw the charge made against me as a commitment.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him an undeniable character.</p>

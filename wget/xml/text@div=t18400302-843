I saw the prisoners on the 19th of February, in the Chalk road which leads from King's Cross to Holloway—they were in conversation—as soon as they saw me, they ran—I pursued them, and saw a parcel under the tail of Hutchinson's coat, and he threw it into a field—I called to a man to stop the prisoners, which he did, and I took them—a man got the parcel, and gave it to me—it contained a pound of green tea—I took them to the station, then went and made inquiries—I found on Griffiths three or four figs in a paper—I went to Mr. May's, and spoke to the shopman—this is the parcel which had been under the tail of Hutchinson's coat—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—Hutchinson told me be took it from a boy who was asleep by a wall in a field, and Griffiths said, "If you like, you can come with me, I dare say you will find him there now."</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. George May, a grocer, at King's Cross, which is about fifty yards from the Chalk road. On the 19th of February I saw the two prisoners at the shop, between ten and eleven o'clock—Griffiths paid me for a pennyworth of figs—as soon as they were gone, I missed a pound of green tea, which had been on the counter done up with several other parcels—the prisoners were close to them—I had not put a mark of the price outside the parcel, but I can tell this is it by the tea, and by the manner in which the parcel is done up—I did it up myself—the tea is worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Griffiths came a little way from Hutchinson when he paid for the figs, but before that they were standing close toge<lb></lb>ther—they were nearest to the tea when they were standing together—MR. May has no partner.</p>
               <p>(George Ringland, a type-founder; and Jane Bantly, of White Horse-court, gave Hutchinson a good character. Elizabeth Woolmer gave Grif<lb></lb>fiths a good character.)</p>

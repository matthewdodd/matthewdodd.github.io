                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bryan. On Monday evening, the 15th of January, I was in Tottenham-court-road—I taw both the prisoners together at Mr. Ward's shop—Pooley snatched a pair of boots down off the railing, and gave them to Smith, who put them into his pocket—they walked some distance, and looked at me very hard, as I was watching them——I lost sight of them for some time, but I saw them again, and pointed them out—I am quite sure they are the same men—I can swear to them—I gave information—I saw the boots again in an area, but I did not get up in time to see them put into the area—I saw the prisoners in some square about three-quarters of a mile from Mr. Ward's—the area in which the boots were, was in the way from the shop to that square.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Pooley.</hi> I was taken up ten days afterwards, and was very tipsy; I laid on the floor, and the policeman brought you in; you said you believed I was the man, you could not swear to me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was not tipsy—I had never seen him before that night, but he looked at me so had that I knew him—I was watching him and he me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Benjamin Ward, boot and shoe<lb></lb>maker, in Tottenham-court-road. On the evening of the 15th of Jan, Bryan gave me notice about a pair of boots—I went and missed a pair from the railing outside the shop—I followed in the way Bryan directed, and she pointed out two men—I went after them with the policeman, and Smith, who was one of them, was taken—I saw him throw the boots over the railing of an area at the corner of Bedford-square—I ran with another policeman after the other man, but he got away—I cannot swear that Pooley was the other man—I can swear to Smith—he threw away these boots—they are my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse patrol. Early in the morning of the 10th of August I was sent for to Mr. Heam's rick yard, and the prisoner was given into my charge—I searched him, but found nothing but a few halfpence—I told him I took him for robbing Dawson of his money—he said he knew nothing about where it was, but afterwards he said another person had taken it—I afterwards took him before the Magistrate—we then went to Edgware, he asked me if it would be any worse for him if he told where the money was—I told him I did not know—he said nothing more then—when we got to the Crane, where the Magistrates sat, before we went before them, he said he wanted to speak to Mr. Hean's bailiff, Bolus, who came up—he called me to him and said in the prisoner's presence that he had said he would tell him where the money was—I said I must go and see where it is—the prisoner then took us to a little slip of ground three or four hundred yards off, belonging to John Perfect—he walked close alongside a post by a ditch—I saw the ground had been moved, and he said it was there—I searched, and found forty-five sovereigns, sixteen half-sovereigns, and one shilling in a purse—he told me as we went along, that another man had stolen it who wars stranger, and he had shown him where he hid it—Shepherd is not in Mr. Hearn's service now—he has been discharged, as his work was finished.</p>

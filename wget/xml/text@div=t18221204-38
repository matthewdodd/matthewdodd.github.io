            . I am a constable. On the 28th of October, between five and six o'clock, when I came near Duke-street, Houndsditch, I observed three persons behind a female, going towards Houndsditch - I followed them, and when she came to the corner of Houndsditch, I observed a bustle - I did not see them take anything: but she turned round, and looked rather confused, I asked if she had lost anything - she said</p>
               <p>"Yes, a parcel." Bitton was then going towards Aldgate-church, and Clark crossed to the opposite side - I could not see the other. I looked for half a minute, then crossed over, and laid hold of Clark, opened his coat, put my hand between his legs, and took the parcel from there - it contained the articles stated in the indictment. Bitton was at that time crossing towards Clark - I said to somebody who was near,</p>
               <p>"Lay hold of him;" he immediately ran down the Minories a short space, then turned back and walked; somebody laid hold of him, and delivered him to me - he said he knew nothing of it. When I took Clark, he said,</p>
               <p>"I picked this parcel up at the corner of the posts." Several persons besides them were round Miss Walford, as there was a stoppage with a coach. I did not see either of them stoop; they might without my seeing them. My eye was fixed on them. I cannot say whether the pavement was clean or dirty. I think it was a dry night.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>BITTON'S Defence. I was returning from Gracechurch-street, and as I crossed a gentleman laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>CLARK's Defence. I was coming home, and by the corner of Houndsditch, I kicked this parcel with my feet, took it up, and held it in my hand ten minutes to see if anybody owned it.</p>

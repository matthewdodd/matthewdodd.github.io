               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you have known the prisoner some years? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q.And, in consequence of the good character he has maintained, you took him to be an honest man? - A. He has certainly bore a very good character; he has been an unfortunate, but I believe an honest man.</p>
               <p>- ABBOTT sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Seal: I did not see the tobacco taken from the prisoner; Mr. Seal gave it to me. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you had it ever since in your possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was left at the office was it not? - A. Yes, and I went for it; it was sealed up, and I know it to be the same.</p>

               <p>Seal. The tobacco delivered to Abbott, I am sure, was my property.</p>
               <p>Abbott. This is the tobacco I received from Mr. Seal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was tobacco that I had saved up from what was given me of an evening, to make a present of.</p>
               <p>Seal. The tobacco we give them is perfectly finished, and cold; the tobacco I took from him was warm, and the same description of tobacco he had been at work upon; and there is a particular smell that betrays it at once, whether it is just took off the stove or not.</p>
               <p>Q. A man being at work near the stove, with tobacco in his waistcoat-pocket, it might produce nearly the same smell, I should think? - A. It might in some degree.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who had known him from twenty to thirty years, and who gave him an excellent character.</p>

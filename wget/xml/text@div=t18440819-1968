                  </hi>. I am a publican, living at Yarmouth. I have been married eight years—the prisoner is a painter—up to about Midsummer last he lodged with me—he had given me no notice of leaving—on the 24th of June I was at a fair in the country—I returned about six or seven o'clock, and he and my wife were both missing—I missed a dozen small silver spoons and two large ones, a silk pocket-handkerchief, four gold rings, two brooches, and a steel seal, and a box with my wife's clothes—I accompanied my brother to town next day—I was directed to a public-house in the Old Bailey, and in a bed-room there I found the prisoner and my wife together—I gave him a good dressing—I saw my brother find this silk handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket—it is mine—there is no mark on it—I generally wear such a one—I saw the purse found in the prisoner's pocket—it contained a sovereign and a half, four gold rings, two brooches, a seal, and a small locket—I used the seal myself, and so did my wife sometimes—these are all mine.</p>

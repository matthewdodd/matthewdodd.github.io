I had been into the barber's shop at the corner of Stonecutter-street, and on my coming out to go home, I said I wished I knew my own door. Creswell, the prisoner, came up, he would shew me Rose and Crown court, Shoe-lane, where I lived. I told him I would thank him if he would. He laid hold of my arm, and took me to Eagle and Child court, Shoe-lane. He there thrust his right hand into my left waistcoat pocket. I made a grasp at him, and some of the money fell to the ground, He ran away. I followed him immediately. He ran down Shoe-lane as far as the Red Lion. I called the watchman, and we then took him to the watch-house. At the watch-house he was searched; no money was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober - A. I had been drinking a little.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were not you so intoxicated that the patrols would not take the charge - A. They would not take the charge, you offered me money to make it up, and I believe I should have taken it, because they said they would take me to the Compter until Martin and Lee came in; they knew where I worked, they took the charge.</p>
               <p>MARTIN ROBINSON. I am a watchman of St. Andrew's. I heard the call out of stop thief. I saw the prisoner run by quite fast, and the Prosecutor after him; the Prosecutor laid hold of him. I came up and took him to the watch-house. He went to the watch-house quietly.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Andrew's. I saw the prisoner searched in the watch-house; nothing was found on him but a few halfpence. I went to where the prosecutor said he heard the money drop, but nothing was found. The night constable threatened to send the Prosecutor to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Shoe-lane. The Prosecutor got hold of my collar, he called out watch. I never saw him till he got hold of my collar, nor was I up so far as Stonecutter-street at the time.</p>

I am a cabinet maker, of 20, Gloucester Street, Hackney—last Saturday night, about 12. 6, I was in Hackney Road, theprisoner came up on my left side and threw me violently towards the road—I asked him what he did that for, he said that he would very soonshow me, and put himself in a fighting attitude—he struck me, and Idefended myself as well as I could—we fought for some time—he closedwith me and threw me on my back on the pavement—I got up, and wehad another encounter—he again threw me on my back, and put his kneeson my chest—I thought I was almost killed—I felt him tearing my watchand chain from my pocket—I held him against a wall and shouted "Police!"—a policeman came and took him in custody—this piece of mychain and my locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were picked up and given to me.</p>

I am a musician, of Cambridge Heath Road—I was in the Hackney Road, and saw the prisoner push Mr. Castro, who asked what he was doing—they pushed one another—the prisonerused foul language, and hit Mr. Castro on his face—they fell, andgot up and had another round, and he went down again, and I saw theprisoner's hand on his watch-pocket—I said to, a friend "If he don't takecare he will lose his watch," and when he got up he had lost it—he laidhold of the prisoner, and I said "You have got the right one"—after apoliceman came, the prisoner turned to a man, who I believe was his mate, and said "Will you come up as a witness for me?"but he walked away, and said "I saw nothing of the affair."</p>

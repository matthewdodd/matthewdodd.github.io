House of Correction, Holloway—I knew him before—he has often threatened, if I did not leave Bryan alone, he would do me an injury—he tried to put a knife into me that night; he was drunk—I was called a fool for not hitting him—I said I would wait till I saw him sober, but I never saw him from that day to this.</p>

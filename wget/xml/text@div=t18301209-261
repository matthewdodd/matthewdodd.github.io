            . I am waiter at the public-house. - The prosecutrix came there very tipsy, and asked for a quartern of gin; my master would not serve her - she sat down, and was going to sleep; my master told me to take her out- I set her against the shutters, and she fell down - the prisoner and her sister came and said I might take her to their house, and she should remain till she recovered; I took her to a lodging, but I do not know whose it was; she then lost her things, and came to my master's house- I took the other woman, whose name was Richardson.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WILKINS. I am a Policeman. About half-past seven o'clock on the Sunday morning, I was on duty, and the prosecutrix said she had been robbed - I asked her of what, and she told me; the prisoner was present, and said she knew nothing of the prosecutrix; she said she lived no where, and had no key, but I knew where she lived, and the waiter said that was the room he took them to - this is the cap, handkerchief, and part of the property which I found there; I took the other woman, but nothing was found on her- when we went to the watch-house, she gave her sister the key.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the woman before - the waiter took her home on his back.</p>

On the 12th of November, about three in the afternoon the prisoner and another woman came into the shop and enquired for some Scotch cambric; I was waiting upon two ladies, some Irish linens laid upon the counter, the ladies then that I was waiting on told me to cut some callico off for them. I turned my back to reach a yard that lay on the ground, and when I got up I saw a piece of something white under the prisoners mantle, the other woman and she talked together, I had suspicion of them. The shop being much crowded with customers they were making out. I jumped over the counter and laid hold of the prisoner and secured her, she resisted very much, the other woman made her escape. I took her into the parlour, locked the door, and went to Marlborough Street and brought an officer, she was then searched, before I went for the officer I took the Irish linen from her, it was the same that I saw under her cloak. I locked it up in the parlour with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any other shopmen in the shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040018"></xptr>about seeing him hanging by the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined two or three days after by the coroner, your fright was quite subsided. - A. I told him the same that I did before, and I don't know when I did it, I had been up night and day with a lady, my head was very bad at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What aged man did be appear to you to be. - A. I thought he was near forty, I do not know what age he was, he was pretty hearty all but his knee, he had been in the hospital a month, he could eat and drink hearty, there was something the matter with his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs and found him hanging, did you see near him any chair - A. There was a chair standing sideways to the bed, it was standing in the place it usually stood, I had before seen it there, the chair was close by the body, the arm-chair stood almost at the bottom of the bed,</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a cord as that. - A. Yes, it was a smallish cord.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. Mrs. Andrews, I understood you to say that you went into the yard for about ten minutes. - A. Yes, leaving the prisoner packing up the trunk, putting her clothes together, I left her in the parlour, and I found her in the parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. And when you came back she was engaged in packing up the things. - A. Yes, and looking in her drawers, and putting her clothes together what she was going to take away.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the object she had in view when you went out in the yard she was carrying on when you returned. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did return you heard the noise like the scraping of a chair. - A. Yes, a few minutes after I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at the time that you returned and you heard the scraping. - A. She had gone out to Mrs. Orpwood's door, she stood at Mrs. Orpwood's door, I ran to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards, when you went up stairs into the room, the chair was in the situation of having been removed from the place in which it had been, and it was at the foot of the bed. - A. The chair was very near to the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a person had been disposed to hang himself, could you conceive a chair to be put more convenient for such a purpose. - A. I do not know, it always stood there.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be used for that purpose. - A. I do not know but it might.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he was a hearty man, and that he had a weakness in his knee. - A. He appeared to be a hearty man, he had very good use of his hands, and too much of his tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that from the weak state of his body, that any body could have hang'd him. - A. He was very strong and very spitefull, I do not think that any body could have hang'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that a man would suffer himself to be hanged up by a woman, or any body else without using his hands. - A. You will know that by the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no marks of violence found upon her. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the means of doing it, he was strong and hearty enough, if he was so disposed, to have done it. - A. Yes, he had used violence upon her, but I believe not that day.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe after that you saw the child Rebecca. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing between you and Rebecca, did you go to the house of Mrs. Brown - A. I went to enquire, and Mrs. Andrews answered me, Mrs. Brown was sitting in the parlour with the parlour door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she hear what passed between you and Andrews. - A. Yes, I think she could, I asked what was the matter, Mrs. Andrews said Mr. Brown had died in a fit, Mr. Bennet had been sent for, and he said he was no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of Mrs. Brown while she was sitting in the parlour. - A. She was full of grief, she asked me if I would assist Mrs. Andrews, and lay him out, I said I would come bye and bye.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Andrews said that Mr. Brown had died in a fit, did Mrs. Brown say any thing to that. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went again in the course of the afternoon to lay him out. - A. Yes, about a quarter before six, when I went the second time they were at tea in the parlour; Mrs. Andrews took a bason of water, soap, and towel, she went up stairs first, Mr. Brown was laying upon the bed as if he was asleep, he was dressed, I observed a small black mark on the front of his neck; I saw the prisoner the next morning, she seemed full of grief.</p>

The first time I went it was five o'clock in the afternoon, Rebecca, the daughter of the deceased, came to me crying, I went to the house, I was shewn the deceased by Mrs. Andrews; Mrs. Brown followed me up stairs; Mrs. Andrews told me that he had been in a fit, this was in the hearing of the prisoner, he was lying on the bed on the right side, I immediately unbuttoned his waistcoat and felt his body, which was rather warm, but his extremities were cold, I said he was quite dead, Mrs. Brown immediately was struck with surprise and grief, and very much alarmed; Mrs. Brown said at first that she hoped he was not dead, I told her that he was quite dead, she said to Mrs. Andrews, you know what there is, let the furniture go, do the best you can for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Andrews said he died in a fit, did Mrs. Brown say any thing. - A. No, she neither confirmed it, or contradicted it.</p>

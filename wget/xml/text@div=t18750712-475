                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman D</hi> 379). On 22nd June, about 5.50, I was on duty at Thames Bank near the distillery in Grosvenor Road—I observed the prisoner loitering about for full half an hour—she had a child in her arms—she came and placed herself near the steps leading down to the river—I asked her if she was going to drown herself—she said "I am," and she ran by me and threw herself into the water with the child in her arms—the witness Black who stood close by me immediately jumped into the water and with great difficulty succeeded in saving both the mother and child; there was a strong current at the time—the child was quite exhausted when it was taken out; it was in the water two or three minutes—it was taken to, the workhouse and is there now—it is about twelve months old—I found on the prisoner a letter for the Belgrave hospital—she said that she was going to try to get the child in on the following Thursday—the child is a female; it is a very sickly child, very sore round the nose and eyes, suffering from some disease—it had a starved look—the prisoner told the Magistrate that she had tried to get the child in the hospital but was too late—she said she was determined to destroy the life</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabdriver and live at 18, Johnson's Place—I was passing Thames Bank on this evening and saw the prisoner jump into the water with the child in her arms—I immediately jumped in with all my clothes on and swam out and brought the woman in with the child, with the assistance of a man in a boat—the child was in a very exhausted state; the prisoner held it very tight in her arms, I had very great difficulty in getting it out of her arms in the water—it was about twenty or thirty feet deep there—I did not ask her any questions, I was too eager to get home to change my clothes—the tide was running, very strong, at the rate of five miles an hour—I don't think there is another man in London who could have done it with all his clothes on, I had to swim a considerable distance, but thank God I am a pretty good swimmer.

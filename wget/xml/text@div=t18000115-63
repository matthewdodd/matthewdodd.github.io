No; on the Sunday morning I saw him take a pair of scissars into the back part of the warehouse, about nine o'clock; he returned in a few minutes with something in a blue paper, he brought it into the front warehouse; he then went behind the counter, where I could not see him; and in the space of a few minutes he came from behind that counter, where I could see him; he had the same blue paper as before, likewise a piece of lawn in his hand; Mr. Smith was looking at the same time, and I went with Mr. Smith, and he charged him with it; he said he had nothing more than he ought to have; he then pulled out a small piece of waste paper, and said he had a bit of lawn, that he had bought in Newgate-street, to make his baby some shirts; a person was sent for to take him into custody.</p>

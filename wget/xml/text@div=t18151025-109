            . I am Post mistress, at Skipton. The Post Office through which the letters go before they come, some is kept by John Hart, who is a quaker. I received the bag from his Office on the 12th of July. (A paper put into the hands of the witness.) That is a bill of all letters sent to and received from Darnley, on the 12th of July. There is an item here which shews me that there was apart paid double letters from Gargrave to London; there is the sum of one shilling and ten-pence opposite it, which is put there as the sum paid, and which is the amount of the double postage of a letter from Gargrave to London. Part of this bill is made by me; that is the part relative to letters sent by me to Gargrave; the other part is made by Hart, and is the account of letters sent from Gargrave to me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Submitted that the man who wrote this himself, ought to be called.</p>

I afterwards made up the bag from Skipton to London, and made up the list of the letters. (List put into the hands of the witness.)

               <p>Q. It does not express how many double letters there were? could it not have been a double letter to some place from Gargrave, but not to London, the postage of which would be elevenpence - A. No; two double letters would be more.</p>

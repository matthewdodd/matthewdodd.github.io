                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Palmer, at Barking. I was walking round the fields, about seven o'clock in the evening, on the 10th of Feb.—I heard a noise in the top of the building called the Castle, as if some persons were taking tiles off the roof—I got assistance, and as soon as we got back to the fence, we saw a man coming out of the Castle door with a lump of lead—I had a dog with me—the man ran away—I met the two pri<lb></lb>soners coming out of the Castle—I had a gun in my hand—they rushed back, and I closed the door upon them—I got the police, and we secured them on the spot—the lead had been taken off the roof of the Castle—a man was coming out with part of the lead, and the rest was left on the roof—the build<lb></lb>ing belongs to the Earl of Mornington.</p>

I went with Whisker to the Castle—it it in the pa<lb></lb>rish of Barking, in Essex—a man came out of the door with a piece of lead on his shoulder, he dropped it, and ran away—we then went to the door, and saw the two prisoners in the act of coming out—I assisted in closing the door till the policeman came, and they were taken into custody—I went on the roof, and found a sack with some lead in it, and a piece of lead lying by—it had been ripped from the roof of the building.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I went to Cranbrook Castle, as it is called, on the 10th of Feb.—I found Whisker and Lockwood there—I found the Castle door fastened inside—the prisoners called from inside, and told me to open the door—I said I could not—they opened it, and as soon as I recognized them, Hunter said, "We had better do this than starve"—they said they would give themselves up—I left them in charge of another officer, and I went up stairs—I saw a quantity of lead in a sack, and some on the stairs—142lbs. weight of lead had been se<lb></lb>vered—I compared it with the gutters and the roof—it appeared to fit—I made such observation on it as to say it had been severed from that roof, and it corresponded in width and length—I found this knife on Hunter—he is a sweep, and Austin is a farming labourer—this knife appears to have been used against lead—this castle has been used as a dwelling-house, but it is empty now.</p>

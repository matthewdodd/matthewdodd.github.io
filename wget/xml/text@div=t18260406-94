               <p>JOHN HOWARD. I live in St. Martin's-court. The prisoner was in my service for about a fortnight - I sent him on the 10th of March to take home this pair of shoes, which a gentleman had bought in the shop - he came back and said he had delivered them.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bridges-street, Covent-Garden. The prisoner brought these shoes to me on the 10th of March - he said he brought them from his father, and he lived at a fishmonger's shop in St. Martin-lane - I went with him to the house - he told me to wait, and he went up stairs - I waited some time, when he came down without his hat, and said "You cannot see my father, he is in bed" - I said "Let me see your mother" - he said she was out - I then went into the house and asked a woman if he lived there; she said No - he said he did - we went up stairs, and he knocked at a door, when some respectable people came out, and said they did not know him - we found his hat thrown on the stairs - I then took him back - met the officer and gave charge of him - his mother called the next evening at our shop - she is a widow and appeared very respectable - she has six children, and he is the eldest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went home to my dinner and found my mother and the children starving. I went to pawn these shoes to get some food, and intended to have redeemed them on Saturday evening, when I got my money.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 13.</p>

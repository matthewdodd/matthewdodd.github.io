               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. Have you the book here? A. Yes, this is it - many persons write in this book; here is no credit entered to these customers by the prisoner, which he should have done - this other book is the cash book, which I keep; if he had brought these sums to me I should have entered them here; if I had omitted to enter them the cash would not have been right- it is the rule of our house to make up the accounts every night - it has happened that some items have been entered the next day; I think they have not been left for three or four days - I pay every body, the workmen and collector bring the money to me - our business is not conducted in a very irregular manner; I do not know that I ever said it was - I might, on some occasion have said so; some of our workmen have staid out all night, and they have been spoken to about it, and Mr. Graham has been told of it - it has happened that one salesman has given his money to another, to enter it for him, but that was for ready-money transactions in the shop - I will not undertake to say the prisoner did not give these sums to another person, but it is not likely - we never give credit to the men - it the prisoner had come home very late at night, and had not paid me till the next morning, I should not have considered him a debtor for it - I should not have known what he had received till he told me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it his business to give the money to you the night he received it? A. Yes, and I enter it in the cash book, and it is not here - I have never had it; he did not pay it on the 20th of July.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

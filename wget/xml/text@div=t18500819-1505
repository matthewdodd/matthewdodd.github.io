I went to bed from half-past ten to eleven o'clock—I am sure they were not in the house at that time—they did not sleep at home that night—between eight and nine in the morning, I heard footsteps come from the kitchen door, and go out at the front door—when the officer Kemp came, I showed him the prisoners' room—I know they were not at home the night before, because Wheeler's mother called to see him, and tried their door, and it was locked and no one answered.</p>

He said, Yes; and when I came back he was gone on; thinking I should overtake him, I went on, but did not, and I went direct home and to bed, and next morning the policeman came to ask for Wheeler.

I said I knew nothing about them; Wilmot confessed that he took the things to the lodging unknown to me, while I was out—the key was left over the door for Wheeler if he came home, and that was how he had access to the room; he was not a stranger to either of us; he had been in our company before, and had been to the concert that night.</p>

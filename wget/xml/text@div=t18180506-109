On the 15th of April the prisoner lodged with me - I live in a cellar. I put my watch in a box at seven o'clock in the evening, it was not locked - I missed it next morning between eight and nine o'clock-the prisoner slept in the cellar that night; he sat by the fire when the watch was put into the box. He went out before eight o'clock the next morning - I did not suspect him. There are four other lodgers in the same room. I found it at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I am a gardener. I was going to Chelsea, met the prisoner, and asked him where he was going? he said he had got drunk on Saturday, spent all his money, and was going to pledge his watch - I told him he had not got one; he pulled it out of his pocket, and shewed it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had taken them both home drunk the night before. I asked her to lend me 5s.; she said she had not got it. I asked her to lend me the watch to pledge - She said I knew where it was. I took it out, and told her I was going to pledge it.</p>

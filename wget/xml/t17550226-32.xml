               <p>Q. When had you seen it before?</p>
               <p>Higginson. Not since the Thursday before the prisoner was taken up, on the confession of Evans; I was sent before the justice, there they both were, the prisoner would not own any thing of the matter; the people that bought the saddle advertised it. I went there, the man's name is Lewis, he lives in Castle-street by the Seven-dials, he shewed me the saddle, but said, unless I would pay for advertising, and two shillings which he gave for it, he would not let me have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here?</p>
               <p>Higginson. No, I have not subpaened him. I know nothing of the prisoner; the boy confessed he sold the saddle to that man.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar and I were drinking together at the Fox-and-goose, Drury-lane, the same night the other robbery was committed on the 25th of January; he said all his money was gone, and asked me to go out with him to get some money.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Evans. A little after six o'clock we went to pick up what we could, and went to Mr. Higginson's in Bear-yard, Clare-market, the door was fastened with a nail in a hasp, we undid it, and the saddle was hanging up. Booth took it, and said he knew a man near the Seven-dials, named Morgan, that bought stolen things, we went both there; the prisoner went in, and I heard him ask Morgan's wife whether they would buy the saddle? I staid at the door, she said her husband was ill, and desired him to leave it; then he desired her to lend him 2 s. upon it till the Monday, which she did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Evans. This was before seven o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stepney-green. My father is pos<lb></lb>sessed of some houses in Lincoln-court, Drury-lane—I collect the rents for him—about a week before Christmas the prisoner applied to me to take a room—I agreed to let it him if he would give me a deposit, which he de<lb></lb>clined, and I locked the room again, and said he should not have it—about a fortnight afterwards I went to the house again, and found him in posses<lb></lb>sion of a room on the other side of the court—I asked How he came there—he said he did not know—I said I would not let it him without I de<lb></lb>posit—he said, "I considered my goods would be a sufficient deposit"—I said, "That will not do; I did not let it to you, and here you shall not remain," and I would fetch a policeman, but as he said his wife was lately confined, I thought I would let it be for a week or two—I did not molest him—he remained there, and never paid me any rent—on my going there on the 27th of March, I asked if he intended to remove, or to hold posses<lb></lb>sion in defiance of me—he said he would go when it suited him—I said "Will it suit you in a week, fortnight, a month, or two months?"—he re<lb></lb>peated, that he would go when it suited him—I then told him he should go before, for depend upon it he should not remain there—I had not made any motion to remove him—he rose up and seized me by the breast of my waistcoat with both hands, which he tore, forced me over a chair, threw me on the ground, and endeavoured to beat me, but I defended myself, so that he could not do me any material injury—he struck at me, but I de<lb></lb>fended myself as I lay on my back, and he did not hurt me seriously—I</p>

               <p>could not get up—he held me down, and was over me—he then called to his wife for the poker, and, as she did not give it him, he extricated himself from me, and reached it before I could rise—when I raised my head about two feet from the floor, he struck me in the front of my head with the poker—it had a stunning effect, and having called for help, I saw a young man who was looking at the room—this confused the prisoner, and I was able to escape out of the room—a great quantity of blood came from my head—a policeman came, went up stairs, broke open the door, and took him—he had not got into the room with my father's consent or mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take any means by using your hands to remove him before you were struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Mr. Smitch, a surgeon, attended me, and dressed my wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you come into my room and knock me off my seat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I showed him some rooms on the opposite side—I never showed him the room in question, nor saw him in it till I found him there—I might have sent him up to look at it, but I distinctly declined setting him a room without a deposit—I asked him if he would go in a week, a fortnight, a month, or two months; and if he had promised to leave then, I should have communicated with my father, and asked his advice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The first week he came I owed him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he wanted to throw my wife and infant into the street, and brought a policeman up to have me turned out. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did so after having seen him there, but the policeman refused to act—I did not intend to turn him out, but to take the wife into custody to answer for being there—the policeman refused—I went to the station-house, and they refused assistance—I went to a Magis<lb></lb>trate, and he said he was very sorry, but he had no power to interfere—I did not go near the prisoner for two or three months after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He told me to look at the room, and take it if I gave him a deposit, and said he would give me a lock and key as soon as I had got my things in it. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I never did—I did not apply for any rent when I found him there with his wife confined in it—he has said he would pay me, but I always said, "I will not have your rent, you came without my leave, and I will have you out"—he never produced any money—the rooms are generally locked, but at times a lock it broken, and he might have found it open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you sent him up to look at it and it was locked, How could he get there?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I did I must have given him the key, but I do not recollect sending him at all to look at it—I am quite sure I refused him as a tenant, on his not agreeing to make a deposit.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lincoln-court. The prisoner was living on the third floor back-room—I was living underneath on the second floor—on the 27th of March I heard a scuffle up above stairs—I ran up, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor scuffling together on the floor—the prose<lb></lb>cutor was undermost—the prisoner forced himself away from the prosecu<lb></lb>tor, went on the other side of the room, brought something in his hand, and struck the prosecutor a violent blow on the head—the blood gushed out directly—I went down stairs to give an alarm, and the prisoner seeing me on the stairs, the prosecutor had time to get up and run down stairs—he sent for a policeman, who came and took the prisoner—I saw him strike the blow, but what it was with I cannot say—it had the appearance of something dark—I ran down stairs, and the prosecutor got up and ran out.</p>

I did not know it was fit I should go till the gentleman came next day and asked me to go—I said I would, but did not wish to go without being asked—I was never in the House of Correction—sometimes I am out till eleven and sometimes till twelve o'clock—I was never taken up for picking pockets—my wife sells matches at times—I was never take up on suspicion of stealing anything—I did not tell your wife that I never saw or heard any thing of this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called in on the 27th of March to take the prisoner—the door was fast—I requested him to open it—he said he would not—I said I was an officer—he said, "I don't came who you are, I will not open the door for you nor anybody"—I broke it open, and took him into custody—I found this poker in the room—it is an iron bolt—the prosecutor's face was covered with blood, which was falling from his face—I observed a wound in his head—I took the prisoner in about twenty minutes afterwards, before the Magistrate—there was no time to look for any witnesses—the prosecutor appeared seriously injured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon to the police-force. I was called on to attend Noble, on the 27th of March—I found him with a deep lacerated wound in the scalp, about two inches in length, and it penetrated to the bone—it was on the forehead—considerable force must have been used to inflict such a wound—an instrument of this kind is very likely to have occasioned such a wound—the skin was broken—I did not consider that any danger was likely to arise—the bone underneath was not injured—that part of the head is exceedingly thick—a blow on the top of the head would be attended with much more serious consequence—I should think it was a single blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>.

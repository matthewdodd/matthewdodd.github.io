I afterwards went to his lodgings in Drury-lane with an officer; the woman he lived with was there. I found various tools which I had not missed, including the articles stated in the indictment; they hung in his room by the side of his work bench; we took him up in about half an hour afterwards. I accused him of it, and he said if I would forgive him he would tell me all he had done. I said I should not make any promises - he did not then tell me any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me these braces out to make? A. I gave him a quantity to make about twelve months ago, and about six months ago he brought in all he had as he said - he used to send the boy with them, and I accused the boy with being two dozen of braces short, and the prisoner said he had given them to my boy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you allow him to have work at home? A. Yes, but I knew these 17 pairs of braces were not taken in the course of that employ, because he had taken them all in - about one dozen pair of them were unfinished, and these five pair were some he had no hand in making.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These five pair had been put in promiscuously with work I had to take to my mother. Witness. No, he could not, his business was to tie these up. I packed them up, and he must have taken them from a basket in my warehouse. He had nothing to do with them at all, nor with these 300 brace bits - we give the bits and braces together - it is impossible we could have given them to him. He has had nothing to do with them during the last six months - he has been a porter in the house.</p>

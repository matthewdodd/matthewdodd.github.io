             I got very much in liquor. I sat on the bench, and whether I pull'd out my watch to see what o'clock it was I can't tell. I had it when I sat there, I lost it, and she sat by me on the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suspect she stole it ?</p>
               <p>Roe. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Roe. Yes, Mr. Howard awak'd me, and asked me if I had lost my watch; I missed it, and said I had lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get it again?</p>
               <p>Roe. No, my Lord, he said he saw the prisoner take it from me, he charged the prisoner, and sent for a constable, she fell a crying.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own the taking it?</p>
               <p>Roe. I can't say whether she did or not. I was much in liquor. She was carried before the justice,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110012"></xptr> she was charged there with taking it, but I can't recollect what passed, or what she said. I have been in her company before, and I do not suspect she took it from me.</p>

            . I am a Marshall Court officer, I found a watch in the woman's custody. I saw her have a watch in her hand, which I thought not to be her property being the man in liquor. I awaked him, and asked him he had lost any thing; he said, no; he searched, and said, I had a watch, and have lost it, and I shew'd it him; he said, he gave her leave to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you give her leave to take it ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe I did for security.</p>

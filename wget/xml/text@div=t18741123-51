I keep the Star in the East public-honse, at East Greenwich—on Wednesday, 11th November, the prisoner was employed as a painter at my house—I noticed my bagatelle balls safe in the billiard room on that morning—after the prisoner had gone to his dinner I missed them—next morning, when he came to work, I accused him of having taken them, and told him to bring them back and I would not say any more about it—he said he did not know anything about them—I gave information to the police, a detective came, and I went to the station with him, where I saw the balls and identified them—I can speak to four of them by the spots on them—they are worth about 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>

I am assistant to Mr. Phillips, pawnbroker, 62, High Street, Deptford—about 3.30 on the afternoon of Thursday, 12th November, the prisoner came to my shop with these nine bagatelle balls to pledge—I asked him to whom they belonged, and he said they were his—from what my foreman said to me, I went with the prisoner on the way to the station—he went into a public-house to get some beer, and escaped, leaving the balls in my possession—I went to the station, and gave a description of him to the police.</p>

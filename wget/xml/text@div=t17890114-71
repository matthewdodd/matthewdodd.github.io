I missed the things; I sent my wife up into the room, and she found the things in the indictment were gone. I went up to him the next day, and I met him on the stairs, and he told me he had taken them to the pawnbroker's, and I might be d - d, and get them again myself. I did not take him up till three months afterwards; for he promised me to bring them back; he did not; but he fell back in paying of the rent and I took him up; after that, before I took him up, when I went up stairs to him for the house-rent, he told me that he would bring the things back next week; he did not, and I took him up; he told me the things were at

After the prisoner was in prison, I went to the pawnbroker's, and the boy said they were there; and the master told me if I would bring the duplicates I might have the things: I could not get them from the prisoner. There was a bolster, blanket, rug, sheets, a frying-pan, gridiron, and a pair of bellows, and a flat iron. The prisoner would not let me come into the room, before I took him up, while he was in the room. I went to Mr. Wilmot's office about this, and charged him with robbing the room, and he sent him to Bridewell; and he was to forfeit twelve shillings for so doing.</p>

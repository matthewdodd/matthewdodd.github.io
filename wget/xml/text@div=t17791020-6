I accused the prisoner with stealing it; he denied it; I told him if he did not confess, I would go to Sir

I asked them whether they or I should find a captain for him to serve; they agreed I should take pains to get a captain for him. They were not willing to send him after that, and they sent a lawyer to me.</p>
               <p>What reason have you besides his confession to fix this upon the prisoner? - Finding the purse under his bed, and the room door being always locked.</p>
               <p>What did you loose? - A half crown piece, three shillings, a silver groat, a silver three pence, a silver two-pence, and a silver penny; it was hoarded money.</p>

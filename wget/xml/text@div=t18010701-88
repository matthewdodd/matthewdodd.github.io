               <p>Q. Had you any demand upon Mr. Cock? - A. Yes; the whole bill was 2l. 17s. 11d. for wheelwright's work; here is a bill and receipt in his own hand-writing - "Settled,

               <p>Court. That you may put in your pocket, for it is a fraud upon the revenue, I shall not hear any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were not brought up to the business of a wheelwright? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the business was conducted by the prisoner? - A. He was my foreman; I succeeded Mr. Webb in the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long the prisoner was in the service of Mr. Webb? - A. Ten years and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010079"></xptr>Q.And when did you come into the business? - A. In 1792, with my late partner, Mr. Roake.</p>
               <p>Q.During all which time he has been employed in your service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were so well satisfied with him that you held out to him expectations of a partnership? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard before you took him up of his intention of going into business apart from you? - A. No; I heard of it after I discharged him; I did not know a word of it till after I took him before the Alderman; I did not commence the prosecution till I came here; I heard he had been round to some of my customers to solicit their favours.</p>

               <p>Q. You had heard that he intended to commence business on his own account, and had been soliciting custom? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up? - A. I think it is three weeks ago yesterday; it may be a month ago yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you turned him away on the 16th of May; upon your oath, did he not come to you on the 27th of May or thereabouts to desire to settle accounts with you? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor at any time before you took him up? - A. He came to Mrs. Bayley, he was very drunk then, and told her, he was come to square the yards with his master.</p>
               <p>Q. That was intending to settle accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand from your wife that he came to your house for the purpose of settling accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was some days before you took him up? - Yes; I did not then know that he had taken any money on my account.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not in the habit of settling accounts from time to time? - A. On a Saturday I used to give him a list of a few bills for him to collect, and when he brought me the money I scratched it out in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid him his wages at that time? - A. Yes; and he owes me 9l. 2s. 9d. now; he was always in my debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever met to balance the account? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore it still remains open? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you make it appear that he is indebted to you upon the account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hand-writing is that account? - A. It is all my own hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Q. Has he acknowledged that account by signing it or any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not call upon you after you had discharged him to settle accounts with you? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call upon you? - A. Yes; but he was so drunk I could not understand him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A.He was in such a state of intoxication I could not tell what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after he had called upon your wife to settle the account? - A.Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know where he was gone to live after he had left you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear that it was in Stamford-street, Blackfriars-road? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Tilley your foreman tell you that he had taken a piece of ground for the purpose of carrying on the business? - A. Yes, he told me he had taken a piece of ground, but I did not know where.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you discharged him? A. After I discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him up or after? - A.Before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me just now that you did not know of his going into business till after you took him up? - A. He told me both before and after I heard of his taking a bit of ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell that Jury that you did not receive that information till after he was taken up? - A. That has nothing to do with what I charge him with.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes it has a great deal; upon your oath do you not believe he would have obtained a great deal of business; is he not a very clever workman? - A. No, there are better workmen.</p>
               <p>Q. And you kept him ten years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Webb kept him ten years before you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Tilley tell you that he was going to join him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the article, that you charge him with, the last that he received for you? - A. No, he has received some since from other people and paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not a few minutes ago swear directly the reverse? - A.He was in my service some time after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say but two questions before that he had not paid you money since Mr. Cock's demand? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COCK sworn. - I am a carpenter; I I was indebted to Mr. Bayley in the sum of 2l. 17s. 11d. the prisoner brought me in the bill (produces it) I found fault with the charge, and told him I should not pay the bill till I saw his master; some time after that, I think about the 5th or 6th of March last, the prisoner came and asked me for payment of the bill; I asked him if he was fully authorized to settle the bill with me, he told me he was; I asked him how much he was to take off the bill? he said a few shillings; I told him by taking off 6s. 11d. it would reduce it to 2l. 11s. which I paid him with my own hands.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ROWLEY sworn. - I am a constable, I know nothing but the apprehension of the man; he said he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I received this money,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010080"></xptr>it was late on the Saturday night; when I came home, I did not settle with Mr. Bayley; I was to have taken but half a crown off the bill, and I went to Mr. Cock's house, to return the money that he had paid me; and I saw Mr. Cock's son.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bayley.) Had you any conversation with the prisoner, about deducting any thing from the bill? - A. Yes; I told him to deduct two or three shillings.</p>

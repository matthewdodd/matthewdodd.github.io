On Monday night, the 8th of December, I left my doors all barred and bolted, and the windows secure; I have nobody but an apprentice in the house: I went to bed about twelve o'clock, got up about half-past six, and found the front door unlocked and unbolted - no violence had been used to that door; the key was left on the counter in the shop- I had left it in the door: my house was formerly a butcher's, and there is a slaughter-house at the back, from which there is a door and window looking into the shop - they first broke open the slaughter-house door, and had entered into the back parlour, through the slaughter-house window; a pane of glass was taken out of the window - they could then open the window, get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190006"></xptr>in and unbolt the shop-door; I missed a quantity of bristles, and about four or five dozen brushes - they were worth about 25l.; they were all safe the night before. -On the evening after the robbery two men called and asked me to come out, as they had something to communicate; I went out, and in consequence of what they said I went to the Police-office, and told what I had heard - an officer was sent with me and the two men; we went to a house in Charlotte-street, Curtain-road, where the prisoner lived - we saw him there, and found a basket of bristles on a table in a corner of the room; I identified them as part of my property - I knew some by the tie, and some by a process I had brought them through; the officer asked the prisoner how he came by them - he said two men called and left them there, and that he expected the price of a drink for allowing them to do so; the officer told him to say nothing to criminate himself, as what he said would be given in evidence against him - he then said two men called, and left them there; when we came to the office the other two men followed me for some money, for the information they had given - the prisoner was in the watch-house at that time; I had promised to reward them with 2l or 3l. if I obtained my property - I gave them into custody, and they were let out on bail; there names were Smith and Fletcher.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you learn from either of the men any thing about one Nathan? A. No, but he was in custody, and discharged on bail; I have not indicted him - the prisoner did not mention Nathan's name: the bristles laid on his table, in a clothes basket, covered with a black handkerchief; we found more in the room: I told the officer I suspected a man who lived behind my house, as he was in the trade, and the best bristles were selected - I have seen that man once or twice since; the prisoner described the two men to me, and I think they answered the description of the men who gave the information - they were in the crowd at the office, and the officer said, "Do you not know either of these two men;" he said he knew one, but he was not the man who brought the bristles.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The men pointed out the house to you? A. Yes, and then they ran away; the prisoner did not see them then - when I came back I found them standing in an entry near his premises; I could not find the house after I had been for a coach, and they pointed it out to me; I have no reason to believe the prisoner knew I had received information from two men - I might have told him so, but I am not certain about it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 9th of December, about ten o'clock at night, Rooney took me, with the two persons who gave the information, to the prisoner's house, No. 25. Charlotte-street, Curtain-road; the men pointed out the door, and immediately ran away - I went in: I knew nothing of the two men before - the door opens into the lower room; the moment we got in Rooney went to a dresser, and saw some bristles, which be claimed - I then said I must take him to the office, and told him not to criminate himself; he then told me two young men had brought the bristles there about six o'clock, and that he, being very poor, wished to earn a shilling or two, and had allowed them to leave them there, and that they were to be called for that night or early the next morning; he gave me no description of them - I took him to the watch-house, and went to the office; when I came outside, observing the two young men had been following the coach to the watch-house and to the office, I secured them, having suspicion of them; there were eight examinations - they were remanded there or four weeks, and then ordered to find bail; they did not find bail, and were discharged last Session, by proclamation. On the following morning, as I was bringing the prisoner from Norton-falgate watch-house, he said, "Now I will tell you the truth, a man named Nathan came to me, and asked me if I would earn a shilling - I said Yes; he then desired me to bring my basket out of the house, which I did, and then Nathan left me, desiring me to follow two men who were waiting outside the house;" next morning he identified one of the two men as one of them - he picked him out from forty persons; that was Smith: he did not point out the other man, but denied knowing him - he said he followed them to a house in a street near Rosemary-lane, that one of them then took the basket from him, went in, and brought it out, with something in it, and desired him to carry it back near his house - he said he waited at the door while one or both of them went in (Rooney does not live near Rosemary-lane); he said when they got to his house they told him they could not get any money, but if he would let them have the basket they would return in a few minutes, and pay him - that they returned in a short time, and begged they might leave the basket there, and they would call and pay him that night or next morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you inquired about the prisoner's character? A. I believe him to be very poor; I never knew a charge against him - this trial was postponed last Session, because his sister was in the family way; I never heard him say she had slept in the same room with him on the night of the robbery - I understand Nathan is a queer character: the prisoner is a pieman - I do not suppose he understands about bristles.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . When the men called they wished to know what I would give them; I wished to defer it till morning, but they said they would be gone then - I said 2l. or 3l. - they said, "Come along, and we will shew you where it is."</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, and lived with him in December; only he and his wife live there- we all slept in the same room: I could not come here last Session, as I was brought to bed six weeks ago. On the night of the 8th of December my brother went to bed about ten o'clock, and got up about seven next morning - my bed was by the side of his; he was out of employ. On the day he was apprehended I saw Nathan come to the house between five and six o'clock in the evening, ask my brother to go some where in Rosemary-lane, and fetch some things for him; he said Yes, if they were not too heavy - he went out with an empty basket, and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190007"></xptr>Nathan to go and shew him where; Nathan said two young men were waiting outside to go with him - my brother returned alone in about an hour and a half, without his basket, and said, "Nathan says he will bring the basket in half an hour, and pay me 2s." - Nathan returned in about an hour and a half, with the basket, and asked my brother to let it be there till the morning, when he would call and pay him. I am quite sure he slept at home on Monday, the 8th.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tooley-street, Southwark. On the 31st of January, the prisoner came into my shop, which has an inner door, at nine o'clock or a few minutes after nine in the evening—he first came to the door and looked in at the outer door—I was standing at the end of the counter—I saw him come to the door and look in—I have two doors to my shop—there is a lobby—the outer door was open—the inner door was on a latch—it opens with a brass knob—I saw him take hold of the knob, turn it, and come in—I am certain that door was shut—when he came in he turned to the window, put up his hand, took hold of a pair of trowsers, looked at them, and looked at me in the face—I was standing at the end of the counter, about three yards from him—he took the trowsers in his hand and turned to look at me—I was about to step to him, expecting he was going to ask me the price—he caught down another pair which hung by the side of them, and run out with them both—I called "Stop thief"—two or three persons followed him to the end of an archway, and he got away—I am lame—I never saw my trowsers afterwards—he was taken up on the following Saturday—I am certain of him.</p>

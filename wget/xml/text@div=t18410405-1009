                  </hi>. I work about the wharfs.

                  </hi>. The prosecutor had given the chaise and horse into my care that morning—I went to fetch the whip—Corfield told me a per-son had gone with the coat—I went out of the shop, and just as I got to Miles-lane, I saw the prisoner running—I ran after him and got into King William-street, and saw him with it under his arm—he sometimes walked and sometimes ran—he got to the corner of Lombard-street—I told a policeman—the prisoner saw me do it, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the coat into the road —policeman ran and caught him—he is the same person.</p>

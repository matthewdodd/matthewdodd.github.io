How came he to sleep there? - I asked him how he came to sleep there? in the night, and he said he saw his name put at the window, and he asked for a lodging there, this was the first night. The waistcoat, breeches, and handkerchief were missing; my mistress she perceived the things gone first, he came down and gave the key to her, and asked her if there was not a place backwards, and after that went out by the window, and she mistrusted he had got something under his arm, and she went up and saw my things were gone; and she told her husband, and he went after him.</p>

               <p>I am the landlord of the house, the prisoner came and took the lodging of my wife at five o'clock in the afternoon, and he slept along with this man; in the morning he got up and brought the key down, and gave it to my wife, and went and asked to go back to the yard, she said, yes, and directly as he went out, she saw the bundle under his coat and directly went out after him, and lost him up in Crown-street, and they came down to me to the brewhouse, and I went after him and see him walking down the street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040028"></xptr>with the things in his hand, and took him with the things in his hand, in Crown-street, St. Giles's, between seven and eight o'clock, as nigh as I can tell in the morning. He gave the bundle into my hands, I claimed it of him; the bundle contained a pair of velveret breeches, a cloth waistcoat, and a silk handkerchief. I have kept them from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These are my things, I know the breeches, there is a little patch on the right thigh.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Between five and six when the man got up, he waked me and told me to bring the key down to the landlord; about six or seven a man came up and waked me by my bedside, I don't know who it was, and told me to get up, and take the key to my landlady, and I went down and gave the key to my landlady's daughter, and I asked her the way backward, as I did not know the way of the house, and the little girl stayed in the yard all the time; the man and I went out, and this man who came up and waked, asked me to carry the bundle for him, and as I was walking along, in Crown-street, them two men came up and took me directly.</p>

            . I am headborough of the Liberty of Norton Falgate. I know no more than the apprehending of the prisoner, on Saturday, the 23rd of December, in the evening, at about eleven o'clock; I apprehended him at a public-house called the New Crown, in Wheeler-street, Bethnall-green, Hospital-fields. I heard the woman was dead, and therefore I apprehended him.</p>

This is the same house in which the prisoner and the deceased lived; he himself lodged in the gatrret, and she lodged in the same room; she was the woman he cohabit with. This was on the Saturday night, and Christmas Day was on the Monday following; I don't know what time I went out; but when I was returning, it was nearer eight then seven; when I came up to the house, I saw a great mob round the door; when I went up to see what it was, I saw the deceised laying on the steps of the door. When I went up to her, she could hardly speak. It is impossible for me to know whether she was in danger of death, nor do I know that she was sensible, as she was in a dying way; I don't think she had her perfect senses about her; she was carried to the watchhouse, and I went with her to the watchhouse; there she was in a sensible state. Afterwards she went to the Hospital; but I don't know whether she died going to the Hospital, or at the Hospital. I saw the prisoner that evening at the King and Queen, in Norton Falgate; I asked him how the woman came out of the window? He swore, and said how did he know. I told him he ought to know, because the woman had lodged with him upwards of two months? He said he had set by his own fire side, while she broke the windows with her kunckles; he did not say what window. I said, as he had lodged with the woman, he ought to have come down stairs, and seen what was the matter with her. He said if she had a mind to break her neck out of the window, that was nothing to him, and he swore again. I don't know whether they-had been quarrelling that day; I had not seen her or him either; I very seldom saw them.</p>

            . I live in the next house, on the adjoining floor of the prisoner; I live up three pair of stairs, and the prisoner lived three pair of stairs in the next house; there is nothing but a lath and plaster division between. They were always quarrelling and wrangling; I knew the prisoner's voice, and I could distinguish the deceased's from it. At about eight o'clock in the evening of the 23rd, I heard the prisoner and the deceased wrangling; I heard him get up in a very great passion, and she came against the partition. He pushed her down two or three steps, by reason of which, she fell against my wainscott. I could see nothing; I could hear him go into the room again, and her follow him: I heard him get up and force her towards the door again; she said "you won't" three times. I understood that he was endeavouring to push her down stairs, and she said "you won't."Then I heard her fall down the whole pair of stairs. She said, "don't murder me," three times. The prisoner said, he did not want to murder her; but he would have his money. He shut his door, and went towards the fire, as I could hear. The woman was then down one pair of stairs; then I heard her groan very low. Then I heard the stair case window break; I heard it break four or five times; in about six or seven minutes, I heard her fall out; that was the two pair of stairs stair case. The prisoner at that time was in his room. Hearing this, I ran down stairs; she was laying just at the foot of the steps, on the flagstone, just under the window. I never saw either of them to my knowledge before. The neighbours came round, and I went to my own house.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Moore's-alley; that is almost facing the house the prisoner lived in; I knew the prisoner; but not the deceased. I heard the prisoner and her making a great noise, wrangling and quarrelling; I could not tell what it was about. I heard the deceased cry "murder," several times, and I heard her say, "for God's sake some good Christian come and help me" I heard the window break several times, It was ten minutes after this that I heard the window break; I could not tell what window; I did not see it at the time. I heard nothing else. Afterwards I went down after she fell out, and saw her laying on her back on the stones; she looked sensible in her eyes; she did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100018"></xptr>speak. She was taken out of the alley to the watchhouse, and I saw no more of her.</p>
               <p>ANN KELSEY. I live in this alley; my house is on the opposite side of the way to the prisoner's; it was up one pair of stairs. Between seven and eight, I heard the woman cry out "murder," I knew her voice; I went and opened my window,but saw nothing of her. I never held any conversation with the woman. I thought I could see a head hang out of the window, between seven and eight o'clock. I asked her what was the matter? and she said, she wanted to get out, and she said, if she could not get out, she would throw herself out of the window; I said, don't do that, until some body comes to you. I directly shut up the window, and came to my own fire place. My husband came down, and sat by the fire. I heard some thing fall out ef the window, very heavy; that was in a very few minutes after she said "she would throw herself out of window." Upon hearing this fall, I ran down with a candle, and went to the woman; she was laying with her foot in the kinnel; I went to her, and said, poor woman, have you hurt yourself, and she opened her eyes, and could not speak.</p>

            . I attended at the London Hospital. I remember the evening of Saturday, the 23rd; the deceased was brought to the Hospital soon after eight o'clock; she was dead. On my examining her, there was a bruize at the hinder part of her head; on removing the bone of the head, there was a quantity of fused blood between the duramater and the brain; the pressure of the fused blood was the cause of her death; there was neither fracture nor depression. She died of concussion. This exhavasated blood would occasion stupefection, and death, and might be produced from the blow we understand she received. I have no doubt that a fall would occasion it.</p>

               <p>Several witnesses gave the prisoner a good character for humanity.</p>

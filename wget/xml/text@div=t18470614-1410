On the evening this hap<lb></lb>pened I was on duty in the neighbourhood of the Flask—I had to pass the window before I got to the door, and I looked through, but could not see whether it was Coffee or John Gorman who was on the table kicking Hubbard on the back of the head—I immediately went into the room with all the speed I could—the door was closed against me—I forced it open, and found Hubbard there—Coffee, john Gorman, and some other whom I do not know, were beating him—I think there were about four altogether about him—they had a quart pot in their hands—I laid hold of Coffee and john Gorman, as I knew them, and required them to drop the pots, and not murder the man—I threw them back from him—they did not put down the pots; and at that moment Dignam came in, and John Gorman got away from me, and struck Dignam on the head with the pot as he entered the room—I laid hold of him a second time—I had my truncheon in my pocket—I took it out at that time, but not before—in doing that I was struck with a quart pot by Dennis Gorman, who stood on a form over me, and cut my hat and my forehead—I took hold of Dennis—the mother, Catherine Gorman, then came up and laid her hands round my neck—I required her to let me go—she would not loosen her hold, and, before I could get from her, John Gorman came and struck me on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, and live York-street, Westminster. On the evening of the 24th of May I was in the tap-room of the Flask public-house—there were six or seven other persons there—the prisoners were there—I was there when Minter came in—he said something to the prisoners, I could not exactly understand what, and they jumped over the table and struck him violently—Coffee struck him first, and when he was down john Gorman kicked him—I do not know whether either of the other did anything to him—there was a confusion, and I could not identify any particular object afterwards—I saw Minter leave the house—I had a com<lb></lb>munication with the landlord, and I went for the police—I was gone about a quarter of an hour—when I returned, I found that in consequence of Minter having left, peace was restored—there were no policemen there then—in five or six minutes Trevett and Hubbard came—I then saw Minter return—the very moment he came in, john Gorman and Coffee jumped over the place and commenced a fresh attack upon him—I cannot say whether Minter had interfered with them—he said something to them in a low tone of voice—he did not attempt to touch or strike them—on Minter's being beaten, Hubbard attempted to seize Coffee, and John Gorman struck him with a quart pot on the head—nobody elseinterfered—Minter crawled out of the room—two po<lb></lb>licemen were at the window, trying to get in, because the door had been bar<lb></lb>ricadoed by john Gorman and Coffee—two more policemen came, (Carmody and Dignam,) and burst open the door—the moment they came and attempted to <hi rend="italic">seize</hi> Gorman, Coffee struck Dignam a violent blow on his head with a quart pot—his hat fell off—the blow had penetrated the hat, and he bled from one side of the head, being then in stopping position—Dig<lb></lb>nam was beat out of the room—Carmody was then alone, and John Gorman and Coffee struck him several times on the head with quart pots—I saw Dennis Gorman with the poker—he placed it down in the conflict, and Gilbert struck Carmody a blow on the back part of the head with it—Carmody was then the only policeman in the room—I noticed the female prisoner lay hold of him by the throat, while john Gorman struck him with a quart pot on the back part of the head—something was said at the time she had hold of him, I do not know what—she held him for a minute or two—I did not hear him, say anything—something was said, but I do not know what—Mr. Brown had sent for a reinforcement, and they burst open the door and entered—Carmody was in the room at that time, bleeding—I was glad to make my escape, and saw nothing afterwards—the first policeman that came in was Charles Chinn—he was struck by Gorman with a quart pot—when the door was burst open the first time, when it was barricaded, John Gorman and Coffee were near the door, inside—Coffee said, the first man that came in, he would knock him down, and that no b—policeman should take him—I stopped outside a short time, and then went to the police-station—I did not hear that any fighting was going on after I got out.</p>

               <p>I am headborough of St. Luke's; the prosecutor lost a watch; I saw it taken out of her pocket; she refused to be examined; I never saw the prosecutor before that night; it was my watch night and two women came to the watch-house, and said, a man had been robbed of his watch, in consequence of which, I went and took the prisoner; and she had a watch in her right hand pocket. (Produced and deposed to.) I found her in Bell-alley, Golden-lane; I asked who was the person that lost their watch, the prosecutor said, I am; I said, where is the girl that robbed you; he said, here; I took her into custody, she confessed she had the watch; I asked the prosecutor if it was his, and he said, yes; I have had it ever since; there is the picture of a woman on the chain; I cannot say the maker's name, or the number, the seals are red.</p>
               <p>What are the figures upon them? - I cannot tell, I should know them again.</p>

               <p>My Lord, this gentleman went home with another girl, and going home, the man that this girl lived with knocked her down, and I did speak to the gentleman, and asked him to let me look what it was o'clock; and she tried to snatch the watch out of my hand and run away; and I asked the prosecutor to go and see after her, and in turning back I met the officer, and he stopped me, he asked me if I had the man's watch, and I said, I had, and I took it out of my pocket and gave it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you going home with another girl? - No, I was not, I am sure the prisoner was the girl.</p>

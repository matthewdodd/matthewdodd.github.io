                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Hancock, who keeps the Exeter Arms, Lisson-grove—the prisoner was my servant for three weeks. On the 22nd of Oct. I missed a pair of my black silk stockings from a drawer in a spare room—on the morning of the 23rd I told the prisoner I had missed them and several other things, and I would have a general search—she ran down to the wash-house, and came up with her keys, unlocked her box, and in it I found this other pair of silk stockings, and these other things—I asked how she could be guilty of such meanness—she said some one must have put them in her box, that the ribbon was belonging to a bonnet, and she had had it two years; but it is mine, it is quite new, and had never been on a bonnet—I have the fellow piece to it—I found a book of mine in her pocket—these are all my husband's things.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in New Buildings, Red Cross Street. On 3rd Feb., I left home to go to Walworth, about 8 o'clock in the evening—I had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in my pocket. On returning from Walworth, I went into the Sugar Loaf public house—I was drinking there—I found a sailor there, and was drinking with him some time—it might be an hour—it might be about 10 o'clock when I got to the Sugar Loaf—when I came out I might go with the sailor towards London Bridge; I would not say—we came out of the Sugar Loaf together—I do not recollect going anywhere else—I had some money when I left the Sugar Loaf—I cannot tell to what amount—I was drunk—I am not aware that I went to High Street, and from there to Union Street—there was something happened to me; it was in Union Street the policeman told me—I remember nothing of seeing the prisoners till I saw them before the Magistrate—in the morning I had no money, it was all gone, and my clothes were dirty—I had my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coming up from Walworth.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 251). I was on duty in High Street, Borough, at a quarter past 1 o'clock, on 4th Feb.—I saw the two prisoners and the prosecutor standing together—Hands had got her hand in his pocket, and, as soon as she pulled it out, they both laid hold of him by the shoulders, threw him on the pavement, and ran away—when Hands drew her hand out of his pocket, her hand was shut—I pursued and overtook them about twenty yards off—I caught them both round the neck; another constable coming up, I let him take hold of Welsh, and I said, "You have robbed that man"—Hands said, "I never touched the man"—I laid hold of her hand, and took six shillings, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, out of it—it was her right hand, which she carried under her cloak in running.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what part of High Street was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twenty yards from Union Street, towards the Town Hall—I was on the same side of the way as the prisoners, about ten yards from them; there was no one else there—I never heard the cry of "Police" from any one—there was no one passing, and no cab—they ran towards Union Street—I followed them about twenty yards—the prosecutor was lying on his back; I sent another constable to take him up—he was taken to the station—he did not recover himself—I saw him the next morning.</p>

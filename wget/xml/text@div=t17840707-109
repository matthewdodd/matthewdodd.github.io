               <p>I am the prosecutor's servant, I took this bason out of the prisoner's pocket in Covent Garden, I saw him with it in his hand at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070157"></xptr> Mr. Pincham's door, he put it down, and I saw him with it again, I spoke to him about ten minutes after, and I asked him if he had paid for it, and he said pho! pho! I took hold of him and took it out of his pocket; at the Justice's he made some excuse that he paid some woman, I do not know whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Might not he go from your stall to another and buy one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Last Wednesday evening I was coming along Covent Garden, I recollected my servant had broke a sugar dish, I cheapened one, the prosecutor asked 1 s. 6 d. I offered him 1 s. he went backwards, and a woman that was there said you may take it; I put down a shilling and put it in my handkerchief, and they followed me, I said I bought it and paid your master, or his sister, or his wife one shilling for it, when I came back the woman was not to be found; they wanted to persuade me that the woman belonged to me, I never was from the stall, we went to a magistrate, I told him I would send for two gentlemen to bail me, if it was 1500 l. I could get it; the next morning we went before Justice Addington, I told him the same; I was then committed: I am of opinion both the master and man, and sister ought to be set in the pillory; here I have been confined three or four days, and my credit at stake.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the woman? - It was in the dusk of the evening, I cannot say I can swear to the woman, but it was a woman that I am sensible belonged to the shop.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to your character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

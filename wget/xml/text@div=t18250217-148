It was part of my duty to look after his pigs - they were kept in the stye, close by the house. On Saturday, the 12th of February, I saw them safe about seven o'clock in the evening, fed them, and fastened the stye. I had had the care of them for ten days, and knew them well - I missed them about ten on Sunday morning, and traced the steps of two of them for about thirty rods, but no further; there is a ditch there, over which there is a plank; if they had crossed the ditch and the marsh, they might have got into Old-Ford road. I saw four pigs in the custody of Carter, on Wednesday, the 16th, and knew them to be Mr. Hart's pigs - they had been scalded. There was a very particular mark about the ear of one of the biggest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. They had lost the greater part of their hair; my master bought them of Mr. Downer, of Romford. There are more store pigs in that neighbourhood; but I can swear to them - they had black marks, which I had seen while they lived.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were two of them larger than the others? A. Yes; and it was them I chiefly knew.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in High-street, Shadwell. Perkins came to my house last Monday, and asked if I wanted to buy any pigs; I said I should have no objection, but I did not care much about it, it being the beginning of the week - he said he had got four pigs. I asked where they were; he said they were at the Quaker's house, which escaped the fire at Ratcliff, in Butcher-row; I said I would go and see them. I went up in the evening and looked at them; I saw four hanging<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170071"></xptr>up - I saw Perkins only; he asked me a crown a stone for them, without their heads and feet; I asked him what he would have for them with their heads and feet on; he said 4 s. 9 d.; I bid him 4 s. 6 d. for the two smaller ones - I asked him who they belonged to; he said to Mr. Jefferson, who was not there - I said if Mr. Jefferson would take that for them, I would have them. Perkins and Jefferson brought them down to my house that night - I paid him for them, and went to Mr. Seamon's to have them weighed - I hung them up in front of my shop that night, and put a clean cloth before them. Carter came next morning and took them away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Jefferson? A. Yes; he has a good character, as far as I know; he was in my employ three quarters of a year ago; I believe he dealt in pigs and other things. Perkins said he supposed they were fed on pease, for there were pease in their inside.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in High-street, Shadwell, near Mr. Redford's. On Monday last, Jefferson and another man came to my house with Mr. Redford, to weigh two pigs; after they were weighed, the two men said they had got two more; I asked what they wanted for them; they said 4 s. 9 d. a stone; I said I would go and look at them. I went to a house, which they said was the Quaker's house, which was not burnt down at the time of the great fire. I saw the pigs in a stable; I saw all the three prisoners there - I asked them again what they would take for them; they said 4 s. 9 d.; I told them the most I would give was 4 s. 6 d. It was Jefferson who spoke to me, and I believe it was him who agreed to take it; he brought one to my house, and one of the other prisoners (I do not know which) brought the other; they weighed 12 st. 3 lb. - I told them to go to Mr. Ottey's, the public-house, and I would come and pay them - an officer came as soon as they were gone; I went with him to the public-house, and the prisoners were taken into custody. The pigs were fairish meat; what I gave was a very fair price - I did not ask how they got them.</p>

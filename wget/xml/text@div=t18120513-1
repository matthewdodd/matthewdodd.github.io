We were suspicious that we were losing a quantity of soap and barrilla until the apprehension of the prisoner. On the 13th of April I went into the barilla room, and found the prisoners coat upon an empty cask in the barilla room, I searched his pockets, there was a great deal of barilla dust between the lining of the coat and the outside, which was made as a large pocket; and there was also soap plastered inside that pocket. I then ordered my clerk, Mr. M'Clerc, to watch the prisoner, and I went to Worship-street for an officer. I returned with the officer. I saw the prisoner coming out of the manufactory; I pointed him out to the officer, and desired the officer to take the prisoner. The officer took the prisoner; we brought him into the accompting-house, we searched the prisoner there, and took from him a quantity of soap, twelve pounds of soap, from the flap part of his breeches. I gave the prisoner into the custody of the officer. The officer took the prisoner to Worship-street office. We went with the prisoner to the prisoner's lodgings, we there found three cakes of yellow soap, weighing eight pounds, value five shillings, and a hundred weight of barilla on the stair-case, facing the room door. When we were searching the prisoner's room, he said it was the first time, he hoped we would forgive him. I told him it was not in my power to do it. This is the barilla and the soap. We afterwards found about half a hundred weight of barilla concealed behind the cask where the prisoner's coat was.</p>

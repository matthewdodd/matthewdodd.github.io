            . On the 29th of December. I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night, and was the last person up. I got up at half-past six in the morning - it was then dark. I went into the front parlour, and missed a table-cloth. I found the parlour blinds open, the glass of the sash cut, and the sash open; the shutters were forced open, but put too again. I missed a desk and tea-caddy. I found the caddy, through an advertisement. Four or five phosphorus matches were left behind; three or four of them were burnt, and a piece of candle had been burnt almost to the socket.</p>

               <p>Q. You told the Magistrate you believed they were the men - A. I never had a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that you believed they were the men - A. I do not recollect it. I swore positively to them. Easterby had a fustian jacket, but not the one he has on now. Ryan had a blue coat buttoned up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the colour of a coat at that time of night - A. Yes, by the light of the lamps.</p>

            . I have a tea caddy and a shoe. On Friday, the 9th of January, I went to King's room, and found this tea caddy concealed under the bed among other things; King was there, and said all the property in the place was his. I asked how he came by these things; he said a woman had brought them up there. I took Ryan's shoe off his foot; a chair was brought to the office which stood in the prosecutor's parlour, under the window; it appeared that the person on entering the window had stepped on the chair - the mark of a foot is on it now, and the shoe fits it; here is the chair; it is the print of a right shoe; his shoes are rights and lefts; the heel and waist of the shoe fit the mark.</p>

               <p>Prisoner KING. When you came into the room and asked if all the things belonged to me, I said Yes; not knowing that these were there; but when you found them, I said I could produce the woman who brought them up. I sent for the woman, and she came up and owned them. - Witness, The woman he lived with came up and said they belonged to her; and we took her to the office; the Magistrate discharged her; her name is Sharp.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner himself say when they were first produced that they belonged to Sharp - A. No, my Lord, it was

            , who he lived with; she said that they belonged to Sharp; I do not recollect King saying so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that the caddy was his - A. No he spoke generally of the things in the room; the caddy was not then found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner KING. When I said I could produce the owner, Sharp came up - you shewed them to her all separately, and she owned them all. - Witness, He never told me he could produce the owner. Blackwell said Sharp had brought them up there; Sharp came up and said she brought them there.</p>
               <p>JURY Q. Did you suppose these things to be stolen - A. We found so. I took the woman to the office with Blackwell - they were discharged. Sharp was sent to Clerkenwell Prison, and afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Sharp also own the things belonging to the last case - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not mention that on the last trial - A. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180032"></xptr>done away with before the Magistrate - I thought it not necessary.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Vann to Easterby's and to King's, where we found the tea-caddy, with other property. Blackwell said a girl named Sharp brought them there - Sharp came up in a few minutes, and owned them. Sharp was in custody some days. King said nothing about who brought the property there - it was Blackwell - and when Sharp came up I saw Blackwell pull her by the gown, but what it it meant I cannot say. King said he rented the room, and that all the property there was his, speaking generally.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you give this account when you were examined half an hour ago - A. Yes. I did not mention about the woman coming up and claiming the property - as the woman was discharged I did not think it necessary. I have been an officer nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know it to be most important, for the purpose of a conviction, to prove that man in possession of and claiming the property - A. I cannot say that I did. I would not say a wrong thing if I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it materially in his favour that the property was claimed - A. If I have done wrong, I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Our verdict would have been quite different in the last case as to King, if we had known this before.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. John Chatfield and others, who live in Upper Ground-street, Blackfriar's-road. On the 5th of July we missed ten sticks of timber, which I had seen safe at <placeName id="t18300916-328-crimeloc1691">Battersea</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What was the mark on them? A. The ship's name was the Latona; we did not have the entire cargo, but several pieces; the rest would have the same ship's name on it, but the number would be different - there might be some others of the same contents; I did not see it from the 1st to the 5th of July - the dock they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160142"></xptr>were in is secured by a boom, which goes across; the timber generally floats at high water - it can be removed without loosing the boom.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did you find the locks of it broken? A. One was a little damaged - the same feet of timber may be in one stick as another, but the number would not agree.</p>

            . I am a waterman, and live at Hammersmith - the prisoner is a waterman. On the 3rd of July, about twelve o'clock at noon, I saw him with ten pieces of timber, which he was hauling into a dock at Lane's-end; I afterwards saw Smallwood and the prisoner at the Cannon public-house; the prisoner put on a canvas-frock - I saw the same timber there on the Sunday, but I did not see it taken away; I afterwards saw Prudent speak to the prisoner the same day, and then Prudent rowed the boat down to Hungerford.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you always state the same time? A. At Bow-street I said three o'clock, but it was twelve- I was not aware of any thing coming of it; I judge now by the state of the tide - I was in the Old Court as a prisoner; I had done the same as others, nothing, but I went to New South Wales, and staid there seven years - I was charged at Horsemonger-lane, but not in the Court; I was a prisoner at Croydon, but the bill was thrown out.</p>

I saw the prisoner there as I was going to London, and I saw Summersell; it was on a Saturday in July - I was an apprentice at the time, and I asked the prisoner to give me a cast down in his boat; he said he was going to stop a little while, but I might row his boat down, leave it in charge of somebody, and he would call for it in the morning - I rowed myself down, and left it alongside the others.</p>

               <p>MR. MERCER. I accompanied the officer to Smallwood's; I did not see Edwards there - I found five sticks there; I then went to Cook's, where I had been the preceding evening, but Edwards was not at home - I found the two sticks there through the people on Smallwood's premises; the two I found at Cook's, and the five at Smallwood's, are part of the ten that were lost.</p>

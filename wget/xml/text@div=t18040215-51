I shewed her several lower then, and she seemed to be dissatisfied with them; I asked her what price she would go to; she said she did not know. The first I shewed her was three shillings and ninepence a yard; I asked her if she would go to that; she said, she would, if she could get a good one; I knew them to be good I had shewed her; I suspected her, and said, stop, I will look, I think there is one missing; she told me I must find it; I told her I intended to find it before she went out of the shop; she asked me whether I thought she had robbed the shop; I told her I would say no farther till I was perfectly satisfied. We counted the lace over again, and I found it one short; I then told her I was sure. She asked me whether I was not ashamed to accuse her; I told her, no, if she was not ashamed to steal, I was not ashamed to accuse her. She insisted upon leaving the shop; I told the young man to go to my next door neighbour, Mr. Ellis, she had cheated him out of a yard of dimity; she insisted all the time she had not got the lace; I told her the pattern and the price. I then told our young man to get a constable; the constable came, and found the lace upon her; I searched her myself, the constable was present; she had two shawls on, it was in the under shawl. During the time she was there, two persons came in, our young man is not very careful, and while he was serving them, I cast my eye now and then to look at them; in the mean time, the lace was gone; we were both behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There were two other customers - there were five of you in the shop during the time she was there? - A. Yes, for a short time.</p>
               <p>(The lace was produced by the constable, and identified by Mrs. Parry.)</p>

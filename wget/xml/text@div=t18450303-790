                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Barnett. The prisoner was in his service—he left on the 5th of Feb.—he and I had slept together in a turn-up bedstead, in the shop—on the morning of the day he went away he said, if I could find his pocket-book he would give me a sovereign—he left about seven o'clock in the evening—afterthat I let down the bed which the prisoner had slept in the night before, and the pocket-book and two small bundles fell out of it—my master was about half a yard from me at the time—I picked them up, and gave them to him—I had seen the pri<lb></lb>soner write a card at one time, and I saw that card in the pocket-book.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. How long have you lived with Mr. Barnett? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years—the prisoner was with him about eighteen months—I have not often been charged with telling my master lies—perhaps I may have been charged half a dozen times—I have told him stories—the prisoner used to go to dinner at one o'clock—no other persons had charge of the shop—when the prisoner went to dinner I used to remain in charge—he was absent from twenty minutes to half an hour—when pledges are redeemed, the ticket is taken off the goods when they come down the spout, apd pinned to the ticket returned by the pawner—they are put into a box "bove the till, which box is left open for the convenience of the business, to put them in and out—the prisoner had asked me about his pocket-book about two months before he went away, and told me he had lost it—he went way in consequence of having broken some smelling-bottles—I have seen his father come to the shop—the till was open, as well as the ticket-box, when the prisoner was in the shop, but when he went to dinner he always pushed the till in—the moment I turned down the bed the pocket-took fell out—I had turned the bed down every night—the book fell from between the bed and the sacking, I think—when the till is pushed in it does not lock, but it cannot be pulled out without</p>

               <p>making a noise; but when the prisoner was at dinner in the parlour he pushed the till in, and pulled the blind up, so that he could see into the shop—I remember his losing a half-sovereign—he did not ask me about it—I did not know he had lost it till I happened to pick up one the same night—the book is not made up at the time of the redemption of the pawn, not till after the shop is shut.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Roebuck-terrace, Dover-road—the prisoner was in my service for a year and a half—he slept in the shop—it was his business to take in pledges, and re<lb></lb>ceive the money for them when re<lb></lb>deemed, to put the money into the till, and the duplicates which the parties brought, into a box placed orer the till, and enter the receipt of that money in a book which I have here—the account was made up nightly—the duplicates were compared with the money, and the amount was ascertained by that means—I hare referred to the book—on the 30th and 31st of Jan. there is no entry of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on either of those days—I have looked at the days immediately before and after—I find no such entries with reference to the articles in question—if that money had been paid, it should have been crossed out in the book—this jacket and two shirts are not crossed out—as far as appears by the book, they appear to be in pledge still-there is no receipt of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. acknowledged on the 31st of Jan., on account of a jacket—there is an entry of a shirt pawned for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that day—the prisoner left me on the 5th of Feb.—I was in the shop when Bosworth was making the bed that night—he handed me over this pocket-book, and these two packets of duplicates—the pocket-book also con<lb></lb>tained duplicates—the duplicates which refer to these trapsactions were some in the pocket-book and some in the parcels—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing them</hi>)—here are two duplicates pinned together—they ought to have been in the box over the till—the prisoner had no right whatever to have them—at the time he received the money he ought to have put the money and the interest in the till, but not to have put the interest on the duplicate if it were under a month.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Wiggins, who works on the Paddington Canal. On the 10th of November, I went into Clayton's beer-shop, about six or seven o'clock in the morning, to look for a man my husband wanted to go with him—I went from there to Branch's—he is a labouring man—it is a private house—I saw Mrs. Branch, her husband, her brother, and another man, but I did not know him—those were all the persons in Branch's house—I stopped there a considerable time—Mrs. Branch wished me to stop and have supper there—all the men went out, and left Mrs. Branch and me by ourselves—they eat some supper and drank some beer before they went out—a lad (the prisoner's brother) came in with some nuts, and I bought twopennyworth of him—he went out after I bought them—I began to be fearful of stopping so late—it was, to the best of my knowledge, past ten o'clock—Mrs. Branch saw me take my money out and count it—there was 2 sovereigns, a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Piece, and 2 half-crowns, and the rest in shillings, sixpences, and copper, making near upon 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put it in a piece of paper, and put it into my pocket, and then went to Portsmouth's beer-shop to see if my husband was there—I did not go into the house—it is a short distance from Branch's—I did not go into Portsmouth's—on getting to a flight of steps which lead to his</p>

The prisoner said what is it o'clock? I looked at my watch and said it is about half after five; a customer came then to be shaved; I went into the shop to shave him and the prisoner then asked my mother if she would drink a glass of any thing.</p>
               <p>That was while you was in the shop? - Yes, I heard it; there is only a glass door between the shop and back room, which always stands open. My mother said she did not want any thing, she was going to tea; the prisoner said she should like to have something, it was very cold, and she sent my mother out for a quartern of gin. While my mother was gone the prisoner went out. There was nobody else in the room when my mother went out but a child not five years old. My mother came in and said the watch was taken away; I said then, that woman must have taken it.</p>
               <p>Do any other persons live in your house besides you and your mother? - Yes, I have lodgers.</p>
               <p>Could not some of the lodgers come into the back room? - There was no other person in the back room.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure no other person was in the back room? - Yes, I am sure there was not; my mother was not gone a minute.</p>
               <p>How far did your mother go to the alehouse? - About four or five doors. When my mother came back, the prisoner was gone and the watch too.</p>
               <p>Did you follow the prisoner? - No, I did not. I went to the top of the street but could not see any thing of her; I never saw her again till I was sent for by Justice Clerk. I charged her with the fact she denied it.</p>
               <p>Was the watch found? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A silver watch, I take it to be worth two guineas; the justice set it down at twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>An Officer. My Lord, the prisoner says she cannot speak English; she is a Welsh woman.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did she speak English when she came to you? - Yes, very good English.</p>
               <p>To the Officer. Did she tell you in English or Welsh she could not talk English? - In very good English. She says now she has a cold and cannot speak.</p>

               <p>How long did she stay? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Did she come again? - Yes, about five o'clock. She said she had a box to fetch from an inn, and wanted my other son to fetch it; I sent my daughter for him; when she was gone the prisoner said she wanted something to drink; I went to fetch a quartern of gin. When I returned, the watch and the prisoner were both gone. I could not be absent more than two minutes. I left nobody in the room but the woman and the child.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the room when you returned? - Nobody but the child.</p>

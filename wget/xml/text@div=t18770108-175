                  </hi>. I am a chimney sweep, and live at 9, Tooting Court, Marylebone, the prisoner is my wife—on the night of 11th September, a. little after 12 o'clock I went home with her—I had been at work in the morning part; I had been drinking about all day almost, whenever I had time from my work, along with friends—I was tolerably fresh, my wife was sober—when 1 got home I laid on the floor, as I generally do when I have a little drop, upstairs in my room—my wife came up with me, and as I was lying down she took off my boots and cut my jacket, that woke me; I was in a. drunken sleep—I don't believe there was anybody else in the room—there are only two others persons living in the house—my wife went down-stairs, I went down after her and followed her up the court and tried to persuade her to come back because there were no more houses open to get liquor and she stabbed me or did something to me, I put it down to being stabbed; she <hi rend="italic">sticked</hi> me with a knife, I am sure—I did not see the knife—I was in front of her trying to get her home and she goes like that in a moment, (<hi rend="italic">describing a stab</hi>)—I had not hold of her, I did not touch her—I only asked her to come back and she would not, and made a dig at me—and I said, <hi rend="italic">"Lizzie</hi>, I am stabbed"—I saw her make a dig at me, and 1 felt it too, I was pouring with blood—I saw a man named Smith there that I knew, and I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Charlie</hi>, I am stabbed"—my wife went down the court again after she done it and went upstairs—I hallooed for police and the constable came up—Mr. Giles the doctor saw me that same night and I was taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I daresay it might be an hour after I got home that I was stabbed—I had been out drinking that night—I was in some men's company, not in any women's that 1 recollect—i war not quarrelling with some women in a public-house—I don't remember it—none of the men or women followed me to the corner of the court—I could not swear it—I am not given to quarrelling—we do have rows two or three times a week—I was standing near the entrance of the court when I received the injury, about six or seven houses from my house—I don't remember my wife saying she would not stay in the house with me because of the state I was in—I</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, East Street, Manchester Square, and am melter at a tallow chandler's—on the morning of 12th September, about 2 o'clock, I was at work at Messrs. Harris &amp; Blackburn's, in Tooting Court—i I heard some persons talking in the court—I could not exactly catch what it was or who it was—I was at work on the ground floor, and the window looks out on the court—I heard a man sing out "I am stabbed, I am stabbed; police, police"—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running down the court from a man on the opposite side of the way—I had never seen her before to my knowledge—as she passed my door she made a mo<lb></lb>tion with her left hand to me, but the words I could not swear to; it sounded to me like "Go in, it is only a drunken man"—there was a lamp under the archway—I had an opportunity of seeing her face; my gaslight reflected through the door, and I was able to discern anyone's features going by—I can swear the prisoner is the woman—she had no boots on—I looked up the court, and saw the prosecutor about 2 or 3 yards from the top of the court; he had got his hand to his left side, and was staggering from one side of the court to the other—he was in the direction the prisoner had come from—I saw no one else in the court, only those two—I did not see anything in her hand—the police came in two or three minutes, and I then saw the man was bleeding from his side through his clothes.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—between 2 and 3 o'clock on the morning of 12th September the prosecutor was brought there by some policemen—he had a punctured wound on the left side of his back, which proceeded downwards and outwards—it was about 1 or 1 1/2 inches long and about 2 inches deep—it extended obliquely underneath the skin—it was a very dangerous wound; it had opened the chest and injured the cavity in which the lungs are contained—air was bubbling from the wound—it might have been caused by such knives as were shown to me at the police-court—he has continued at the hospital till now, an will return there this evening—he is out of danger now, but I fear he will suffer from the effects of it for the rest of his life.</p>

               <p>Rev. <hi rend="smallCaps">ABRAHAM BORROWDALE</hi>. I live at St. Mary's parsonage, Vincent-square, Westminster, and am the perpetual curate of St. Mary's, Vincent-square; the house is my dwelling house. On the night of 12th Oct. I went to bed a little before 12 o'clock—I went over the house, as is my invariable custom, and left everything safe when I went up to bed—about 3 o'clock in the morning of the 13th, I was awakened by some person apparently trying the door between my room and the room adjoining—I called out, "Who is there?" I received no answer—I then got out of bed, and opened the other door of the room which opens on to the bead of the staircase—I again called, "Who is there?" and with a like result, no answer was returned; consider<lb></lb>ing it might be one of the servants moving about, my wife rang the bell which communicates with the servant's rooms—I distinctly heard a person moving at the end of the passage to the right of my room—I called to know if any of the servants were moving, they answered that there was no one moving, that they were all in bed—I then distinctly heard a person pass me, and go down the stairs—I closed my door and locked it, threw open the window, and called for a policeman—I was answered in two or three minutes—I told him to go to the door, and I went and let him in—there were three police<lb></lb>men, two had arrived while I was descending the stairs—on going down stairs, I observed that the dining and drawing room doors were both open—they were both shut and locked when I went to bed—we went first into the drawing room; we there found that a cheffonier had been opened, two desks belonging to my children bad been taken out, and forced, and the contents were strewn on the ground, with the exception <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the articles that were taken—I missed from those desks two pencil cases, a fruit knife, two florins, and some pieces of Maundy money, belonging to the children—none of those things have been recovered—we went down to the basement floor, and there we found everything in disorder, thrown and strewn about—I found that a pane of glass had been removed from the water closet window, and the win<lb></lb>dow itself was standing open, having been fastened when I went to bed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 146). On the morning of 13th Oct., I was on duty in Regent-street, Westminster, about 200 yards from Mr. <hi rend="italic">Borrow</hi> dale's house; and about half past 5 o'clock I saw the prisoners coming from the direction of Vincent-square—I had heard of the robbery at that time—took them into custody, searched them, and found this knife on Anderson.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 93). On the morning of 13th Oct., be<lb></lb>tween 9 and 10 o'clock, I was at the police station, Rochester-row, West-minster;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240029"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoners were there, locked up in two separate cells—I heard Anderson say to White that he had made his mind up for a <hi rend="italic">stretch</hi>—White said he had not—Anderson said to White, "How about looking at the hands?"—White said, "Hold your b——tongue"—Anderson told White that he should say he had come to call him that morning—White said, 11 Yes;" he would stick to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Anderson.</hi> It is false, I never said such a word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of place is this where the prisoners were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are six cells; three on each side—I was in the middle one of the three, be<lb></lb>tween the cells in which the prisoners were—they are divided by a brick partition, about ten feet high; the brick partition extends up to the ceiling, but not in front, there is a grating for the air to come through at the top of the doors—outside there is one common passage to them all; the officers are going to and fro in that passage at times—I was about three quarters of an hour in the cell between them—I was there for the purpose of hearing any conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the usual course at the Rochester-row police station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had charge of them altogether; it was not part of the charge given to me to get into a cell between them, and hear what I could—it was not the sugges<lb></lb>tion of my own mind—I had been ordered to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you were ordered to do it on that occasion, or as a com<lb></lb>mon practice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only on this occasion.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, B</hi>). About 6 o'clock on the morning of 13th Oct., the prisoners were brought to the Rochester-row station—I received the knife produced from Burnett; there is a very great peculiarity about the shape of the top of the knife—the top part of the back of the edge is quite flat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean that it is very blunt at the end? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go that same morning to the prosecutor's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I looked at the sash of the watercloset window, and found a square of glass had been removed out of the window, and in the window sash there was an indenture or puncture right through the putty into the wood work—I compared that mark with the point of the knife, and they corresponded—the top of the knife corresponded with the depth in the wood—I fitted the knife into the dent, they exactly corresponded—I fitted the knife in gently at the top without using any force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How deep was the hole that was made through the putty into the wood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps about one-eighth of an inch; that one-eighth of an inch corresponded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine the cheffonier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I found it had not been opened by a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>; it was done by a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know it was not done by a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no impression from the chisel in the wood, and there was a mark on it with which this knife exactly corresponded; I also examined a desk which was there, and found marks on that which corresponded with this knife—I have the desk here; there are marks of blood inside—I should also say that the knife slipped, and there is a long groove here, which corresponds with the blunt part of the knife (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—it was done by something smaller than <hi rend="italic">&amp; jemmy</hi>,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the marks of blood appear to be recent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, quite iresh; I think there were several papers with blood upon them—I then went back to the station, and examined the prisoner's hands; 1 found on Anderson's left hand a wound from a knife; it was a recent wound; the cut was quite green—he said, "I did it yesterday, cutting an apple."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 111). I was on duty on the night of 12th Oct, in the Broad Sanctuary, between half past 11 and 12 o'clock, and saw tie prisoners together—they were coming from the direction of Westminster bridge, and going towards Victoria-street, Westminster—that would be the nearest way to the prosecutor's house; it was about a quarter of a mile from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Anderson.</hi> He did not see me with White; J saw White at 6 o'clock, on Wednesday; I was at home, and in bed, at 11 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not know Anderson before—I have seen White—I might have seen Anderson, but not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">White's Defence.</hi> At 6 o'clock, the evening before, Anderson met me, and told me to come and call him the next morning; 1 went, about half past 5 o'clock, and called him, and just as J got up to his house he was coming out of his door; we went in, and had a cup of coffee at a coffee-shop close by; when we went out of there a policeman stopped us, and searched us; then he let us go; we went on about 100 yards further; another policeman stopped us, and asked us to go to the station-house; we went; he searched us, and found nothing on me; he found this knife on Anderson; I was not with Anderson the night before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Anderson's Defence.</hi> At 6 o'clock, on Wednesday, I met White in North Devon-road; 1 said, "I want to look after some work; if you have a mind to come, come and call me by half past 5 o'clock;" he came next morning; I was going to Whitechapel, to work for a gentleman that I had been used to work for, and at the top of Regent-street the policeman stopped us, and took us to the station.</p>

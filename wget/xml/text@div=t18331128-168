About six weeks ago we missed some of an inferior quality, which had been manufactured two or three months before - a few days ago I went to Mr. Walker's Wheeler-street, Spitalfields, and found some annatto, not of the description we missed, but some which I knew was ours; I purchased some, and got an officer who took Walker - we stamp all our annatto; my father's name was Matthew, the stamp has never been altered.</p>

            . I am an agent, and live in Turk-street, Bethnal-green; I deal with dry-salters and others. I received this annatto from the prisoner, and sold it to Mr. Walker - I cannot recollect the day I had it, but it was in September: I hawked it about town for a fortnight, and no one would buy it on account of its having no maker's name on it - I am not a hawker; I go round<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280122"></xptr>with samples - I gave the prisoner 10d. a pound for it, and sold it for 1s. - I did not buy it on my own account; I told the prisoner when I sold it, and got the 2d. in the pound for commission.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether you bought it or got it to sell, was it not in the early part of September? A. I really cannot tell the day; I had known the prisoner and his father before - there was no concealment in this transactian; I know no harm of the prisoner or any of the family.</p>

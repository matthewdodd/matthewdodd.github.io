            . On Sunday the prisoner beat his wife, and on the Monday morning, I went in and asked her how she did; she said she was very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell what she told you, but any observations you made yourself is evidence - A. I saw she had a violent blow on her breast, it looked to me to be very bad. She shewed me a bruise on her arm, and a bruise on her thigh; she appeared very poorly. This was on the Monday. I saw her on Tuesday morning in bed. She died on the Wednesday morning. I asked her on Tuesday morning, what sort of a night she had; she said very bad. I asked her now her pain was in her breast; she then said she had got her fatal bane.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you understand by that - A. That she had got her blow very bad.</p>

            . Q.You are a surgeon and apothecary - A. Yes, I was sent for, on Monday the 20th of July, between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find her - A. She was sitting in a chair, conversing with two women in her own room. She got up and told me her name was Heath, and that her husband had used her very. She shewed me the bruises; there was one on the left breast, one on the arm, and one on the lower part of the loins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you upon examination of these bruises, that they were likely to produce her death - A. No. I bled her that evening, and saw her the following day. On the next day she was up, and doing her domestic work. I did not see her after that. She died on the Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her on the Tuesday, was there any thing about her that indicated a speedy dissolution - A. No indication of danger on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, if you had thought there was any danger, you would have visited her again - A. Certainly, I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not visit her until you heard of her death - A. No, I saw her on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her opened - A. No, Sir, that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Had you an opportunity of knowing whether she was in liquor - A. When I visited her she was not; neither the first or second time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the surgeon who opened her - A. Mr. Spry, Sir.</p>
               <p>MR. SPRY. Q. Had you seen the deceased, Mrs. Heath, before she died - A. I had not. I saw her on the Thursday. I examined her; there were no outward marks sufficient to produce her death. I opened the body; I found within the ventricle of the brain a quantity of serum.</p>
               <p>Q. In an healthy subject, Sir, that would not have been the case - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment was that sufficient cause to produce death - A Quite sufficient.</p>
               <p>Q.If you could by any possibility know that any such cause existed, you would be certain that death would follow - A. Certainly there were several marks of violence on her body, on her left breast, but of no importance. I examined the body very carefully; I found no cause of death, but what I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. You can say that these outward marks of violence did not produce any effect to cause her death - A. They certainly did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The effusion of blood upon the brain could not have been produced by any of this violence - A. Certainly not, we should have had other appearances.</p>

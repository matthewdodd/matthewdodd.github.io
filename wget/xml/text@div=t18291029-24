The prisoner came on the 20th of October, and said his name was Phillips, he was organist of Greenwich, and he wanted to hire a guitar for three hours; I said I could not let him have it, as Mr. Rathmaker was not in the way- he stood some time, and asked for a glass of water; I got him one - he drank it, and asked for another; I got that, and he asked for a third - when I got that he was gone, and the guitar he had been looking at; I ran out and gave an alarm - he returned with the guitar, and went into the next shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DUNN. Q. Had he not more time to run away the first time you went for the water, than afterwards? A. Yes, as I had to get the glass ready; there was no other person in the shop - when he came back with the guitar he said he had gone after a friend; I thought he was a singular character when I saw him in the shop.</p>

            . I am one of the new Police. On the 20th of October I saw the prisoner at the top of Oxford-street, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's - he had a guitar in his hand; a little boy gave me information - I went to the prosecutor, and found the prisoner in the next shop with the guitar; he said he only took it to run after a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him returned with it? A. Yes, but when I first saw him he was going from the house - he must have gone round to have returned.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

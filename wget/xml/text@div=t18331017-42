             (police-constable T 138). On the 8th of September I fell in with the prisoner Healey in Praed-street, about eight o'clock in the evening; I followed him three hundred yards; I then stopped him - I found this tea tray under his arm - I asked where he brought it from? he said from No. 12, Cambridge-terrace - while I was talking to him, his wife came up, and said,"Give him the bundle, and let him go" - I took him to the station - he there said, if I would go to No. 12, <placeName id="t18331017-42-crimeloc236">Cambridge-terrace</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did he not say he had had it from Mary Devereux? A. Yes, and that turned out to be correct - I did not find anything on him, nor at his lodging.</p>

            . I live with my mother, her name is Mary. Devereux was her <rs id="t18331017-42-viclabel237" type="occupation">cook</rs> - she came on the first week in June - this tea tray was taken from a press in the kitchen, and these other things from the wardrobe in the back kitchen, where she slept, which was broken open - when the officer came she said some person wanted to speak to me; I came down, and saw the officer - I was frightened, and desired Devereux to remain there, but she went down stairs - my mother then came down, and we went into the parlour, and I heard a noise in the kitchen; we then found that Devereux was gone off without her bonnet or shawl; she was out all night, and came back the next morning, and I let her in myself - I had seen the prisoner Healey about there in the landlord's employ, but I never saw him in our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he is a bricklayer? A. Yes, in the employ of Mr. Pounsford our landlord.</p>
               <p>Devereux. This bit of calico was given to me by Miss Miles. Witness. It is almost impossible to swear to calico; but I did not give her this book, nor this tea tray, I can swear to that, it was brought from India by my brother.</p>
               <p>Devereux. I took the tray to pawn as I had not sufficient to live on; I had pawned the last article of my clothes before I took it. Witness. She never wanted for any thing in our house; we were about to part with her as she was much more expensive than we wished.</p>
               <p>Healey's Defence. This girl told me she was going to leave her place and asked me to take her box for her, I called at eight o'clock in the evening for it, she said the box was not ready; but she told me to take these other things, the officer stopped me and I told him I did know what I had got, but I would take him to the person I had it from.</p>

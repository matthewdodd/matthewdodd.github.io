             rubbed down my horse, and was very particular in having the outward gate made fast; he said to Batch, that he would go down and see it made fast; the stable is connected with my house, there is no back door, upon his return to the best of my recollection, I bolted the outward door, the front door, the horse goes thro' the house, and thro' the kitchen to go into the stable; the prisoner and Batch went up to bed, I looked in the counting-house, and saw every thing safe, and followed soon after, to my own room, one pair, over the compting-house; the dog went with me, who generally slept at my room door; in about half an hour, before I put out my light, I was disturbed by my dog falling down stairs; I went down within six-stairs of the bottom, and saw the dog lay in great agony, at the foot of the stairs, he was a sort of New-foundland-dog, as tall as I am, when on his hind legs; I called to the dog, he appeared to be very ill, and lay on his side; I went back to my own room, and the dog soon after struggled up stairs to his place, I opened my door and saw the dog in great agony, then I heard him quiet, and put out my light; I heard no more till the morning; I went down between six and seven in the morning, and the first thing I saw, was my dog dead at the door, I found the lock of my counting-house door strained, and at the bottom of the door, I picked up this small iron; I perceived the beaufet door in the kitchen, a very little way open and the key in it, my plate had been kept there about thirty-six years; it was all gone, I immediately went out into the yard, and proclaimed this; I went into an empty house, which has a window that any person might get through, which opens into my yard; and in that house, I found this chisel, this window bolt, this dark lanthorn on the floor, and this tinder-box, and the ebony handle of a silver tea-pot, which had been lost; I observed the door of my house, the compting-house door was behind my street-door, and was a kind of secret door, that few people knew; it had not been broke open, but there is the mark of an instrument on it; there was no mark of violence on the street door, or any other door; having a number of young people, creditable men's sons, apprentices, I did not know what to think; I had them watched, and the prisoner in particular: I was before the magistrate, he asked him what he knew concerning the robbery.</p>
               <p>Were any promises made use of? - None by me, nor by any person before me.</p>
               <p>By the Magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090034"></xptr>Any threats? - Far from it, none in the least before me; I saw the justice sign it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You have I believe five apprentices, who all sleep in the same room? - I believe there are six or seven, seven of them sleep in the room besides him.</p>
               <p>How long had you been retired to your room, before you heard the dog? - About half an hour, I was just got into bed, but had not put out my light.</p>
               <p>I believe on the 14th, you had some magistrates at your house? - No; peace officers, from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Were your several apprentices examined at that time? - They were.</p>

             the 18th the prisoner continued in your service? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the time he was apprehended? - I was, he was taken by Shakeshaft, Armstrong, and Harper; in my presence, and of Steward, he was taken on the other side Tower-hill, I do not know the identical spot in the street.</p>
               <p>I believe at first the officer collared him, and used him a little roughly? - Not in the least, I believe they said no otherwise than this to him, they went up to him, and before they spoke to him, he was going on in a wild station, and when he saw them, he could not stir.</p>
               <p>And upon that I believe you said, do not collar him, I do not wish to hurt him? - Upon my word I cannot tell what I said, I was very much confused.</p>
               <p>This young man was kept in custody from the 18th till the 20th? - The 19th was Sunday.</p>
               <p>What time was he taken into custody? - I think between nine and ten in the evening.</p>
               <p>What time on the 20th was he carried before the magistrate? - I did not go down there till about twelve.</p>
               <p>In whose custody was he kept during all that time? - These three people that took him, he was kept in the watch-house all the time.</p>
               <p>Did you overhear all the conversation that passed between Armstrong and the prisoner, in the way from the place where he was apprehended to the place where he was taken to? - Yes, I believe I was not further behind, than I am from you.</p>
               <p>I can very easily believe that you made no promises; did not Armstrong or Shakeshaft, or Harper; but particularly Armstrong, did not he use a great deal of persuasion to this young man, to induce him to confess? - I should think Mr. Armstrong had better answer for himself.</p>
               <p>Sir, you will condescend to let me manage the defence of this young man in my own way? - You seem to know about it, you had better explain.</p>
               <p>That is very gross and abominable and infamous conduct in a prosecutor; I ask you, and do not tell me again that I had better explain; upon your oath, Sir, what did Armstrong say, and repeat it as nearly as you can? - What Armstrong said to him, was first regarding the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider, you are prosecuting a young man for his life? - My lord I know it; and I am as partial to the prisoner as any man in the court.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider your situation; you come here as a prosecutor; if the counsel should ask you a question that is not proper, I shall find it my duty to stop him; but you are not competent to judge of the propriety of the question? - He said where the prisoner had been that night; what he had done; and the different places he had stopped at; what he had left regarding to his boots and other things, as near as I can possibly recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to be understood that Armstrong held no conversation with the prisoner respecting the circumstances of the robbery? - Do you think that, when I made an application to the peace officers; I did not tell them the nature of the thing in which I was robbed.</p>
               <p>I ask you this, Sir; not what you told the peace officer; I ask you not what you said to any body; but whether Armstrong said any thing to the prisoner respecting the concern he was supposed to have respecting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090035"></xptr>the robbery of your house? - I cannot give any answer to that.</p>
               <p>Flourish apart; and God knows when a man's life is at stake, that is not the time for flourish; did Armstrong, or did he not, say anything to the prisoner at the bar, after he had him in custody, with respect to his supposed share in the robbery? - Not to my knowledge, he did not.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say he did not, as far as you recollect! - I will.</p>
               <p>Nothing of any sort? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Then Armstrong did not say in your presence, for God's sake! tell me all that you know of this affair, that innocent persons may not be suspected? - To my knowledge he did not.</p>
               <p>He did not desire him to say that he had let in two men to rob your house; and that if he did say so, they wanted to get at those two men, and they would set him at liberty? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Nobody ever said in your hearing, that he should have his liberty on any terms? - No such thing in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Was not he told that he had better tell the whole truth? - I believe Armstrong said this; what ever you have to tell, tell it; but nothing further, neither better nor worse; that was in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Did not he say that it would be as well for him; or that it would be better for him; for that there were other apprentices that might be suspected: did not he entice him in short, to take this guilt upon himself? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>After you were at the watch-house, were you and the prisoner alone in the room? - Never till after his examination, which he signed.</p>
               <p>Am I to collect from you; that speaking now, seriously and solemnly; taxing your recollection, nothing was said to him to induce him to confess? - No one individual thing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Does your knowledge afford a certainty of it? - In my hearing they never did.</p>
               <p>Did you never authorise any body to do so? - Never; I gave gave a strict charge to any of my people, never to go near him.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with a brother of his,

               <p>There again it is better for you not to judge: do you mean to swear that you have not had any conversation with that brother about this business? - I believe I spoke to him on the Sunday, to tell him the circumstances his brother then was in; and I likewise spoke to him, that he might have his clothes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell that brother that there had been promises of forgiveness made to this young man, before he made the confession; and that until these promises, he had absolutely denied his guilt? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand you, that you never made use of any expressions to that effect, or of that import to the brother? - Nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Did you say anything to the brother about his confession at all? - Upon my word I cannot say, if it was after the Monday I spoke to him concerning his confession.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that this young man on the day after the robbery, and afterwards, had denied he knew anything about it; but that upon some promise being made to him, he confessed his guilt? - Never, nor anything relating to the kind.</p>
               <p>Did you never say to the brother, that you would not hurt the prisoner, as he had confessed it? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>How long had this young man lived with you? - As near as I can recollect, I think he came the latter end of last October.</p>
               <p>I observed you said, that to the best of your knowledge, you fastened the door when you came in? - I swear positively that that door was fastened when my dog lay against it; I can swear to the best of my recollection, that six nights out of the seven, I fastened it myself.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090036"></xptr>And therefore, as it was your general habit, you conclude that you did it that night? - I do.</p>

               <p>Will you say with certainty, that that night you fastened the house door? - I will; it has two bolts; I saw them fast when I came down to the dog.</p>
               <p>In the morning, how was the outer door found? - With the bars properly fastened up; I have two house doors, and they both open into the front yard.</p>

               <p>You did not see anybody shut the outward door that goes into the street? - The prisoner went out twice to shut it; it was my business to shut it, and I usually did it; I mean the large door, leading out of the yard into the street; that door was found fastened in the morning; we have two house doors; I fastened one of the outward doors, but not that which you are speaking of.</p>
               <p>That door which had something happened to it in the course of the night, you do not know whether it was fast or not? - I do not; we went to sleep pretty near at one time; I heard no alarm nor disturbance till the morning; the prisoner slept on the other side of the room, five or six feet asunder.</p>
               <p>Court. I find you went to bed before your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner go up with you? - I do not rightly know; I recollect he did come up that night, and he was in bed in the morning.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to the prosecutor; I was the first person that got up in the morning; I got up about seven; the first thing I perceived, there was a door at the bottom of the stairs which was fastened on the outside, that I could not open it the first time I pushed against it; that door is always open of a night; I got it open afterwards; there was a chair set against it, and a spit in it, with the point against the pannel of the door, to keep it fast; I forced it open; the next thing I observed, was the door that was usually shut, which went into the court, was open.</p>
               <p>Was that the door where the dog laid? - Yes</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was the door I found the dog at; I slept in the apprentice's room; I was not awakened when Patch came to bed; I was the first up; the prisoner was in bed when I got up; I heard no disturbance in the course of the night.</p>

               <p>I am sister to the prosecutor; the night before the robbery, the plate was in a small closet in the kitchen; there were the things in the indictment (repeats them): I saw them all safe over night; I locked the closet, and put the key under a tea-urn, close to the closet, on the dresser; it was covered with a green cloth.</p>
               <p>Can you tell the value of all this? - I cannot tell the value; I imagine there was one hundred and forty, or one hundred and fifty ounces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prosecutor is a very considerable jeweller? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was only the plate that you used in your family, that you lost? - No.</p>
               <p>There was a large property in the house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now, were there any promises or any threats made to him by you, or by any body else, in your hearing, to induce him to confess? - No, Sir, not in my hearing, not any.</p>
               <p>When he came before the magistrate, he was examined? - He signed something; I witnessed it; I saw the justice sign it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you hear what passed between Armstrong, the thief-taker, and the prisoner, as they went along? - It was impossible for any of the officers to say anything to him, as they went along, without Mr. Berkenhead and me hearing of it, I think.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Armstrong telling him for God's sake, to tell all that he knew about this affair? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation at all between the prisoner and Armstrong? - All of them spoke to him at times; Armstrong said this is the man; there were several things passed that I cannot charge my memory with now.</p>
               <p>These are just the things, that with as little flourish as you please, I should wish to hear? - You shall have them, without any flourish at all.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell him, that he should very soon have his liberty, but that he must go before the justice, and tell all he knew? - By no means, I never heard that said.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any promise, any threat or any thing that could put him off his guard and induce him to confess this offence? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Is that your hand writing? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am brother to this unfortunate lad.</p>
               <p>After your brother was taken into custody, did you see his master at all? - On the Sunday, as he was taken on the Saturday night, the prosecutor came to our house, I was at the next door, having my hair tied, he enquired for Mr. Clarke's, he said he wanted his son, says he, you are not the person; the prosecutor laid hold of my arm, says he my name is Berkenhead, your brother is apprentice to me, and I took him up last night for robbing of me, but says he, I promise not to hurt him, if he will confess; and desired me, by no means, to let my father or mother know it, for he meant to give him his liberty the next morning, Monday morning; he desired me, particularly, when he left me, not to let them know it, because it would occasion them a great deal of uneasiness, and he intended him to have his liberty on Monday morning, and he would not hurt him; he said if he did not confess, he would certainly be hung; I was sent for to Shoreditch watch-house, and I went to my brother, and I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090039"></xptr>what Mr. Berkenhead said to me, and he told me, that Mr. Berkenhead had promised him the same, and the officers, that it would be best, he declared to me that he knew nothing of it; I told him as Mr. Berkenhead had given his word to have his liberty, to say whatever his master would with him to say; that was on the Sunday, and on the Monday he made this confession; nobody was in the shop, but the hairdresser and me, his name is Ewington, I did not know he had heard any thing of the affair till I came in again, and he said that gentleman has been robbed; I said, yes, he has; and he said he does not mean to hurt the person if he will confess; I said no, and let the conversation drop; I found the hair-dresser listened.</p>
               <p>And you swear positively that on the Sunday you told your brother what Mr. Berkenhead had said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What day of the month was this? - On Sunday, I cannot recollect the day of the month, it was about one, I went to my brother in the evening, not before; I was not there again in the morning on the Monday; I was at work in a hurry; I supposed by Mr. Berkenhead making that promise, that he meant to perform the promise; when he was fully committed to Newgate, I went then, when Mr. Berkenhead came and told me, I suppose it might be him; nobody was with Mr. Berkenhead, and this conversation was at the door of the shop of the hair dresser, close to our door; it is in Jewin-street, the hair-dresser had nobody in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. You have heard what this witness has sworn, is that she brother you alluded to when I examined you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it true that you went to him at the hair-dresser's? - I called on him at the hairdresser's and asked him where his brother in law, Mr. Franklin, lived.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Franklin? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any part of his family except that brother on the Sunday? - No.</p>
               <p>Did that conversation which he has now stated, pass between you? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you go there for? - Why I wanted to see his brother in law, as it was through him I had the prisoner, he told me he lived in St. Paul's-church-yard, I told him, I supposed he could not be ignorant I had been robbed; he said no, that his brother had been home, and told him that they had all been examined; I told him then, that his brother was in custody, but where, or any thing further, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him not to let his father and mother know of it? - Why I believe I did, not, till I had seen Franklin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If the boy was to be indicted for a capital offence, the sooner his father and mother knew of it the better; if he was to be set at liberty, it was not worth while to trouble their old age; why did you mention that, unless the young man was the next day, to be restored to his liberty? I can conceive that it is humane, it is kind, it is benevolent not to tell them; but if at the distance of a month, their son is to be hanged, the sooner they knew of it, the better; upon your oath, did not you tell the brother, and recollect that this poor boy's life, depends now upon your recollection; did you tell Franklin so? - Upon my oath I did not, nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath did not the boy's brother understand, the boy was not to be committed? - Upon my oath I never understood it myself, nor said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that he was to go before the magistrate to-morrow? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him he was to go to make confession? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, and to take the risk of it; you are but a young man, you may have many days to live, do you mean to take upon yourself to say that you did not convey to this near relation of his the idea, that the next day he was to be discharged? - On my oath I never did.</p>
               <p>Very well! it is your business, thank God! not mine; I defy human ingenuity to point out a reason, except a barbarous one, for the caution, unless he was to be discharged.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Franklin about it, on Sunday? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Then your only purpose in going, was to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090040"></xptr>find Franklin, and to have some conversation with him, and after that you did not see Franklin? - I went home, and from thence went into the country.</p>
               <p>When did you next meet Franklin? - Not till Monday.</p>
               <p>Not till after the lad was committed? - I believe before.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was before? - Yes, Sir, I will.</p>
               <p>Did Franklin attend before the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>So then neither Franklin, nor the brother, nor the father, nor the mother, nor any of the relations attended before the magistrate; now can you help us to a reason, can you help us to a conjecture about it, why this young man was to be deserted in his distress, unless you was to be his protector.</p>

             asked the gentleman whether he should send his sister to shew where his brother in law lived; the gentleman refused letting the girl go; he asked him in door, but the gentleman refused; the gentleman told him the lad should come home on Monday morning; and desired Francis not to take any notice to his father and mother concerning the matter; they were about five minutes together; I was listening at the shop door, with my head half in the entry, and half in the shop; when Clarke came in, he sat down; I put the cloth about him; says I, that gentleman has been robbed, by what I hear? and he made answer to me, yes, in a slight indifferent manner, as if it was of no consequence to me; I said, I heard the gentleman say he had promised the person he would forgive him, if he would confess; nothing further ensued between us; Clarke dropped the conversation; a fortnight after, we were in a publick-house, drinking a pot of beer; then he related the circumstance to me concerning this affair; I had heard before that his brother was in custody; but I never took any notice to him, till he did to me.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that you heard any conversation about forgiveness, and about confession? - I did, upon my honour.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Upon my oath.</p>
               <p>And about the return of somebody to the house on the Monday morning? - On the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then it is your custom to listen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Francis and you are pretty well acquainted, I take it? - Very little acquainted; no otherwise than he dresses with me; and I use him as a customer.</p>
               <p>He lives next door to you? - He does so; we are but very lately acquainted; I have not known him above two months.</p>
               <p>He did not say the person had confessed? - No; he said if they would confess.</p>
               <p>Did he desire him to use his interest with the young man? - No; I understood he was to be at home at Mr. Clarke's house.</p>
               <p>Then, when he came into the shop again, you did not know it was his brother? - No, Sir, nor for a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Why was it to be at Mr. Clarke's house, if you did not know it was Clarke's brother? - I never saw young Clarke in my life; I collected that he would be at home on the Monday; I understood at Mr. Clarke's house, but I could not justly tell; I cannot positively say it must be at Mr. Clarke's house.</p>

               <p>Did not you collect it from the conversation at the time; by hearing that he would be at home on Monday, at his father and mother's house? - I heard him say the person should be at home on the Monday, at the next door, to the father and mother's; and desired him not to take any notice to the father and mother; I understood that he should be at home at his father's.</p>
               <p>Who did you understand that father to be at the time? - Mr. Clarke himself, I supposed; I did not know that this was the son of Mr. Clarke, because I never saw the son in my life; I judged within myself, that he was to be at home at Mr. Clarke's house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was one of those who thought (I do not know what my learned friend thinks) that it was just as delicate, to mention it at a distance, as to say your brother is taken up for theft? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You imagined that it must be about the father and mother at the next door? - I did so.</p>
               <p>When did you hear from any of the neighbours, that there was a suspicion on this young man? - About four or five weeks ago.</p>

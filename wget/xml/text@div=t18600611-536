                  </hi>. I am comptroller and secretary to the savings-bank in St. Martin's-place—I produce a deposit account from which it appears that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was deposited in our savings-bank in April, 1843, in the name of Joseph Henry Manley, a minor—according to the course of business, if any<lb></lb>body comes to receive interest or principal, it is necessary that he should he identified—in the case of a minor, when an account is opened we take the signature of the parent or guardian, who is always required to identify the parties when they come to take out the money; whether it be principal or interest—on 2d June I saw both the prisoners at my office—the female prisoner said she came to withdraw the interest on the account—it amounted to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I inquired of her whether the male prisoner was her son, she said he was—as he did not appear to be a minor, I inquired what his age was—he said it was either 23 or 24; I forget which—I said in that case he would be master of his own account, and I struck out the word "minor"—the female said she did not want to take the principal, only the interest—I then sent them into the other office to the chief cashier, to receive the money, and to make his signature in our books, in order that we might not have to refer to the mother oil any future occasion—the last time any interest was paid upon this account was on 4th December, 1854—the female prisoner had originally placed the money in the name of her son—there were six children, and she brought all the six children to put in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—it was money standing in the name of her husband, and she took out administration to his effects, and received 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing of the male prisoner, we relied entirely on the female to identify him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief cashier of the savings-bank in St. Martin's-place—On the morning of 2d June the two prisoners were brought into my office by Mr. Boodle—the name of Joseph Henry Manley was called out by me, and the male prisoner answered—I wrote this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and laid it before the prisoner—I told him to write his name on this line, and he signed it, "Jophis Henry Manley"—seeing that he had spelt the name wrongly I asked him to sign his name again, which he did, spelling both "Joseph" and "Henry" wrong—the female prisoner was alongside of himall that time—a conversation then took place between the prisoners—one of them said that on the last occasion of a re-payment the male prisoner signed his name, and the other said he did not, but which said which I cannot say—the female prisoner then said that the re-payment was made at a certain part of the office where I was quite certain it was not, from our regulations—I then requested them to go into Mr. Boodle's private office, and told him I thought we had not the right man in this case—he requested the female to leave the room, and then asked the male prisoner if he was the son of the female prisoner—he said, "Oh! it is all right; it isthe woman's money; I have done it before."</p>

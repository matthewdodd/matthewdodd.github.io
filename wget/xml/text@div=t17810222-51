            . The prisoner has worked for me a year and half. On Saturday the 20th of January, at about a quarter after ten o'clock, my apprentice went down into the cellar to draw some beer; he returned very much frightened, and said there was a person in the house. I took a candle and went down and found the prisoner in the cellar. I brought him up; he appeared to be very much in liquor; he said he had got intoxicated, and fell asleep, and had never been out of the dye-house. I believed so at the time. There are utensils which are used in the dye-house in the cellar. I let him go, but one of my apprentices said he thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220071"></xptr> he had some silk about him, and they went after him and brought him back, and found some silk in the alley, and brought it in; then the prisoner owned the fact. He said it was the first time he had been guilty of such an offence, and begged I would let him go to sea. I told him if he would inform me who was the receiver I would do every thing I could to serve him.</p>
               <p>(The silk was produced in court and deposed by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Crocker. I went down into the cellar, about a quarter after ten o'clock, to draw some beer, and saw the prisoner run by the stair-foot into the cellar. I ran up and told my master. After he was gone out my fellow-apprentice said he thought he had some silk; and we went after him. I saw him secure the prisoner, and pick up the silk in the alley which the prisoner had gone through. He was brought in and I fetched a constable.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Crocker. I followed the prisoner and told him my master wanted him, and he came back with me into the dye-house, and stripped himself. My fellow-apprentice and I took a candle and went up the alley, and found the silk and brought it back.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I got in liquor; I went down to the necessary and fell asleep. My master came down and found me there. I did not take any silk; it is possible lying asleep some might stick to my clothes or buttons of my coat. Such a thing has happened. I never confessed taking it.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Ralph Wilcoxon, a boot and shoemaker in King William-street, London-bridge. We had these two pairs of boots safe on Tuesday morning last, and about one o'clock I missed them.</p>

I took back the boots to Mr. Wilcoxon's—the prisoner brought them, and we suspected he had not got them right, because we knew he had not the money—I watched on the Monday morning, and he got the other pair—I was afraid to say any thing, and before we overtook him he had pawned them—we got the tickets, and got them out, and took them back—I gave a caution to the pawnbroker, and he stopped them—we do not consider he has been in his right mind these two years, since he was raving mad, and had a strait jacket on—he works as a fellowship-porter—he served his time to Mr. Sims—we have not been able to sleep safely this last fort<lb></lb>night from his deranged talk—he said he had got a great estate from an uncle, who had died and left him a large shoe-shop, and these were all his property left him by a brother of his grandfather at Leeds, and he was to buy a horse and cart, and put us all into business—he was not at all given to</p>

As I was coming from my work I met a man with a bundle under his arm; he asked me to go in and have a pint of beer; when we were in the publick house, he asked me if I knew any pawnbrokers; I said I knew pawnbrokers to my sorrow, for I had been ill, and obliged to make use of them at times. He asked me to take these things, and get a guinea and an half upon them, if I could. I asked him if they were his property, and he came honestly by them; he said he did. I got a guinea and an half on them, and gave him the money. I met him again in the morning, he said he was under an arrest, and asked me to go and try to get some more money on them.</p>

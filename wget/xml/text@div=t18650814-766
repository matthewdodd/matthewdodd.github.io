                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Italian Benevolent Society—I know the prisoner and have seen him write—this letter marked "A" is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">The letter being translated by the. interpreter was dated London, 24th May, to Count Maffei, stating that the Italian Society did not care for his letters, and calling them "monecchi" or mountaineers; that as an Italian he was entitled to help from the Society, his daughter having died for want of the necessaries of life, it concluded thus</hi>: "My blood and the blood of my daughter who is so inhumanly dead, blood for blood. If this letter shall not have the desired effect I will go myself to the Society and vindicate the blood of my daughter. I have sworn to do myself justice; blood for blood. To die on the scaffold is bad, and to die for want of the common neces<lb></lb>saries of life, to die of hunger is worse, of the two deaths I have chosen the mildest, hoping that the Italian Legation will do me justice—I am with all respect to yourself.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I took that letter to Count Maffei myself I asked him to send him to the Italian ambassador and asked him to do me justice; my wife and children were in bed many weeks and one of my children died. I applied to the Italian Society for assistance but they sent me away. I used the word "monechi," which is only the same as calling a London man a cockney, I meant to say that the blood of my child was the blood of my blood and the flesh of my flesh, I had no bad intention, and I wrote it very quick, it is in Italian and it sounds different in English, it is, in fact, only an application for assistance I said that I would rather die hanging than starving, but I had no intention to do anything. I addressed it to the president himself, not to any member.</p>

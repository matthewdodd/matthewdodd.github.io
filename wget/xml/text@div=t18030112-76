               <p>Q. Did you miss a Bank-note at any time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received a letter containing any Bank-notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day? - A. I came to town on Saturday evening, the 1st of January, and found several letters on the table, but was so very ill, that I went to bed immediately, and remained there till six o'clock the next day. On Sunday evening, I sent for the letters, and opened them; one of them contained five notes to the amount of forty-five pounds; four of them were ten-pound Bedford bank-notes, and a five-pound Bank of England note; I put the notes into the letter again, and left them in my bed-room on the table. Next day, I had not been below above three quarters of an hour to attend my physician, Sir Walter Farquhar, when I went up stairs again, and went to bed, having previously put the letters into the drawer of my secrefaire, but did not lock it. On the following morning, when I examined the letter, I found the five pound-note missing; upon which I sent for my valet, and told him the circumstance, commanding him to go to the different trades people I employed, and tell them, that if any servant of mine came with a five poundnote to change, to stop the person and the note. About two o'clock the next day, my servant, James Neale, brought me the five pound-note, saying, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120046"></xptr>baker had brought it, having stopped it on one of my servants, naming the prisoner; I then taxed the prisoner with it, and be acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you make him any promise or threat? - A. No; he fell down on his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him? - A. I asked him why he had robbed me of my money, and taken such an advantage when I was so dangerously ill. I then sent for a constable, and gave him in charge. I delivered the note to a serjeant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken any particular notice of the note before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you can give no particular description of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was the prisoner? - A. My livery-servant, and had been one of my soldiers in the 76th regiment. He had not been with me a month as my servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice of Benjamin Jones, a linen-draper, in the City-road. On the evening of the 28th of May the prisoner came into Mr. Jones's shop, to look at some caps, and some were shown her—she then requested to look at one in the window—the young man pulled one out, and she requested to look at another—he had left fonr caps on the counter, and while his back was tamed to go to the window, she took one up, and put it under her shawl—I went round, and looked her in the face—she was very much agitated, and Mr. Jones came in—I went and told him—she purchased goods, but I cannot recollect the amount—she put down the money, leaving the shop—Mr. Jones followed, and brought her back.</p>

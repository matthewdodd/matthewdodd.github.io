The prisoner was in my service for two days, and on the 30th of October, about ten or eleven o'clock, I sent him to the stamp-office, to purchase stamps, and gave him five sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and a shilling, to pay for them; he did not return - he had given me no reason to suppose he was going to leave: I informed the officer of our ward, who brought him to me in about a fortnight - he neither brought me back the stamps or money: I took him, having a good character of him from his father, who lives in our neighbourhood, and bears a very good character.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 12th of November, having been informed by Mr. Barlow that he had taken this money - his father lived in a court in Cannon-street; I looked after him at several places, and found him about nine o'clock on Friday night, in one of the land-arches of New London-bridge; I took him to Mr. Barlow, who gave him in charge - I did not hold out either threat or promise to him; he said he had been stopped in the Strand by a Police-officer, who put him into a hackney-coach, took the money from him, and left him - he did not say who the officer was; I found no money on him.</p>

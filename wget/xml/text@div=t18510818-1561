                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bennett. On 12th Aug. I was in the Coach and Horses, at Harlington, between 10 and 12 o'clock in the evening—the prisoners came in, and the woman sat down close by me—I should say they staid an hour, or an hour and a half—they both left toge<lb></lb>ther—I left about ten minutes after—when I was ready to go I missed my shawl—I had it when I went there—my husband was outside—I saw my shawl again in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, when the sergeant had it—this is it—it is mine—I had been having a drop, but I was sober enough to know what I was doing—I am sure of that.</p>

I was sitting outside the public-house—I was drinking with a gentleman's gardener—I had come there to meet my wife—I saw the' two prisoners leave the house—I had a suspicion—I went in and asked my wife if she missed her shawl—I had seen her with it when I first went into the house hanging loose on her shoulders, and when I went to make the inquiry the shawl was gone—this is it—it is the one she had had—I spoke to the policeman about it.</p>

            . On the 3d of December last, I went into Mrs. Simpson's for a porter, the prisoner followed me, I gave her the cloth, and a card where I live at Hackney. I asked her whether she could read, she said she could not, but she would ask, she should be sure to find it. I then walked on briskly when I got to the bottom of Wood-street, I turned round and saw her coming, I then walked on supposing she would follow me and bring the cloth. After I got home and waiting near an hour, I felt uneasy about my property, I returned back to Mrs. Simpson's in Noble-street and enquired if she knew the prisoner; she said the prisoner was recommended to her by Mr. Triggey to serve her with butter and eggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the woman - A. I believe she is so far, if she is the person that followed me out of the public house, I will swear that she is the person that had my property.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TRIGGEY. I keep the Crown public-house, Water-street, Strand, the prisoner has been in the habit of serving my house with things for a twelvemonth past, she represented that she had a large family of children, I recommended her to Mrs. Simpson to sell her butter and eggs.</p>

            . I live in Noble-street, Foster-lane, I only know that the woman was recommended by Mr. Triggey. Mr. Self came in for a porter, there was none there; this woman offered to carry the parcel, she went out to carry the parcel for Mr. Self The prisoner's basket and eggs were left at my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford Will you venture to swear to the prisoner - A. I will venture to swear that the woman that came from Mr. Triggey is the woman. It was pretty near three weeks before I saw her again. I do not pretend to swear to her.</p>

               <p>on the stairs, and saw Pedro and several men in a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> before the bar—they were knocking him about—I heard them say he should pay for a broken glass—he swore in his own language that he would not pay it—he was trying to get away—some of the people caught him by the collar, and had struck him, and prevented his going—I saw the prisoner—he began to swear at Pedro—directly after this he got a staff in his hand, and struck Pedro two blows over the head with it, and then put the staff into the bar—in about two minutes he struck him again with it eight or ten blows—Pedro was trying to get out, but could not, as the men had him tight, some holding his arms, and some the collar of his coat—during the two minutes the prisoner was trying to clear the people out of the house, but could not, and took the staff again—I do not know whether he is a constable—I heard some people halloo out, "He has drawn a knife"—that was before the prisoner got the staff a second time—I cannot say whether the prosecutor had drawn his dagger, as the people were round him—I could only see his head and shoulders—I could not see whether Pedro struck the prisoner, or struck at him—Pedro was pushed out of doors—a policeman came directly—before Pedro was put out, his face was all over blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker. I was at the public-house when the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> took place, and saw Pedro there with a glass—the prisoner had part of a broken glass in his hand, and Pedro snatched at it—the prisoner asked him to pay for the glass he had broken, and then he could have it—he muttered something, but what I cannot say—after the prisoner asked him to pay for it, he made a rush to get the glass from the prisoner—he put his hand into his pocket, or somewhere else, and pulled out a large dagger, or knife—he bad a belt round him, and a red cap—he held the knife up in his right hand, in this manner—a German or Italian laid hold of him, and caught his arms, so that he should not injure anybody—the prisoner called out, "Bring me my staff," and when he got it he struck him once—I did not see him strike him more than once, for another man assisted Pedro, and they all went down together—the struggle continued—I cannot say whether the prisoner struck any more blows—there was a cry of "Police!"—the prisoner never used his staff till the knife was drawn and brandished towards him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing at the bar of the Brown Bear when the foreigners came down—the prisoner asked them to pay for a glass—they appeared to refuse—I could not understand what they said—they appeared to be very excited and angry, and made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the glass—Pedro was one of them—the prosecutor asked him again to pay for it—he put his hand to his right pocket, or side, as if going to take some money out, and drew a dagger or knife—I believe this one produced to be it—he swung it in his right hand over his head twice—it was not in a sheath—he went towards the prosecutor as if to stick him—a young man, I believe a German, caught his arm, and, while he was scuffling, another seized his arms behind—the prosecutor asked for his staff—that was the first time he had asked for it—he had not got it in his hand before that—I saw him strike Pedro once at the time he had the knife in his hand—he was brandishing it about, and seemed in great agita<lb></lb>tion—when the prosecutor struck him he fell, or was thrown down—there was a cry of "Police!" and Murder!"—I went away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had Pedro been ill-used by anybody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—he was only asked to pay for the glass: he immediately drew the dagger, and appeared as if he was going to stab the prosecutor—the men did not hold his arm till he made a rush at the prosecutor—it was while they were strug-gling that the prosecutor struck him—he was trying to stick them, or to get to the prosecutor, and the prosecutor struck him once, only once, that I could see.</p>

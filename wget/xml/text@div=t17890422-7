             came to me; and asked me if I would buy a pair of iron gates; I am a blacksmith; I live at Moleshead, in Surrey; he said, he had them to sell by weight; I told him I had heard of a pair of gates being lost; and I told him he had better go to the person that lost them; about three weeks after I saw White again, and I asked him, if he had said any thing to the gentlewoman about the gates; and he said, no; and I said I would go myself, and he agreed that we should inform her; and I was desired to buy the gates in order to know who had taken them; by the information of White we sent for Hutchinson to a Mr. Hopman's at Sunbury; he came; and White said to him, here is the man that I asked to buy the iron gates; he says, will you sell them now? Hutchinson said, yes; I asked him, what I should give him; and we agreed for 12 s. a hundred weight; and I was to go about nine in the evening in a boat, they laid near to the river, they were under ground covered with earth; we got the gates home to my house, and then I sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>I was drinking with the prisoner, and he told me he knew of a pair of iron gates; it was on the 2d of February; and he asked me to go to Edmonds's to see if he would buy them, he only said he knew of them; the prisoner is a basket-maker at Sunbury; I have known him about two years; I had never seen the gates before; I went with Edmonds.</p>
               <p>Hales. I saw the gates at Edmonds's; I am sure the gates are Mrs. Bowen's.</p>

               <p>I work for Mr. Groves, a basket-maker, and I used to work near to the river to get oziers for the baskets; and I saw them lying there, when I had been to ease myself; some time after White came to me, he had a bad leg; and he asked me to lend him half-a-guinea to get into the hospital; I told him, if he would sell those gates to Edmonds I would lend him some money.</p>
               <p>Court to White. Is that true? - No, my Lord, I am sure he would be the last person I should think of asking.</p>

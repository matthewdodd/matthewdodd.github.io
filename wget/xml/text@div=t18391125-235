                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Trafalgar-road, Greenwich. In September last I had two sheep at Maze-hill, in Vanburgh-fields, about a hundred yards from Mrs. Cousins's garden—I saw them safe on Sunday, the 22nd of September, about one o'clock, in the field—one was a white-faced sheep, and very dirty behind, the other was short-legged, and dark-brown faced—they were ewes, and Cheviot bred—they bad been turned into the field on the Friday before—I had bought them on the Monday before, (the 16th) at Smithfield, of Mr. Waugh—in consequence of what I heard, I went on Wednesday, the 25th, to the prisoner's house—I had previously sent my lad Bennett—I asked the prisoner if he had fetched two sheep from Mrs. Cousins's garden—he said he had on Monday—I asked if he had killed them—he said he had killed them. on Monday—I asked him to let me see the skins—he said no, be would not allow me on the premises, the skins were gone—I told him my boy could prove the skins were on his premises that morning—I fetched the boy, and he took him into the yard, for the boy to show him where the skins were—the prisoner said he was a liar—I said I thought it was clear they were my sheep, and I would see what I could do—I went home, and gave information to Dorsett the policeman, and went with him to the prisoner's house when he was absent, but found no skins there.</p>

On Tuesday, the 24th of September, I went to Mrs. Cousins's house, and in consequence of what I was told there I came back to my master's, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I went to the prisoner's premises round the back way—I saw two sheepskins lying on some faggots—I believe the woolly part was down—I could not see much of them—I saw the skins again on Wednesday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, in the same place—I went back and told my master, and then went to the prisoner's—I asked if he had two strange sheep—if be had fetched two from Mrs. Cousins's—he said he bad fetched two from Mrs. Cousins's, but they were his own—I asked him to let me look at the two skins on the faggots—he said no, he would see me d—d first—I went and told my master, who went down and then came up and fetched me—the prisoner said, "Perhaps you can show me where the skins were lying?"—I said, "Certainly I could"—I went and showed him the place, and Mrs. Waterhouse came out and said it was a pity Mr. Couldery should keep such an abominable young liar as me.</p>

I may as well dismount and go with you," which he did, and went with me to the station-house—he said, going along, that he had fetched two sheep from Mrs. Cousins's garden—I said he was my prisoner, and whatever he stated to me I was bound to tell the Magistrate—he then said, "Three months ago I had five sheep, I killed three, and lost the re<lb></lb>maining two—the two I lost were wethers—having heard that two sheep were in Mrs. Cousin's garden, I went and looked at them, and found they were not mine—I came home, and had some conversation with my wife, and she said, 'For God's sake, have nothing to do with the sheep, you will get into trouble'—I said I would not—my wife soon afterwards went up stairs—I then put my horse to the cart, and went to Mrs. Cousins, fetched the sheep, brought them home, and put them into my slaughter-house—I had them there about ten minutes in the slaughter-house—I then turned them up—I found they were two ewes—knowing they could not be mine, I then opened the door leading into the street, shook my apron, and turned them out—no one saw me torn them out into the street, and my wife never knew that I brought them home"—he said, he believed them to be Mr. Couldery's sheep, but being on bad terms, he would not acquaint him of it—he said he had not killed a sheep on his premises for two months—I saw two sheep in his' shop on Wednesday, which ap<lb></lb>peared to have been killed within a day or two—I could not see any ap<lb></lb>pearance of sheep having been slaughtered there—they were two whole carcasses, without the heads, the legs were on—the prosecutor was with me at the time, and he said one of the legs appeared short legs, but I could not see any difference—the prisoner said he had bought two car<lb></lb>casses of mutton on the day previous the (Tuesday) in Whitechapel, and one of Mr. Co veil, of Broadway, Deptford, which was hanging in the shop with one of the two he bought in Whitechapel—I found several joints of mutton besides the two carcasses—I am positive he said he bought them on Tuesday.</p>

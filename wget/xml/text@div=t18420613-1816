                  </hi>. I live in St. Mary Axe—about eleven o'clock in the morning of the 19th of May, I was at the parade in St. James's park—there was a review by Prince Albert—at the moment the Prince went by I felt a pull at my cravat—I then looked, and the prisoner was by my side, and had his hands up—he had a dark handkerchief or cloth, and in that cloth was my diamond pin—I saw it in the cloth in his hands, that I swear—the pin was worth fifteen guineas—I said to him, "Where is my pin?"—he immediately threw it down, pointed to it, and said, "There it is, sir, I picked it up."</p>

I was with the prosecutor—there was a great rush with the mob—I saw the prisoner put his hand or arm over the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's shoulder, take out his pin and throw it on the ground—I heard him say, "There is your pin"—I do not think he could have taken it because it was loose, or to save it from falling, or any thing of that kind—he did not throw it down before my friend asked him where it was—I seized him.</p>

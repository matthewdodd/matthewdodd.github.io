On the night of the 21st of July I went with the prisoner to a house at the corner of <placeName id="t18300916-168-crimeloc865">Dean-street, Stafford-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18300916-168-crimeloc865" type="placeName" value="Dean-street, Stafford-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Are you a master tailor? A. No, a journeyman - I had never seen the prisoner before; I did speak to her about going to America - I did not promise her marriage; I asked her to take me to her lodging; she said she could not - we went to a house and had some brandy and water; I said, "I came from America" - she said, "I should like to go there;" I said, "I shall go there soon" - I had drank nearly a pint of ale after four o'clock, before I met her; I do not recollect having any thing else - I was not intoxicated; I was at home till about half-past eight; I then went to a public-house at the corner of Marylebone lane - there I and another drank two pints of ale: she had told me her address - she did not say, "I want some paper to curl my hair, and I will take this note;" when we went to her lodging she did not say, "I have your money, but I won't give it you yet" - I said, "Where is my money?" meaning the 5l. note and the money; she said, "I have not got your money, I have not taken it, and will go and bring my pocket to show I have not taken it;" she was not paying me the money when the officer came.</p>
               <p>LOT COX. I heard the prosecutor call Police! about six o'clock that morning - he said he had been robbed by a young woman he had been sleeping with all night in Dean-street, but he did not know the number; he said she was at No. 43, Upper York-street, Marylebone - I went and demanded admittance; Mr. Whitehead said there was such a person in his house, and he went and brought her down - she came within one or two steps of the bottom; the prosecutor asked her for his money - she said, "I have no money belonging to you, and took none;" she then told him to come up stairs - the landlord said, "No man should go up but the officer;" she then brought down a dark reticule, and handed me a 5l. note and a sovereign - she said she took it through a lark, and she had told the prosecutor where she lived; the prosecutor did say he believed she did not mean to steal it - he said had Mr. Whitehead let him in, he would not have called the officer.</p>

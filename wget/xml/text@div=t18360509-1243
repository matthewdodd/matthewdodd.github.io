On Mon<lb></lb>day morning the 2nd of May, in consequence of information, I went to Curnell's house, in a court leading out of Willow-walk, Old-street-road. On knocking at the door, and it not being immediately opened, I looked through the window, and saw a man getting over the paling at the back of his house—I then ran up a passage two or three doors from the house which led to the back of the house—I knocked at a door into which I supposed the man had gone, and there found the prisoner—he had top-boots on which the man had who got over the paling—Mr. Walton and another person had got in in the mean time—Mr. Walton was looking at the skins when I took the prisoner there, I asked him if they were the skins of the lambs he had taken to Newgate-market that morning—he said they were—Mr. Walton having identified two of the skins, I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner where he got them from—he told me that he was employed by a Mr. Day, living at No.3, Old-street-road—that was the first answer be made to the best of my recollection—I then took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. Last Monday-week, I was at the prisoner's house with him—I did not hear a knock at the door—he was in the room with me—the yard is about five feet square—the prisoner got over the pales, and I was the cause of it—Kentish the officer and Mr. Walton came to my employer, and inquired for Harry, the butcher)—I directed them to the prisoner, and ran down to see what was the matter—they went a round<lb></lb>about way—I got there, and asked, if there had been two persons from Newgate-market, he said, "No"—"I" opened the door and said, "Here they come; "I said, "I may get into trouble, I will go next door"—I went and while there, I called the prisoner over, and said "What is it"? he said "I don't know, I have killed some lambs and taken them to market for a man"—while we were talking, Kentish came in, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> I want you"—I did not know about the lambs then—the prisoner did get over, when I called him—I heard no knock, because I might have got over before the officer came.</p>

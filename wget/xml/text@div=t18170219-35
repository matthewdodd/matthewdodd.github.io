I turned my mare out on the common; she had a particular mark down her face - I turned her, and her foal, on the common on the 14th of January, and missed them on the 15th. I went towards London in search of them. I came to Smithfield on the Friday, and saw the prisoner coming up Hosier-lane on my mare. I was sure that it was my mare, and am sure the prisoner is the man - I think he knew me. I asked him whose mare it was, he said it was his own. I gave him in charge - He went very willingly. I found my foal on Merton common as I returned home.</p>

            . I live at Merton, and am employed to watch the common there - I knew the prisoner very well. In January last I found a stray mare, and foal, on the common; I turned them off-the prisoner said they belonged to him, and asked me to buy them. In two or three days after, the mare was gone, and the foal left behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them between Merton and Kingston - I gave 4l. 4s. for them; two young women were with me at the time. I was sent to Guildford to be tried, and was discharged by proclamation. I knew the men. I bought them of, but they are so very unsettled I cannot find them; I had witnesses attending there.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH TILT. I was bound over to prosecute here, not at Guildford.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 268.) On the 26th of Dec. I stopped two women, named Brown and Maller, in Chapman-street, St. George's, about ten o'clock at night—in conveying them to the station Maller tried three or four times to get behind me, and in coming down King David-lane, Brown, who I was leading, was very tipsy and became more violent—just before we came to the station Maller stooped down, and by that means got behind me—I put Brown into the station, and in handing Maller in I imme<lb></lb>diately missed a basket which Maller had before been carrying—I found pro<lb></lb>perty to the amount of between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I did not know of the rob<lb></lb>bery then—I only stopped them on suspicion—I afterwards ascertained that a basket of plate was missing, and I believe that basket contained the plate—Maller had the opportunity of getting rid of it at the time she stopped behind—I do not believe anybody was following us—there was some one passing just at the time, and I suppose the basket was got rid of to that person—I did not notice who it was.</p>

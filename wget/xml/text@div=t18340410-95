            . I am a patrol of Cripplegate. On the 4th of March I saw the prisoner in Aldermanbury at twenty minutes after seven o'clock - he stopped at No. 32, then went on and stopped at No. 36, he then came back to No. 34 - he had this parcel with him on a knott - I spoke to him - he said it was all right, that it was some wrappers which his master allowed him - I said I did not know that it was all right - I took him to the watch-house, and he tried to make his escape.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. These are old things? A. They are papers which have come round cloths from the country - they certainly are not new - I do not know that it is the custom of the trade to give them as perquisites - there are five months' wages due to the prisoner, at 25l. a-year - he had given me warning on the Friday before, but he had not left me.</p>

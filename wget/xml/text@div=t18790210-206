                  </hi>. I am barman at the Wooden Shades, Bishopsgate Street—on 15th January, about 9.30, I saw the prisoner and two or three others there drinking together—the prisoner's wife went up to Mr. Wright and asked him if he was going to stand anything to drink—the prisoner then went up close to him, and he treated him to drink—Mr. Wright was then sick, and stooped down, and the prisoner put his hand in front of his chest, took the watch out of his pocket, and took it off the chain—I told the head barman, who jumped over the counter and said, "That won't do for me here," and ordered the doors to be closed—a policeman came, and Wright said to the prisoner, "I shall charge you with stealing my watch"—he said, "I did not take it"—he was taken to the station—one of his companions left before the police came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The watch was off the chain when I saw it—I did not see him unfasten it—Wright had had a little too much—he was leaning against the partition conversing with a woman—I did not see the prisoner point to Wright's chain, or hear him say, "Look at your watch"—I was serving—Wright treated two women—they did not go away before they had finished their liquor, but I do not say that they drank every drain—they left before the police were called—the watch was not found.</p>

I am an agent, and live at 23, Henrietta Street, Euston Road—on 25th January I was in the Wooden Shades about 9.30, drinking at the bar—the place was pretty full—I had a watch on that evening worth 41. or 51., I cannot swear that I had it when I went in, but I believe I looked at it in the public-house—I have never seen it since—I had had a glass, but I distinctly remember going in—I was there a quarter of an hour.</p>

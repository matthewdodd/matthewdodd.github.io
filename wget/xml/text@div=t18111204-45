               <p>Q. Did you leave any body in your house - A. No. I fastened all the doors and windows; I returned at five o'clock, it was near dark then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned did you find anything the matter with the house - A. Not directly. I came home and made a fire and put on my kettle, and went up stairs to make my bed; I made one bed and went to my box; I found the hasp of my box loose and my money gone; I missed three dollars, an eighteen-penny piece, and a new shilling, and two sixpences out of my sons breeches pocket, they hung on a line from one bed-post to another. After I missed a shirt and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a single woman yourself - A. I am a widow, the mother of nineteen children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into your house to see if it had been broken into - A. The bolt of the window had been lifted up through the hole in the shutter; they lifted up the sash and got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, about ten or a dozen years ago. I have not seen him lately. His parents were neighbours of mine, he was a gardener I believe.</p>

            . I am headborough of Twickenham. On Tuesday the 12th of November, between seven and eight at night, I apprehended the prisoner at his father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mrs. Newell's house - A. About a quarter of a mile. I asked the prisoner what money he had got in his pocket, he shewed me three dollars, an eighteen-penny piece, and three sixpences. I took the dollars and the eighteen-penny piece from him, and put him in the cage. I then went up to Widow Newell and asked her what property she had lost; she told me three dollars, an eighteen-penny bank token, two sixpences, and one shilling; I went to the cage, I told the prisoner I thought that he had some more money that I wanted; he produced three sixpences and some halfpence, and told me that was all the money he had got. I searched him, in his side pocket I found a shilling, I told him that was what I wanted. It is a shilling that has been but worn a little. This is all the money.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Can you speak to the money - A. This shilling I can say is the same; I can take my oath to this shilling; and this is all the money I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you speak to that shilling - A. It is a shilling I had given to my boy. I had it by me a twelvemonth, it wore black.</p>

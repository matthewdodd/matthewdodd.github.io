Jones and Joseph Webster"—the cheque book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is from our bank—it was issued to the prisoner on the 24th October—he had at that time kept an account for some considerable period—(<hi rend="italic">ledger produced</hi>)—the account was at that time overdrawn about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 31st of October, he paid in a sum of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but that was for goods—the last payment on the drawing account, available as against cheques, was on the 4th of October, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 31st of October, was for goods we held as security for money advanced—he paid in the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then gave us a cheque for the same amount, so that it exhausted it at once—he had a credit on the 4th, after paying the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 6th a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented and paid—that was in favour of Simpeon—it was then overdrawn—there was nothing paid in after.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you found them again?</p>

               <p>Haffenden. No, Sir, I wish I could; I saw Lane and this one-armed Man, Brown, the Accomplice, in my Shop, they came and cheapened Hats.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Day was it?</p>
               <p>Haffenden. Between seven and eight o'Clock in the Evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both come to cheapen Hats?</p>
               <p>Haffenden. Brown cheapened a Hat, and the other, his Friend, came with him for Company, or with an Intent to rob me, that was the plainest.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Haffenden. I missed one in a Quarter of an Hour after they were gone out of the Shop, and the Remainder the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. What Day was this?</p>
               <p>Haffenden. On Wednesday Night; on Saturday I missed five; I lost six in all, but this Person has sworn to no more than five.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any of them again?</p>
               <p>Haffenden. None of them.</p>

            , they went with me out of Chick-lane, we went into Hatton-garden , we went there for Stockings, but we could get nothing; so Thomas Lane says, let us go into this Shop, and see if we can get a Hat a piece for ourselves; I said with all my Heart. As I was cheapening a Hat, this Thomas Lane takes his Hand underneath his Coat, and drew the Hats off the Bulk, and there he stood a small Quantity of Time, the Value of half a Minute ; I told the Gentleman I could not see it plainly, I desired that he would put a Mark upon it , so he marked it with an I and S.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these Hats divided?</p>
               <p>Brown. At Mr. Glover's, at the Sign of the Ship; I don't suppose he will come, because Lane is a particular Friend of his. He owned before the Justice that he stood at the Door and took the Hats .</p>

               <p>Lane. That Brown, the Witness with one Arm, he has been twice transported; I never knew any thing of the Fellow, but by carrying a Child to Nurse at his Brother-in-Law's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Rosenthal as silk and trimming manufacturers in Cheapside. On Tuesday, 2nd Dec., the prisoner came and said that he been living with Mr. Richard Evans, of Watling-street, for five years this Christmas, and was still—I knew that there was a house of that name in the same business as mine—he also said that he had lived with Solomon and Sons, of the Old Change, and had formed so favourable an opinion of the Hebrews that he was anxious to be with persons of that per<lb></lb>suasion—he said that Mr. Evans was indebted to him 38?., and would not pay it, and that if I would engage him, he would forego that sum and enter into our service—I said, "I am not able to make you any offer with regard to a situation, but if you will jot down on paper what your ideas are, I will see whether I can do so; it is perfectly immaterial whether I pay 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a year; all I want is a valuable servant"—he said that he would call again and place on a paper his views, and that he was in great distress, owing to Mr. Evans withholding the 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as he had a wife and four children, and wanted money particularly, and asked me to lend him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed his statement that he had been with Mr. Evans, and lent him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if I had known he had not lived there, I would not have done so—he gave me this document, "I O U 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., John Simpson, Dec. 2nd, 1856"—he called next day, wrote this letter in my counting-house, and said, "Mr. Barnard, I dare say you scarcely slept last night"—I said, "I slept very well"—he said, "The fact of having lent a stranger 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must have dis<lb></lb>turbed your rest"—I said, "Perhaps it might, but I believe you are in Mr. Evans's employment, I believe all you stated"—he told me that his brother was a clergyman of the Church of England, and went away, promising to come again the same day, and saying that it was only business engagements which would detain him—he did not come again, nor on the Wednesday or Thursday, and on the Thursday I think I went to Mr. Evans's, and, in consequence of what he said, I gave instructions to the police.</p>

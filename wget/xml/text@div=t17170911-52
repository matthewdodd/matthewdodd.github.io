The Hostler deposed, That the Prisoner came into the Yard, about 2 of the Clock, and called for his Horse, and wanted his Boots. But he told him the Chamberlain had lock'd them up, and he must call him up to help him to them; to which he seemed unwilling, telling him he would not have him disturb'd; but if he could get them without him, he would give him something for himself, and also leave something for the Chamberlain; he told him he could not, and so called the Chamberlain, who gave them him, and he was putting them on, and that in the mean time the Chamberlain went up Stairs, and he heard him talk with the Prosecutor, and what he said, and he believed the Prisoner did hear him too. And that while he was putting on his Boots, he starts up on a sudden, and said he must go into the Yard; that he wondering at this sudden Motion, look'd after him, saw him go to the Stones, put his Hand in his Pocket, heard the Stones rattle, and that he came in again immediately, and staid not to make Water or do any thing else; that when he was come in again, the Prosecutor and Chamberlain came down immediately, and taxed him with the Money, which was found as aforesaid. The Chamberlain deposed, The Prisoner came in about 7 of the Clock that Night to lodge, said he should stay 2 Nights, and was going to Canterbury. That when the Prosecutor went to Bed he attended him, lock'd his Chamber Door, and put the Key under it, and that being call'd up in the Morning, he admir'd that the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171709110008"></xptr> was going away so early and in such a Hurry, therefore having given him his Boots, went up to see all was safe in his Chamber, and going by the Prosecutor's Door, saw it had been forced open, and waked him, as has been before related. The Landlord and several other Evidence confirmed the circumstances as to the finding of the Purse of Money among the Stones, and the 12 Guineas in his Pocket, and that the Prosecutor as soon as he  saw the Purse, said the Strings had been opened, and that there was in the Purse when he had it in his Pocket,124 l.10 s.

He added likewise, that the Prisoner had been before discharged of a Felony at Ailsbury by the Management of Norton.

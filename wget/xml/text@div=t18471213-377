                  </hi> I am a soldier. On 18th Oct. I was at Spencer's booth, at Charlton Fair—I called for two glasses of rum-and-water—the prisoner was the waiter—I gave him a sixpence, and fourpence in copper—he said, "It is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said "What! for two glasses of rum-and-water?"—he said, "Yes"—I took the sixpence back, and took out from my purse what I considered to be a shilling by the feel, but I believe it was a sovereign—I gave it to him—about two minutes afterwards, the waiter came and said a man had lost a sovereign just now—I knew I had got a sovereign in my pocket—I examined my purse, and missed it—I only had one sovereign and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver when I went into the booth—I had seen it safe not half as hour previously—when I missed it, I still had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left—my wife had some coppers—I asked the prisoner if he was sure it was one of our men who had lost the sovereign—he said, "Yes"—I asked him to show me the man—he could not find him—he afterwards tapped a civilian on the shoulder, and asked him if he had lost a sovereign and found it again—he said, "Yes, I did"—I said, "That is not one of our men; be kind enough to get me a candle"—he told me to go to Mr. Spencer, who kept the booth, and get one myself—I did not get one then—I went to another booth, where I had taken a shilling out of my purse at four o'clock in the afternoon—I called for a pint of porter, and looked under the table where I had been sitting in that booth, about two hours before, but could not find it—there were not many people in the fair; but a shower came on, and we went there for shelter—I went back to Spencer's booth, got a candle, and looked under the table—a man of our corps said, "What are you looking for?"—I said, "I have missed a sovereign"—he said, "I saw you pass a sovereign to the waiter, and he took it up"—I got a policeman, and charged the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> On 18th Oct., about six o'clock in the evening, I was in the booth—Brown placed sixpence on the table to pay for some liquor—he found it was not sufficient, and shoved a sovereign and fourpence in copper over to the prisoner, by where I was sitting—I saw the prisoner give him some change—it was candle-light—there was a good light there—I was a stranger to Brown—I did not like to mention it to him at the time,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 108.) On 18th Oct., between six and seven o'clock, I was fetched to the booth—Brown told me he had paid a sovereign in mistake—the prisoner was present—Brown charged him with having it—be denied it—I asked what money he had—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a few coppers—I asked him to let me see, searched, and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some coppers in his waistcoat-pocket—I asked two or three times if he had any more money with him—he said, "No"—I said I should like to see if he had anything in his fob—he said he had nothing there—I said I did not choose to abide by what he said, and he drew a purse out of his fob—I asked what money he said in it—he stood hesitating some time, and then said, "7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and some silver"—I found nine half-sovereigns, two sovereign, and some silver.</p>

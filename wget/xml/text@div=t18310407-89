            . I am a Police-officer. On the morning of the 11th of March I was in London-field. Hackney, about a quarter before seven o'clock; I saw the prisoner about a hundred yards before me, with two tubs on his head, a wheelbarrow under his arm, and a broom in his hand; I followed him, and stopped him at Cambridge-heath turnpike - I asked where he brought them from; he said from a gentleman at Homerton-terrace, and he was going to take them to his master at Mile-end, who had borrowed them for the purpuse of brewing - I asked what he was going to do with the barrow; he said that was made a present to his master's little child - I took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q.Did he attempt to run away? A. No - he said he could not go with me, as he was delaying his master's time; I said I would go to his master, or take a note for him - I am sure he said the barrow was a present to his master's child.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did he say? A. He told the serjeant at the watch-house that he was going to carry them for a person at St. George's in the East, and that they were for the purpose of brewing; he gave the name of Knatchbull, but he could not tell where he lived, nor where he was to be found, but he said he was hired to carry them, and he was to have 1s. 6d. for it; he did not say any thing about the barrow or the broom to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say he was employed to carry them by Knatchbull? A. Yes, but he did not know where he was to take them, and that he was to meet him.</p>

            , of Clapton-square - he is a clerk in an insurance-office. I know these tubs to be my master's, and this barrow is his little child's - we did not lose any broom; I missed these tubs about half-past six o'clock in the morning on the 11th of March - London-field is about half a mile from my master's; the tubs were kept in one cellar, and the wheelbarrow in another - the cellar door in which the tubs were had been shut, but in the morning it was standing open, with a tub against it; I have been in the habit of using the tubs four years for washing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any private mark on the tubs? A.This one has been newly hooped, and there is a bend in one stave; I know this wheelbarrow - I had seen them safe on the night of the 10th of March.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the tubs were kept in a cellar? A. Yes, a cellar outside the house - it comes into the area- it would not be necessary to break into the house to get there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How are the cellars separated from the house? A. There are two steps from the kitchen door to the cellar - a noise from the cellar might not be heard in the house; the house is in the square.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said the area was nine feet deep. - Witness. It is a deep area, but I do not know how deep; the cellar door was shut, but not locked, the night before.</p>

            . I am a nurse, and have known the prisoner six years - he has been employed in jobbing for me and others; he has lodged in the same house with me since Christmas - he did not get up on the morning of the 11th of March till the clock had gone six, and he had been in bed by half-past nine o'clock the night before; if he had got up I must have heard him, as I had a child ill with the hooping-cough.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where is your house? A. In James-street, Bethnal-green; I have rented it six years; the prisoner slept in the room which I live in down stairs, and I sleep in the room up stairs; I went to bed at half-past nine o'clock the night before - we were all in bed by that time; I did not get up till half-past six or seven o'clock, to get my son's breakfast - I heard the prisoner go out at six, and told him to shut the door; I had gone down in the night with the child - I went down at half-past eleven o'clock, and then I went down again; I cannot exactly say at what time, but I was detained till near half-past three: I did not go into that room again from half-past three o'clock till six, but I was not asleep, and could hear every thing; I had made a fire in that room in the night.</p>

             re-examined Q. How far is the place at which Mrs. Phillips states she lives, from where you saw the prisoner? A. About five minutes' walk, and the place I saw him at is about twenty minutes' walk from the prosecutor's - it wanted a little more than a quarter to seven o'clock when I saw him.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.What is the depth of the area? A.About six feet, and the rails are about three feet - the door of the cellar was propped open with a very high tub; I think one person might have got these things over one at a time.</p>

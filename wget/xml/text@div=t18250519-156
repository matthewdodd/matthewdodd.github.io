On the 12th of May I saw the two prisoners come into the shop, with two others, about seven o'clock in the evening; my master was behind the counter, reading the newspaper; I watched, and saw Newman take a piece of cloth off a rail, and he assisted Grindley to put it under his coat; they went out; I gave the alarm, and pursued - they were taken two doors off: I took hold of Grindley myself, with the linen under his coat; he was brought into the shop, and it was taken from him; Newman came back at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not at the office when Newman was brought up, and did you not say you did not know whether he was one or not? A. No, I did not. They had been in the shop about two minutes.</p>
               <p>JOHN BIRT. The property is mine. Clarke gave an alarm - my young man and her went out, and brought back the prisoners; the linen was found upon Grindley.</p>
               <p>NEWMAN's Defence. I was going down the street with a shipmate of mine, and we were looking into the house of the prosecutor, as he was going to buy a handkerchief; the young woman came out and took Grindley by the arm, and said he must go back; she then looked round, and said there was another person with him - the shopman turned to me, and said, "Do you think this is him?" she said, "I don't know."</p>
               <p>GRINDLEY's Defence. I was with a shipmate; he went into this shop, brought out the cloth, and gave it to me, telling me to keep it dry - it rained, and I put it under my jacket.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 4th September, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was walking in Bartholomew fair, with Burley, the police-officer—I had a veil on—somebody gave a tug at it, and to secure it, I pulled it off my bonnet, and gave it to Burley to take care of—he put it into his pocket, and in about five minutes I saw it in the hands of another person, who was putting it into his bosom—I do not know who he was—I told him the veil belonged to me, and he gave it me, and ran away—this is the veil.</p>

I was walking with the prosecutor—s e gave me her veil to take care of—I put it into my left-hand pocket—I did not feel it taken from my pocket; but something was going on on the stage at Richardson's show, which took my attention off altogether—I received information that my pocket was picked—I was in plain clothes—I immediately called an officer, and he ran and took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody—he had not got the veil then.</p>

               <p>JAMES TARR. I am a watchman, and was on duty on the 26th of January by the side of Fleet-market, between one and two o'clock in the morning - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running along <placeName id="t18300218-161-crimeloc901">Snow-hill</placeName>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutrix had accosted him and must have slipped the property into his pocket, in order to extort money from him.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES TARR. Q. Did he deny he had taken it? A. Yes, and said it had been put into his pocket, but after that said he would leave his hat to settle it - he said they had been walking together.</p>

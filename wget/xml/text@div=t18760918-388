                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker of 286, Hackney Road—I have known Mrs. Hagger and her husband for ten years—about two or three months back they came to lodge with me—at that time they had the Green Man public-house in Price's Street, Blackfriars—on 22nd June I received this letter dated 20th June, I cannot swear to the writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner's writing, I have seen him write—the signature to that letter is his writing, the body of it is also his—the signature to this other document is also his. <hi rend="italic">The letter (which was the alleged libel) was read as follows:</hi> "Dear sir,—My wife informs me that she called on you respecting the disreputable things who has taken your apart<lb></lb>ments. As a married man and have been so to that lady whom you saw for thirty-three years, I feel disgusted to confess that she has not told you a hundredth part of her infamy; with respect to the document her man showed you. I pronounce it a forgery, so well she knows—should you desire to have proof I will pay all your expenses and take you to certain houses where she has committed herself. They were compelled to leave their den of infamy called the Green Man, Price's Street, Blackfriars, in consequence of giving barmen false characters, the truth of which you can ascertain by reading Tuesday's paper, where you will find one convicted and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. They were likewise turned from a house in Brick Lane, in consequence of her disgraceful conduct, the truth of which you can ascertain from inquiries in the neighbourhood. Dear sir, should they continue in your house your place would be a scene of riot every day. Yours respectfully, S. Garcia. P.S.—A fellow living with them is a married man who has deserted his wife and lives by defrauding the public") (<hi rend="italic">The document referred to in the letter was signed S. Garcia, and was a withdrawal of all imputations upon the character of the prosecutrix and an undertaking not to molest her in future.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). I took that letter to refer to Mr. and Mrs. Hagger—shortly before I received it Mrs. Garcia had called upon me—I had some conversation with her several times, I believe she came three times, and on each occasion I had some conversation with her—the Haggers were lodging with me at that time at 152, Bethnal Green Road—since the taking out of the summons I saw the prisoner once or twice; I have not had much conversation with him—after the summons was issued he called to see me—I told him I thought it was rather foolish to have sent a letter to me, especially putting his signature to it, he might have sent it without the signature, and it would have had a better effect—I did not show the letter to him at that time—his reply was that he did not think he had put anything in it to criminate himself in any shape or form, he could satisfy me that what he put in the letter was quite true.</p>

In June I was living with my husband and family at 152, Bethnal Green Road, in the house kept by Mr. Wright—my husband is a publican, but in June he was out of business; prior to that he bad kept the Green Man, in Price's Street, Blackfriars Road, I lived there with him—he sold that business and we then moved to 152, Bethnal Green Road—I have known the prisoner five years—he was in the habit of coming to the Green Man—in October last year he assaulted me and I obtained a summons against him and he was bound over; he had been summoned before that, more than once, he was continually creating a disturbance, and in October he signed this document—the Green Man was never a den of infamy to my knowledge—I have never given barmenfalse characters—we were never turned out of a house in Brick Lane in consequence of my disgraceful conduct—we did keep the Turk and Slave in Brick Lane, we sold that honse—there are not, to my knowledge, houses to which the defendant could take anyone where I had committed myself—I was present when Mr. Wright handed the letter to my husband.</p>

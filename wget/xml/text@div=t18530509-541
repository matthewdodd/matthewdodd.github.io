                  </hi>, Esq. I am a member of the Bar; I occupied chambers in King's Bench-walk in 1851. I had known the prisoner previously to that—I had known him down at Cambridge many years—I practise more there than I do in London—in April, 1851, I was induced to employ him as my clerk—I met him in Hungerford-market, and he told me he had received a fee for me—he was not at that time my clerk, he was Mr. Metcalfe's clerk alone—I had made no arrangement with him—I thanked him, and I forget whether I asked him, or he asked me, to continue to receive fees for me; but 1 told him if he would continue to receive the fees for me, he should have the clerk's fees as a remuneration for his services—that was about 16th April—it was a fee he had received from Trindall and Eyre—I told him in Hungerford-market that if he received fees for me, he was to make an entry of them on a piece of paper, and put it on my mantelshelf, so that I might know he had received it if I were not there—it was the fee in Trindall and Eyre's case that he had received, and I said, "Let this be the beginning of the matter, and make an entry when you get home on a paper, and put it on my mantelpiece, and when I come I will put my initials on it—I gave him the clerk's fee in Hungerford-market—I told him he was to account for what fees he received directly he received them—he was to give them to me directly he saw me, and if he did not see me, he was to write it down on the paper—I was professionally instructed in the case of the Queen and Whittaker and another, by Mr. Wontner, in the March Assizes in 1851; there was a fee due to me of three guineas fur a refresher and a consultation—I have never received the three guineas which Mr. Crawford says he paid to Scott on 28th April, 1851—I missed the prisoner from the chambers about that time, and I never saw him till about a month or six weeks before he was apprehended—I then saw him in a court of justice—I made inquiries for him, and I understood from his wife that he had gone abroad—my inquiries were not successful; I could not find the prisoner—I apprehended him I believe on 1st March—I had seen him two days before, that was in a railway carriage coming to London—I had made an effort to apprehend him on the Friday preceding, but I could not find a policeman—I apprehended him as soon as I possibly could.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090011"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you had chambers with Mr. Metcalfe before this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For several years—I found Scott there when I came back to chambers at the beginning of Easter Term—I used at that time to be up in town for a week, or nearly so—I should think I was up in town in Hilary Term; if Scott was there then I saw him—I never before engaged a clerk in Hungerford-market—I have no recollection of Mr. Metcalfe telling me that Scott was his clerk, and he would not allow him to be clerk to any one else—I will not swear he did not—I cannot recollect it; but when the arrange-ment took place between me and the prisoner, I stipulated that he was not in any way to neglect Mr. Metcalfe's business for me—the prisoner is not a Cambridge man, that I know of—I never took a meal with him—when I was taking wine, I very likely may have asked him to have a glass—I have given him food—he was acting as a clerk—I have two clerks at Cambridge, and one in London, Mr. Attersly—he is Mr. Charnock's clerk—I have chambers with him now—Mr. Metcalfe engaged Scott's son, and I paid part of his expenses—the first fee the prisoner received for me was Trindall and Eyre's—Scott's wife told me be had gone abroad, and she told me he had received the fee, and he would come down to settle it—I should think I saw his wife every day; she was the laundress—the prisoner has not dined with me over and over again—it is a hard thing to say that he has never breakfasted, or taken meals with me—if he were hungry, I would have given him a meal—to the best of my belief he has never taken meals with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you have not over and over again employed him in election matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has been employed by a committee of gentlemen, of whom I was one—I never employed him in any way but as a clerk for the registration of the borough—he was employed in the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> office in this way—he was very badly off, and I solicited employment for him, and he was employed to report the police cases—he never delivered me any brief as clerk to an attorney—on one occasion he delivered a copy of the depositions, but he was not acting as my clerk then—I always take an active part in elections—I did at the last election—I had to second one of the candidates—I saw the prisoner about a month or six weeks before I gave him in custody—I saw him in the county court at Cambridge—I was in a case there—a gentleman said, "There is Scott," but I was in my robes, and was engaged, and could not have him taken then—I did not say to the inspector that I had never been able to see him till I gave him in custody—I have not sent any one to him within this month—Thomas Pearce has been my clerk for many years at Cambridge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not Scott employed by you during the elections of 1843 and 1847? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not by me—I think he was probably employed by the com-mittee, of which I was one, as a check clerk—he has certainly not complained to me over and over again that he could not get his remuneration—I never gave any instructions to the police at Cambridge to take him—I do not know that he has been in Cambridge since September last—I came to town partly on account of the last election, and partly to apprehend him, because I saw him coming from Cambridge in a railway carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not sent your clerk, Pearce, to him several times to beg of him not to appear before the election committee in London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly and distinctly not, nor nothing of the kind—I know a person of the name of Sherman—I know one or two named Chapman—Sherman was a voter, and Mr. William Chapman was a voter there—I know a person named Brooks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell Brooks to convey this message to Scott, that if Sherman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090012"></xptr>
               <p>and Chapman appeared before the election committee you would give him in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most assuredly not—I did not give him in custody about this election business, most assuredly not—it was over; I heard the decision come to on this election business—I did not go immediately and take Scott: about a couple of hours afterwards—I thought very likely it might be thought it was done from political motives, and I waited till it was over—I bad not a warrant to appear as a witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In reference to Sherman and Chapman, was not your name mixed up with them, and was it not alleged that you had been a party to bribing them to the amount of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Sherman came to me after the election, and said something about some money that somebody had promised him, and I told him to leave the house—I know Pratt—I was not charged with inducing him to vote by getting him a license from the Vice-Chancellor—he got a license a good while before—my belief is, it was a considerable time before—I told him I would apply to the Vice-Chancellor for a license—I believe he did vote—he was a publican—I know Pratt, and he is in Court here—I did not promise him a license, certainly not; he had two landlords—I did not canvass them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell Pratt that if he got a license the house would be worth 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think very likely the value of the house would be enhanced, but I do not know whether I did say so—I said that I would apply to the Vice-Chancellor, but on consideration I would not—he has got the license, but not by my interference—I am not aware that Pratt's was one of the houses that were opened for the election—I ordered him to open his house for three or four persons whom I employ, not about political purposes, but perfectly legal purposes—the amount of it was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received a notice to produce a letter written by Mr. Metcalfe; but I looked through several hundred letters, and could not find it—I had some conversation with Mr. Metcalfe—I do not recollect that I told him I should hold him responsible—I wrote to him—I thought he had done wrong in employing Scott at all in the chambers without consulting me—if I had introduced a clerk that had robbed Mr. Metcalfe I should have held myself responsible for it—I did not see Scott in the Committee of the House of Commons, or up in the gallery—I swear I did not—I know Thomas Butcher and William Baker—they have never been my guests, and they have not applied to me for money, certainly not; I had but a few hours to seek for the letter that Mr. Metcalfe sent me, and I could not find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that letter in answer to a letter that you wrote to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—the prisoner has never dined or breakfasted with me, or been received as a guest—there has never existed any intimacy but that between a master and a servant, certainly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you send any message to Scott by his son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think I may have told his son and his wife, probably, that I should send for a policeman if he did not come.</p>

I am shopman to John Orrick Kennard, of the Broadway, Deptford—on Thursday morning, before I went to the police-court, between 12 and 1 o'clock, Winckels and Ellis came into the shop—Winckels asked for some brocaded silk handkerchiefs—I showed him the nearest we had—I sold him this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sold Ellis a black lace fall at 15 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after they had been gone 5 or 10 minutes, I missed these 44 handkerchiefs and this scarf (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)—the value of them is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw them safe while the prisoners were in the shop—I sold the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. handkerchief out of the bundle—they are John Orrick Kennard'e property.</p>

On 17th December, about 12 o'clock, I was on duty in Church-street, Greenwich, and saw the prisoners come out of the Mitre—I had watched Lovell in, and then I saw Winckels and Ellis come out first, and Lovell afterwards—Winckels and Ellis were walking arm in arm, and Lovell was on the opposite side of the road—I saw Winckels and Ellis go into Mr. Kershaw's shop in London-street, while Lovell stood in the street, looking to and fro—they came out and went into Mr. Wilson's shop, another draper's—Lovell was standing in the same place and walked over and talked with them all the way to Deptford; about half a mile—Ellis then let go of his arm, and Winckels and Ellis went into the prosecutor's shop—Lovell walked a little way ahead, and stood about 10 yards off on the kerb, looking sometimes right up and down, sometimes towards the shop, and sometimes away from it—when Winckels and Ellis came out, he joined and spoke to them, and they went into the Centurion public-house—I was in a shop opposite—How and Dubois joined me, and we went into the Centurion and saw the prisoners sitting in three chairs, with some beer in a glass—Ellis was between the other two—I asked them if they had any objection to be searched—Lovell said, "No; I have no objection"—I asked him to stand up, unbuttoned his coat, and found this handkerchief in his coat pocket, not the one he had bought—I asked him how he accounted for it—he said, "I found it just now in the street"—I took him in custody, and Winckels asked me what I was taking him for—I said, "For robbing people"—he rushed at me, caught me by the throat, and we were fighting for a quarter of an hour—How laid hold of him, and I laid hold of Lovell—the woman escaped, and I fell over the table—Lovell ran to get the poker and I got How's umbrella—he struck us, knocked the corner of a chair with the poker, and said that he would knock our brains out—Winckels said, "I have something in my pocket, too, if you do not let us go"—I saw this bundle of 44 handkerchiefs and 7 scarfs on the chair where Lovell was sitting—the woman was brought back.</p>

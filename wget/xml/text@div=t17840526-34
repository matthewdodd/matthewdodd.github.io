               <p>On the 28th of April the prisoner robbed me of the things mentioned in the indictment, she came to me on the 24th for lodgings, she said she came up by the waggon, and she had expended all her money; I took her in on Wednesday about one, she went from my apartment and took the things with her; she was to go by Mr. Ward's Birmingham waggon, from the Bell in Smithfield, and in about half an hour after she was gone, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I went after her and found her in Smithfield about four, I took hold of her, and a woman came up and asked the prisoner if a man and woman belonged to her; I saw nobody but the prisoner, but the other people said they saw them; the prisoner said yes, and said to my daughter, that man and woman has got the black box and your cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by the black box? - The ink-stand; we took the prisoner to the Compter, she had my cloak on her; she never denied taking the things, but said she gave them to this man and woman; she said first that they set her to rob me, then she said she met them in the street and asked them for a lodging, and gave them the bundle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Council. How long has this woman been in town? - She has been five weeks in prison.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I sell gingerbread and saloop in the street; I live in Hen and Chicken Court, by St. Dunstan's Church.</p>

               <p>She never attempted to run away? - No, she was like a baby, as inoffensive as a lamb to look at, she could not well get from me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You met her a little way from the Bell Inn? - Yes, in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>She did not attempt to get away from you? - No, we both laid hold of her.</p>

               <p>JOHN HARRISON sworn. - I am a surveyor and builder, in Berkeley-square: On Friday evening, the 21st of this month, a person of the name of Ellis gave me some information.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ELLIS sworn. - I am a constable: On the 21st of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the bottom of Essex-street, Strand, under the arch-way, I saw the prisoner come out of the house of Mr. Plowden, he had a parcel wrapped up in a dirty sheet of white paper; I had a suspicion, and followed him to an old iron shop in Shire-lane, he was there about two or three minutes before I followed him in; when I went in, I saw the lead in the scale, which is here to be produced; I asked him what he had got there, he first said, it was his own property, and at the watch-house, he said, it was the property of General 
               <persName id="t18031026-30-person233">Bulkeley</persName>
            ; I searched him, and found in his pocket a key that opened Mr. Plowden's door; I then went to General 
               <persName id="t18031026-30-person234">Bulkeley</persName>
            's, and from thence to Mr. Harrison's, whom I found to be the prisoner's master; the lead does not match to any thing; the prisoner slept in the house, it was repairing, and the key was the proper key of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harrison. Mr. Plowden's house belongs to General Bulkeley, his name is Felix, he is the landlord of it; I don't know that the lead belongs to General Bulkeley; the prisoner has worked for me four or five years, I always found him very honest.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ASKEW sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Harrison; I know there was lead on the premises, but I know nothing of this lead, I did not miss any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up the lead in coming up the street.</p>

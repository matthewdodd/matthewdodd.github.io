                  </hi>. I am steward of the brig <hi rend="italic">Harnett</hi>, belonging to Captain William Burrows; she was working, into the West India Docks. On Tuesday morning, the 12th of September, about seven o'clock, as I was hauling into the Docks, I was spoken to by a Custom-house officer—I missed half a small pig—I did not get it again—I did not see who took it—I saw a man in a boat in a blue jacket and straw hat, which was Bolter, and another man—I ordered them to come to the ship—they would not—they Pulled a little, and then laid on their oars—I said, if they did not come it would be worse for them—they whispered, and then I called the policeman—they pulled up the river, and I saw no more of them.</p>

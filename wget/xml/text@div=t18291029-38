            . These ear-rings were pawned with me by the prisoner, on the 23rd of September - the prosecutrix saw them at our house, and at the office, and claimed them; she said the prisoner and another girl met her, and said, "Will you give us some gin?" and she said No - that the prisoner then pulled her ear-rings out of her ears, and said, "We will have your ear-rings - they will fetch some gin;" the prisoner heard it, and did not deny it.</p>

We had been drinking together, and she said she had been trying to pawn her ear-rings, and could not; she asked me to take them - I pawned them for 1s., and came out; she quarrelled with a young woman, and said to me, "Where are the ear-rings?" I said, "I can't get them out without a halfpenny, and I have not one;" she took them out of her ears herself.</p>

               <p>Bradshaw. I believe it was two Years afterwards . When Mr. Godwin came to me, I told him I had lost some remarkable Silk, which my W had in her Gown. Mr. Godwin told me, upon searching at Chelsea , where she had a Bastard Child at Nurse, that her Child had the Skirt of a Coat of a remarkable fine Silk; upon which I desir'd him to bring it to my House at London; by comparing it, we found it to be the very same Silk which had lain by as useless, 'till we should make it up for Child of our own.</p>

When she got out of the Boat, I dogg'd her up Blackfryers , and from thence to the Saracen's-Head on Snow-hill. I sent to my Master, and told him I had set Mrs. Jones; there I waited some Time, and they went from thence into Newgate-Street , and from thence to the Harrow in Greyfryers ; she saw me, and went to run down that Place; I said, Mrs. Susan, you shall go no further, you shall not slip my Hands.</p>

               <p>Bradshaw. This Silk was in a Gown for my Wife, 'tis very remarkable; I bought it in France. Another Reason I have to believe it to be the same is, that the whole Breadth is cut, and half the Breadth cut in two.</p>

               <p>Bradshaw. It was not miss'd when the Prisoner left my House; it might be about six Months, for my Wife had no Occasion to look after the Silk.</p>

             . My Lord, I miss'd Goods at several Times. A Person that quarrell'd with her inform'd me of several Things. She serv'd me with a Writ for false Imprisonment; she employ'd Mr. Moore, (a Sort of Attorney) to come to me. Here's Witness to prove, that, at least, she would get four or five hundred Pounds of me.</p>

I am a cheesemonger, of 291, New North Road, Isling<lb></lb>ton—on the 24th of December, between nine and ten in the evening, the prisoner came in for half a pig's head and two ounces of butter, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a bad crown—I asked her where she got it—she said at 32, Shepperton Cottages, New North Road, close to my house—I asked her to go with me there, and she did so, but first she said that, as the crown was bad, she could only take the butter, which she offered me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, but I did not take it—we went to 32, Shepperton Cottages, and saw the gentleman who keeps the house, who said that he had no knowledge of her—I took her back to my shop, and detained her with some difficulty till a policeman came—I kept the coin in my hand and gave it to the policeman.</p>

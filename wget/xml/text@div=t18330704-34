               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you know me? A. I never saw you before; I know you by your countenance; I knew you from the other soldier, because you struck me with the bayonet - I saw you strike me with something you had in your hand - I never lifted my hand to you, nor gave you any blow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Wood give the soldier any blow? A. No; we found the key of the door on the ledge of the window, when we came back from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you hold the prisoner? A. Yes; I never left him - the other soldier was very civil and persuaded him not to do it - I should not know the other soldier; I am sure the prisoner is the man who struck me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You know you live in a street where prostitutes of the lowest kind live - what do you do for your livelihood? A. By selling fruit in the street; a great many unfortunate girls live there, I believe.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say, You know the bayonet was the instrument you were struck with - and before said, You could not see the instrument? A. I did not know what he struck me with, till they showed it me at the watch-house - when he drew it I did not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She struck me when she came out, and accused me of having the key. Witness. I did not strike him, nor lay my hand to him - there was a gas lamp facing me at the other corner, it was darkish - he struck me so that I was not able to stand the first time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You did not fall? A. No; I followed you afterwards - it is not customary to leave the key of the door outside; we had not come in many minutes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you think you would not have admitted me, if you had thought I had plenty of money? A. I don't know about that - a young woman found the key outside - the prisoner was close by the shutter when he struck me - he was in regimentals, and had a belt on, and I saw him draw out something from behind him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She swore at Queen's-square I was taken into custody by a serjeant, and now says it was a corporal. Witness. I did not swear it was a serjeant; I think not; I don't know a serjeant from a corporal; they told me before the magistrates it was a corporal.</p>

            . On the evening of the 3rd of June, I was with the prosecutrix at my house in Pye-street shelling peas; two soldiers came up, and wanted to come in; I shut the door, and said, No soldier's girls lived there - the key was outside the door, one of them took it out; I went out, and asked them for it, and so did she; they refused to give it me; I said if they did not, I would give them in charge of a policeman - I saw the prisoner draw his bayonet out, and he attempted to stab me with it - my door was open, I ran in, and the bayonet caught against the wall - I am certain I saw him draw it - I did not strike him, nor did I see Andrews strike him - Andrews said, "Let him do it, he must not do it with that;" and then he turned round, and hit her with it on the left side of her head - I saw him strike her with the bayonet - she was outside, opposite my door, in the street - there was not day-light enough to see, but my door was open, and I had a candle, and there was a lamp on the other side of the way - I was so frightened, after I saw him strike her, that I ran in doors, and did not see him strike her again; I saw him attempt it - she asked me to call a policeman, I went and saw one, but he would not interfere as he said he did not see it - I saw the prisoner in the custody of a corporal afterwards - I had never seen him before - I can't say which end he had hold of the bayonet when he struck Andrews; he had hold of the thick end when he struck at me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see the prosecutrix, when she came out of the door, strike me? A. I did not see it - I know you from the other soldier, because we never left your company after you hit her; she followed you, and I followed you to the corner of the street - the other soldier did not go with you all the way; I saw the other soldier go another way - I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did they knock at your door? A. No, the door was half open; neither open nor shut; they did not come in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you know Simmon's-buildings? A. Yes, some of the houses are occupied by prostitutes - my husband gets a livelihood for me - I have been in the habit of selling things in the street - my husband is a hackney-coachman - Andrews lives at No. 16, in the street - the soldier was in liquor.</p>

             on the night in question, and found a bruised cut on the side of her head - the point of the instrument had struck her head; there was a cortused wound, the muscle was very slightly divided, but the point of the instrument had penetrated through the integuments - the wound was about an inch in in length; I am sure the muscle was divided - it was a slight wound except that part where some instrument had penetrated to the bone; the scalp was not laid bare, but the bone had been touched by the point of the instrument - it appears to have been struck vertically; the depth increased as the point descended - it could not have been done by the butt end of the bayonet nor by the side, it had been inflicted by the point of the the bayonet; the wound was not dangerous - a wound inflicted by a bayonet cutting in that way, would not be likely to endanger life unless it penetrated the skull, which it might have done, if struck with his holding the butt end of the bayonet, and struck downwards - there would have been no danger unless it had penetrated the skull - I examined her hand, and found a wound which must have been cut by the sharp end of the bayonet, not with the point but with the edge - it had been done with one of the sharp edges; it might have happened by her defending a blow which he was making with the butt end of the bayonet, it was a cut - there was no danger from that wound; I think the wound in her head must have been inflicted by holding the bayonet with the butt end.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say the wound on the head was a bruise, and inflicted with the point, how could the point of the bayonet bruise? A. The point of the bayonet would enter the integuments, not as if he was stabbing, but as if he was sticking the side of the bayonet against the head - the bayonet is triangular, it was a wound inflicted by a blow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. That is not the way a person would have inflicted a wound if he intended to destroy life? A. No, it was a sort of blow, making a contused wound with the back part of the bayonet, and as the point of the bayonet descended through the integuments, it left a cut.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had intended to destroy life, or do her grievous bodily harm, he would have struck or stabbed with the bayonet? A. Undoubtedly.</p>

             - the girl's door was open - I asked her if she was engaged; she jumped up and shut the door - we both walked on; she came out and accused me of taking the key out of the door, of which I am innocent - she struck me directly she came out with something in her hand, I took it to be iron; and before I could recover myself she struck me a very heavy blow - a man came out of a public-house, who, I believe, is a bully - he collared me, struck me on the side of my neck, and I had marks of it afterwards; two men assisted him; I was obliged to defend myself as well as I could - a whole mob assembled round - the whole cry was against me, and while the men were beating me, this girl was the most active, flying at me; both the girl's characters correspond with the street they live in, which is one of the worst streets in Westminster - there is great contradiction in the evidence; one swears I struck with the point of the bayonet, and the other with the butt end.</p>

            . No other soldier was with him when I saw him - in our battalion soldiers are allowed to wear their side-arms when not on duty; he was in the midst of a crowd when I saw him - they were not attacking him; he had his bayonet in his hand, swearing by his God he would strike the first person that attempted to take him.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. You have said you followed him and held him; how could you do so if you were so weak? A. I followed him some distance till he was taken - it was about one hundred yards I suppose.</p>

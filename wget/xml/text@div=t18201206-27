I did not hear of it again till eleven o'clock at night - she took it out a second time about half-past three. I saw her cross the market, but which way she went I cannot say - the child was found stripped in Sharp's-alley. She had taken a pair of ear-rings and other things - the child was found on the step of a door. When she took it away it had the clothes on it.</p>

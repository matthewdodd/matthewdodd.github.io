I saw the sheep on Thursday evening the 24th of July; the next morning. I missed the sheep, I searched the field all round, and found some blood in one corner; the belly was cut open, and the entrails let out into the ditch, the caul fat was taken away; I then went home; on Saturday night I searched again, and found some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170009"></xptr>more blood in another field, adjoining to the prisoner Smith's garden; about one hundred yard from my field, at a stile within twenty yards of the garden, I found the appearance of the sheep having been hung across the stile, for it was bloody, and there was about half a pint of blood lying at the bottom of the stile, which had dropped down the bars of the stile, it was not a common foot-path; on the Sunday morning I went to the prisoner's house with a search-warrant; upon searching, we found two shoulders of mutton, two legs, and part of two necks, part of the scrag was cut off, and one loin felted in a pickling pan up stairs; and I found a quantity of fat melted; the prisoners were both at home at that time, they said they had nothing of mine; Penn said he had bought it in London on the Tuesday; he said he had bought it of a man with a horse and cart coming up Snow-hill; he said he sent it down by a country waggon, but did not know whose waggon it was, nor the man; Smith said he did not know any thing about it; the sheep was dead when he came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you able to tell, from the mutton, whether it was ewe mutton or whether? - A. They were little sat ewes; the mutton had the dug on, the weight tallies with the sheep that I lost; it had not been killed by a butcher, it was cut and mangled sadly; they were of the Bakewell breed, there was no other mutton of that breed in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Beville. Q. You are very well acquainted with Smithfield? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You often buy sheep there? - A. I have within these few months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that this sheep is so different from others of the Bakewell breed that you are sure it is the same? - A. If I had not bought the sheep myself, and handled it, I should not have known.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Whose house do you say this is? - A. It is Smith's house, Penn lodges in the house with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Is the firkin here? A. Yes, but the butter has been taken out - it was full when I saw it, but I did not see any butter; I cannot say under what circumstance Cooper delivered the butter.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Holmes', Old Fish-street, opposite to the prosecutors' - Cooper was in their service, and I knew Fagan by sight before, I had seen him at Mr. Yeates'. On the 27th of May, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock in the morning, I was at the drawing-room window, which was open, and saw Fagan waiting about as usual by Fish-street church - Cooper beckoned to him; he crossed over, and waited by Distaff-lane - I then saw Cooper beckon to him, and he directly went into the ware-house - I saw him come out with a firkin of butter on a knot, which he carried on his shoulders; I could not see the butter - I gave information of this on Thursday, and attended before the Alderman on the 28th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you live with Mr. Holmes? A. Yes, as cook - I was not acquainted with Cooper, further than saying "Good morning;" I was not at all acquainted with Fagan - Gunstone was watching in our house; I told him what I had seen before - I have seen a great deal of goods go out, but not for men to be beckoned to take them.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to the prosecutors. Mr. Yeates having received information, desired me to watch - I went over to Mr. Holmes', and saw Cooper come out of the door and stand on the stones; he went back again, and Fagan came up - he went in, and I saw Cooper put a firkin of butter on his (Fagan's) head; I know it was butter - he put it on his head, just about the counting-house door, which is a very little way from the street - I saw Fagan carry it away; I remained at Mr. Holmes', I told Mr. Acocks what I had seen, and soon after Gunstone brought Cooper to Mr. Acocks' house, in Trinity-lane, from the warehouse - Mr. Yeates' Christian name is David - he has only one partner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.When had the firkin come into your premises? A. It was weighed on the 24th of May; I know there was butter in it - I never opened it, nor saw the butter; Cooper weighed it - the invoice calls it 66 lbs.; I did not hear what passed between the prisoners - Cooper went back into the counting-house, to the desk, directly; here is the weighing-book in which Cooper has entered the weight - I know it is his own writing; he has written "58 firkins," with other numbers, and 58 is branded on the firkin - here is, against the 58, G. x B.B., which shows that it is the mark on the firkin - we deal in cheese, butter, and lard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you put cheese into firkins? A. No; we sometimes put lard in - here is butter sticking to the sides of the firkin now; it has been in Mr. Smith's custody.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. After the prisoners were committed the firkin was brought to our warehouse; I sent it to one of our retail shops, and charged it as 67 lbs. of butter; if it had contained any thing else I should have heard of it - it now has a little butter at the sides; I was at Mr. Acock's when Cooper was brought there, charged with stealing a firkin of butter - I do not exactly recollect what he said, but I am sure I heard him beg for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. A great many things were talked of besides butter? A. Yes; the firkin was not produced there.</p>

               <p>Fagan's Defence. I am a poor man, and work in Newgate-market; Cooper employed me to go down to the warehouse at half past eight o'clock, to take a firkin of butter - he gave me 1s. to carry it, and 4d. to pay the booking; it is very hard for me to be brought into trouble - Cooper promised to exonerate me before the Court, but he has not said a word.</p>
               <p>Cooper. He is totally innocent - I received the order from Mr. Ware, and employed him to carry the butter; it was my intention to book it if I had time.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN EVANS. Q.What direction was on the firkin? A.Mr. Ware, Hampstead - he was a casual customer of the prosecutors, for ready money only; I know nothing of his having ordered a firkin of butter that morning - when we send butter to an inn, we always send a porter's book to have a receipt; if this had gone out regularly the book would have been sent to be signed.</p>

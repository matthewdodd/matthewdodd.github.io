Two months have elapsed since you pro<lb></lb>mised it to me, and your silence will compel me to call upon you at Twick<lb></lb>enham, where I shall be on a visit to some of my old friends. I need not, perhaps, do more than remind you that your visits to Hanover-gate, Regent's-park, are as well known to me as the one you paid at Westbourne-park, and both to married women. Your kind compliance with the repeated request of an old neighbour, who gave you references of the highest respectability would have prevented all further correspondence, added to which, I have done all you asked by letting you know I hare been for years a resident of respectability in Twickenham, and, I have the honour to be, yours, S. <hi rend="smallCaps">MILLS."</hi>—"Nov. 15, 1848.—Sir,—My communication to you being treated with the silent contempt I could not have expected from an old neighbour who commenced a correspondence, I beg to acquaint you how far you are likely to stand affected with your family and the world through your silence, and my knowledge of your immoralities. I know not how far it may suit your views to figure in a <hi rend="italic">crim. con.</hi>, but it has come to my know<lb></lb>ledge the last week, that the husband of the lady whom you visited at West<lb></lb>bourne-park Villas, (when I was under the roof) not intending to live again with his wife, would by my evidence get rid of her, through what I am pre-pared to swear, and which will, if done, not be agreeable to yourself; the lady, as you doubtless know, being the mother of two children; however, I write to tell you of my first intention, which is to insert a paragraph in a Sunday journal, a satirical paper, in which your name shall conspicuously and unmistakeably figure, and unless I hear from you by the Saturday in this week, or the Saturday in next, your name will appear, and copies be sent to Mrs. Bevan, and many of your friends. Such is unhesitatingly my determi<lb></lb>nation—truth only shall be stated, but that fully, if stated at all by an old neighbour; and, I am, Sir, yours, S. <hi rend="smallCaps">MILLS."</hi>—"81, West-street, Brighton. Sir,—I told you your conduct and correspondence with me should appear in a Sunday journal, and I now beg to state I hope to be in town next week in time to have some conversation with an Editor to whom your letters will be given, and, as I intend, for publication, I shall send a copy of</p>

               <p>your last letter to me to Mrs. Bevan, and tell her the gentleman who accom<lb></lb>panied a lady to Westbourne-park Villas was no other than yourself, nor will I hurt your sensitive feelings further than by telling you I know you received a lady separated from her husband at your residence in Hamilton-place, and when; this may be intelligence you may not object to go to your wife and daughters, but it will most certainly be sent. You have no right to treat an old neighbour who gave you the best references as you have done me, and unless you send what you promised, if I gave you an account of my circum<lb></lb>stances, and that at once, you shall see yourself in print, and your family and partners shall see it too.

We shall give a selection from a collection of epistles before us, which will excite some astonishment, just a little risibility at Twickenham and the Regent's-park.

Our corre-spondent in other respects misunderstands our motives.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184908200087"></xptr>
               <p>at that time seen the articles which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper on 31st March and 7th April—I cautioned him against continuing a correspon<lb></lb>dence of that description, otherwise proceedings would be taken against him—he said that nothing libellous had appeared; he would take care that nothing libellous should appear—I asked him if he had any letters in his possession, the letters alluded to—he stated that he had, and that they were sufficient to fill twenty columns in print, the publication of which would commence in the following Saturday's paper, that would be on 14th April, the next day—he showed me a number of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, and pointed out to me "The Life and Adventures of Captain Aaron Smith"—I do not recollect the date of that paper—he said that was the mode in which the publication would appear—I asked him if he had received the letters from a female—he said, "No, from a male"—he then stated that a female had called on him on 2d April, wishing to see him on the subject of the letters alluded to in the paper of 31st March, but that as she refused to give any name, he declined seeing her—I asked him whether the publication of the letters could be stopped—he said he should not recommend me to make any attempt of that sort—I told him that I was not authorised by Mr. Bevan to make any attempt to get the letters back, but that probably he might be prevailed upon to submit to a little extortion to prevent the publication—he recommended that I should not attempt anything of the kind—he said the publication would commence on the following day, upon which I requested it might stand over for a week to give me an opportunity of seeing Mr. Bevan on the subject—he said he would consent to that—I then left him. (<hi rend="italic">The following paragraphs from the</hi> Satirist <hi rend="italic">of 14th April were here read:</hi>—"<hi rend="largeCaps">INQUIRY</hi>—we shall in a very short time commence the matter you mention by a series of letters entitled" The Banker and his Doings.' The matter will run on for seven or eight weeks, as we have some four or five important letters which we shall publish, bearing out the facts we shall give. We need not add that the matter will create immense sensation, both in town and country; as to this, R, all the facts communicated were within our knowledge, and a great deal you appear not to know."—"<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> must have patience. The correspon<lb></lb>dence of the amorous old banker with his fair friends, and their extraordinary epistles, are preparing for publication, and we shall shortly commence the series. The figure the liquorish old Lombard cuts is highly amusing, and the teasing yarns, such as damsels of a certain class can alone spin, will be found instructive to aged gallants, whose passions are apt to o'erstep their prudence; if the exposure will make only one old sinner pause in his career, our object will be gained." On the Monday following the 16th, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 12) from Hansill—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:—"The Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, according to promise, informs Messrs.

Before I received that letter, I had an appointment to see Miss Mills, and 1 went to 18, Upper Montague-street, according to the appointment—I saw Miss Mills there—I had asked Hansill for Miss Mills' address, and he said he did not know it—I did not see Hansill after my interview with Miss Mills—on 18th April, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 13) from Hansill—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"7, Bennett-street, April</p>

I am open to see you from seven to ten on this evening, and from eight <hi rend="italic">to</hi> nine to-morrow morning, after which time I shall decline seeing either you or other persons respecting this matter, which must take its course; my object in wishing to see you was to render you a service no other person could render, which I even could not render after the first of the series of letters appears; as in this letter one of your letters will be given, in which you refer to Mrs. H., also to Mrs. Laurie, of Hyde-park-square, and the doings at Westbourne-park Villas, by seeing me yourself this evening. These letters may be handed over to you, and the matter arranged; but I need not add, if the first letter appears I shall then not be in a position to keep back the others; you are at perfect liberty to show this letter to any one, but if you act wisely you will see me this evening. I will see no person but yourself, and advise other parties to do the same. I am, Sir, yours obediently, <hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN HANSILL</hi>.")

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Certain letters of Miss Mills's have been put in evidence, did you receive these letters from Mr. Bevan, your client? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do not know whether they had been in his custody from the time he first received them—I had but one interview with Mr. Hansill—my object in going to him was not to pay a sum of money to prevent the publication of any letters that had been written by Mr. Bevan—I did state that although I was not directly authorized by Mr. Bevan, still I thought he would submit to a little extortion—I meant what I said—I meant that a sum of money might be paid to put a stop to the publication in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>—if Hansill had acceded to that I should not have given him a sum of money at that time—I should first have communicated with Mr. Bevan—it was my intention to convey that to Mr. Hansill's mind—I said "in the event of my client being induced to entertain the idea of a compromise will you be the medium of endeavouring to effect it"—I made that application to him, in consequence of his having advised me not to have anything to do immediately with the parties—I do not know that the word "immediately" was used—I followed that up by asking if he would be the medium to effect the compromise—he said decidedly, no—I did not convey <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him that I would bring an action against him for libel; I meant that I would proceed by indictment—he said if an action was brought he would justify—he also advised me to indict any parties who attempted any extortion—I do not remember that he referred to a letter Mr. Bevan had written to Miss Mills—he did not say that an apology was wanted for a grossly insulting letter which Mr. Bevan had written to Miss Mills; I do not think anything of the kind occurred—he did not say he had seen Miss Mills—he said a female had called, but he declined seeing her, as she would not give her name—he did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184908200089"></xptr>
               <p>not say he received the letters from a female—he did not say Mr. Befan had written a letter to a lady calling her a "bore," nothing of the kind—I said if he had the letters he represented they must be forgeries—the subject of my interview was the letters written, or alleged to be written, by Mr. Bevan—my interview was to prevent the publication of any letters in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, and to obtain them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he advised you to have nothing to do with the parties; what had been said about the parties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing, except that I applied to him to know if he could give me a clue to the parties who had given him the information, and it was then that he advised me to have nothing to do with the parties—the interview ended by his consenting to keep the letters out for the next Sunday—it was after that that I received the letter from him requesting an interview, which I declined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury, there being no proof of the publication of the letters by Mills; and further, that to sustain the charge against Hansill as an accessory, a personal aiding of the principal to escape from justice must be shown.—See The Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Chapple</hi>, 9 <hi rend="italic">Car, &amp; Payne, p.</hi> 355, <hi rend="italic">and Central Criminal Court Sessions Papers, vol</hi>, 27, <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> 169. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">with respect to the second objection</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">the Court deciding against the first</hi>,) <hi rend="italic">contended that any assistance to the principal towards accomplishing the intended object would be sufficient</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">urged that the word "assisting" did not necessarily mean an assisting to escape from justice, but any aid offered to a felon after the commission of the crime, such as destroying the inditia of guilt, interfering with the evidence, or making the acts of the principal available for the purpose intended; but even if an assisting to escape from justice was necessary, it was a question for the Jury whether that was not made out by the act of endeavouring to compromise the felony, and so preventing criminal proceedings being taken against Mills.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE ERLE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that some act should be shown tending to the escape of the principal; and the question was whether, upon the ground taken by Mr. Huddleston, the acts of Hansill did or not tend to impede the prosecu-tion of Mills for the offence she had committed</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered it would only amount to a composition of a felony.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE ERLE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">would, if necessary</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">by consent</hi>) <hi rend="italic">take a special verdict upon the facts, and reserve the point for the consideration of the Court of Appeal.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BAVAN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>, Were the letters Miss Mills wrote to you ever out of your possession till you delivered them to Mr. Fynmore. <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, No.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FYNMORE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>, Did you consent to abandon the prosecution against Mills, on her pleading guilty to the misdemeanor. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I made no arrangement whatever with her as to her pleading guilty to the misdemeanor, nor with her Counsel, and I am not aware that anybody did—I am not aware that the prosecution for the felony was abandoned upon her pleading guilty to the misdemeanor, and I am not aware that any arrangement was made; none has been communicated to me—she was not tried for the felony, because she pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor.</p>

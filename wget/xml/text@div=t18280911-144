            . On the 3d of September, I was at the end of a Court, in Whitecross-street; I heard a cry of Stop thief! but being infirm, I did not step up - the prisoner ran past me about twenty yards, then put his hand across his breast, took the bundle from his left hand and then threw it on the ground; he was taken almost immediately - he ran against a house that was being repaired and was stopped.</p>
               <p>MRS. NEWSUM. I am the wife of George Francis Newsum. I sent my son with a bundle containing these things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down Beech-street, and saw a bundle on the stones - he said at first that I snatched it from him - then, that I picked it up, and walked away, which I certainly did; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and a gentleman took me - I merely saw it lying on the ground.</p>

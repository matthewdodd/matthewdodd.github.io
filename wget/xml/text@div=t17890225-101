            , the sister of Lord Carlisle: it happened the aunt of her ladyship, in her life time, knew something of the mother of the defendant now at the bar; I dare say her attention to that woman arose from the poverty of her circumstances, and therefore it was that her ladyship condescended to have dealings of an insignificant kind with her; but her ladyship being a person in the most eligible pecuniary circumstances, and being exact in all her dealings, could never let any debt accrue to such a woman as the mother of the defendant; there might be, perhaps, a pound, or two, or three, or even five pounds owing to her, but there could not be more. Gentlemen, Lady Mary died 1787; soon after her death it entered the mind of the mother of the defendant and herself conjoined with her mother, to bring a charge on Lady Juliana, the present prosecutrix, as the executrix of Lady Mary: when this account was first made known to her, of course she enquired into the circumstances, as the improbability of any debt being due, struck her mind, and all those who knew her; they conceived therefore, that if it was of ever so trifling a kind, it must be an imposition; but when I tell you the debt was one hundred and ninety pounds; and when you know the situation of the parties, you will be ready to conceive there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250133"></xptr>was too much ground for such a supposition: Gentlemen, Lady Juliana communicated this demand to her friends, and as they were assured it was an imposition, of course there was a denial of payment; every possible enquiry was made into the affair of all the confidential servants of Lady Mary, many of whom knew the prisoner's mother, and her situation in life, together with every transaction; and upon the result, her ladyship was advised to resist this demand. In consequence of that it was, that they first began with a suit at law against Lady Juliana, as the executrix of her aunt; to this action there was a plea put in, and it was regularly defended, and it was as regularly tried; and the young woman now at the bar was brought forward on that occasion, to sustain the account given in by her mother, and I believe she was the only witness at that trial. What particularly passed at that trial I shall not trouble you with at present, but it is sufficient to say that, with very little hesitation, indeed, the Jury found a verdict for the defendant Lady Juliana; and the effect was that there was an end of that claim upon this lady, as executrix of her aunt. Gentlemen you would naturally conceive Lady Juliana thought she had now got rid of these people; but she was bitterly disappointed, for they came to her house, and made disturbances there of the most alarming kind; and she found there was something yet to be done, before she could totally be freed from this inconvenience. Then it was, that as in consequence of the verdict, a certain sum of money for costs might be recovered; it was suggested to her, who knew herself very little of this matter, I dare say, that if the mother was taken up for those costs, they would feel it in such a way, as to cause them to desist in future from such an interruption as I have mentioned, and on this account alone such a measure was adopted by the advice of her attorney, and it was hoped there would be an end of this business. The mother was confined, her situation was that of object povery, she not being able to discharge those costs. Gentlemen, then arose that evil of which we complain; the human mind, as is but too common, growing more and more wicked by degrees, they thought of that, which astonishes me when I think of it, and which I dare swear will astonish you when you hear it; for these people having had the audacity to put their first iniquity into force, I am surprised that according to any common degree of understanding which they possessed, they should have hit on this mode of proceeding: the idea of pursuing Lady Juliana, as executrix, was dropped; and the demand was then set up as a charge of debt to the mother from Lady Juliana herself: this could not have been verified without some application to some gentleman of the law, and I am happy that I am provided here with that testimony from those gentlemen themselves, because, it appears to me, that they should be heard, and heard in order to give that apology which their conduct seems to require; for upon an application from a woman like this, charging such a lady as that with such a debt, which was almost of the same amount as the former, and the issuing a legal process certainly demands some apology; and you will hear that she went to an attorney, and told her tale, that the attorney believed her; and then came about that evil which almost makes one shudder when one thinks of it: the attorney was persuaded to issue a writ, and bailiff's officers were employed, and Lady Juliana was arrested, and arrested under circumstances, that upon my honor I can hardly keep my temper while I am describing it, she living at her brother-in-law's Mr. Delme, in Grosvenor-square, coming out of her house, and going into her chair, she was attacked by two of those ruffians, who told her ladyship, forsooth, that they had a writ against her, and that she must go to a spunging-house; such was the state of Lady Juliana! and what was the state of her feelings you must<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250134"></xptr>judge, in forming an idea of a young lady of fashion in the hands of these ruffians, about to tear her away to a spunging-house; she desired to go to her brother's, which she did; but when there she was subject to the insults of those fellows; her brother infinitely composed thought of going to Mr. Gregg, her ladyship's attorney, away he went to Mr. Gregg: Mr. Gregg came and found Lady Juliana in a spunging-house; what her situation was I will not call your attention to any more, I am sure it must have made an impression upon you similar to what it has made upon me; after what I have told told you there can no longer remain a doubt on your minds, that this second attempt to gain property from Lady Juliana, was in consequence of the failure of the first; no pretence had ever before taken place of Lady Juliana being indebted a farthing to this woman, not a syllable; every person in the world from whom inquiry was made, put an end to the first demand; but the second is an instance of such an extraordinary iniquity, which if it had not happened I should hardly have thought it possible. This makes the foundation of the present charge, that of the young woman going before the proper officer, in order to make an affidavit of this debt; the circumstances therefore it will be proper to trouble you with, will be those a little antecedent to this time; in order that you may collect a little what the probability of this case was; with respect to the case, I trust, when you have not heard half, there will be very little doubt: - with respect to the prosecutions for perjury, in common cases of perjury, it happens that the perjury is to be proved by more than one person, the law saying, which pays no respect to ranks, God be praised! that when one person is on oath, and another upon oath, without some reason assigned, there shall be no preponderation; therefore Lady Juliana stands in that situation which the law has placed her in, there is oath against oath with respect to the action that was brought in consequence of the arrest, they have never had the audacity to proceed; that action is at rest, and it is at rest, in that way that furnishes me with a proper testimony to prosecute: Mr. Gregg, her ladyship's attorney, did every thing that became him by his vigilance and activity, and he has obtained a non-pros. The suit is at at end; if it had not, Lady Juliana, could not have prosecuted for this offence; but as it is, there is an end of all the charge set up by this young woman against her ladyship, although it is true, that the law has placed them in that situation, that oath is to have its avail against oath, yet there is another deposit which the law has placed in your bosom; you have the account which is given by the young woman as to the debt; you will now hear her ladyship upon oath; you will determine what degree of credit her ladyship's oath will deserve from you, from the necessary circumstances of her testimony; with respect to the single circumstance alone of debt, or no debt, there is oath against oath; the circumstances in the present case will be many, but they will be such as I trust will, in your minds, bring about even a more pleasant effect than if the testimony was to come from witnesses; because from the circumstances attending the nature of things, we are enabled to conclude of the certainty of truth being in our possession more frequently than from witnesses themselves, because as we cannot dive into the hearts of witnesses, we do not always know whether they are speaking truth or not; and, therefore, circumstances themselves form a better basis and reliance for our conviction. The first thing necessary will be to prove that the woman went before this officer, and made this affidavit; that will not admit of a moment's doubt: after that you will hear her ladyship's testimony, and it would be impertinent in me to anticipate what that will be; then also, there are several other circumstances, particularly that at which I rejoice inasmuch as it affords an occasion for a man, who was, I verily believe, imposed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250135"></xptr>on by that young woman, to tell you what passed, why he permitted such a thing as a writ to escape from him. At present you shall hear the witnesses, I will not at all attempt to impress your minds with any improper bias; as this is a misdemeanor I shall be intitled as an advocate for Lady Juliana to a reply; I have always thought that particularly in a cause for perjury, the advocate for the prosecution ought to be extremely delicate in the management of that which is put into his hands; therefore, do promise my learned friend, the prisoner's advocate, that I shall in the sequel of this business which is intrusted to me, take no unfair advantage I hope of that liberty. Gentlemen, you are possessed of the outline of this business, we shall now proceed to call the witnesses, and I trust the event will be, that with very little hesitation you will be disposed to find a verdict for her ladyship.</p>

               <p>During the whole time, from the death of Lady Mary, till the time of the verdict passing for you, was there ever any demand made for any debt on your own private account? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear any suggestion of that sort? - No, never.</p>
               <p>In point of fact my lady, was there any such debt due from her? - No, never.</p>
               <p>You never had any dealings whatever of any sort or kind with the party? - No, never.</p>
               <p>After that trial, and previous to your ladyship's arrest (a memorable circumstance in your life) was there any demand made on you? - No, never to me.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear that any was claimed to be due? - No, I had not the least suspicion that any such debt was claimed.</p>
               <p>The arrest took place, I believe, the 16th of May? - It did.</p>
               <p>Be pleased, Madam, to describe the circumstances that took place when the arrest was made?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Is there any necessity for that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is to prove, that she herself, at the time of the arrest pointed out Lady Juliana.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. It is certainly admissible evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And it may in this light be also material; for it may be material each way to shew the intention and knowledge of this party who swore to the debt; it is certainly admissible evidence; it certainly will inform the Jury that nothing in the circumstance of that arrest is to make any effect on their verdict, nothing improper in the conduct of the officer, nor even in the defendant herself, only just as it tends to shew the treatment of her ladyship. In what manner was your ladyship arrested? - I was coming out of Mr. Delme's house in Grosvenor-square, my chair carried me to Berkley-square; the officers there caused my chairmen to set me down, and there they told me they had a warrant against me; that was on the 16th of May in the evening, near nine o'clock; I came home to Grosvenor-square, and the bailiffs followed me up stairs, and after waiting some time, insisted on my going to the spunging-house; Mr. Delme was at home at the time; he went to Mr. Gregg's, and left me with the officers.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Lady J. M. Howard.</p>
               <p>How long did your ladyship continue there with them, before they insisted on taking you to the spunging-house? - I believe about half an hour.</p>
               <p>They took you to a spunging-house, Madam? - They did; Mr. Gregg and Mr. Delme came to the spunging-house, and of course I was discharged.</p>
               <p>How long might your ladyship be in custody? - About an hour.</p>
               <p>I take the liberty, for form's sake, my lady, to ask you once more, whether you ever had, in the course of your life, any dealings with the prisoner or her mother, from which any possible debt could arise? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did it happen to you, Madam, to see this woman, the defendant, at the time you was arrested? - She was at the door with the bailiffs.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted your ladyship had no conversation with her? - None at all.</p>
               <p>I do not ask of your ladyship particulars, which would be extremely disagreeable, but you were treated roughly enough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There was a debt claimed then of your ladyship, as executrix of your aunt? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>One hundred and ninety-nine pounds I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That sum has never been paid yet? - No.</p>
               <p>There had been some dealings, my lady, then, between the mother of this woman and Lady Mary? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>That business had never been settled Madam? - They never received any money from me.</p>

            , the mother, was in prison at your ladyship's suit for the costs? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Any of these instances, which my learned friend wishes, we will admit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There were some memorandums in a book of memorandums, a short time before her death, of sums paid, but not of sums due; there were a good<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250139"></xptr>many articles? - Yes, I do not know what they were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It has been asked my lady whether there were any account of Lady Mary's in which she made herself debtor to

               <p>Had your ladyship the smallest occasion to believe that there was a shilling due to that woman at the time of the death of Lady Mary? - Not the least, and on my own account, not a shilling.</p>
               <p>I believe, Lady Juliana, it was understood that Lady Mary was very exact in the accounts of her money? - Yes, there was not ten pounds in the whole left that I know of.</p>

               <p>I am an attorney, I was agent for Mr. Gregg at the time of Lady Howard's death, I recollect the action that was brought in the Common Pleas, against Lady Juliana, as executrix of her ladyship's aunt.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the time of the trial of that action? - Yes, I was.</p>

            , beginning April 1784, and going down to December, 1786; she was examined very fully in that case.</p>
               <p>Do you remember whether any other paper was exhibited on the part of the plaintiff? - Yes, there were two other papers exhibited to prove something out of a book, which I believe now the Counsel has before him.</p>
               <p>Court. What any of the witnesses said in that case, in the presence of the witness, is evidence.</p>
               <p>Lavine. The witnesses were examined apart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who was called first? - She was examined herself, and she endeavoured to sustain the demand of the mother against the present prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Did she at that time say any one syllable of any demand; that the mother had any demand from Lady

             to her mother.</p>
               <p>That cause ended in a verdict for the plaintiff? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember this being said by witnesses in the presence of the present defendant, and proved to her satisfaction in her presence, that no debt whatever was due from Lady Mary?</p>
               <p>Court. The verdict tells that.</p>
               <p>In consequence of this I believe the plaintiff in that action was committed for the costs? - Why Sir, in consequence of their very much molesting us and Lady Juliana, we recommended it as the only means of quieting them, as they were almost always together; and some time in the middle of December we issued a writ against her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250140"></xptr>Lady Juliana at first did not think it necessary to take this miserable old woman for the costs, but she did it as a means to get rid of the nuisance? - We recommended it to her, I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner after the arrest? - I know nothing of the arrest; she came to the office frequently, and all times she has claimed a debt due to her from Lady Juliana as executrix; and after this arrest another action was brought in the name of the mother against Lady Juliana as executrix; I believe that gentleman, Mr. Redhead, was the attorney in that action for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I understand from you, that this poor woman being troublesome, she was sent to gaol for the costs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And this woman being troublesome, she was indicted for the perjury? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>That is the history of the business, I believe? - Compassion might have induced Lady Juliana if she had not been troublesome.</p>
               <p>You never understood she had any other demand? - She always pretended that the judgment Lady Howard had recovered against her was for want of assets; therefore she must continue that demand against her executrix.</p>
               <p>Do you look upon her as a mad-woman? - I do not know; her conduct was certainly curious to be sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. She has often insisted on her former demand, but she thought her defeat arose from want of assets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>My learned friend says, that because that woman was troublesome she was committed; it was in the power of Lady Juliana to have committed her for the costs as soon as those costs were taxed? - Yes, clearly.</p>
               <p>Out of compassion to a miserable old wretch she refrained? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But at last, because they were so troublesome a writ was issued? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And this prisoner was indicted because she had perjured herself and arrested Lady Juliana in consequence? - We told Lady Juliana, that our idea was, that she ought in justice to be arrested, but we could not do it till the action was non-prossed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I suppose you know nothing of this, but what was told you in your character of attorney to this woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Does your Lordship think that whatever is said to an attorney under such a character, that he shall be at liberty to disclose it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, there is no man in the profession, I trust, who would be more ready to anticipate an objection of this sort, in any case where it was fair and sit to take place, than I am; and I have anticipated the question, and I think I am perfectly equal to the task of obviating all reasonable doubts in your Lordship's mind. I agree, that any thing that is a fair communication in consequence of the situation of attorney and client is not afterwards to be divulged, with the exception, however, where the interest of the publick and criminal justice is concerned; because all that I ask of Mr. Roberts, and all that I wish to ask of another Gentleman, are facts, not secrets, committed to the confidence of an attorney; and would it be endured, that a person about to commit a crime should shelter himself by going to those who are, in many circumstances within the seal of confidence and secrecy; and that, therefore, those who in other relations do stand with their mouths closed, should not be witnesses for the Publick, and for the administration of the justice of the country? suppose a man intends to commit a forgery, or high treason; and I choose the last case for my argument; suppose he should go to some Gentlemen at the Bar, to whom the secresy applies equally as strong, and should state to him, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250141"></xptr>had it in his contemplation to do some flagrant act of high treason, and that he desired to know how he might do it with safety; if it became a question afterwards on an indictment for treason, whether that man had done such a fact, should it be permitted, that any technical rule of the confidence between an attorney and client should sacrifice the whole interest of the community. My Lord, I ask no secrets of Mr. Roberts; but I ask him, Did not she ask of you to arrest a Mrs.

            ? and I ask, what secret there is in that? and I say, that this woman communicates in artful and disingenuous terms her case to Mr. Roberts; and I desire to know what fact she desired to be done; whether she desired the arrest to be made; whether she desired his clerk to go with her to swear the affidavit; and whether she pointed out Lady Juliana to the bailiffs. Is not it common to see a man, of the character of my friend Mr. Gregg, called upon to prove the hand-writing of his client; for in many other cases, what other way could a man possibly have in proving a hand-writing? If, therefore, I am asking facts of Mr. Roberts, not within that seal of confidence, I am intitled to have them answered.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you prepared with any authority, that any line of distinction has been drawn, and that it has been dispensed with in any case, except the one you mean, high-treason.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Undoubtedly I am not; and if I have succeeded, I do not want it; I seriously complain that my learned friend has not condescended to state to me the grounds of his objections; I agree there is nothing short of high-treason, that admits an attorney to disclose the secrets of his client; but I say I am not asking those secrets.</p>
               <p>Court. Though Mr. Silvester has not stated the grounds of his objection, I will state shortly the reasons on which I conceive the objection is a good one, and then what I conceive to be the line; for it by no means follows, that because Mr. Roberts happened to be the attorney of the party, that there is no question which you may be permitted to put; I perceive that the privilege in question is not the privilege of the attorney, but of the client; and that the attorney, if inclined, has not a right, nor ought to be permitted by a Court of Justice, to make that attempt; for it is for the sake of leaving the course of law, both civil and criminal, open to all the King's subjects, that they are permitted to consult and advise with those who prosess the business of the law, with freedom and with confidence, and that they may collect their real opinion, and be properly as well as honestly informed, that they shall be at liberty to make a full disclosure without the hazard of any privilege in their civil rights, or subjecting themselves to criminal prosecution: the privilege can never extend to a suppression of that evidence which would have existed without it; because it does not shut the mouth of the attorney as to any facts which came to his knowledge, prior to that connection, or exclusive of that connection; so that it never can have the effect of obstructing publick justice; because it is the evidence, which arises from such communication alone, that is to suppressed; then I am not aware of any case, except that of high-treason, which authorises, I will not say impels, an attorney to disclose in a Court of Justice, the communications made to him by his client in the course of any professional employ, or any professional consultation, to the prejudice of the life, fortune, or liberty of that client; the law forbids all mankind to be the repository of the secret of treason, and the fact of reception, and concealing of the secret, is without reserve a crime in all who do it; I conceive in all other cases the law to be clear, that you are not at liberty to ask an attorney to any conversation that passed, in the course of his employ as an attorney, between him and his client, nor to any fact disclosed to him, in the way of instructions for his legal proceedings; you are certainly at liberty to call him to prove a handwriting,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250142"></xptr>to prove the fact of an arrest, because these are things that make no part of his instructions, nor of the confidence, under which he is employed, but beyond that, you are certainly not permitted to examine him in that capacity; and, therefore, the objection being in some degree conceded to by yourself, and in my opinion in part, a good objection, I think the objection will depend on every question you ask.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Roberts. I believe I had got the length of asking you, whether you knew the prisoner at the bar? - I do.</p>
               <p>When did you first become acquainted with her? - Some time in the month of May, the same day that the affidavit was sworn, I do not recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Did you prepare the affidavit yourself? - I drew it, and my clerk copied it; I did not attend the defendant to swear it; I did not issue the writ, I did not deliver it to the officer; my clerk took the whole of it from me to the officer.</p>
               <p>Now I will ask you a negative question, to which I think there can be no great objection: Did the defendant apprise you of the situation and rank of the person to be arrested? - She did not.</p>
               <p>She did not tell you where that person lived? - She did not mention where she lived, only the square, not at any person's house.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to believe, previous to the arrest, that the person who was to be the subject of that action, was of the rank that you afterwards found? - I had not.</p>

               <p>Is she the person that went with you to the Filacer's?</p>

               <p>Did you attend her to deliver the writ to the officer? - I do not know whether she went with me or no; I carried the writ to the officer, I believe she might, I do not recollect every person that goes with me.</p>

               <p>Do not you know that she went with the officer to accomplish that arrest? - I do not, the action she told me going to the Filacer's was against a Mrs. Howard, who lived with a Mr. Delme.</p>

               <p>State upon your oath what the prisoner told you was the condition of the person you was to arrest, and where she lived? - I have told you.</p>
               <p>I will make you tell me further, I repeat my question; who did the prisoner tell you, you was to arrest? where she lived? and what was her condition? - She shewed me the house, and we staid in the square two hours; I did not know the lady.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came to Armstrong's office, who did she tell you, you was to arrest? - I had not the pleasure of seeing her at first; she told me to go up with her into Portman-square, and there to arrest the lady; I do not recollect what she said.</p>
               <p>In what situation of life did she describe the person to live that you were to arrest? - She informed me she lived there with a gentleman; I cannot say what she said, there was very little passed between her and me.</p>
               <p>Court. You shall answer the question, do not shuffle and prevaricate? - I can tell no more than I heard.</p>
               <p>In what condition of life did the woman at the bar describe the lady to live that you were to arrest? - She said she believed it was a lady that was kept by some gentleman.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, Sir, that she said she believed she was kept by some gentleman? - I cannot say any more; I am not clear in just the expression that she made use of, she signified that she was a lady of easy virtue.</p>
               <p>When was you to find this lady of easy virtue, and under what circumstances? - We were to wait 'till such time as she came out of doors.</p>
               <p>What, from her gentleman? - Yes, I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Well, you went to the square? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you wait there? - About two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>And at last this lady of easy virtue came out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In her chair, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far did you attend her chair? - We attended it down as far as Berkeley-square.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner with you at the time you made your caption? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say when she pointed out your prey to you? - She said, that was the lady, and she desired me to arrest her.</p>
               <p>Where did you make your caption? - I spoke to the chairman, we were as polite as we could be.</p>
               <p>You did not overturn the chair, I suppose; you were as civil as your natures would admit of; then you took the lady back to her keeper's house? - We desired the chairmen to take her back to her house.</p>
               <p>How long did the lady continue in your custody? - About two hours, or an hour and a half; she came down to Mr. Armstrong's in Carey-street.</p>
               <p>What, it was the lady's choice to go to this spunging-house? - I believe the gentleman and she concluded to go.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that now? Did you not take her there? - To be sure I went in the chariot with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is the first time and the last you ever had such company.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, I wish to ask you, how you came to take the lady from Mr. Delme's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250144"></xptr>to Mr. Armstrong's? - For the better convenience of settling the business, because we would not disturb the lady to keep her there so long.</p>
               <p>Do you fancy I can take that for a true answer, that you took the lady to the spunging-house for her convenience; how dare you give me such an answer? - I do not know it was so.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that? think before you do? - It was to shorten the business, while the servant went to Mr. Gregg's; we went to Carey-street.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that, or do you not? - I cannot say exactly the words I made use of at that time.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir, why did you take her to the spunging-house? - I had not the pleasure of knowing who the lady was.</p>
               <p>Had not you before that time known who the lady was from her servants? - There was not a servant that I had any conference with.</p>
               <p>Were you in such a house without making any enquiry where you were, and who was your prisoner? - We went up stairs, and I never saw any other person, but the gentleman that was with her.</p>
               <p>Are you a Sheriff's officer now? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. There can be no objection in your pointing out to me what you conceive to be the circumstances from which it appears, independent of Lady Juliana's evidence, the credit of which I shall never leave to a Jury, that there was no debt due to this woman from Lady Juliana. My Lord, the fact to be made out to the Jury is, that the allegation of the defendant was untrue; I feel extremely reluctant to do that which the right of my learned friend, and the justice of the Court calls me to do; I am put into this situation to prove it by piecemeal, I am not justified in going to observations as by way of reply; I am called on now to sum up that evidence which has been given; if I am right in asserting that, all that is incumbent on me to prove, is, that no debt was due at the time of this affidavit from Lady

I am content so to take it; I have the positive oath of the prosecutrix; I have in addition to that a chain of circumstances under the hand and the oath of the defendant herself, by which I expect a verdict; I mention those circumstances but slightly; it is proved by Lady Juliana first, that no debt is due; next, that no transaction has passed between her and the defendant, or the defendant's mother; next, I have the defendant, on oath, I have her examination in the Court of Common Pleas, where she attended as a witness of her mother, in an action brought by that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250145"></xptr>mother, not against the present prosecutrix, as a debt due from her, but proceeding on the idea, that is due as the executrix of Lady Mary; she is cross-examined, she proceeds to the full length of disclosing all she knew on that subject, she does not intimate an opinion, she does not intimate a suggestion that Lady Juliana owes a shilling; what have we more? we have her laying by during six months application at the office of the attorney for Lady Juliana in that action, pressing for something from Lady Juliana, never pretending that any thing was due but as executrix; and she has put in a miserable plea of want of assets: - It is proved by the testimony of Mr. Lavine, that from the time of that application down to the time of this arrest, this woman never made any demand on Lady Juliana in her own character; if I want additional testimony I have it from Mr. Roberts; I knew him elsewhere; I respect him as much as his character deserves; and I do not mean to say I respect him slightly; he has not had a single question put to him about the conduct of this woman, whether she did not, the first moment she came there, say Lady Juliana has defeated me as far as she is executrix of Lady Mary, but I have a debt of her own which no plea can defeat, I will arrest her, and hold her to bail; was not that the language of a woman that had a real demand? but was that her language? My Lord, if I were addressing myself now to the Jury, I should have no sort of difficulty on the result of the verdict; if I want addition to all this, not addition to the credit of Lady Juliana; but that addition which the law requires in a case of perjury to counterbalance the oath that is made by the defendant, which is contradicted only by the oath of Lady Juliana, I might receive additional confirmation even from that miserable witness the Sheriff's officer; for is there a man of the Jury that can doubt, first that there was no debt due from Lady Mary; and next, that there was no debt due from Lady Juliana, but I have no other burden upon me than proving there was nothing due at the time this affidavit was made; and I think I have done that very sufficiently, and need not even to mention the great uncertainty that there is of any man among us, even of high condition, being arrested going home to night, if persons are to be arrested upon such affidavits; though I know that in such a case an indictment for a conspiracy would prevail, and the parties be convicted; if my learned friend can make out a debt due from Lady Juliana, let him, let him disgrace her in the face of her country; and then the Jury will attend to it, and will pay no more respect to the oath of Lady Juliana, than to the oath of the prisoner; but if he cannot prove such a debt due, it seems to me, with great deferance to your Lordship, to hold out, as it mere, an incitment to perjury, unless the case is permitted to go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Roberts. Do you remember any application being made to you on the part of Lady Juliana, for an account of the demand of your client? - I do not recollect any requisition to me for a demand; Mr. Lavine and me had some conversation about her, and I had at that time-given up the business.</p>
               <p>Was you ever furnished by the defendent with any particulars of the demand against Juliana? - I was furnished with the particulars of a demand as against her, but when I saw it, I did not conceive it to be a demand against Lady Juliana.</p>
               <p>Was it, in point of fact, a demand against her? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Lavine. State to me the steps that were taken to non pros. the action? - There was a non pros. signed for want of declaration.</p>
               <p>In consequence of any previous notice given? - We put in bail, I attended the very next morning upon Mr. Roberts, and told him what had happened.</p>
               <p>Court. My only doubt is whether I ought to leave this evidence to the Jury or not; in point of law I have no doubt at all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250146"></xptr>of the general proposition stated by the Counsel for the prosecution, being a true one, which is, that perjury may be proved by circumstances as well as by positive testimony; and in my opinion the rule of law is not critically stated, when it states that it requires two or more witnesses to convict of perjury; if there is but one called, that the defendant cannot be convicted is certain; but that it requires two or more witnesses to the fact, I conceive to be different; I conceive that no person shall be convicted of perjury on the evidence of one witness only, of what description soever; the credit of the witness never comes into the contemplation of the law or the Court, when this point is under consideration, the addition of circumstances to that testimony, and if circumstances proved by other witnesses, may be evidence to be left to a Jury; my doubt is, whether we can pick out in this case circumstances proved by other witnesses, that seem sufficiently to go to the non-existence of the debt from Lady Juliana to the defendant, to be left to the Jury as an additional legal supply of the defect of evidence, not as the supply of the defect of the credit of the evidence, but as a defect of evidence.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Was the bill that was delivered you by your client, after she employed you as attorney in the action, with a view of instructing you in this action? - With a view of giving me instructions for the declaration.</p>
               <p>Court. Then unless the prisoner's Counsel desires it, I cannot permit you to answer that question; the circumstances that appear to me, Mr. Garrow, are, first, that the action was not proceeded in; that alone I do not think would be sufficient to go to the Jury; because if it would, it would follow, that this would apply in all cases where an action was discontinued for any reason: here are circumstances to shew that there was no account of the demand ever given, though there was an opportunity of giving it; and there are circumstances enough to shew that the prisoner acted certainly (if that were the question) upon malicious motives; but the only doubt I have is, whether there are circumstances proved by other witnesses that go farther than that the action was not proceeded in; however in this case, if it pressed, I will leave it to the Jury, giving the prisoner the advantage of saving the point, whether it ought to have been, in point of law, left to the Jury or not; whether there are, exclusive of the evidence of Lady Juliana, circumstances of the non-existence of the debt sufficient to be left to the Jury?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am perfectly satisfied there are; I wish it to go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, to favour me on the part of the defendant at your bar: Far be it from me to throw any imputation on so respectable a lady; far be it from me to justify the brutal conduct of the officer who arrested her: I do not stand here either to justify the one, or to accuse the other; but I stand here as Counsel for that woman, who is intitled to your verdict; I say intitled to it, because unless she is convicted by direct and legal evidence, though her situation is that of a poor, ignorant, frantic Jewess, and the prosecutrix a lady of large estate; yet the law extends to one as well as the other. Gentlemen, the crime imputed to her is the crime of perjury; that crime is stated to be that she swore a debt due to her from this lady: when oath comes to be weighed against oath, you cannot say which it is that has sworn false; when I say this, I do not mean any imputation on that lady; I mean it merely as an abstract proposition of law, that when it is oath against oath, the law will not permit that person to be convicted of the crime of perjury; but that oath, it is said, may be confirmed by a number of circumstances. We have had it confirmed in this Court, by circumstances corroborated the oath of the person, and proved that what the other swore was absolutely false; if the bill had been delivered with the dates to it, and the lady could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250147"></xptr>have proved either that she was out of the country, or that the person who charged her was not in the country at the time, that would have been a strong circumstance to have proved the perjury. Gentlemen it is told you by the learned Counsel, that gentlemen may be arrested going from here: there are instances where men have been convicted of illegal arrests. The Counsel who conducted this prosecution, said it was the strongest instance of criminal audacity, and that he would not raise your indignation, though he endeavoured all in his power to raise that indignation at the treatment the lady had met with from the officers; but Gentlemen, the prisoner at the bar, whatever her crimes or faults may be, is not to answer for the misconduct of others; what they have done they are answerable for; and faults of this kind should come clear before you, and women of the description of the prisoner are not to be oppressed. It is not the high rank of the prosecutrix, it is not the abilities of the Counsel that will make you swerve from what is right; because what is law for her to-day, is law for yourselves to-morrow. You will consider your own situations; if that woman could be convicted on this indictment for perjury, how could you arrest any of your customers for goods delivered by yourselves; perhaps you make the affidavit, and the moment your customer proves that, he is to indict you, and bring you to that bar. Gentlemen, the fact for you to try is, whether in truth and in fact any debt was due from Lady Juliana to to Lear Elias; it is for you to determine whether an oath taken even by the most respectable person in this country, is sufficient to convict any one of perjury, because if it is, it is the power of any man, let him be ever so bad, to be a witness against one of you; you may stand at that bar, because you cannot object to his competency, though you may to his credit; you may be first of all swindled out of your goods; then when you arrest the man, he may stand up here as a prosecutor against you; he has a right to be believed, if it is once laid down in this or any other Court, that the single testimony of any witness, if competent, you are to give credit to the question; how much credit, is another point, but the law makes no distinction.</p>


               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have taken the liberty of stopping my worthy friend, in consequence of the orders I have received from my client; Lady Juliana has attended to what has passed here to-day, and she has found it necessary to prosecute the present defendant, of whose conduct my learned friend has not even attempted a justification, and whilst I say, that there are no terms in the English language sufficient to express every honest man's detestation of the crime of perjury; and that my client, therefore, thought it necessary to prefer the present indictment, that society should not suffer from attempts to pick her pocket of a sum of money, to prevail against her, so as to become an example for others; but she instructs me to say, that she would be more favoured than any body, if a verdict should be obtained on evidence of her own, on which there could be the slightest doubt in the minds of lawyers, that it was not confirmed according to all possible technical rules; it is not in consequence of any judgment of my own, whatever respect I may have for the Court, I still hope I should be intitled to a verdict on the result of this inquiry; but in consequence of the desire of my client, I am to desire the Jury may find the defendant, Not Guilty; it is fit the prisoner should understand that she owes it to the clemency and goodness of Lady Juliana; she has no obligations to me; I should have found it my duty to have superceded that request, not only for the lady but for the public.</p>
               <p>Court. I think it right to explain the reasons upon which I have not resisted the very humane desire expressed by the prosecutrix; for under some circumstances I have thought it my duty not to give way as desired, but to put it to the Jury, to find a verdict according to the evidence, for by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250148"></xptr>no means in general is it consistent with justice, that a defendant should be acquitted even though it is the desire of those who are most honourably prosecutors, because the public is infinitely more interested in this prosecution than the individual that brings it forward; nothing certainly can have been more honourable than the whole conduct of this prosecution, from the commencement of it, to the desire that now calls upon me to express my sentiments; therefore I wish the ground upon which I give way to that desire to be fully understood: if the matter stood in such a situation, that consistent with the general rules of law established for the protection of innocence, and which have no sort of relation to the rank, character, or situation of parties, how high or how low soever; if it were clearly consistent with these rules, that this case should go to the Jury upon the credit of Lady Juliana's evidence, I am pretty confident there could not be a moment's hesitation in any man's mind in Court, if that were the question; but the rule of law is precise, and fixed, that upon the single testimony of any witness whatever, not confirmed either by other direct and positive evidence, or by strong circumstantial evidence, a person shall be convicted of this particular offence, and the law makes no distinction, whether that witness shall be the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the lady who has now given testimony, two characters equally intitled to belief I am sure, or whether it shall be the meanest and most profligate character that comes with proper competency into a Court of Justice; in turning this in my mind I should have found some difficulty in picking out the circumstances that were to go to your consideration, to shew that the oath that was taken by the prisoner was false, and within our own knowledge false; both which are necessary; and even if there had been circumstances to shew that the oath was literally false; that is, that there was no debt due from Lady

             to the prisoner in her own right; still I am of opinion, that would not have been sufficient to find the prisoner guilty on this indictment; because it is necessary in the crime of perjury, not only that the oath should be false, but that it should be known by the party to be so at the time. Now it appears from the evidence for the prosecution, particularly from Mr. Lavine's evidence, for every part of it is given, with the utmost fairness, it appears that before the time of this arrest, that before the verdict in the Common Pleas, and before any idea of that verdict, this misguided, and worse than misguided woman, had been making repeated demands, and pressing and teazing, but always demanding as a debt due from Lady Mary, and making her demands against Lady Juliana as executrix; - now there is no positive proof whatever on this trial, and it would be difficult, perhaps, to produce it, unless we were to go into the secret communications with her attorney, that this woman knew a point of law, which many people, not of the profession, in this Court probably may not know at this moment; which is, that a person cannot be sued in their own right for a debt due by the person to whom they are executor; it is a proposition perfectly clear in point of law, but there is no evidence before us, that the prisoner knew that distinction; before, therefore, she could be convicted on this indictment, we must have evidence to prove, not only that there was no debt due from Lady Juliana in her own right, but that there was no debt due from Lady Mary; because this woman might have conceived that she had a right of action against Lady Juliana, and not distinguishing as a lawyer could do, might have brought that action wrong. Now, that there was no such debt due from Lady Mary to her mother, there is strong proof from the verdict in the former case to believe, but it does not necessarily follow, that that witness knew that she had produced an account on the trial of the former cause, which I see contains an inventory of the delivery of a great many things; now, those things may or may not be all that was delivered to Lady Mary, some of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250149"></xptr>them unquestionably were, for there are entries in Lady Mary's memorandums of payments, but the prisoner might not have known what money her mother might have received of Lady Mary, for that knowledge has not been brought home in evidence to her to day; I think I can say without any danger to the prisoner, and without any offence to public justice, that if this prosecution had been carried on with a very vindictive spirit, much stronger evidence might have been produced against the prisoner, but on the evidence to-day I do not think that I am bound in duty to prevent your complying with the humane desire expressed by the prosecutrix; at the same time I should have found an uneasiness in leaving the point to your verdict from the evidence, for this reason, because independent of the fact of the perjury supposed to be committed in the affidavit, the conduct of this woman has been so attrocious, so brutal, so malignant, and so contrary to every thing that renders a person fit for society, that there would have been some difficulty to divest your minds of all prejudice, and though that conduct does not directly go to substantiate this charge, I mean the brutal behaviour of the prisoner, and those employed by her in the arrest, in the manner in which it was conducted, and still more in the instructions given by the defendant for that arrest, as far as the law can reach, that it seems to be due to public justice, to punish that offence, and I am sure it would be wise, if certain other methods were pursued still to punish this woman, but I do not think there is any thing against publick justice on the evidence now before you in your acquitting the prisoner of this charge.</p>

You owe it in part to the clemency of your prosecutrix, and in part to the very strict and rigid rules of law which must govern in these cases, that you have escaped to day that punishment which there is very strong reason to believe you have most richly deserved; it will depend on the future humanity of Lady Juliana, whether you will escape from all punishment, because there is a part of your conduct from which the acquittal of this Jury will not protect you, and which certainly subjects you to punishment, and to punishment of severity. If you escape further prosecution, I hope her ladyship's lenity will not be abused, as it hither to has been, and that you will be conscious of your own guilt, and behave accordingly.</p>

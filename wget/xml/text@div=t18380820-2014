On the 21st of August, a little before three o'clock, Host a work-box, which I had seen that morning on the loo<lb></lb>table in the drawing-room on the ground-floor—it contained the articles stated—the house is almost surrounded by a garden, and the street-door is kept open during the day—the garden-door was kept locked—I think I have some recollection of the prisoner—he has been a sweep, and I think has swept the chimneys in my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Victoria, in Crescent-place, Hampstead-road. The Gothic Cottages are just across the road—I know the prisoner. On Tuesday, the 21st of August, about twenty minutes after two o'clock, I saw him under Mr. Richardson's palings, with another boy—I did not see the other boy get over, but I missed him, and then I saw him hand the box over to the prisoner, who walked away with it—they went away together till they got to Augusta-street, and then they parted—I ran on and followed the prisoner with the box—they walked right up the Albany-road, and turned down by the canal—I ran round to see if I could see the prisoner again, but could see no more of him—I then ran and asked Mr. Richardson if he had lost any thing—I and the police<lb></lb>man went to look for him, but could not find him—I saw him in custody eight o'clock—the box seemed a dark one, with some white about it—it poured with rain at the time—I did not know whether I might take him, as I could not see a policeman.</p>

I produce a box which I found in the plantation adjoining the Regent's-canal, on Tuesday evening, about half-past seven o'clock—I heard the prisoner had been seen to go there, and I and my brother constable hid ourselves, to see who would come for it—just afterwards the prisoner came, and when about four yards from the box, I suppose he saw me—he had passed by the box, and was making</p>

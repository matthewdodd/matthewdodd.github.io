            . I am an officer of the City. On Friday, the 6th of May, in the evening, about six o'clock, going down Leadenhall-street, I observed the prisoner coming from the skin-market, with a quantity of lead on his shoulder; I followed him down St. Mary Axe, to a little plumber's shop. I waited until he came out. I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and count some money. I went into the shop, and asked the man if he had brought the lead; the lead was laying in the shop on the floor. He told me, no; it had been left there by the party at the bar. I run up St. Mary Axe, and took the prisoner into custody, and asked him where he got the lead; he said, he knew nothing about any lead. I asked him if he knew Mr. Watts, where he had left it; he said, no. I then took him back to the shop, and asked Mr. Watts if he was the man that left it; he said he was. I got a person to take the lead to the Compter, and I immediately took the prisoner there. On Saturday morning. I went round to several plumbers, and found that the lead was Mr. Piper's, and that their <rs id="t18140525-23-deflabel134" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

I am sure the prisoner is the man who had the lead on his shoulders. I produce the lead.</p>

This piece of lead is one of the pieces of lead that I gave to Mr. Piper's foreman. I can swear to this piece. Mr. Piper's foreman gave it to the prisoner to carry it to his master. Mr. Piper was to account to me for it. The place I last saw the lead was in the kitchen. There was more lead besides this. The other went to Mr. Piper, this did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Piper. I had the order to repair the sink. My foreman cut up the sink, came home, and went out to look after another job. The prisoner was my servant. Instead of bringing this lead to me he took it elsewhere.</p>

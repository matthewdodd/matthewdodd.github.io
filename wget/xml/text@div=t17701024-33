On Sunday the 10th of September, I and my wife went out about four in the afternoon, and left the apprentice and the maidservant to take care of the house. I came home about ten o'clock. I went up into the shop. I found the trap-door open, and all the windows open; then I thought the house had been robbed. I went to the drawer where my gold and silver work was, and missed the whole; and in my bed-chamber the drawer belonging to the glass was broke open, and the two gold rings and some other things were taken out. My maid-servant informed me that the prisoner went out about five o'clock; that made me suspect him. I made a proper search after him, and on Wednesday following he was taken in Whitechapel.</p>

            . I have been acquainted with the prisoner about half a year. I met him on Sunday, the 16th of September, near St. Andrew Church in Holborn; he had a bundle in his hand. He said he was going to his mother's in the Fleet Market, on dress himself, and asked me to hold the bundle till he came back again. I gave it to him when he came again.

            . When my master went out he left the prisoner and me to take care of the house. The prisoner sent me out for an halfpenny worth of plumbs; a little after that he sent me out for an halfpenny worth of apples; I took the two children with me. I was gone near a quarter of an hour; When I came back the parlour-door was locked. He took the applies from me, and damned me, and said, he could get no rest. He went down into the kitchen; when he came up again, he took the key of the shop, and went up stairs; a when he came down again he went out. He said he should not be gone five minutes, and bid me not go from the door; this was about five o'clock; he did not return again. When I went to set the tea-things, I missed four tea-spoons; I thought my mistress had laid them by; when she came home I asked her, and that led to a discovery of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. At the end of March the prisoner came to me, and said that he had had an offer from Young and M'Donald, for whom he was agent, of 700 quavers of barley, for which he had got a buyer on the north<lb></lb>east coast, and which he was. willing that I should purchase, as there was a margin of profit upon it; and also that he had at the same time got 300 quarters of barley, making in all 1, 000 quarters, which he would find a buyer, for, and I should have no trouble about the matter, as he would be able to place it immediately; virtually he was, to sell the 1, 000 quartos, I paying for them in the, first instance., and he giving me that which he sold them for—in pursuance of that, I paid; him 1, 554<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—he handed me bills to the amount of about 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; among them was this one for 453<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this for 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., both purporting to be drawn by Giles Hall and Co.—the 453<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill is drawn on John Taylor, late Taylor and Francis, Nottingham, and accepted by John Taylor, payable at the West<lb></lb>minster Bank, and the other on Richard Day, seed-crusher, Earl-street, Maidstone, Kent, and accepted by Richard Day—the first of the bills was paid, that was for 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—one was dishonoured, and the other is not due—they were, both drawn by hall, and accepted in the, name of Chaplin—I said to the prisoner, I must have a remittance from Hall to cover these bills—he said he would write to hall and ask him for the remittance, but instead of a remittance he gave me another bill of exchange, which I was up willing to take—it was neither of these—on 23rd July this bill for 237<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. came due, and was returned—there were several other, bills due at the same time, and I said to the prisoner. "You must see Hall about it; I can't have the bills coming back in this way"—two or three days after he said he had heard rumours of Hall being likely to stop payment—on) the Saturday after that I saw him again, and he said would go down and see Hall at Gloucester—on the Monday afterwards I saw him in the morning early; and asked him whether he had seen Ball—he said h, e had not been down, but he had bad a letter that morning from Hall to say, that he should be, obliged to defer his payment for two or three months—I said in that case I must have some security, and he gave me one, on a cargo of oil-cake, which has not realised yet, and an acceptance—these two bills have never been paid—after the case of the bill, of lading, inquiry were made, at my instance, at Nottingham, Gloucester, and Maidstone.</p>

I spent the evening at Mrs. Bryan's; I had some supper there between nine and ten o'clock; I sent out Mrs. Bryan with a five-pound note to get half a gallon of beer; she brought in the beer, and four one-pound notes, and the change. When we had drank the beer, I expressed a wish to go home, as it was pretty late. She recommended that her son should see me part of the way home, to which I accepted. I am a stranger to that part of London. We went into the coach stand public-house; I wanted to treat him, and called for a pot of beer; it was at Mr. Christian's, in Ratcliffe Highway. This Bryan handed the pot to the prisoner, and two or three other men that I did not take particular notice of, and the prisoner came up to me, and asked me what ship I belonged to; I told him the St. Domingo, a seventy-four. He said he had a cousin on board that ship, of the name of William Gifton. I told him there was not a man named William; but Jack Gifton. He said, his name was not Jack, and he wished to know what sort of a man he was; I told him, and he made an account to me, that he had not heard from him a long time. I told him he was a mess-mate of mine, and that Jack fell off the yard-arm, and was lost. In consequence of that, the prisoner recommended me to an aunt of his, and said I should be well treated, and he wrote down the direction to enquire for Mrs. Browne, Iron-street, Lambeth; after this, the landlord wished the company to quit the house. Three men came out along with me, and proposed to seeing me home to my lodgings. They brought me down thrown some small courts, and into one called Starch-court, as I hear. They dragged me into the court, and held me by the head and arms, and took my watch, and what money I had. I had the silver in my waistcoat pocket, and the notes in my fob pocket, with the watch; they ran away; they took my watch, my silver, and bank notes; the prisoner, Bryan, and another man held me; but I could not swear to the other man. The officer detected the watch. I am sure ther prisoner was one of them, I was only hearty; I was not drunk, to my recol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100054"></xptr>lection. I went to Mrs. Bryan's in the morning; Bryan was not at home; the mother requested I should stop, and take breakfast, and I stopped with the intent of seeing him. I breakfasted and dined there. I went to my own lodgings when it was dark. In a couple of davs after, I told the publican, Mr. Christian, and asked him if he knew the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. I only know Mrs. Bryan; I did not know her son before; the son had been to sea, and he and I had some discourse together, and she recommended that he should see me part of the way home. It was about eleven when I went to this public-house. I did not know where the prisoner lived; but when I went to the landlord, he gave me to understand something, though he could not tell where he lived. In consequence of that, I applied to Mr. Jackson, and told him of my loss. I took pains to discover the prisoner. I gave a description of Bryan. I requested the landlord if ever they should come into the house again, to give charge of them, and I left my address with the landlord; the landlord could not tell me the prisoner's name. Nobody has told me about a reward for convicting a man of a highway robbery; Mr. Jackson, the officer, has not told me there was a reward; I have heard of it; but have not believed it. The prisoner was taken up last Thursday. I was asked if I should know my watch if I saw it. Bryan was in custody since this robbery, he was taken up on the Saturday following; I made a charge against him of this robbery, because I knew him to be one of the men. I was hearty, and had been taking a drop; but I was not intoxicated, to my recollection. I will swear that the prisoner came out with me, and I have always told the same story to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. I gave nothing to this old woman but some beer; I was sober when I left Mrs. Bryan's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Here is what you swore before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>"I was much in liquor, I then went to the Bunch of Grapes, and was much intoxicated. I wanted to get away, but I had not power, and I fell asleep, and the pataole found me."</p>

            . I am a police constable of Shadwell. Last Wednesday evening, I, and two other officers, chanced to meet with Craig; knowing he was wanted for a robbery we took him to the office; as we were going up to the office, he asked me whether it was for a robbery that happened since this, and I told him no, it was for one formerly. In consequence of information that I received, I went to Battle, and asked him for the watch which he had purchased of the prisoner; I told him he must give it to me; which he instantly did I have the watch. I then informed Craig, the prisoner, that I had got the watch he sold to Battle he said, if that was what I wanted him for, he could prove he had had that watch twelve months, for that he won it at skittles. I then sent for the prosecutor; he came on Friday; I asked him the maker's name in the watch; I told him the right name. I don't know how Bryan came to be discharged. I think it was not entered into against Bryan; I think there was no deposition taken about Bryan; he is now in custody about another robbery, and we were advised not to bring him here; the other robbery is of a much more serious nature than this. I asked the prisoner how he came by the watch that he had sold to Battle, and he said he bought it of Bryan. I shewed it to no person but Bryan. I knew the prisoner to speak to him; but I did not know where to find him when I wanted him.</p>

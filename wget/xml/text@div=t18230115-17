On the 3d of January, about half-past 10 o'clock at night, I went into a room which had neither fire or candle in it, to see if the window was safe, it was so. and I found the prisoner laying on the bench with a table rather over him; I asked what he was doing there? he said he was very sleepy; I told him to go out, for we were shutting up - he went out, and I shut the door after him; I fastened the door and windows - I went again and looked all over the house, and left all safe. I was the last person up; I heard nothing in the night. I got up about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, came down stairs and went into the bar, and found all the tills pulled out, and three of them gone, which contained a great quantity of halfpence, and four half-crowns wrapped up in a bit of paper; all this money was gone. The tills and money were safe after I turned him out of the house at night. I examined the house, every thing was safe in front, but in the back parlour I found a lower pane of glass cut clean out, it was quite large enough for a man to get in at - he could then come from the parlour into the bar; he was not in the back parlour the night before; I am certain that window was safe when I went to bed - it is a good height from the ground, but there is a shed he could get on and easily get in. The wash-house joins the parlour, I went in there and found two of the tills laying there empty, and a pail gone, and the wash-house door open, which was bolted and locked the night before - the key of which hung in the bar, and still hung there; I think the lock had been pushed back; I found the other till empty in front of the bar. I was the first person up in the morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. George in the East. On Saturday the 4th of January, about five o'clock in the morning, before day break, I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Phillip-street, about one hundred and fifty yards from the Angel, coming in a direction from there, and going towards his lodgings - he had a pail on his shoulder, and a flank of beef curled round on the top of it. I asked what he had got, he made no reply - I asked again, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Beef," that he belonged to a ship in the London Docks, called the Hope - he went on a few yards, and kicked violently at the door of a butcher's shop; I asked what he wanted, he said,</p>
               <p>"Some pork," he said he bought the beef in Ratcliff-highway. I saw two officers over the way, whom I called to my assistance; he wanted me to go to the butcher's where he bought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150011"></xptr>beef - they went with him, and I remained with the pail, I found it very weighty, and on lifting up the beef, found a piece of printed cotton, and under that a quantity of penny pieces and halfpence; the officers brought him back, and said he had bought the beef. I then said what I found in the pail; we took him to the Thames Police Office, and I afterwards counted the copper, it amounted to 4 l. 19 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The pail was not on my shoulder - A. The moment I came up he put it off his shoulder on the ground.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner with Kendall, who called to me, the pail then stood on the step of a butcher's door - we went and enquired about the beef, and returned with him and examined the pail, which contained 4 l. 19 s. 6 d., a cotton apron and some beef; a silver sixpence was among the halfpence, I afterwards searched him, and found in his trowsers pocket three half-crowns, a shilling, and fifteen-pence in copper, all loose in his pocket. I asked how he came by the money in the pail, he said he could not tell, but that in his pocket was his own. Pawson claimed the apron; I found a key on him, which he said belonged to his lodging, but would not tell where that was.</p>

            . The pail and apron are ours - the apron was made out of an old gown, and I have had the pail a long time. I do not know how much copper was taken, but there was as much this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told them how I came by the pail, and the officer said he knew the man, but never looked after him. I have no friends in this country, and have no knowledge of the robbery. As I was on my way to my ship, two men engaged me to carry the pail. I always use this house when I am in this country.</p>

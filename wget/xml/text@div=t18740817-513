I live at 370, Holloway Road—I serve in a confectioner's shop—on the 23rd July I served the prisoner with a twopenny bun—he paid with a half-crown—I discovered that it was bad before, he left, but did not tell him so—I afterwards ran after him, and told him that he had given me a bad half-crown—he said "Oh, have I; I was not aware that I had any bad money about me"—he was going to give me a good shilling, but I held him by the arm, and took him back to the shop—I then took the shilling and gave him the change—I gave the half-crown to my employer.</p>

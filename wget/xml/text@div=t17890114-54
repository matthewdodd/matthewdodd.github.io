My house was broke open on Monday, the 29th of December, between two and six. I discovered it on Tuesday morning when I got up about six; I was the first person up; when I went into the bar, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140072"></xptr>found the till was forced from it's place. It was not locked, but two long nails were drove through from the top, to prevent it coming out totally: it would come put so far as to put a person's hand in, but not wholly. There was no lock to it.</p>
               <p>Was the bar quite inclosed? - Yes; the door of it was not locked. All the halfpence were gone, till and all.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing left in the till on the over-night? - It was almost full of halfpence. I had been out, spending the evening, and came home about half past one; my wife and a servant sat up for me. We always examine the till over-night; it holds almost three pounds. When I came down in the morning, the servant went to open the windows; they open into a court; and he found them put to; and, on my examination, I found the shutters of the back-parlour had been opened by a crow, and the bolts which fastened them within-side were wrenched off. The bolts all run from the inside. It appeared to me, that there had been a hole bored in the shutters with a gimblet or an augre, or something of that kind. The window-sashes are within the shutters: the sash was down; there was nothing to fasten it. There appeared to me to have been plain marks of force on that window; that window is between five and six feet high; the window looked into a public paved court. I examined the beaufet in the parlour, and found that had been broke open also. The servant-man fastened those shutters over night; he is here. The castors were gone; and a felt hat, that hung up in the parlour, and an apron, which my wife put into the bar the same night; it was a linen apron, with a particular mark upon it. They drank about half a bottle of rum, and took away about half a bottle of brandy; which I believe was the means of their being discovered. The two prisoners had used my house about three or four months; but finding they had no visible way of getting a livelihood, my wife desired they would not come there any more.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you so delicate in Rosemary-lane? - Yes, so delicate to keep away people of this description, if we know it.</p>
               <p>I am very glad to hear it. - I have nothing further to say about it; the other witnesses will describe the manner of their being apprehended.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the house. I am a watchman, in Bishopsgate-ward. At a quarter past four, almost half an hour, the two prisoners came by me; the tall man came first, I believe his name is Norrington; they came by me in Widegate-street, Bishopsgate-street; and when he came almost to me, he dropped an iron crow: I did not know at that time that it was an iron crow for certain, for there was a deal of snow and ice on the ground, which made the noise not so loud. The shortest man, Craig, stooped, and picked it up. I followed them about a hundred and fifty yards. The tall man, Norrington, slipped down again, aside the place; and the other man, that had the crow, made his retreat back the same ground that he formerly came to: I followed him, and mended my pace; and when he found I gained ground upon him, he dropped the iron crow, and ran away. I went to stoop to pick up the crow, and slipped down on the ice, and hurt my left knee. My light went out, and I called to my comrade watchman to stop him; he stopped him immediately, before he was out of my sight. I said, Bob, hold him fast, for I have got his play-thing. His play-thing! he said he did not know what that was. I went up with the crow. He was taken to the watch-house, and searched; and in his waistcoat pockets there was found a quantity of halfpence: that was the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140073"></xptr>Craig. I wished to go on my stand, to find the other; I went back to the spot where I saw the tall man fall, and there I found him laying; I desired him to get up, but he was intoxicated in liquor. We got him up, and took him to the watch-house; he was searched by the superintendant to the constable, and in his right-hand coat pocket was found a quantity of halfpence, and in his left-hand coat pocket was found a white linen apron. Mr. Bailey took the apron out of the man's pocket, and I believe he has it in his possession now.</p>

               <p>Was he, at the time you stopped him, in sight of your comrade? - I will not positively say whether he was or no. It was just at the turn of the corner: my comrade was in Sandwich-street; he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>The man that you stopped, at the time your comrade called, what was he doing? He was running. I could not see exactly where my comrade was, but I heard his voice in Sandwich-street, at the corner of Widegate-alley.</p>
               <p>Was he sober or drunk? - He was middling. I took him to the watch-house, and the officers of the night searched him; he had a quantity of halfpence. But I cannot tell the name of the man I stopped; it was the tallest man. (Craig.)</p>

               <p>Milner. This is the crow I received from Jolly, and I marked it.

I went there, and the beaufet, or cupboard, this part exactly fitted with it. I afterwards went round, with my brother officers, and there were three purchases that fitted entirely with this end of the crow.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of December last I was asked to go to a club, at the French Horn, in High Holborn, to spend the evening. I went there; and in the course of the evening I came down, and I saw this young man in the tap-room: knowing him, I asked him to spend the evening, and he went up with me. It being Christmas time, and a number of young men there which I knew, I staid rather longer than was prudent, which is the occasion of my coming before this court; and in coming along, a young man asked us to go home with him to his lodging, as we were both in liquor. We agreed to it; but when we came there, it was past two o'clock, and we could not get in. We went into Drury-lane; and there finding a house open, we had a glass, and made the best of our way to Spitalfields, this young man coming along with me; he said he did not know what to do; I told him I believed I could get him into my lodgings. At the end of the new cut which leads to Bishopsgate-street, he stopped behind; I did not miss him for some minutes; I walked on slowly, and came to Long-alley; I called, and he did not answer. On my calling, two men came from out of the ruins, where they where building. I knowing he was behind, thought to wait for him; accordingly, I went up to this part to ease myself, and I saw something lie white on the ground, which I found to be these halfpence and the iron crow. I took it up; this young man called after me; I took the halfpence. Seeing the watchman in the street, I threw the iron bar on the ground; thinking it was a dangerous thing, and of no consequence. Turning down Catharine-wheel-alley, being very much in liquor, I tumbled down; and was stunned, which the watchman knows: nor did I know this man was taken, till I saw him the next morning in the Poultry Compter.</p>

I went abroad to Africa, along with the black poor, to that new settlement, Searleone. Mr. Angerstein not having a vacancy in his family, he wished me to go to work, to one Mr. Sudor, at Greenwich; which I did, till the frosty weather set in so intense, that I came up to town to see for employment; and I had a suit of cloaths, which Mr. Angerstein had made me a present of; and I took those cloaths to a brother of mine, and sold them to him for one guinea. He not having gold nor silver enough, he made an agreement to pay me part in halfpence, and part in silver. I told him I had no objection to take the halfpence, if they were good; he said he would not promise that, but what had halfpence there were among them he would change, and give me silver for them. I received thirteen shillings in halfpence from him; they were done up in papers; I counted them, to see if the quantity was there, and put them loose in my pocket, with intention to take them home: and going from there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140075"></xptr>across Bishopsgate-street, I met with one Mr. Bond, who was second mate of the Vernon, the ship I went abroad in; he invited me to go into a public-house: I went with him to the top of Oxford-street, to see his sister; there I dined, and stopped till about seven; when I parted with him, as he was going to stay there all night. I came to the French horn, in Holborn, and sat down in the tap-room, and called for a pint of beer. This other prisoner came down stairs; he knew me before, and asked me to come up and spend the evening with him; which I did. We stopped there till nearly two in the morning. There being a young man there, a friend of this young man's, who saw we were both intoxicated, he invited us to go to his lodgings, in Great Wild street; when we came there, he could not make his landlord hear. I wished to get home, being uneasy at having the halfpence in my pocket. We three, I believe, had a glass or two at the bar of a public-house, and then we parted with the young man; and coming along with this prisoner, he said I might go and sleep with him; which I agreed to. Upon coming through Moorfields, just by the watch-house, I stopped: I heard some noise in the watch-house; I went round to see what it was. There was some watchman had taken up some girls of the town; I stopped some time looking at them, thinking this young man was with me; but he had got before me I followed him across Bishopsgate-street, towards the end of Wide-gate-street, he stepping rather on before me, and I coming up behind, kicked against something with my foot; I stooped, and picked up that iron bar. I followed him down Catharine-wheel-alley, nearly towards the bottom of it, where I entirely lost him. Not knowing where his lodging was, I concluded to go back to a night-house in Bishopsgate-street. I had this iron bar in my hand, which I dropped down; it might feel cold to my hand. Coming out at the end of Wide gate street, the watchman stopped me, and searched me, and found the halfpence, and eight shillings and sixpence in silver. The prosecutor said he had lost no silver, and the Lord Mayor ordered me to have it again. Nor did I know that this young man, while he was absent from me, had picked up that apron, or these halfpence, or the bar.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner Craig for some years; I always knew him to be a very sober, industrious man; I never heard any thing against his character. He worked for Mr. Sudor, which he has mentioned, last summer. Mr. Sudor is now a petty constable, and obliged to attend at quarter sessions. He was discharged, about a month ago, for want of work.</p>

               <p>I live at Greenwich. I know Craig; he lodged at my house about eleven months; he always paid me extraordinary well, and kept very good hours.</p>
               <p>Court to Norrington. Where is that young man that was with you at the French-horn? - He is a hair-dresser, and I suppose he is busy.</p>
               <p>You have opened a fact, which you might have proved by all the people that were assembled there, that you spent the whole of the evening at the French-horn; have you any of those people here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Craig. You say you have a brother, to whom you sold your cloaths for a guinea, and that he paid you in halfpence and silver; is he here? - He would very willingly have attended, but he is gone into the country, to a sale.</p>

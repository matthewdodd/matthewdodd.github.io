            . I met with the prisoner on the 27th of June, half after eleven at night in St. James's street, I took her with me into the Horseshoe and Last, there we drank two bottles of wine; I went out into the street; there familiarities passed between us; she all on a sudden run away in a great hurry, before my breeches were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070020"></xptr> buttoned up; I found my money gone; I lost the money mentioned in the indictment. We had connection with each other standing under the porch which is next to our house; my breeches were down and she ran away in a great hurry. I had connections with this girl first, after that with an other, and after that with this again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other woman, when you went out with this woman?</p>
               <p>Decoff. She was gone; I was twice with her first; I gave her 2 s. and then 1 s. 6 d. more; then I changed a guinea out of my purse. I had shewed my purse to the people I was in company with; the other woman came and informed me she could give intelligence were the woman was that robbed me; I got a warrant and she was taken up; I am sure she is the woman that was with me, and ran away in the manner mentioned.</p>

            . Upon the 30th of June I had a warrant against the prisoner; there was a well dressed woman undertook to shew me the prisoner; she carried me to her lodgings in Petty France; I said I had a warrant against her; she said she had done no harm to any body; I searched her; I found nothing material upon her; I took her from the room to the public house; I searched the house again and then found 14 pieces of copper coin in a little tin box upon the mantle piece in the room; the prisoner said she had had some pieces of such money as this in the room six months before.</p>
               <p>- Clarke. I was along with Bynham the second time; I found these pieces of money (producing 14 pieces of foreign copper coin); the prisoner said she had them of a foreigner a long time ago.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Some of the coin is Geneva, some French, I lost exactly 14 pieces; this piece (pointing it out) I am certain is mine.</p>

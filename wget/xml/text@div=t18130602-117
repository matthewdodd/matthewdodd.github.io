            . I am a constable of Feltham. On the night of the 8th of May a man brought the prisoner to me to put in the cage. It was past twelve. I confined him in the cage all night; he had with him some old iron in a sack. On the next morning I went to the prisoner's house; I took him with me to his house, and there I found a bushel of barley and two sacks with Mr. Shower's name upon them.</p>

In consequence of his being taken up his house was searched. I was present at the search. The sacks are mine; my name is upon them. I had such barley as this. I believe it to be my barley. I never lent him any of my sacks to take home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I stand at this bar a guilty sinner. I committed the act I am charged with, for which I beg pardon. I am fifty-seven years of age, and have two children, whose mother is dead, therefore on account of my age and the children, I pray God to instruct you to pass such punishment as you may think proper, and your petitioner will ever pray.</p>

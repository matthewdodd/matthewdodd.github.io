I am a surveyor, at St. Paul's Lodge, St. Paul's Road, Camden Town—on 19th July, about 1.30 am., while going up High Street, Bloomsbury, near St. Giles's Church, I felt something like the report of a pistol in my right ear, but I do not know what it was, and I fell to the ground—I saw no one—I then saw two men unbuttoning my coat—I have a slight recollection of Riley, but cannot swear to him—I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my trousers pocket, but missed nothing but an ivory two foot rule—was five or six minutes on the ground—a cabman came up and called "Stop thief!"—I think the cab had a grey horse.</p>

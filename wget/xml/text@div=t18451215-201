I am the wife of Edward Gaze, and am the daughter of the deceased—her name was Elizabeth Mundell—I reside at No. 11, Rochester-street, Rochester-row, Westminster—I have known the prisoner about six months—she lodged with my mother—that was not in consequence of my recommendation—a young man who came to our house, first introduced her to my mother—she had been lodging with my mother three weeks—she lodged in the same room with my mother, and slept with her—there was only one bed in the room—my mother lived at No. 1, Providence-place, Brewers-green, Westminster—on Monday morning, the 1st of Dec., as near as I can recollect, about a quarter to eight o'clock, the prisoner called at my house—I was in bed at the time—she told me my mother was very ill, that she had had a fit about seven o'clock, and she wished me to go round directly—I got up instantly, and went—the prisoner told me my mother had called out, "Murder, murder, what are you doing to me? what are you doing to me?"—as we went along, the prisoner told me that some person in the next room had knocked—I said, "Why did not you let her in?"—she said she was holding my mother's hands at the time—on arriving at my mother's room, I looked towards the bed, but did</p>

               <p>it quite shook the room; I asked her what was the matter; she said, "No. thing but a dream;"I thought she was not well, and asked her if I should get her anything; she said no, she did not want anything, but that I had better get up and go for a walk; I said it was too early to walk; she did not reply, but laid still, as though she was asleep; she told me to go for a walk in a very cross sharp manner, and not in her usual manner; I did not think she knew what she said; I watched her afterwards, and she turned several times, but seemed to sleep; she awoke at seven o'clock this morn<lb></lb>ing; she seemed to have a fit; she threw her hands up to her face, and screamed; she screamed, "Murder!" and "what are you doing to me?" I got up and washed her face with water, and asked if I should go for her daughter; she said no, she did not want her daughter; I then went to the woman in the next room, and asked her if I had not better go for her daugh<lb></lb>ter; she said, "By all means;" I asked the woman, if she should hear the deceased, to look to her; this was about a quarter-past seven o'clock; I then went back to deceased's room, and put my bonnet and cloak on; she wai then in bed, lying quite quietly; she asked me where I was going, and said, "Don't go for Ann," meaning her daughter; I told her I was going down stairs; I went to deceased's daughter, in Rochester-row; I came back with the daughter in about a quarter of an hour; when we returned to the de<lb></lb>ceased's room her daughter went in first, and I was at her heels, and followed her immediately; deceased was then lying on the box, just as she was when the present Jury saw her; she had only her night-clothes on; a cord wai round her neck, tied quite tight to her throat with a hard knot; the ends of the rope were hanging down by her side; there were two ends, and I do not think they had been broken; I tried to undo the knot; her daughter trial also; I ran out of the house, and went to the baker's shop; the baker came and cut the rope—when I left the room the three chairs were on the box; when I returned the chairs were removed, and the box was removed a little way from the table where it used to stand; the room was otherwise is the state in which I left it; a medical man was sent for, and came in about an hour; I believe several were called upon; I was present when he came; he said she was quite gone, and everything was to be left; she was on good terms with her daughter."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was acquainted with the deceased Mrs. Mundell for more than two years during the life-time of her husband—I saw her last alive about a month previous to her death—she never herself had any illness while I knew her—she always appeared cheerful, and in good spirits—during my long attendance on her husband, she appeared uniform in her spirits at all times—her husband has been dead two years, but our acquaintance was for two years, while I was constantly seeing her husband, and since that I have known her nearly four years, but not to much since her husband's death—I was not consulted about anything she had taken at any time—on Monday, the 1st of Dec, I was sent for to her room—she must have been dead some time when I got there—her face was pale, swollen, and livid, her eyes wide open, and staring, blood issuing from her ears and nose, and frothy matter, mixed with blood, coming from the mouth—there was no cord round her neck then—it was on the ground—my atten<lb></lb>tion was directed to the neck, believing she had died from hanging or stran<lb></lb>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184512150027"></xptr>
               <p>gulation—I noticed two deep circular lines passing round from the front to<lb></lb>wards the back, marked with discolouration, and only one line at the back of the neck—she died from strangulation, in my judgment—the appearances round the neck corresponded with the mark which would be made by the rope produced, tightly pressed round—it appeared very improbable from the marks on the neck that she could have effected her destruction herself—I believe there would have been a greater regularity as regards these lines, if the death had resulted from hanging, or by other means, with the exception of forcible means being employed behind—I could better explain it by the cord itself—it appeared from the marks to have been applied twice round the neck, and that the pressure had been made in this manner, (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>) as the back of the neck had no mark except the one made by this part of the rope, and there were two distinct lines in front—strangulation was caused by the pressure, and pulling it from behind, and towards the right side, supposing the party destroyed to be laying on the left side—the force or pressure must have been greater applied towards the right side in a direct line almost with the back line—I have not heard that the rope was found tied in a knot, on one side, till just at this moment—that might have altered its position in part, in the removal—the body was placed on the box—the whole trunk when I saw it appeared as if it had been so placed after life had left the body—the rope must have been tied round the neck during life-time, from the marks and discolourations following from the pulling—I did not per<lb></lb>ceive any mark, as if made by a knot—if the knot was pulled back, it would be loose from the neck—there was no mark of the knot on the neck—the rope would be loose after it was let go—I examined her hands—there was nothing amounting to the marks I expected to see, as the consequence of the force used to make the marks on the neck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the bed to have been found in a wet state, would you draw any inference from that circumstance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not certain—it is an ordi<lb></lb>nary thing for the urine to be voided under strangulation or hanging, but of course, as I do not know the precise nature of the fluid, it is impossible for me to say; it is an ordinary circumstance for urine to be voided where death is caused by strangulation.</p>

I thought you had. turned carman, seeing you with a van on Saturday"—he replied "I was only there getting the beer for dinner, and I assisted the man to unload."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. I have been about 15 years a weigh<lb></lb>bridge clerk—there are eight weighbridges, and one Clerk at each—there would be 400 or 500 carts in a day at No. 4 weighbridge, and only one clerk to attend to them—he is there from 6 to 5, and takes his dinner while at his post—there is no one to assist him—if I am a man short I cannot go and relieve him during his meals—it is a very busy place, and especially No. 4—the clerk receives the Weighbridge ticket, weighs the cart, and enters the weight in this book, which is the only book he has to keep, and that book is changed daily—I have seen 18 to 20 carts at the weighbridge, and 18 to 20 men waiting to go off in rotation—I never saw the Co-operative Coal Com<lb></lb>pany's ticket-books—they give us a ticket when they come out, which we sign and fill—in Bull's case the Weighbridge clerk initials the ticket, and keeps it, and the carman then goes to the wharf foreman and gives him the Wharf foreman's ticket, and he keeps it to get his money—with other merchants there is only the wharf order, which the weighbridge clerk initials, and returns to the carman to take into the wharf—when the cart comes out the clerk weighs it, and enters the weight in this book, arid gives a pass to the carman usually at that place; a number of carts are waiting to be dis<lb></lb>posed of—Brooksori has been employed there 5 or 6 years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Most of the vans go 6ut in the morning, arid about 8 o'clock in the afternoon—dinner time is a slack time for a little while—there is no entry of order 1844 in the weighbridge book on 6th September—there are two weighbridges in this yard—each weighbridge clerk is moved Weekly to another weighbridge; they take it week by Week, and the books are changed daily—no one named George Doyle has coals from the Great Northern Yard—there was a man of that name, but it is three years since I saw him.</p>

The books kept by the weighbridge clerks are ex<lb></lb>amined by me as chief weighman every morning, and we make out a return specifying the names of the merchants, and the tonnage that has been dane during the day, and that list is sent in to the head office daily, showing what each weighbridge has done—the officials can then see exactly what took place on any particular day—if a merchant goes up he inquires, and similar returns were made on this day.</p>

On 15th September I went with Sergeant Miller to the Bang's Cross coal yard from information received and saw Devoil there—I said "We are police officers, and are making inquiries about two tons of coals stolen from this yard on the 6th September; we have heard that you were seen carrying sacks of coals into the Mitre Tavern, Copenhagen Street, on the 6th"—he said "Yes, quite right; I went there to get some dinner beer; I met carman Young there; he asked me to assist him in carrying the coals into the house; I carried four or five sacks; I saw some empty sacks on the ground before I carried any"—I said "Did you see the van loaded, or see it before you got to the Mitre?"—he said "No"—I said "Will you accompany me and Miller to the tavern?"—we went there, and saw the landlord, Mr. Parker—I said to him in Devoil's hearing." We are police officers making inquiries about two tons of coals stolen from the Great Northern Coal Yard on 6th September; we have heard that coals were delivered to you on the 6th"—he said "Yes, I did receive some coals on that day"—I said "Who delivered them, and have you got the receipt?"—he said "That man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Devoil</hi>), carman Young, and another stout man delivered them—he handed me a receipt from a file, and I showed it to Devoil, who said "Yes, I received the order from Mr. Parker for two tons on Thursday; I gave it to Young to do; I signed that receipt, and gave the money to Young at the same time"—the landlord heard that, and said "This is how it occurred. Devoil was in the bar on 4th September, and asked me if I could do with some coals; I asked Devoil what price they were; he said 'They are as low now as they will be this year, 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton.' I said 'You can send me two tons.' The coals were not delivered till Saturday"—I said to Devoil then "After that statement you must know whose truck the coals came out of"—he said "I don't know anything more about it; when I received the order I gave it to Young to do"—I then gave him in custody—I gave Brookson in custody on 15th October—the other two prisoners had been before then under examination at the police-court, and the matter was in Messrs. Wontner's hands—I had had a conversation with Brookson about this some time before.</p>

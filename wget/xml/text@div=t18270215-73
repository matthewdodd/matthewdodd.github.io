            . I am apprentice to Mr. Lanbury, of Whitechapel-road. On the 15th of January I went near Percival's-buildings, to call a carman, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner walking to and fro - I saw two men on the top of the hospital buildings - I am sure the prisoner is the person I saw walking backwards and forwards; the London Hospital wall is near Percival's-buildings - the building is close to the wall - it is built against it - I saw the two jump down - there were three small carts near the building - the prisoner took some lead from under the cart, and went towards the White Raven public-house; the other two went the same way - the prisoner picked up the lead, and put it on his shoulder - I met the other two at the corner of Percival's-buildings; when I went back I told the men in my master's shop of it directly; I did not know where to go to find the persons belonging to the Hospital - I had seen the prisoner several times before - and I know he is the man; he passed me quite close, within two or three feet; there was light enough for me to know him.</p>

            . I am a carpenter belonging to the London Hospital; I examined the building called the carpenter's shop on the morning of Wednesday, the 17th of January - the wall forms one side of the street, and Percival's-buildings forms also part of the wall near the shop; I found some of the gutter lead missing; on the Saturday or Sunday preceding, there had been no rain, or I should have discovered it, because it would have come down into the shop; there was no rain on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>L - HACKWELL. I belong to Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th; I received information from the watchmen; I then went to Ayers, and in consequence apprehended the prisoner from his description.</p>

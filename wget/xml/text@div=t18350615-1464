                  </hi>. I am a sailor on board the <hi rend="italic">John Renwick</hi>, West India ship. We were in the river on the 2nd of June, and about to go into the docks—the deceased, John Peter Oram, was a sailor on board the vessel—the prisoner was acting as third mate—we were hauling the ship into the docks—the crew were all pretty active—I just came from aft—the prisoner was just before the fore hatchway—Oram came off the windlass as I came forwards—he jumped off the windlass, and struck the prisoner back handed, and he went over a spar and a chain: it was a sort of trip up as he was standing between the spar and chain—he would not have fallen if Oram had not <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him—he struck him by the side of his ear, or about the ear—I was on the other side of the deck, and could not see nearer—he struck him, as it appeared to me, with his open hand—Menzies got up, and I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and take a knife out—he went immediately and stabbed Oram; but the pilot spoke to him after he had the knife out, before he struck him—he said, "You villain, are you going to stab the man with that knife?"—he was right over his head when he said that—on the top-gallant forecastle—he must have heard him—the prisoner said nothing when the pilot called out, but went immediately, and struck Oram in his left breast—I caught hold of Oram as he staggered—he said, "I am going, I am going "—and as he fell on the deck, he said, "I am done for"—Menzies went aft, and I believe jumped over-board, but I did not see that; but he was brought on boar and again jumped over—Oram was taken aft, and a doctor was sent for—he died between three and four o'clock next morning.</p>

               <p>for they were going to call me in a second time—I did not mention the pilot, or what he said—I never mentioned a word about the pilot; and when I came to inquire, he did not appear—yarn is used to block the vessel—I do not know whether the prisoner had been using the knife to cut the yarn—I did not go to him for any—I did not see him cut any, nor did I see him using the knife at that time—he had been using his knife in the after<lb></lb>noon—it was his duty to serve out the yarn to the ship's company—I never saw that knife before—he had another knife in his pocket at the time, which is in court now—I cannot tell how long we had come from Gravesend—we were towed up by a steamer—I believe I drank two glasses of grog that day—the crew had not been drinking, to my knowledge—I had no beer at Gravesend—I cannot state whether the crew had—I did not say before the Coroner that we had beer at Gravesend—what I said was read over to me, before I put my name to it—we had some beer the night before—I did not say we had some smuggled beer—I had not tasted a drop of any thing at Gravesend.</p>

I belong to the <hi rend="italic">John Renwick</hi>—we were hauling her into the docks in the evening—Menzies was before the fore<lb></lb>hatch—Oram was sitting on the windlass—I heard Oram say, "If you give me much more of your <hi rend="italic">cheek or jaw</hi>, I will put you down in the coal-hole"—before that the pilot had ordered something to be done, and the chief mate ordered the prisoner to get a block from below—he seemed intoxi<lb></lb>cated, and I went to his assistance—I went to where the block was, and passed the end of a rope down to him to make fast to the block, but I was not strong enough to raise it, and called Oram to assist me—he called once or twice, and said to me," Mind yourself, Brown; that block can be got out easy"—he said to the prisoner, "Why don't you move these blocks, those are lashed together off that strap?"—the prisoner replied," You are stronger than me, if you can't get them off, how can I?"—Oram said, "You stand in a better place than I do to reach them"—the prisoner replied, "You get paid for it, and I don't"—Oram replied," You are third mate of the ship, and get 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, how can you say you are not paid for it?"—I then left them, and went aft—I returned in five or six mi<lb></lb>nutes, and found them in the same place—I went aft again, and on returning forwards; saw Oram sitting on the windlass, and Menzies standing just by the fore-part of the hatch, six or eight feet from Oram—I heard Oram say, "If you give me much of your <hi rend="italic">cheek or jaw</hi>, I will put you down the coal<lb></lb>hole"—Menzies replied," You are not <hi rend="italic">game</hi>; I dare you to do it; come and strike me if you are a man"—Oram sprang off the windlass, and struck the prisoner—whether it was with his fist or open hand, I cannot say—I did not notice where he struck him—the blow occasioned the prisoner to stumble over a chain and spar—I think he must have fallen forwards—I do not think it was in consequence of the blow, but he appeared to be going to dodge, and so he stumbled—he would not have stumbled if he had not been struck—I turned my face away for a second or so, and when I turned again, I observed Menzies drawing a knife away from the deceased's breast—I did not hear the pilot say any thing before Menzies struck the de<lb></lb>ceased</p>

               <p>—Oram clapped his hand to his breast and walked to me—I said, "Are you stabbed"—he said, "Yes"—I sang out to the chiefmate" There was mur<lb></lb>der on board the ship—here is a man murdered"—Oram walked a few yards, and the chief mate ran forwards hastily—I went to get some lint, and saw no more of Oram—I heard him say as he was falling, "I am going, I am going"—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the cabin—a man named Owen asked him, for the knife, and he gave him the knife—Owen said, "That is not the knife"—he said, "That is the only knife I have about me."</p>

On the 29th of August I missed a pair of silver shoe-buckles; afterwards I missed another pair of buckles that were my wife's, and a tea-spoon. I charged the prisoner with taking them, and told her if she would confess generously I would forgive her. She told me where these things, and a great many more, were pawned. I went and paid about 2 l. 4 s. for them, and I came home and sent the prisoner about her business. On the Tuesday following I went to a woman's that used to come after the prisoner. I found the prisoner there. I told her I missed several things more, and begged her to tell me where the things were. She then told me of the three books. Then the woman and she began abusing me, and said they would punish me for what I had done.</p>
               <p>Where did she say the books were? - At the same pawnbrokers. They shut the door upon me. I was aggravated by the usage I met with, and went and got an officer, and took the prisoner up. Mr. Townsend is the pawnbroker where the things were pawned.</p>

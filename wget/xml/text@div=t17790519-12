               <p>On the 7th of this month I lost a surtout coat from my lodging before I was up; I had left it in the Kitchen the night before; my landlord's servant came up to me in the morning, and asked if I had taken my coat up with me; I said no; she said then it was stolen. She alarmed her master, who pursued the prisoner, and took him with the coat upon him.</p>

The prisoner came in for a pennyworth of purl; he sent the maid backwards to me for change, which gave him an opportunity to take the coat; she called out to me and told me he had got Mr. Ormes's great coat, and was gone up the Old Change with it; I went after him and desired him to come back; I said he had something that he had borrowed; he said it was nothing but an old coat. He had it wrapped round him under his coat.</p>

I am sure he is the man - They rifled my pockets. They ran off - I called Murder!

Next morning I complained at Queen-square Office, and went with Gillmor and Cooper to several houses in Old Pye-street - I saw the prisoner by the Crown, public-house, and told them he was one of them - They took him.</p>

I took him to several houses, and at last to the Crown, public-house, in Pye-street - the prisoner passed us, and went towards the Crown; the prosecutor said he was sure he was one of them. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

The prosecutor came to me on the night of the robbery-it was very foggy-if I had seen a stranger, I should not have known him again. The prosecutor asked the way to Perkins's-rents. In about three minutes after I saw him again in Perkins's-rents, calling to a woman to let him in. After that, I heard the cry of Stop thief! ran up, and met him - He said he had been robbed. I asked him if he should know any of them? he said No, they gagged him. It was impossible to see a man's face, it was so foggy.</p>

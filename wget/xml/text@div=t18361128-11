On the 1st of Sep<lb></lb>tember the prisoner came to the warehouse, in Fenchurch-street, and said he called from Charles Lee and Co., ship-chandlers at Wapping, who had a considerable order to give for some coffee-mills, and if we woulds end a quantity of samples down, we should have the order, if approved, by next day—I sent a quantity down, with the prices—a few days afterwards the prisoner called again, he stated that Mr. Lee approved of them, and told me to send down a dozen of small sizes and a dozen of larger sizes—I sent them by our young man, with particular instructions not to leave them without the money—he brought them back, and next day I went to see Mr. Lee respecting the patterns—the patterns have never been re<lb></lb>turned—I did not see the prisoner again till he was apprehended—I know nothing of his having them in his possession—I sent then down by a por<lb></lb>ter, and wrote on the list of prices "on approbation."</p>

On the 18th of April, near five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop serving a lady, and the two prisoners came in and asked for ribbon, I shewed them the ribbon; after some time they said it would not do; they bid me good afternoon and went out, I looked at them as they went out, as we had reason to suspect them robbing us some time, I knew them by sight well, Edwards more than Phillips. I thought when I looked at them I saw a confusion in their countenances. I then looked at the things I had been serving, I saw a vacancy in the box of ribbons. I ran out into the street and overtook the prisoners, when I got up to them I stopped them and looked between them, I saw Edwards shew Phillips what she had taken from me. She had a fruit basket. I took hold of each of their arms and told them I would thank them to walk back with me, they asked me what for? I told them I thought they had no occasion to ask the question, they made fun, and said walk back; I said if they did not I should have them secured; when they came in the shop I took the velvet ribbon out of the basket, it had my private mark upon it, Mr. Parry came in and sent for a constable. The prisoner Edwards had a child with her, she said the child must have put it in the basket.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Edwards's Defence. I was going to market, I had the market basket in my hand, we went into Mrs. Parry's shop to buy some ribbon, she had none of the colour we wanted. I do not know which way the ribbon came into the basket, without the child put it in.</p>
               <p>Phillips's Defence. I know nothing about it.</p>

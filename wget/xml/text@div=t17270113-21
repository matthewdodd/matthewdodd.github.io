             (Midwife) thus depos'd. When this Girl's Mother came to me, she desired me to search her Daughter; and upon searching her I found a Man had had to do with her, but I can't say that her Condition was any otherways than what it might have been upon such an Occasion, if no Violence had been used to her; but for my Part, I could never have been persuaded or deluded to it in such a dirty Place.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence. Katherine Southall used to come after me to our Cellar, and would be always giving me Apples or Oranges, or one Thing or another: and I asked her to lend me Six-pence, and she sent it me; I asked her for a Quartern of Gin, and she gave it me; and she asked me to hang her Windows on for her, and I did it, then she asked me if I would drink a Pint of Beer, and I went along with her; and when we came out I asked her to lie with me, and she consented, and came along with me, and took up her Gown Tail that it might not be dirty; and when it was over I asked her to send me a Shilling, and she lent it me; and then said, what shall I say to my Mistress that my Cap is so dirty, I'll not tell her that I have been with you, but I will tell her that a drunken Man run against me and threw me down in the Dirt; the Place is not above five Yards distance from the Strand, and there were People passing by in the Time.

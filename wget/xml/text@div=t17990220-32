               <p>Q. Did you ever see her at all disguised? - A. No. I have seen her out in the country with her husband, and I suspected her husband took her out for the recovery of her health, for she seemed to be in a very bad state of health.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.From your knowledge of him, since the time you have known him, is he not a humane good kind of man? - A. Yes, very much so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to live happy together? - A. Yes, very much so, in my presence.</p>
               <p>JOHN GEARING sworn. - I lived within three doors of the prisoner, when they lived in Tottenham court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not know any thing about them near the time of her death? - A. Not a sentence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her disguised in liquor? - A. No; I have known her fifteen or sixteen months, and never saw her the least in liquor in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing more of this business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how she and her husband lived together? - A. I thought they lived in an amicable state, I never heard otherwise.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Hemmings-court: The morning before Mrs. Quinn died, about ten o'clock in the forenoon, she sent a girl to beg the favour of me to send to enquire the price of some fowls, for Mr. Quinn had shut her out into the court, and she wanted to get in; I did sent, and she got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her again that day? - A. Yes, a little after eleven; she appeared then in her business, the same as at other times, she complained of a pain in her head, in consequence of the severity and coldness of the weather; the first time I saw her was between eleven and twelve, and then a neighbour had bought a rabbit, and said, come in, we will have a glass together, it is cold, and she had a glass. The Coroner sat upon the body, at my house, the Wednesday following; and this coat and bundle were left with me by Mrs. Quinn, the wife of the prisoner's brother, she is not here; but they were in possession of the officer before that.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Warren.) Had you the possession of this bundle? - A. No, Kennedy had; he is not here.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: Having heard that the prisoner had absconded, the Magistrate granted his warrant to apprehend the prisoner; I then went to a house in Hemmings-court, to endeavour to find him, but could not hear of him; I went into the Black-horse public-house, kept by the last witness, and, in the back parlour, I saw the undertaker, and the prisoner's brother.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell us what they said? - A. I observed the undertaker's man, and the bags there, that was on the 8th; I made the best of my way from there to the undertaker's house -</p>
               <p>Q.Without waiting for them? - A. Yes. When I got to the house, I enquired of the woman there, if she had any knowledge of the prisoner, as to his being in that house; she said, she did not know, but she would go and see; she went up stairs, I followed, and in the back garret I observed the undertaker's man that I had before left at the Black-horse, appearing warm about the face, and rolling up a bed that laid in the room; I looked into that room, and saw no person but the woman and this man; I then seeing another door open, which led to the front garret, I looked in there, I saw nothing but a child sitting by the fire; but the woman who had answered me below, said, the man that you want, is in that room; glancing my eye to the curtains of a half tester bedstead, I saw the curtain move; I pulled it back, and found the prisoner squatted behind it against the wall; he was without his shoes; I then secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. You made the best of your way, you say, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200029"></xptr>this undertaker's house - did you go the nearest way? - A. Not the very nearest way, I believe, but the difference could be but very triffling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the Coroner's Inquest? - A. No; the Coroner had then sat.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the body afterwards, did you not? - A. Yes; by the direction of the Magistrate I went to see the body, and had the coffin unscrewed</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any gentleman of the faculty with you? - A. Yes, a Mr. Hanbury, I believe an apothecary; and, I believe, he has something to do with Tothill-fields prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; I observed a violent blow on the left jaw, nearly the size of the palm of my hand; another large blow under the right breast; on the left-hand and arm several lesser marks, which appeared as if the hand had been held up; and a discharge of blood from one of the nostrils.</p>
               <p>Q.Was this violent blow likely to occasion death? - A.Of that I am not a sufficient judge to guess; what there was appeared to be very violent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What you are pleased to call blows, are bruises? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How they came there you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Morris, I believe, opened the head, by the direction of the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MORRIS sworn. - I am a surgeon, in Great Marlborough-street: I examined the body of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, from that examination, what was the cause of her death? - A. I found several marks of violence, but, I think, not such as to occasion death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you particularly examine the head? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks about the head which were likely to occasion death? - A. No, except the mark upon the jaw, and that was a small bruise only, and nothing likely to occasion death; I am rather inclined to think it was occasioned by a fit of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I am aware of what Dr. Thornton will give as his opinion; but if there is a difference of opinion among medical men in that respect, and the surgeon who saw the body, and saw the bruises, says he did not think any of those bruises occasioned her death, whatever sense we may have of the bad behaviour of the prisoner in beating his wife, still, if that behaviour did not occasion her death, it is impossible for you to declare this man guilty of the murder. Under these circumstances, therefore, I think we cannot press this case against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Israel Lyons. On the night of the 18th of August, about eleven o'clock, I was in Fleet-street, when the prisoner picked me up near Ludgate-hill; she is a common woman. I went into a tavern with her, and after having been some time with her, I told her I was rather too late to go to my inn, so I went with her to a friend of hers in <placeName id="t17690906-19-crimeloc102">Bridges-Street</placeName>

I had a guinea, two half guineas, and three quarter guineas in my pocket. What silver I had, I cannot tell. I put my breeches under my head, and being extremely tired, I fell to sleep immediately. I had wound my watch up, and laid it on the table. After some time I was awaked by the master of the house, who told me the woman wanted to go out, but that he would not let her till he had seen me. I took up my breeches and found all my gold gone; there having been no other person in the room but the prisoner, I was sure she must have it. I offered to let her go, if she would give me my money again, but she would not, so I charged a constable with her. He carried her to Covent-Garden round-house. I was present there when he took the very number of pieces from her, and five shillings that I had given her. I took her before Sir

I found she had a bit of tape tied round her body over her shift, and a little purse fastened to it behind, in which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060013"></xptr> I found this money ( producing one guinea, two half guineas, and three quarter guineas.) She all along denied having the money till it was found, then she stormed about, and made a great noise.</p>

               <p>This man met with me upon Ludgate-hill; he treated me with a bottle of wine at the King's Arms, and told me if I would go with him to the Ship Tavern without Temple-Bar, he would give me a couple of shillings: after that he told me, if I would go and lie with him, he would give me more money. He made me a present of it. I went with him, he gave me that money, and he bruised me and used me very ill: afterwards he said if I would not deliver it again, he would send for a constable. I never picked his pocket, or intended to use him ill.</p>

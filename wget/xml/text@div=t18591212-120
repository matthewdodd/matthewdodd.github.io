                  </hi>. I am chief usher at the Worship-street police-court—on the afternoon of 28th November, a charge was made against the prisoner of having murdered his wife—I went to the house at King's-head-court, and went up stairs to the first floor—the prisoner followed me, and the first thing I saw on opening the door was the body of a woman without a head, partially covered with clothing—the neck was lying close to the skirting-board—I placed my hand on the body, and found it quite warm—this was between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I pulled the remaining portion of the clothing partly down, and saw a gash right across the abdomen, about six inches in length—the body was lying quite flat on its back, and perfectly naked—I then observed that three parts of the room had been recently washed, and was quite wet—a little child about two years of age was there, with his head resting on a pillow—Haynes took it up—I removed the pillow, and then I saw the head of the woman lying in a basin, with about a pint of blood in it—the eyes were quite open—there were three large open wounds about an inch in length, on I think, the left side of the skull—the body evidently appeared to have been washed—it was smeary, as if it had been smeared with blood and water—the prisoner was standing by me all the time—he made no observation then, but I took him to the other end of the room, and on looking at his trousers, found marks of dry blood on one knee—I found it to be wet with water, and as if it had been rubbed—it was white—I then took off his coat, and examined his hands and shirt, but saw no blood—Haynes said to him, "Why, you have got a clean shirt on"—he said, "I have not; it is a dirty one"—it was a clean shirt—there was a pail containing blood and water and rags, or some particles of linen; also a basin and a pan—while I was looking at them, the prisoner said, "I hope they will not make it appear that I have done it"—he then said, addressing me, "I wish to speak to you, Sir, and tell you what I know"—I said, "You had better be very cautious what you say to me"—he said, "I wish to tell you"—I then asked him if I should write down what he said—he said, "Yes"—I then took out a bit of paper and a pencil that I had in my pocket, when he stated this—(<hi rend="italic">Reads:</hi> "About half-past 7 this morning, I left home, leaving my wife and child in the room, getting breakfast ready. I went out to look after business. Between 2 and 3 this afternoon, I returned home, and knocked at the street door twice; a little girl answered the door; I don't know her name. I came up stairs and looked about, saw things looking very strange. I pulled the clothes off and found a body lying on the floor, as it now is; I immediately went down stairs, and asked who was the landlord; the landlord came up stairs with me. I then showed him the body, and asked him who had been in my room during my absence; I asked him to get a police-constable; I then went with the landlord to the police-court. The body I know to be that of my wife, Mary Anne Moore. I know nothing more about it. On Wednesday last, I left Hoxton-house"—I asked him if he would sign that, and he signed it thus, "James Mo—," and then left off; whether the pencil would not mark any more, I do not know—the attention of the officer was then taken to him; I believe he would have signed it, but Haynes, the officer, at that moment picked up the fire irons, and that prevented him—Haynes and I took the prisoner to the station—I afterwards saw inspector Bricknell take some clothes from a pail.</p>

               <p>the scull; I think they were such wounds as might have been inflicted with a blunt instrument, such as a pair of tongs or a poker—I then felt the body of the woman that was lying in the room; it was still warm—I can't say exactly how long the woman had been dead, but I should think about six or eight hours—the head was completely severed from the body—it was a clean cut with a sharp instrument—it was not done with one cut—there were no wounds at the side of the neck—there was a circle round; the integuments were cut all round first—I have no doubt that the body must have been quite still at the time, in order to have been cut as I found it—the blows given on the head must have stunned the woman, and I think the head must have been cut off almost immediately afterwards—I am led to that conclusion by the dilated state of the pupils of the eyes, and coagulation of the blood, and the sheets of the arteries having retracted—there was also a wound on the lower part of the abdomen, and the bowels were, partially protruding—the wound commenced in the left groin, and was carried across the abdomen to the right groin—I do not think that wound would cause immediate death—I think it was done after death; it might ultimately have caused death—I think that death was immediately caused by the severing the arteries—I have seen a razor that has been produced—the head might have been severed with such an instrument as that—there was a small portion of steel found imbedded in the muscles of the neck, and close to the bone—this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it is a small speculse of steel—there are several small notches in the razor—the bones were not violently severed—the incision was made right through the articulations of the bones—I have seen the trousers that the prisoner had on that morning—there was blood on them—I afterwards saw a poker, and a pair of tongs; one leg of the tongs was besmeared with blood—I was at the police-court on the following day, the 29th—the prisoner said something to me there; that was before the witnesses had been examined, before the case had been introduced to the court at all—he stated that he wished to have a private conversation with me—he hesitated to speak because the inspector was there—I said, "Oh, you may consider the inspector nobody, of course, as he must be here," and then he spoke, and in a very familiar manner he said "I suppose you are quite aware, Sir, of what is going on in my inside; I have had some substance there for a long time, and have been examined by several doctors"—I said, "Does it affect you much now? he said, "No, not just now, but it does sometimes affect my liver a good deal"—he could not think what it was; it was like a ball or a tumour full of wind—he said something else about steam, but I did not catch what it was—I examined him at the station with reference to the state of his mind; I led him as it were, into a conversation—I did not wish him to know that it was an examination; that was on the evening of the 28th—I did not come to any conclusion as to the state of his mind—he was perfectly rational—there was no difference whatever in his manner the next day, the 29th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Apparently perfectly rational, you mean, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Apparently, certainly—I know that the most insane persons sometimes have the appearance of perfect sanity, so as almost to deceive medical men—the prisoner told me himself during the conversation, that he had been in a lunatic asylum for some months—a person who has been insane at one time is very liable to a sudden recurrence of insanity, especially if there be any exciting cause—the period of a lucid interval varies in duration from hours to weeks, and months and years—there is no doubt that the notion of a tumour, or something full of wind, was a delusion; but I was not aware</p>

               <p>when he told me that, that that had been one of his illusions in the asylum, and therefore I did not think much of the conversation until I heard Dr. Dixon's statement—it is generally stated to be one of the peculiar features of homocidal mania, that the person afflicted with it, commits violence on his nearest and dearest relations.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am the medical superintendent of the Hoxton Lunatic Asylum—I went there in August, 1858—it is a private asylum, but it takes in all classes of patients—patients are sent there from the House of Correction by order of the Secretary of State—when I went in August, 1858, the prisoner was an inmate of the asylum—he was dis<lb></lb>charged from the asylum on 23d November last—I had formed an opinion at that time that he was perfectly sane—when I first came there in August, 1858, he was labouring under mania, with limited delusions—the delusion under which he was suffering at that time was that he had an engine in his inside—he was prone to violence, quarrelsome, and easily excited—he con<lb></lb>tinued in that state until the month of September in this year—he suffered under that illusion up to that time; he then became calmer and better con<lb></lb>ducted in every way, and wished to work in the factory that we have—after that he used to work in the factory regularly with other patients—he got better up to the month of November, when he was discharged—he became quite sane in every way—his actions appeared to be perfectly under the control of his reason in every way—I used to see his wife; she used to come and see him once or twice a week for many months—his conduct towards his wife was very affectionate, always wishing to be discharged, that he might work for her and the children—I did not observe that the prisoner at the time these illusions were on him was more disposed to violence—I have only seen him since in public.</p>

I cannot see but that I am quite capable of work, and getting my living; but if people choose to follow me, and take my character away, what am I to do? I do not know what my wife has been doing for a living during the last two years, since I have been absent. I can't say who she has been with, or how she has been going on. All that I can state is that three weeks ago, I came out of Hoxton-house, and I was only five days altogether with my wife. I went out and came home again. I gave a correct account of my time, and all this row took place in the house, and everybody was fetched, and I bear all the blame; and I can't give a full and correct account of myself without I am brought in an insane man; whether it is to put me back again to that place, I can't say; or whether my wife has any grievance, or was keeping company with any one. I can't say. We never had any quarrel; we may have had a word, now and then, but nothing to speak of. When I was away, six years ago, my wife was ill used, and torn about, and when I came home she denied having been in any row, until I was told by my neighbours that two women had been and torn and scratched her all about the body, but she was frightened to tell me what had transpired during my absence. I don't see why I was taken to that asylum to be treated as a prisoner and a slave. I should like to know in what I am deficient that I am not in my right mind. I wanted work, that was not given to me, and I complained of my diet; what they gave me did not agree with me, and it was not likely that I should take it. I went on bread and water from two to three months, all to get justice. Why should I have an instrument passed into my inside, to be made a plaything of?</p>

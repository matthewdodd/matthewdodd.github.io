On 19th March, about half past 8 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty at Stratford in plain clothes, I saw the prisoner in a marine store dealer's shop named Shea—I received informa<lb></lb>tion, and followed the prisoner from thence to a beer shop—I told him I wanted him to go down to Mr. Shea about some lead; he said he had not been to Mr. Shea, he had come straight up Stratford—I told him he should go along with me, he said he should not; I took him by the collar, and said he should; he resisted, and struck me in the mouth, and knocked me down; with assistance I took him to Mr. Shea's—this lead was given me by Mr. Shea, who said he bought it of the prisoner, who said that a man had given it him, and he took it into the shop—I took this lead to the roof of a building where the lead had been cut away; this corresponded with the lead that remained exactly.</p>

I received information, and went to a cook-shop, in Newgate-street, about the 25th or 27th of October - I saw some sheets of a work called "The Medical Adviser," and "The Monuments of St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey;" they were my property, and worth about 1l. 15s. at the cost price - no person printed, published, or sold them but myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. How can you undertake to swear that no other person published these works? A.Because I am the proprietor of the copyright, and there are no other such works in existence - the printer's name was not on the sheets of paper; I can swear to the paper itself - I did not make it; it is possible another person may print this "Medical Adviser," but that they can copy these blocks and arrive to such a similarity, that I cannot see the difference, I cannot well imagine that; the prisoner never was left in management of my business - I never sold waste-paper, nor did any of my boys, by my permission: there is a cupboard in my room, in which there was waste-paper, but not such paper as this - I never gave the prisoner permission to sell waste-paper; I have sometimes got tipsy - I went home one night when his mother was there, but I did not tell her that he had no occasion to spend any of his money. as he might have waste-paper to sell; the fact is the cupboard was full of waste-paper for lighting the fire and making mattresses for other parcels, and recollecting that I had lessened my insurance, and this cupboard being so contiguous to the fire-place, I desired the boy to remove this waste-paper - he said, "Where shall I put it?" I said,"Where you like, but don't let it be there."</p>

            . I live in Tottenham-court-road - I did live in Newgate-street, and kept a ham and beef-shop. I bought a quantity of the "Medical Adviser" from the latter end of July to September - we used a great quantity there, and the rest I delivered to my mother - she gave it to the officer, but I was not at home; I know one of the parcels was not opened at all - the prisoner used to come to the shop and buy things; I had a bill in my window, "Waste paper bought here;" he said,"I see you buy waste-paper; we sell ours by the month - a man comes, and gives us two sovereigns for it; will you buy it?" I said I could not tell till I saw it - he brought some, and I bought it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Whether it was this paper or not you cannot tell? A. No, it was like this; there was some small and some large - I bought three bundles of him.</p>

            . I live with my father, in Newcastle-street, Farringdon-street. I have been in the employ of the prosecutor since August last - the prisoner told me that his master gave him and the other boy permission to sell the paper, which was their perquisite, and I carried some of it to Mr. Saunders - I received what I took from the prisoner; they were works of this description, but I do not think I took so much as there is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you lived with some booksellers before? A. No, with a printer - I did not partake of the profit of all this paper; I received a third of one lot - the prisoner and I took some paper to my mother's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had formerly leave to sell wastepaper that was in the cupboard - I should never have taken this if Birt had not told me that he used to sell paper from a printer, and as good as that was - his mother wished the paper to go to her house to be sold; she sold some, divided the money as she liked, and treated us with liquor - I did not see what paper went to Saunder's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not together in the public-house? A. Yes, but I did not pass one word with him, nor shake hands with him; I suppose he was kept in custody, but I went away, and the officer took him - I said I wanted to go, I had my horse in the cart, and should have no more concern with him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard a cry of Stop thief! in Fox and Knott-court; I saw several persons running, and the prisoner at the head of the mob - I considered him to be the person the mob was running after; I did not stop him myself, but I came down and asked what was the matter - some person said he had committed a robbery at the Bear and Ragged Staff; I saw the prosecutor running, and he said, "Have you got him - he has robbed me of my pocket-book," but he had got it again, and he did not wish to have any more to do with it- the prisoner went on his knees, and begged his pardon - several of them in the room talked of ducking him; I took him to the Compter, and found this chisel on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find nothing else? A. No; he said he was a jeweller - the prosecutor knew that he fell on his knees; I saw them part company, but do not recollect their shaking hands, there were so many men in the room - I could not attend to every one.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ALDRIDGE re-examined. I caught him by the collar; he tried to get away, and found he could not, and 
               <persName id="t18300916-140-person1226">drew</persName>
             this book from between the waistband of his breeches - he then bolted out of the door, and a gentleman who was giving me a glass of gin, cried Stop thief! and a good many people ran after him; when he was taken he went on his knees, and begged my pardon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you take the book off the ground? A. I had hold of him, but I took it off the ground - there might he four persons in the room; I did not appear on the Monday against him - my business lies so that I could not; I did not understand the law at all - the officer did not tell me that I was to go on the Monday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

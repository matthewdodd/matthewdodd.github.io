               <p>JOHN FEATHENSTONE. I am clerk to Messrs. Clark and Cox, on the 13th of February, I went to a person of the name of Cormick M'Coy, in Duck Lane, he complained of the beer; on his complaining, I found that was part of the beer that we fur- furnish St. Ann's, in consequence of which the two prisoners were apprehended.</p>

               <p>CORMICK M'COY. I live at St. Paul's, Shadwell, on the 11th of February, the two prisoners brought me a barrel of beer; I was to give thirty-five shillings for it. I paid them twelve shillings in part.</p>

               <p>FEATHENSTONE. I called upon Cormick M'Coy, he said what kind of beer have you sent me in. I said you gave me no order; he said your men have left me a barrel, it is so bad, I cannot draw it. I went down into the cellar with him, he

I told him I did not know that any had come; he said our men had been there and left it; it was so bad he could not draw it. The prisoners had taken it there he said. I know they had no order to dispose of it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the value of the beer - A. The contract was eleven shilling.</p>

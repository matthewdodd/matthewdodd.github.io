            , he lives near Watford; on the 13th of February, about four in the morning, a man came to me and demanded the bridle of my horse, I am not sure that that is the man; the horse was tied behind the waggon; he shewed me a thing which I thought was a pistol.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He did not say any thing, he came up to me, you Sir, says he, give me the bridle of your horse.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he wanted with the bridle? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he demand any thing else but the bridle? - No, he said he would either shoot me, or blow my brains out, I do not know which.</p>

            , with this bridle on it, at half past eleven, at the Cock in Tottenham Court Road, this was the 13th of February, the man asked me if the horse could stand that night, it was the prisoner at the bar, he came with the horse, he desired me to put him into the stable, and give him half a peck of corn and a little hay, and he should come and speak to my master in a minute or two, and he left the horse and went off, and I saw no more of him.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner at the bar, I am one of the patrol lately appointed by Sir Sampson Wright, the patrol happened to go to Kilburn, I met this prisoner and some other people in company; I searched the prisoner, and I found this in his left hand pocket, it is not a pistol, it is only the appearance of a pistol; he said, he was going to Edgware, we took him into custody; the last witness immediately on seeing him again said, that is the man that brought the horse to our house.</p>
               <p>Court to Price. How long was the prisoner in the yard? - Only at the door, he gave me the horse, he stopped five minutes, not longer.</p>
               <p>At half past eleven, it was not light at that time? - There was a lamp over the door, I never saw him before, he was dressed as he is now, I can swear to him that he is the same person.</p>

               <p>I know the bridle by the buckle</p>
               <p>Court. Is not it a common buckle? - There are others like it.</p>
               <p>Is there any particular observation that you ever made on this bridle, that enables you to swear to it again? - I know it by being broke, I have used it many times.</p>
               <p>What is there in that bridle that distinguishes it from any other old bridle that is broken? - I know it from an hundred.</p>
               <p>But if you do know it, you can give some reason for it, and some description that somebody else might know it by? - This was the bridle I gave him.</p>
               <p>What reason have you for being sure this is the same bridle? - I cannot know it any other way than this, I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>That young man knows no more of me, I never saw him before I saw him in Bow-street, the runner that took me has put him up to it, and bid him swear any thing that he could, and he might get 20 l. the people that I had as witnesses are gone home, some of the turnkeys told them my trial would not come on to night, and they are gone home.</p>
               <p>Court to Lawrence. Did you observe what sort of a horse the prisoner was upon when he robbed you? - A black horse.</p>

               <p>RICHARD PECK. I live at Old Ford. On the 18th of July I went into the Jolly Sailors public-house, Back-street, Shadwell, leaving my gelding in charge of Watson; I came out in about five minutes, in consequence of an alarm; the horse and Watson were gone; I went in search, but could not find it; on the 19th of October I found it in possession of Mr. Barber, the Governor of Gosport gaol - it was a bay gelding, worth thirty-five guineas; I lost the saddle and harness with it.</p>

            . I am Governor of Gosport Bridewell. On the 17th of October, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's premises at Brockhurst, in the parish of Alverstoke; I knew him by the name of William Brown, but not by the name of Cutts - he is a <rs id="t18271206-16-deflabel87" type="occupation">horse-dealer</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You have been Governor of the Bridewell a considerable time? A. Yes; I had known the prisoner two or three months - he knew I was Governor of the Bridewell - he had shown me the horse about three weeks before - it was not then in so good a condition; when I saw it afterwards it had been well attended to.</p>
               <p>Q. It had not been cut in the mane or tail? A. Yes, I am sure it had - the hair of the tail had been cut and combed - it was a switch tail when I first saw it; being cut made a very great alteration in its appearance; I do not mean to say that the fleshy part of the tail was cut - it was a cob tail; I saw several persons at the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a stable in which any body might put a horse? A. No; he made no secret of showing me the horse; I was frequently there, and had seen it two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see different persons about the stable? A. Yes, Mr. Brown's attendants; the horse had been brought to my house with another or two, to be shown to a friend of mine - my son rode it about, and was so delighted with it, that Brown, in conversation, called it my son's horse. My house is nearly two miles from his stable - it joins Gosport gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, "Oh, Mr. Brown, I am in trouble" - did he not add, "It is a pity such a thing should have been left with me?" A. I do not recollect it - I wish to mention all he said; I will not say he did not, for he said a great deal to me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far is his stable from Old Ford? A. About eighty miles; I had no information about it when my son rode it.</p>

            . I am constable of Gosport. I accompanied Mr. Barber to the prisoner's premises; I was in the road close by the yard - Mr. Barber came out to me in about five minutes, and showed me a bay a horse; I had seen the prisoner go into the house with Mr. Barber, and as I stood at the stable door I saw him make his escape across the yard into the field; I told Mr. Barber, and followed him across three fields; he was running without a hat; I called a man named Fryer to assist me, and about three fields off we came up to him; I stood, and saw Fryer bring him from a hedge; he had slippers on, and no hat - he took me by the arm, and said, "I am beat - I will go with you like a man, Stroud."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see him show the horse to Barber? A. I saw him go to the stable with him; I went into the stable afterwards; I had seen young Mr. Barber trying the horse at Bridewell, about eleven o'clock one day; a great many people were there; I never saw it before.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PECK. I received the horse from Barber - it is the one I lost at the time in question; I got it from Barber's stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a doubt of its being yours the moment you saw it? A. No; I knew it directly - it was not fatter than when I lost it; the tail had been trimmed; it was cut - it had been cut previous to my losing it, but it had grown long again; when I found it it had been cut shorter than I had ever seen it before; no joints were taken off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Dean is the man who brought the horse to my place, which I believe Mr. Blunden knows - he came to my house on the 29th of July, with a horse, and I gave information of it to his father, and he sent to tell me to take care of the horse and his son, for he had a friend arranging the matter with Mr. Peck, which was the cause I kept the horse; I never offered to sell it. I took a cob down to show a friend of Mr. Barber's, and I rode this gelding myself; I never intended to sell the gelding. I never showed it for sale to any individual - it was seen publicly in plenty of places.</p>

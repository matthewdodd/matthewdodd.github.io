               <p>I have belonged to Sir John Fielding's Office many years, I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday the 16th of November, about eight in the morning; I produce two bits that were taken out of the prisoner's pocket: I took the prisoner up one pair of stairs backwards in Princes-street, he was in bed, he got out of bed and opened the door, and he had a black handkerchief tied round his head for a night-cap; the woman prisoner was in bed with him, he got into bed again, I desired him to get out of bed.</p>
               <p>Court. He knew you, I suppose? - Yes, my Lord, we are well acquainted one with another; I then searched his breeches pocket, and there I found a half guinea, some silver, and the two foreign bits which I have now produced; he then dressed himself, and he had a brown close bodied coat, such a one as mine, splashed up to the shoulders; we went to him from a particular information, which I hope your lordship will not enquire into; in the fore-room, in a little closet, I found these boots wet.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose lodgings were these? - I cannot tell, and by the side of the fire-place lay these spurs, the leather of which was wet, there was a whip in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Can you distinguish between town dirt and country dirt on this occasion; I think I have heard you do so on other occasions? - That must be left to the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court. That is too nice.</p>
               <p>(The bits produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are like the pieces that were in my purse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you believe these are some of the pieces that were in your purse? - I do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Mr. Sheridan. Here are two more that are pretty like them, I believe, Madam, do you recollect them also, (showing her two other bits) you have no particular mark on them? - No, I have had them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100007"></xptr> for some time, I have used them as common marking pieces instead of counters.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no distinguishing these unless there was a particular mark.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Was the man that robbed you and took the purse from you and your daughter a tall man or a short man? - He was on horseback, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had he boots on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he a whip in his hand? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What did the other man do while the prisoner robbed you? - He stood on my daughter's side; my daughter and myself delivered our purses to this man.</p>
               <p>It was light enough to discern his countenance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you know his voice? - I would not venture to swear.</p>
               <p>Did he seem to use his own voice or a feigned voice? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>But you swear positively to his person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You did not state it as a positive fact that he had a round hat on? - It was a round hat he had on.</p>
               <p>You say he had a dark great coat on? - Yes, a dark coat.</p>
               <p>Court to Jealous. Was the coat you found a great coat? - No, my Lord, such a one as mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutrix. You said it was light enough to distinguish objects? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it harder to distinguish objects or features? - I could distinguish the men.</p>
               <p>But you could not be certain whether he had a whip in his hand? - No, because his hands were constantly employed, he held my reins down with one of his hands, and he had our purses to take with the other.</p>
               <p>Where either of the men disguised? - I did not notice that they were.</p>
               <p>You said at first, I think I see him now; upon a closer question you said, you verily believed that was him, and after that, that you had no doubt; I would ask you one question, there is the life of a man at stake; will you undertake to swear upon your oath, I beg you to consider seriously of it, and the consequences; it is not the first time witnesses have been mistaken, will you swear it was impossible it could be any body else? - I do not know how far I can swear to that, I swear that I know the man, and that that is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. That is enough.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Which side of the carriage was this man on? - He was on the left-hand side.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prosecution to Jealous. Did you observe any thing else that is particular to mention to the Court? - When I looked round the fire-place, I could not find any spurs, and at last I saw the woman prisoner hiding them under the bellows.</p>

             M'DONALD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the officers of Litchfield-street; I was called on by Jealous; I went to apprehend the prisoner about eight o'clock on Sunday morning the 16th of November, we went to the fishmonger's in Prince's-street, St. James's, the prisoners were both in bed together, he opened she door and got into bed again.</p>
               <p>Did he know you? - Yes, very well; I did not knock at the door because he knew my voice; Jealous found some pieces of money upon him, I found a purse in the girl's pocket under her head, there was nothing in it; I searched his pocket and found some loose powder in it, I found no firearms, he had a brown coat and a white shag waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Was it a loose coat? - No, there was never a loose coat in the room; there were a pair of boots found in the room; I searched the man and found a key; he said he kept a stick-shop two or three doors off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I think I heard you say that you knew this man? - I know the intention of the question and am not afraid to meet it.</p>
               <p>You know the nature of business in Bow-street very well, you know it is necessary when any body is robbed to give a description? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it usual to say, Oh, I know the man, he is such a one, I will go for him directly? - No, I knew where the man lodged that used to go on that game, I will not tell you who told me.</p>
               <p>But I believe you must. - If my Lord asks me I will tell him, but it is not fair.</p>
               <p>Court. They should not discover it; you should ask him what kind of intelligence he received, without mentioning the person. -</p>
               <p>M'Donald. A person called upon me and told me, and I called upon Mr. Jealous.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Bond. How was the information sent? - It was sent by a written letter.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was along with them when they took the man, and when the information came on the over night; three men came on horseback from Mr. Bond from Hendon with a letter from Mr. Bond, and they had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100009"></xptr> likewise fire-arms, they had been in pursuit of the two highwaymen who stopped Mrs. Bond, they gave a description of the two men and their horses; we had likewise received information before of such men robbing, and we suspected these men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do not you expect a share of the reward on the conviction of this man? - Yes, you know that as well as you get your own fee.</p>
               <p>Does Mr. Jealous expect any? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Forty pounds for a good guess at a man's dress.</p>
               <p>(The purse deposed to by Mrs. Bond and Miss Bond.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. If this man committed a robbery, and went to bed to any woman, he might naturally give her the purse, she might not know it was stolen; she may be set from the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If never can be my intention, my Lord, to press any thing against a prisoner; I shall leave it to the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the woman sit down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Macdonald. You know the woman that was lately at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is she a lady of easy virtue? - She is a girl of the town, she lived with another man before him.</p>
               <p>Was not it as possible for her to have that purse from another man as from the prisoner? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>He let you in directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He went into bed directly afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan. My Lord, I submit there are about ten thousand of such purses and about five millions of these pieces of bits, especially since the war.</p>
               <p>- BOND sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that money, do you ever remember seeing it before? - I cannot swear to money, I gave such money as this to my wife.</p>
               <p>What coin is it? - It is the eighth of a dollar.</p>
               <p>What is the name of it? - They call them a kind of bit.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of this purse? - That was my wife's purse, I bought it myself on Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Is there any particular mark on it? - No, Sir, I have had it in my hands frequently, and I tried to get such another, but it was very hard to match it.</p>
               <p>Then you believed there was such another, or you would not have gone to look for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Can you swear to it with as much certainty as you can swear to objects of that sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you at home when the robbery was committed? - I got down directly after the ladies, I believe the highwaymen passed me, I sent an express directly by one of my servants, and a letter to Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Mrs. Bond. Did you swear positively to this man then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Mr. Bond. Where does this coin come from? - It comes from Spain.</p>
               <p>Are they not frequently in circulation at Portsmouth? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. My Lord here is the man's discharge, he was just discharged from the Porcupine.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of the matter, I have witnesses to my character.</p>

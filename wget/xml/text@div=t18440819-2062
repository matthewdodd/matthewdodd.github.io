                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 79.) On Sunday morning, the 6th of July, about six o'clock, I was on duty in Broad-street, Ratcliffe—I saw the prisoner and one Donovan standing at the corner of School-house-lane—they had a wash-tub—one held one part, and the other the other—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came along—the prisoner hailed the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and, assisted by Donovan, he put the tub with its contents on the top of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner got up, and rode by the side of the driver, and Donovan made his escape—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped opposite Old Gravel-lane, and when it stopped the prisoner got down, took the tub on his shoulder, and went off—when I overtook the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he was gone with the pro<lb></lb>perty—I overtook him, and asked what he had got there—he said he did not know—I asked if he did not see what it was when he took it on his shoulder—he said, "No," that a woman gave it to him in Ratcliffe-highway, and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take it to the Thames Tunnel—I said, "Don't you know what it is? what do you think it is?"—he said, "I think it is crockery by the rattle of it"—the tub was covered over with a clean table-cloth, and contained seven sheets of copper rolled up, weighing 591bs.—I took the copper and the pri<lb></lb>soner to the station—Mr. Ward's counting-house is about a hundred yards from where I first saw the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Thomas Ward, a ship-owner, at Ratcliffe—I live on the premises. On Monday morning, the 7th of July, this copper was shown me by a policeman, and I missed seven sheets of copper—there are two small cellars in which we keep the copper and the yellow metal, and this being copper was kept in a little cellar—I saw it safe at five o'clock on Saturday evening, the 5th of July—I locked the door of this little cellar, and kept the key—the sheets of copper were all lying flat—I had had them under my care about three years and a half—I have had them through my hand in clearing up the place many times—as we do not use copper we use yellow metal—we used to employ the prisoner as a labourer about two years and a half ago, on the premises, and on board the ships—the cellar where we keep the copper is on Mr. Ward's premises—I believe this copper to be the same, I have had it through my hands so often, but being rolled up now it alters the folds of it—the stains that are on it are familiar to me—I see enough to know that it is the same copper.</p>

Q.</hi> Copper always gets stained if it lays by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have moved this about three or four times a year—I believe it to be Mr. Ward's—I have not got it down in any book—when we have copper in I put the quantity down, but this was in a separate place, and there it laid—it was there before I came to the premises, and the mark on it is the mark of the manufacturer—I know nothing of Donovan.</p>

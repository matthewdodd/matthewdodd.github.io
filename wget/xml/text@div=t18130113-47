               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in your service any time - A. Yes; she came, I think, on the 31st of March, and continued with me six months.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of September had you occasion to search her box - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Mr. Deering, and some of the servants, go into her room for that purpose - A. Yes. She was surprised at being suspected, and was very reluctant of opening any thing that belonged to her. Mr. Deering and I both insisted in her opening her drawers, and the first thing that we found was about half a yard of black lace. It is here. One of my children's stockings was found in another drawer, locked up, and another piece of lace was in the drawer. I then required to search her box. On the top of the box was a decanter inside. The box was locked, and when she came to her letters, she said this is my property; no one shall see them; they are my letters. She put all the things in the box again, and locked it up. I then insisted upon searching further. Under the letters I found a tablecloth, some pieces of dimity, and a pencil-case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This young woman was taken up to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130030"></xptr>Marlborough-street office - A. She was not taken up. She attended there to be discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you consented to her discharge - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that no sum of money was paid by the prisoner - A. I say there was, but it was not to make good the things that were stolen. When I hire a <rs id="t18130113-47-deflabel268" type="occupation">lady's maid</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18130113-47-defend432 t18130113-47-deflabel268"></join>, I tell her I give her charge of my wardrobe, that she is answerable to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there paid - A. Two ten-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was upon her being discharged at Marlborough-street, was it not - A. No; when her wages was paid. I do not know when she took these things. We found them upon the 28th of September, 1812.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discharged her, and when you took the money for the loss of the things in the inventory, I believe, after that she brought an action - A. An action was brought by her.</p>
               <p>Q. And is now pending - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. And now, having given up the charge in Marlborough-street, and the action now pending, you bring her here. You thought fit to take her up again, during an action that is pending upon you for false imprisonment - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Why did you forego the charge at first - A. Because Mr. Baker told Mr. Deering and me, that for that charge she must die, and when we came to town this copy of writ was taken out against us. We went before the same magistrate and had his advice, and pursued his advice; and Mr. Conant said it was for the good of society.</p>

            . Q. Did you attend at the time the box was searched, and the drawers - A. I did. The prisoner shewed her box very reluctantly. I saw the lace and the stockings found. When she came to her letters she shut her box, and said no one should open them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason that you did not proceed when you went to Marlborough-street - A. Because the charge would affect her life, a young person like her, had come with a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How long had she been in your service - A. About six months. She was lady's maid, and acting as housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore when things were used in your house, it was her duty to see the safe custody of them - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever think of charging her here until the action was brought - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, gentlemen of the jury, the tablecloth was not used in common; it was used only when we had company. I had not put this tablecloth in its proper place. I put the tablecloth there for safety until I returned from Bath. I knew I should not have Mrs. Deering's keys to put it away before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

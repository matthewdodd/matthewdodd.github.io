On the evening of the 23rd of March I was at Wellington-terrace, Bayswater-road, and saw the prisoner in the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's passage, leaning over the wicket-gate—he put his hand into the shop window, drew out a box of cigars, and he made another motion with his hand, but I could not see what he took then—he came out of the passage with the box—I followed him to Camden-place—when I came near him he put the box under his coat—I told him to bring the box of cigars back—he said nothing at first—I asked him again, and then he drew them from under his coat, brought them back a distance, and offered them to me—I refused to take them—he came a short distance further, and then said, "Well, here they are, if you like to take them," and threw them on the ground—I took them back to the shop.</p>

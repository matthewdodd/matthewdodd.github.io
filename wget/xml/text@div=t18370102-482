                  </hi>. I live in Milton-terrace, Southwark<lb></lb>bridge-road. On the morning of the 23rd of December, a truck belonging to my father was missed from Atkinson's timber-yard in the Borough; and between two and three o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner in Giltspur-street with the wheels and axletree, which I knew to belong to my truck—I followed him up Newgate-street—I went across to speak to a policeman, and then the prisoner went away, and left the wheels and I axletree for two hours in the street, nearly opposite the Blue-coat school I watched there, and saw him come up the lane opposite the school, but he ran down again, and I could not get him—he did not take them—I am certain he is the man—(when he was taken he said he did not know any at all about the wheels)—just at dusk I saw him again, and a young man who was with me secured him.</p>

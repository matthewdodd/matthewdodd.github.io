                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Ingoldby &amp; Lamb, 3, Whitefriars Street, City, publishers-one of our publications is known as the International Guide, it comes out every two years—the object of it is to enable foreigners to know where to purchase any thing they may require—I employ men as canvassers for advertisements for that guide—In 1873 the prisoner was in my employ as canvasser—he was with me about three weeks—I think it is very likely he left of his own accord-this letter, dated October 30th, 1873, is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had been unwell; could have made money at it if he had not been prevented from following it up, and enclosed a statement of account.</hi>) Since that time he has never been in my employment—In 1873, when he was in my employ I used orders of this kind, and he would be in possession of such orders-when he left our ser<lb></lb>vice in 1873 I do not remember whether he handed in the orders or not—In consequence of information I received I wrote him a letter and received this letter in reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 19th March</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">in which the prisoner said:</hi> "I will, as you wish me call to-morrow, Friday.") I believe he did so</p>

               <p>call—I was there—he said he had not called upon anybody to collect any money—this receipt, marked A is in the prisoner's writing "March 9th, 1876. Received from Messrs. J. Fulgar &amp; Sons, 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for insertion of adver<lb></lb>tisement in International Guide"—neither the prisoner or anyone else has ever accounted to me for that order—he had no authority to take it. (<hi rend="italic">Two orders were here produced signed by the prisoner, also receipts dated October</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">from Messrs. Talbot &amp; Alder</hi>, 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for insertions in the International Guide signed by prisoner.</hi>) I have never received the monies represented by those orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have several letters of his that I have compared—the receipts are numbered, so many 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so many 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and so many 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., there is no stamped number, it is written—when we give out a packet of receipts to travellers, we register them as against the particular traveller—I have searched whether these were registered against the prisoner—the parcel he brought back was the specimen book and papers—for aught I know, he might or might not have returned the receipts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Ingoldby &amp; Lamb are the prosecutors—I did not com<lb></lb>municate to them—another canvasser called afterwards—I can swear the prisoner is the man—he was under my observation about ten minutes—we do not advertise largely, though many canvassers call—I was standing by his side, and saw him write—I have a very good memory—I am positive the prisoner is the man—we did not send any one with the detective in order to seek out the man—I did not go myself.</p>

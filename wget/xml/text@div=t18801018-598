                  </hi>. I am agent to the London and South-Western Railway at Farnham—I reside dose by Farnham Railway Station—on Monday, 6th September, I closed the house and went to bed about 10.30 p.m., and left hanging up in the passage a new overcoat, a felt hat, a child's jacket, and a child's Ulster—this property is mine—I did not notice the scullery window, but I believe it was closed; the fastening had been broken a day or two before—at 7 a.m. the next morning the servant told me the househad been robbed—I then saw the scullery window; it was open—I gave information to the police.</p>

I went to his house near the railway station—I examined his house and garden—I found the coat and hat produced in the garden, also some footprints leading across the garden—I covered them up—on 8th Sept. the prisoner was brought in in the evening—he was shown the coat and hat produced—he said that they were his—his boots were taken off, and I accompanied the constable on the next morning to compare the footmarks with his boots—they resembled the prints in every particular, especially one of the soles, which shows the packing or strips of leather.</p>

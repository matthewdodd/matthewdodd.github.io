            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 17th of November, between four and five o'clock, Perara, accompanied by another man, came into my father's shop; he asked to see a long jacket; the jacket in question was on the counter. At the time, while I was shewing him a long jacket, the person accompanying Perara left the shop. Perara had looked at the long jacket; and, after bidding me much less than the price I asked, left the shop. On my doubling up the jackets that were on the counter, I missed the jacket in the indictment. I know the prisoner did not take the jacket, but the person accompanying him took the jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that person. - A. That I cannot say. When I missed the jacket, I went to several pawnbrokers, and desired them to stop it. On my return, the prisoner Perara was in the shop with a jacket of the same description that I lost. My father asked me, if that was not the jacket that was stole? I said, I believed it was, but I would fetch the person that made it. I went for the person that made it, and when I returned, Perara had left the shop and took the jacket with him.</p>

             on the 17th of November, about half past ten at night. He asked six shillings on it. I took the jacket up to Mr. Rose. I never saw Perara at all. I have kept the jacket ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my jacket; it was taken away when Perara first came in, and Perara came in with this jacket between eight or nine at night. He asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs, and asked me the price of them. He bid me little more than half, and when he was gone away, he took the jacket up under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the jacket that you missed before. - A. Yes I asked him where he bought the jacket? he said, at Blackwall; he gave sixteen shillings for it. I replied, you have not given any thing for this jacket, it was taken out of my shop this afternoon. He said, you make a thief of me, take care of what you say.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he speak English. - A. Perfectly well; and while I was talking to him, my son came in. He said; he thought it was my jacket; and, to put it beyond all doubt, I sent for the woman that made it. I was behind the counter when my son was gone out. Perara snatched it up, and went away. The jacket is worth eighteen shillings. I swear to the jacket.</p>
               <p>Perara's Defence. I met a black man; I gave him sixteen shillings for it. I gave it to the other man to pledge.</p>
               <p>Antonio's Defence. I know no more than the other man gave it me to pledge.</p>

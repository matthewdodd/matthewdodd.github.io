            , the servant of this house, She brought me a candle of seal it, she see it. Then I put my letter into my pocket, and went out till between the hour of four and five in the afternoon, then I came to the Bunch of Grapes again; I asked if Mr. Holt would be so kind as to give the postman that letter at six o'clock, when he usually came by; in the mean time the bell man came; I said, Mr. Holt, be so kind as to step out and give the man that letter; and I stood by the side of him and see him give the man the letter; the prisoner is the bellman; he asked him if he would take this letter? he said he would; he asked him if it would go safe? he said he would enter it in the book when he came to Lombard-street, and it would go safe; Holt asked him what it would come to; he paid him eleven-pence for the postage; and he doubled it once double in his hand, and he carried it away in his hand, he did not put it into the bag with the rest, and in the course of the week I had no answer to the letter that I sent, and I sent another letter, and had another letter describing that that first letter was not received; when I found the letter had not come to hand, I went to the inland office to examine the books, and they ordered me to come the next day at eleven o'clock; that was the Monday week after the letter was sent; the person that took it in was not there then; I then the next day, the person examined the books, and there was no such thing entered in the books; I went back to Well-street, and at five o'clock I met the postman, and I asked him what I was to do to get my money; that Tuesday, the same day as I was at LOmbard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - At the Bunch of Grapes door, where I put in the letter; I asked him whether I was to lose it or no? he said he knew nothing about it, he put it into the office; I asked him if that was all the recompence I was to have for it, I said if that was all I would go and get a warrant, and then I went and got a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see this bell-man in your life before? - Never before, he took the half guinea, he was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard his name mentioned? - Never to the best of my knowledge, not I did not know his name when I got the warrant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner told you that it would be entered in a book? - He said he would enter it in a book when he came to Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you know the regulation of the office, that if a man does neglect to enter it in the book, and any thing is lost, he is obliged to pay for it? - I don't know, I don't want to prosecute the man, not hurt him, and she justice ordered us to make it up; I only want my money.</p>
               <p>Q. He did offer you the half guinea by the justice's recommendation? - At that time he did.</p>
               <p>Q. And who was the justice? - Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe besides that you claimed some extra money for expenses?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160229"></xptr>- Yes, I claimed my expences; I did not want to he any thing out of my pocket; it is very hard for me to lose my money.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be very glad to know what the extra expences were? - The loss of my time, two days going to Lombard-street, and the expences of the warrant, and serving of the warrant; a guinea was asked in all to pay every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you asked nine shillings and seven-pence besides the half guinea and the postage, and he knowing that nine shillings and seven-pence would save him from a prosecution at this bar, refused to pay it? - I suppose that is the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the civility when you took him up, to acquaint the post office, that a man, a servant of theirs was taken up, to ask them what they would do for their servant? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was the letter directed? - To Mary Anthill.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you receive your letter? - On Friday, a week after I sent to Mr. Thorn, to desire him to send me a trifle of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that letter that came to you? - No, I burnt it at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that letter from? - From Mr. Thorn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he acquaint you with? - That he sent me half a guinea before in a letter, that he sent it directly as he received my letter, by the return of post.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say the half guinea was inclosed in the letter? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very odd you should burn that letter; did you shew it to the post office? - Yes, I shewed it at the post office twice, at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this letter sealed with a wafer? - No, with sealing wax, I never noticed the seal.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to receive this letter? - Because I had not sent any answer to the first letter that he sent.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you desire an immediate answer to your first letter? - I did, I have the letter that I received from her, that she had not received the half guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are one of the inspectors of the letter carriers in the post office. Will you be so kind as to tell us what is the practice of the office, with respect to letters paid money with? - The general rule is, when a man takes a letter that money is paid with, to have it entered in the money book.</p>
               <p>Q. In the hurry of business, does it, or does it not, frequently happen that that is omitted? - It does; the post master's permanment order is, that those that neglect that duty, shall pay the loss, besides a suspension.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man been in the employ of this office? - Two years.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, what has been his character and behaviour in the office, good or bad? - To the best of my opinion as honest a man as ever was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hands does a letter pass through between here and Bath? - I cannot say, a great number.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the service of the office when apprehended? Supposing him acquitted, would he be taken into the office again? - I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to his settling of his accounts at the post office, has that man been regular and punctual, or not? -Always regular and punctual.</p>
               <p>Court. Do they turn them out of their office if they refuse to pay the money? - There never has been such an instance, but I am very confident they would be dismissed if they were guilty of such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter was put into the post office on Friday, the 21st of August; do you remember whether at that time there was any robbery of the mail, or any loss of letters complained of? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it not being entered in the money book, might it not go to Bath? - Yes, but a letter may go to Salisbury or Bristol and we never hear of it again.</p>
               <p>Q. But in general do not they come back to the office when they go wrong? - Yes, but sometimes they do not.</p>
               <p>- SPARKES sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you employed by the post office? - Yes, a deputy inspector; the prisoner was letter carrier, I have known him about two years, he made his payments always regular.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in court when Mr. Ferguson was examined, he has spoken to the practice of this entering in the money book? - That is the practice.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it frequently happen that that practice is omitted? - We have frequently instances of it, from the hurry of business.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the letter to be lost, the party can be no gainer by it? - He is liable to make it good, or forefeit his place.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think the place of a letter carrier is worth to a man? - Fourteen or sixteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Court. When there is any money in it, it is entered in the money book? - Yes, and they pay as a double letter.</p>

               <p>On the morning of the 22d of August, the prisoner informed me that he had omitted to put such a letter in the evening before, that he had received it, I believe, in Oxford-road; that he had received the postage of that letter, and was informed that it contained money, that in consequence of that he brought that letter to the Post office, with the other letters for which he had received postage, that he had paid for the postage of the letter in the proper office, but that in consequence of the celerity with which business was obliged to be done with us, he had neglected to have it entered in the usual money book.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had paid the postage of it, it must have found its way into the Post office at the same time? - It must. some days afterwards, I cannot tell the distance of time, about six or seven days, he again came to me, and told me that that letter had not found its situation to the place where it was directed, he was apprehensive it must be lost: I told him if that was the case, as he had neglected to have it entered in the proper book, he would be answerable for the amount that the letter contained. The man acquiesced in that demand.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not these things frequently happen? - It is unpleasant to say that it does frequently happen.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hands do you think the letter must pass through between this and Bath? - At least five or six; I don't think it can pass through a great many more.</p>
               <p>Jury. It does not pass through any more hands after the bag is sealed up on the road to Bath? - It does not; but at Bath it goes through several hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What character has he borne in the office? - Always borne a very fair character, nor have I observed any impropriety in his conduct whatever.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is this money book kept? - It is kept in the paid letter office at the Post office.</p>
               <p>Q. When the <rs id="t17950916-83-deflabel470" type="occupation">bellman</rs>

               <p>Q. Then when they are so separated, what does he do with them? - He gives them to the officer attending in the paid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160232"></xptr>letter office, informing him that they contain money.</p>

               <p>I am president of the inland office.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes. On the 1st of September he came to me, very much agitated, and said, that he had been applied to by a gentleman of whom he had received a letter containing money, who had informed him that the letter had not got to hand. I asked him whether he had received charge with it at the time, and whether he had seen it entered at the time he delivered it in? He said he had forgot to do that; I told him as that was the case he must pay the man whatever it was; which he promised to do.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was continued in the Post office as letter carrier, notwithstanding this thing had transpired, and he was the person that let you know that the fact had really happened? - He has been in the office about two years; I never had the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he be taken into the service of the Post office again? - Yes, he would.</p>
               <p>Q. They, I understand, take up this defence? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. It is at their desire that you attend? - It is.</p>
               <p>Court. When there is a money letter, and when there is not, do not they separate the letters? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. And they always distinguish that to the person that takes them at the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of these money letters do you think may be brought by a bellman at a time? - A man may bring three or four in the evening, and he may not bring one in the course of a week.</p>

I asked him whose property they were; he said they belonged to one Mrs. Gray in Whitechapel: he said she had a great many things in pawn, and she would be glad to sell some to redeem others. The same week he brought a crimson gown and some pieces of silk. I went and sold them, and brought him the money. While I was out selling them, he brought some other things; eight shifts, and a muslin toilet for a table. I could not get the value of them, so I brought him them again. After that he asked me to go out with them again. Then he brought a sack and coat, and set the price five guineas. There were other things he brought also, but I did not sell them; a black bombazeen coat, a callico counterpane, but no linen, a cradle quilt worked in the same manner. I sold the sattin gown and coat to Mr. Everingham: the prisoner and a woman were with me at that time. I sold a small spotted one, and some pieces of silk, to

I begged of him to tell me whose property they were; he said they were Mrs. Gray's. I said I would go with him to her, and if she said they were her things, I would release him.

            . I am a constable. I was directed to search the prisoner's lodgings, on the 25th of September, where I found, in a drawer, a sheet, a black tippet, a pocket book, and several medals. (Produced, and deposed to by prosecutrix.) The prisoner was asked if the prosecutrix would not miss the things when she came home: his answer was, she would find a d - nable deficiency.</p>
               <p>Mr. Seabine. I had this ring of the keeper of the watch-house where the prisoner was. (Produced, and deposed to by prosecutrix.)</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Phillips. I bought a sack and coat of Mrs. Walley, and sold them the next day.</p>
               <p>Seabine. When the prisoner was before the Justice, I heard him say he took the things out of the house, at the fore door, at four times. I said, Then you must have a key. He said he had a key, and he left the door a jar each time, and that the maid was a washing below, when he brought them out, and gave them to three men, who took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Bramley. Is there a key-hole on the outside of the street-door?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bramley. There is. The back-door goes out into Marybone-lane. All these things mentioned were left in the house when we went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was drinking with a couple of men, who brought these things to me; and I lent them some money upon them; but they not coming again to their word, I took and sold some, and pawned others.</p>

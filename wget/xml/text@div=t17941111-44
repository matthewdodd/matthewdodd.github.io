               <p>Q. I will ask you a question, which certainly may appear very distressing to a female mind to answer.

               <p>Mr. Ager. I object to this.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you was no; told by Mrs. Taylor, the first wife, herself, that she never was capable of receiving the embraces of her husband; and therefore she had permitted him to part from her, and to live with you, with her own consent? Did not the first wife know of your marriage? - Not at the time, but afterwards she did, and approved of it. The circumstance you asked me just of, I was told of by Mrs. Marshall's friends.</p>

Has Mrs. Marshall, or Mrs. Taylor, known of your marriage? visited you with her approbation? and has she not supported you and Mr. Taylor down to this present moment? - I am in the greatest friendship with her down to this present moment, and hope to be so to the end of my days.</p>
               <p>Q. I now ask you whether you or any of your friends instigated this prosecution? - They did not, none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what great reformer of morals brings this prosecution forward? - Spite and malice, I know from my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that your husband is a witness on some trials that are to be hereafter?</p>
               <p>Court. I shall not suffer you to call this man her husband.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I beg pardon. Then tell me do you know that this gentleman is a witness in some prosecutions that are to come on? Do not you know and by those that have instigated this prosecution, that you are brought here for the purpose that his conviction may be a means from the prosecutor preventing him from giving his evidence on these prosecutions? In every transaction of Mr. Taylor's life that hath come to your knowledge, is he a man deserving of an excellent character, a moral man, and worthy of belief? - I always found him extremely kind to me, and to all his friends, and would serve any one.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are a clerk to an attorney, and I expect you to understand evidence, and I expect you to keep to it. - I saw Mr. Taylor after he was committed, by Mr. Flood or Bond, at Bow-street office, and I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was taken down in writing? - I do not know it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not? - I will not; there was no one person writing in the office when I was present; and if there was I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. I expect that you will swear any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Upon your oath, and I desire nothing from you but the honest truth, was an examination taken in your presence? - There was no written examination. I can only speak to what Mr. Taylor told Mr. Flood, the justice;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110091"></xptr>there was no written examination in my presence; Mr. Flood asked me if I could swear that that was the person that stood in the indictment; I said, yes; and then he committed him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was there any written examination taken down in writing or no, and was not this taken down in writing? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I ask you on your oath at the time that this conversation took place, was there any body taken down any thing regularly? - No, Mr. Lavender was not writing, he was present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What was this conversation? - After Mr. Flood had committed Mr. Taylor, Mr. Taylor said, that there were two marriages, and that he had a good defence to make, the reasons of which he would not then enter into.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what situation of life Mr. Taylor is in? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was clerk to Mr. Martin, the attorney? - I was for about three quarters of a year; I was assigned over to him on the 13th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clerk to him now? - No, my articles are now expired.</p>
               <p>Q. You are attorney of this prosecution? - I am the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what relation are you to Mrs. Taylor? - No relation whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation are you to Mrs. Richardson? - No relation at all, I did it merely for public justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did you prosecute a man for a burglary? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, sir, you are a sort of a public prosecutor? - Yes, certainly, and I mean to continue so, when ever any thing comes within my cognizance, and knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you will not be paid for this? - No, I shall not, I have done it merely on my own head.</p>
               <p>Q. This fell within your cognizance? - It certainly did; I heard of the circumstance from the country, and I made enquiry, and I found it was fact, and knowing the man, as I conceived him to be a man of bad character, therefore I prosecuted him, not with an intention to do that which is unjust, but merely that he should be obedient to the laws of his country.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this tale, you heard of it by accident? - If you please so; I received a letter from the country first of all; I heard of the second marriage from a Mr. Jefferson, and I also heard from the same the marriage of the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the trouble to go to Baldock? - I went to Baldock on purpose, but I went some part of the way on other business.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems you have no other motives? - I have no animosity whatever against the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Pearce, you are not then under bail to answer any charge of high treason? - I was taken up, and I am under bail at present.</p>
               <p>Q. You are then under bail to answer in a charge of high treason that was preferred against you; you never heard that this man was a witness against several persons that were tried for high treason already? - I have seen his name in a list of witnesses that was on the occasion.</p>

               <p>Q. Then before that time you did not know till you saw the last paper? - I never had, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. No, and trials for high treason? - I did not know that he was to be produced as a witness, nor did I ever hear of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you suspect? - I do not know that I am bound to give any suspicions.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you suspcted that he would be a witness against these persons for high treason? - I never heard that he was a witness against Watt and Downie; I heard there was a person of the name of Taylor, but I did not make any enquiry whether this was the man or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110092"></xptr>Q. Upon your oath did you never enquire whether this man was the man or not? - No, I did not know that he was the man that was at Edinburgh, that was witness against Watt and Downie, I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know Taylor at all? - Because he was a member of the society to which I belonged.</p>
               <p>Q. To what society? - The London corresponding society, and which I conceive is clear from any aspersion by the late verdict.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you heard that he had left you, and given information, before you took any steps towards the prosecution? - The first I heard of it was, I saw him at the privy counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the privy counsel? - Sure I did.</p>
               <p>

            Perhaps you was under examination? - I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before or after you took any steps in this prosecution? - It was prior; the lords of the privy counsel, they was so satisfied with my conduct, that they discharged me on bail, that I should appear when I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you suppose so? - I did suppose so, but I instituted it for public justice only; I am not now a member of that society; I commenced the prosecution since I absented myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had been before the privy counsel, was it before you received the letter from Mr. Jefferson? - It was some time, I heard of it before, it was a flying, report, that he was a man who had broke the laws of society, that he had two wives.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not set about enquiring after it, till after you left the privy counsel? - I did not, I took no notice was sure; I had references given to me, where I might make application, and I then took the necessary steps, and I have athrmed as I did before, that if any thing comes within my recognizance, and I can afford it, I shall do the same; all I shall have is, a satisfaction in discharging my duty to society, bringing to punishment them that offend the laws.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say it will be great satisfaction to you, to make two innocent women very uneasy? - I was the last person in the world to give any human being uneasiness, but I wish to see the laws of the country not violated. In all the business which I have done, I have taken care that the stamp act shall be fulfilled, as far as relates to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many bawdy houses, gaming houses. Be so good as to let me see you here every sessions; you was not in court when that amiable young woman was here? - No, I was not in court, I was ordered out by your own desire, and I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think yourself a party attacked to the guilt of bigamy? Have you been told that this connection with this young woman, was with the consent of her own friends, and with the consent of his former wife? - No, I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you did not enquire whether it was with the consent of her relations? - I did not.</p>

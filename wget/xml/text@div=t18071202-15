On the 16th of November, a little after four o'clock, I come out of my bar to go to lay a cloth on a table; I was about five yards from the bar; I heard a great noise, I turned my head towards the bar, I saw a man with the till in his hand, which he knocked against the corner of the partition and made a great noise; he was going out of the liquor shop door with the till in his hand. I am positive to that man at the bar being the man; he ran down Oxford Arms passage to a baker's that lies on the right hand, and turned too short at the corner, fell over a stone and he and the till fell down altogether. I believe there was a great quantity of copper in the till and some loose silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you following of him. - A. I was. I attempted to secure him at the time he ran down the Oxford Arms inn, and locked himself in a stable, he come out of the stable at another door that opened at the corner, then he was secured by the groom; when he got into the yard another man assisted him, he got loose from him and ran out of the yard into the market; he pulled off his coat and took hold of a glass bottle, and declared vengeance against the man that had laid hold of him; they afterwards secured him in the market and brought him into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same man. - A. I am positive it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go in the pursuit. - A. I followed him with the till in his hand until he fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. You secured your till. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the market after him. - A. I did not; when I was going up into the market I met a man coming in charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he is the same person. - A. I am quite sure he is the same person; I saw his face so plain going out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to strike against the partition. - A. The door about reaches the counter; reaching over his hand to take the till out, and drawing it back, he hit the till against the partition, and on his going out of the door he knocked the till against the door; then I saw his face very plain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say you believed him to be the man. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. I positively believe him to be the man is what he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You had never seen him before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you looked in the till so as to enable you to tell what was the contents of the till. - A. I could not tell what was the contents of the till, only what was in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen the contents of the bag. - A. I only know when I took and counted it out to the gentlemen that were there; I can tell there were six seven shilling pieces, and one pound twelve and six pence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen it before. - A. I cannot say exactly; it might be half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who goes to your till besides yourself. - A. My wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if she had occasion to go to the till might not she have taken it out. - A. Yes, but then I have kept it in my pocket ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on the money. - A. No, I have the money here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in partnership with any body. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what parish it is in. - A. Yes, Christ Church.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your house. - A. Yes, I am the landlord of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was never in his house before I was taken a prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

Observing a wig on the table, I asked who that belonged to; an answer was made, (I believe by the warden) that it belonged to the drunken fellow who was locked up. I said the man might get cold by being without his wig, and I ordered the warden to carry it to him; I said let me look at him; we went to the door, the warden unlocked it, and I saw the deceased lying on the floor on his back, the upper part of his shoulder was leaning against the end of the watch-house, his coat and waistcoat were pulled all over his head, his shirt was pulled up, his waistcoat was pulled backwards and yet there was not any of the buttons unbuttoned. Not supposing the man was dead, I ordered the warden to lift him up. A friend of mine who was with me laid hold of his hand and said the man is dead; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150017"></xptr> felt his hand, and his fingers were quite cold.

               <p>On Tuesday evening, the third of August, I went to Mr. Emmerson's house to meet with a person I wanted to see. A neighbour of mine was sitting there. I staid with him better than an hour. Mr. Hind, one of the king's messengers, came in, and called for the Gazette. I stopped to read it. While we were reading it Mrs. Emmerson opened the parlour door and said, Mr. Emmerson here is a person has called for a pot of beer, and will not pay for it. Mr. Emmerson went out immediately, and was gone some time. After he was gone out, I heard a scuffle in the passage. I went out of the parlour immediately, and found Mr. Hughes and Mr. Emmerson together; I believe they had hold of each other's collar. In going towards the back part of the house there is a step near the end of the passage. Hughes fell off the step; I rather think he slipped off. Emmerson said, take care, or you will be down the cellar, and catched at him to save him from falling. I should have mentioned that all this time there were words between them both but I cannot particularise what they were. I got in between them to part them, and said, for God's sake, Emmerson, do not strike the man. He said he would not, but it was hard to be cheated out of his property, and be struck with a stick. He opened his breast, and there appeared to be a fresh mark upon it.</p>

               <p>Did the deceased deny having struck him. - I got in between them, and parted them. I endeavoured to persuade the deceased to pay for the beer. His answer was, he had paid for it; that his name was Hughes, and he was a man of substance, and lived in Maiden-lane. Something brought Mr. Emmerson back, but I cannot say what. The deceased then made two blows at him, one of which struck him. Mr. Emmerson immediately laid hold of him, and went to strike him. I catched Emmerson, and said he should not strike him. He said it was hard to be robbed of his property and be struck, and have no satisfaction. I told him all the satisfaction he should have in my presence should be to charge the watch with him. Upon that Mr. Emmerson went away, I supposed to call the watch; he was gone some time; all that time I was endeavouring to persuade the deceased to pay for the beer; he said he had paid for it, and would not pay again. Mr. Emmerson came in, and brought a watchman with him, and gave Mr. Hughes in charge of the watchman. They went out with him. I went into the parlour, and I heard a noise in a passage that goes into Petty France. The watchman then said the man was so obstreperous, that he could not take him himself to the watch-house; he must get more assistance. Just as I came out of Mr. Emmerson's door the deceased was sitting on his breech at the step of the door. As soon as I came out the deceased threw himself upon his back; he afterwards turned upon his right side, and, with his left hand inclining towards the kennel, he then cried out murder several times, when nobody touched him. Mr. Emmerson was just before that going to him, but I kept him back, and said he was quiet enough then. Soon after came two watchmen. I think they lifted him up, and underneath the deceased was a piece of a coat. I believe it was the shortest of the men picked it up, and said here, d - n you, you have torn my coat; but I will make you pay for that. I observed there was a piece of the right side of the watchman's coat torn off. After the man was standing upon his legs the two watchmen, the deceased, and Emmerson, all went away together, and I went home.</p>

I asked what was the matter there. Bell, the watchman, told me they had got a gentleman that had torn the cuffs off his coat, and a piece off the back. Then they went on towards Tothill-street. When they came about two doors down, the passage was so narrow that they could not walk three a-breast.</p>

               <p>I had been at Wapping, and came home at one o'clock. As I came along Tothill-street I heard a noise. I was afraid of getting into trouble for being out so late. I thought they had got a pressed man, and I ran under the porch of a door to hide myself. I saw them have hold of a man, and a tall man walked sometimes before and sometimes behind the man. I did not know any of them. They had lanterns in their hands. I heard the deceased groan very badly as they came along Tothill-street. The deceased said something to that tall man, I could not distinctly hear what. The tall man replied, D - n you, you rascal, you ought to have one of your arms cut off. Upon that, one of the watchmen, I believe he that had hold of the left side of him, struck him, and said, d - n your sulky eyes, you can walk if you will.</p>
               <p>Do you know who that watchman was? - I did not know either of their faces. He struck him with a staff about the collar bone, or near his neck. They were just then passing me.</p>
               <p>Which of the men struck him? - I cannot tell any one of them. The deceased's head hung on one side. One of them took up a lantern, and struck him on the other side, upon the temples, with the edge of the lantern, upon which I heard him cry oh! three times. Then they passed me. I saw them as far as Colonel

            , near the corner of Dean's-yard, Westminster. I had been out with a family to Clapham, and had set them down in Fenchurch-street. I came, and put my horses up, it was then near one o'clock. I heard some people talking at the end of Tothill-street. I stopped, and heard the voice of a man, saying, what authority have you got to use me in this manner? The answer by some person was, we have got an authority, and we will show you our authority. I then heard murder cried three or four times very loud. I went to my own door, stood upon the steps, and saw four persons in company; three of them had got hold of a man, one under each arm, and the other was holding one of his legs, and the other part was dragging on the ground, and the voice of somebody, as they went along, said take hold of the other leg. They made a bit of a stop before they came into the Abbey church-yard, and I saw no more of them.</p>

From thence Mr. Emmerson proceeded on towards the watch-house, and we followed as fast as we could. When we came to the watch-house there was Mr. Emmerson and Mr. Draper, the constable, together, and the deceased was lying down in the watch-house. The constable said I will have him locked up directly. By the constable's desire, I had the key to open the door of the lock-up-hole; but, when the deceased was lying on the ground in the watch-house, I saw him move his head, which I should have mentioned before. I opened the door, and they brought him out into the lock-up hole, and he was put in by

               <p>I was taken by the lieutenant of a press-gang to the watch-house the same night. I was much in liquor myself. I laid me down upon the boards in one corner of the lock-up place. I had lain there about three hours, when they waked me with bringing the deceased in. I got up from the place to make room to bring him in. Three watchmen lugged him in by main force; they laid him down in the corner, in the place where I got up from. One of the watchmen, very jocularly said, d - n you, there is a pair of you. In their bustle one of the watchmen was locked up in the lock-up hole; they opened the door, and let him out again. I sat down upon one of the benches; the deceased lay in the corner. Between two and three o'clock I was awaked by Mr. Abington; he bid one of the watchmen unlock the door. When the candle was brought in, the deceased lay up in the corner, with his clothes, waistcoat and all, stripped over his head. One of the beadles said to me lend a hand to lift him up. We tried to lift him up; his head was inclining on one side; his waistcoat was pulled off without unbuttoning; it was slipped up; the buttons were inside, Mr. Abington said he thought the man was dead. A surgeon was sent for. He tried to let him blood, but very trifling came from him. The surgeon ordered him to be stripped, and rubbed with salt, and tobacco fumes to be blowed up his nostrils. He declared him to be dead. Then I was taken out of the lock up hole.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. I was called up by the church-wardens to the deceased. The man, when I came there, was to all appearance dead. I found no pulsation; his extremities were very cold and stiff. It appeared to me that he might have been dead some time; but to satisfy my friends I used every means to restore him, but with very little hopes. I was pretty sure he must have been dead some considerable time. After trying a variety of means, I gave it as my opinion he was dead. I took particular observation if I could see any external marks that might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150020"></xptr> have caused his death. I examined him very attentively, but could find none, except a slight scratch on the fore part of his throat. A mark of something having been very tight about his neck; I judged it to be his shirt-collar. I then went into the watch-house to Mr. Abington, who was enquiring into the manner in which he was brought there, and from the account they gave there of the rough manner in which he had been brought, I got a candle, and returned again into the lock-up place. Mr. Abington went with me. I examined the body again very attentively, but I saw no other appearances upon which I could form an opinion of the occasion of his death, but this scratch upon his throat, which appeared like the mark of a nail in the neck. I then left the watch-house and went home. In the afternoon I was called upon by the coroner to inspect the body. The first appearances which I took notice of were a very large blackness, extending a good way round the neck, and a great deal round the chest; those appearances, I imagine, must have arisen from the putrefaction, and it being exceeding warm weather, and probably in some measure encreased by the pressure of the men's hands round those parts. I am particular in mentioning these circumstances, because, from these appearances, there are prejudices in the neighbourhood very much against the prisoners. I had a gentleman with me, and I opened the body. Upon inspecting the thorax I found that in a very sound state, and the abdomen too. I opened the stomach. I found nothing there but a little undigested fruit, and a very small quantity of blood; but it appeared as if he had been drinking of spirits; there were no appearances that could lead me to suppose any injury had been done to occasion his death in those parts. I then opened his head, and found the vessels of the head remarkably full indeed of serum, and there was water in the ventricles of his brain; the whole brain had just the appearance of a man that had been hanged, which case I once had an opportunity of seeing. From these appearances I was led to suppose that the man had been strangled.</p>
               <p>Suppose he had died of a fit, occasioned by having too much heated his blood by drinking, would there have been the same appearances that you found upon your examination? - There would probably. I should imagine there would have been more appearances of blood upon the brain; there might, I should imagine, have been those appearances if there had been any pressure upon the brain.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I understood you, that when you first inspected the body you observed nothing that could lead you to say decidedly what was the occasion of the deceased's death? - I could see no marks but those I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Is it not very easy to happen to a man of a full habit of body to be suffocated by being laid horizontally, without any remarkable degree of violence? - Certainly; there is more danger to a corpulent than a thin man.</p>

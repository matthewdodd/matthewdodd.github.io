                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to John Foreman, of Commercial Wharf, Old Swan-lane, Upper Thames-street; he is agent to a flint and glass-bottle manufacturer; Seabrook was in his employ. On the 29th of May I came to work at half-past eight o'clock—as I was going up, Sea, brook said a cart had broken down, and he had had a hard job, he had hoisted a crate into the top floor—I cannot recollect where he said the cart had broken down—in the evening 1 and he were at a public-house, and he said the man was coming for the crate on Monday morning it seven o'clock—on Monday, at six, I went to work—I saw Seabrook—he said the man was coming for it at seven, and he was to have it—about seven I was up in the top floor—I saw Seabrook there—he went down stairs—Reeves came down the lane, opposite our warehouse, with a whip in his hand—he said, "Do you know a person named Brown or Bowen and said he called for the goods that were left there on Friday—I said I knew nothing at all about it, he had better go to the foreman—after that, in consequence of suspicion, I went to the warehouse where the crate was—I went to the crate, which was on the floor where I was working—it was a middling-sized crate—I did not open it—I pulled this bottle, now pro<lb></lb>duced, out—I pulled another bottle out, but that 1 put in again—it was similar to this, but not the same colour—I think they are my master's—the crate was fuller than they are usually packed—after I pulled the bottle out, Seabrook came up to me and said, "There is a quartern of gin for you at East's; you can go and take <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> and get it—<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> is the foreman—I called <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and went to the public-house—I then told him what I sus<lb></lb>pected, and he returned back—the crate would hold four or five gross of bottles.</p>

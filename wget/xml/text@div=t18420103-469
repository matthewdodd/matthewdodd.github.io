                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Harry Veal, a haberdasher, in Garnault-place, Clerkenwell. On Thursday evening, the 13th of Decem<lb></lb>ber, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop—I did not know her before—Mrs. Veal showed her some mitts—she said she</p>

               <p>could not afford to buy them—she ordered tome gloves, ribbons, and se<lb></lb>veral more things to be sent to No. 19, Wilmington-square, in the name of Miss Corbell, before twelve o'clock the next day—she did not pay for them—next day I went to No. 19, Wilmington-square, between twelve and one, as she had ordered some wreaths for a bonnet, and we could not get them sooner—I could find no Miss Corbell there—I went back with the things—in the afternoon of the following Monday the prisoner came again—she said she wondered we had not sent the things, but it was a mistake of hers, it was No. 29, Wilmington-square, not No. 19—she asked Mrs. Veal how much they came to—she said 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some halfpence—she said, "Never mind making a bill, I will leave 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the servant"—another customer came into the shop, and these mitts were on the counter—when the prisoner left we missed one pair—she had said she should like a pair of mitts, but she could not afford to have them just now—a box of mitts was shown to her, in which there were several pairs—I took the articles to No. 29, Wilmington-square, and no such person was known there—on Tuesday morning Mr. Veal brought her into the shop—he asked her if she had got a pair of mitts of his—she said yes, but she meant to bring them back—she was given to the policeman—I saw the mitts—they were my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a haberdasher's-shop. I found the prisoner at the corner of Rosomon-street, on Tuesday the 21st, talking to a woman who kept an apple-stall—I took her to my shop—I asked her if she had <hi rend="italic">stolen</hi> a pair of mitts from the counter—she said she had taken them away in a mistake, and intended to bring them back—she produced them from under her dress, and laid them on the counter—these produced are them—they are the same pattern and workmanship as mine, but the ticket had been taken off before she gave them back.</p>

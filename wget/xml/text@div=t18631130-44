                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, S</hi>). On 4th November, in the evening, I was in a public-house in Salisbury-street, Lisson-grove, and saw the prisoner there—I recognised him as a man whom I had seen convicted at this Court—I called him outside and asked him if his name was James Douglas—he said, "No"—I said, "Is your name James May?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I am an inspector of police; listen to what I am going to say. I was present at the Central Criminal Court Session in June, 1856, when you were tried in the name of James Douglas, convicted of burglary, and sentenced to fourteen years' transportation; and unless you show to me that you are on ticket of leave, or some papers that justify your being at large, I shall take you in custody"—he said, "I am not the man, you make a mistake"—I took him to the station, made him strip up his sleeves, and found some marks on his arms which I had seen previous to his being transported, some <hi rend="italic">tattooing</hi> on both arms—there were four letters when he was transported right across his arm, there is now only a smudge, a blue mark, and there were some additional marks—I was present in 1856 when he was stripped at the Paddington station, and I took him in custody—I know him independently of those marks, because I was present when he was transported before, for ten years—I have the certificate here—I searched him, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his breast pocket—it was not in a sheath.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there the same number of letters on his arm as there were before he was transported? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but there are the same number of marks—I do not call letters marks—there are more marks now than when I first saw them—the four letters across the left have gone, but there is a mark as if they had been there—there is not one single letter now which I saw before—I do not know him by letters, and there are not the same number of marks; but on his right arm there is a bottle and glass, two pipes, and an anchor—on the inner part of his left arm there is a man and woman—the letters were across here. (<hi rend="italic">The outer side</hi>)—I told the Magistrate that there were marks on his arms, and I partly identified him by them—I was not quite positive till I saw the marks—I mentioned the anchor and the pipes, bottle, glass, and man and woman, to the Magistrate, and signed my deposi<lb></lb>tion afterwards, but there is nothing there about them—I have seen many sailors mark their arms, and some policemen—the bottle and glass were there in 1856, and the two pipes as well, in the same place exactly—I have examined fifty or sixty arms since, but not four hundred.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> It is true what the officer says; I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Lord Raglan</hi> on 19th February, 1858, and was thirteen weeks on my passage. We took in prisoners at Portland, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, and could not get out of the channel. We put back, and were twelve weeks before we reached Freemantle. I was there fifteen months, and received my ticket of leave. I held it twenty-seven months, and got my conditional pardon. I was driving the mill for the last eight months. A gentleman asked me to take charge of fifty horses from Freemantle to Madras. I landed forty-nine out of the fifty, and one died on the passage. I stopped at Madras one month, and afterwards a captain gave me a passage to the Cape of Good Hope, having worked nine weeks on board. The captain could not make the Cape, and we ran for London, which is what brings me here now. I came in on the 5th August. I lost my pocket-book and papers, and all that I had when I came ashore in London.</p>

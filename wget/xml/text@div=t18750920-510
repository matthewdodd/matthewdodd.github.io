               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200067"></xptr>
               <p>him. and he replied that a man next door by the name of Holditch, owed him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she would pay Mr. Flock out of that—I went to Mr. Holditch, a tobacconist. who stated he did not owe defendant the money, but he had a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., out of which he was to buy the prisoner a watch—the prisoner was present at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of 86, Caledonian Road—on the 17th August the prisoner came to me and said he had had a little bit of luck, his old man had died and left him a lot of money and he produced a cheque—I should say this is the same (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) he said the lawyer had sent it to him—he left the cheque in my charge—I noticed Mr. Rusby's signature on the back—I should not like to swear it was on a Wednesday, the 18th August, that he came to me, but I think it was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I wish to say that two witnesses were brought against me, Catlin and Stesinger. Catlin made a statement on oath which if your Lordship will look at you will find to be incorrect. I received the cheque, for which I am very sorry, but I neither forged it nor stole it; it was given to me, and in receiving it I did wrong. I have no witnesses Those that are here can prove that the signature was on the back of the cheque.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Alexander Watson. I examined my desk in his mill at Stanwell on the 31st of January, and found there was 160 pence, 320 halfpence, and 20 farthings in it—it was safe at two o'clock—I did not leave till six in the evening—I was there all the time from two till six o'clock—there was an ink-bottle in the desk—I re<lb></lb>turned about twelve o'clock the same night, and unlocked the mill—I found the books and papers strewed about, the desk broken open, and the money gone—there was, among the rest, a particular penny-piece—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I had it in my hand at two o'clock that day—I went at one o'clock with the police-sergeant to Woolford's house—the officer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201310153"></xptr>
               <p>shook the door, and said he wanted young Woolford—they were nearly half-an-hour before they would open the door—when he got in I went and found this penny-piece in the possession of Humphreys—both the prisoners were there—there was some silver, and about 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, found there—there was some ink on the money—the bottle of ink in the desk was thrown down, and the penny-pieces were marked with ink, which had been dried on them, when some had been spilt before—I told the officer that he would find a mark of flour on their shoulder, as the place where the persons got in at was a separater, which laid in an inclining state, and the person who got in would probably touch this place with his right shoulder.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant T</hi> 26.) I was called about one o'clock to the mill by Mr. Harman—they had broken in at a window—I saw the desk broken open, and some ink spilled in one corner—I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's residence—I found on Humphreys this penny produced, and some marks of ink on Woolford's hands—when. I took them to the station I found the mark of flour on Woolford's shoulder—he would probably mark it in getting in—I could not get into the house for some time—they were in bed, but there was plenty of time for them to get rid of money—there was ink on this penny, and on another penny and one halfpenny, found on Humphreys, but the ink is worn off now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 45.) I saw the prisoners together about nine o'clock that night, going in the direction of the mill—I have compared Woolford's shoes with the marks in the ground, and they corres<lb></lb>pond exactly.</p>

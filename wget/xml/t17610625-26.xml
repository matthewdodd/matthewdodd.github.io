Then I sent for Johnson, and he owned he gave it to Wright; he said, Wright used to ask him for something to set his feet on, when he went to bed, and he gave it him. They both acknowledged the same before the justice. [Produced in court.] It used to hang by rings, at the corner, by the door, to shew that we sold such things. It is a new one, but the rain had spoil'd the colour of of it. When new, it was worth seven shillings and six-pence.</p>

My wife went to washing next morning, she saw it, and said, What does this man bring this for? it is of no use to us. A little after that I took and sold it, and an old waistcoat together.</p>

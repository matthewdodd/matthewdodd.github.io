                  </hi>. I keep the Dover Castle, Church-street, Greenwich. On 6th Feb., about 11 o'clock, Patrick Donoghue came and called for a pint of beer—I served him—he tendered me a shilling, which I put into the till—there were ten or twelve other shillings there—he drank the beer very quickly, so I looked in the till, and found a bad shilling—I took it out, and put it into my waistcoat pocket—a few minutes afterwards he came in again with the other prisoner, and called for a pint of beer—he laid a sixpence on the counter—I saw that it was bad, but did not tell him so, but gave him the change, and put it in a compartment of the till by itself—the prisoners drank the beer together, and in a minute or two Patrick called for another pint of beer, and laid down a sixpence—I found that it was bad, bit it before them, and put it with the other, but did not say that it was bad—they drank the beer between them—Jeremiah then said, "Master, I do not see that it is any use having a pint, give us a quart," and put down a shilling—I saw immediately that it was bad, and bent it three times one way, and again the contrary way, for the purpose of knowing it—a customer drew my attention off, which made me put it down, and the moment I did so, Jeremiah snatched it up, and said, "You have no business to bend it"—I took it—I watched my opportunity of getting round the counter, and went out to look for a policeman—Jeremiah tried to get away, and fought with me for some considerable time; he pulled the door open, and struck me, and, being stronger than me, he got out of doors, and I having hold of his collar, he dragged me several yards, and got away—I secured him after he had run about 200 yards, and he appeared to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> something away—I hallooed out, "Police"—we got 300 or 400 yards further, and he struck me again; we struggled, and he got away, and ran up a passage by a Church—I caught him again by the collar, and, about 200 yards down the street, met the other prisoner; I <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> him with my left hand, and held them both;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020096"></xptr>
               <p>a policeman came, and I gave one up to him and kept the other; he attacked me in my throat—another policeman came and got his hand from my neck—I am sure the prisoners are the men; I never lost sight of them.</p>

On Friday, near half past 12 o'clock, I was on duty in Church-street, and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoners—I took Jeremiah—he said that he knew nothing of the bad money—I found a penny on him, and on Patrick a good sixpence and a penny—Mr. Giles gave me these two bad sixpences (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to a spot which he described to me, and found this bad shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)on the footpath; it is bent.</p>

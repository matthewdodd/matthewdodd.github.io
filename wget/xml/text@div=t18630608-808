I am assistant relieving-officer at St. Luke's Work-house—I knew the deceased James Sully; he was employed at the work-house, and his duty was to open the door to all applicants for relief—from 10 o'clock to 12 in the morning was the time fixed to receive applications—I arrived at the workhouse about five minutes after 10 on the morning of 27th March—I found the old man (<hi rend="italic">Sully</hi>) lying on the ground, and the prisoner a short distance off, but not on the ground—I heard the old man say, "O God! my thigh is broken"—he died on 17th May—previous to 27th March he attended daily at the gate.</p>

               <p>before the Magistrate, Mr. Cooke, and saw him and the Magistrate afterwards sign it—the deceased was sworn, and the prisoner had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of cross-examining him—(<hi rend="italic">Deposition read</hi>: "I am an inmate of St. Luke's workhouse. The Friday before Good Friday, about 10 o'clock in the morning, I was at the gate of the house as porter at the relief-office; the prisoner now present asked me to let him in to see the overseer. I asked him where he came from. He said, 'Playhouse-yard.' I said, I must not let you in without your going back to get an order.' He went out for a moment. Some people were coming in, and he rushed in; I tried to shove him out. He up with his right hand and struck me in the left eye. I could not get him out; he put his foot in between my legs behind me. I collared him, and would not loose him; he shoved me down with his hand and fell on me. My mate came up. Hill and two men got him out, they took him off me. I felt my leg snap while he was on me. I was taken into the house, and had my leg set. I was in good health before then; I have suf<lb></lb>fered a good deal of pain from it. The prisoner swore he'd come in; he said he'd be d——d if he didn't. I don't recollect he said anything more.</p>
               <p>I never saw him before that day. It was in consequence of the fell that my thigh was broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attendant at the cab-stand opposite St. Luke's work-house—on 27th March, I was near the workhouse door, and saw the prisoner—he knocked for admission, and the deceased opened the door and refused to admit him, because it was before the proper time; that was about half-past 9 o'clock—the deceased slammed the door, and it struck him on the side of the head—the prisoner appeared greatly agitated, and said to me, "What do you think of that?"—I did not make him any reply—he said, "D—n him, if I was inside I would pay him off for that," or words to that effect—when the prisoner went in the second time I was on the opposite side of the road, and I did not see him again until he came out—he was afterwards in the custody of the police—he said to me, "You are the man who saw me struck with the door"—I said, "Yes; you have got a black eye since I saw you"—he replied, "Yes, but the old man did not give it me; it was one of the inmates"—that is all I know of the matter—the first time I saw the prisoner at the door it was before 10 o'clock—it was then that the door was slammed in his face—I saw him going in afterwards.</p>

I am an inmate of St. Luke's workhouse, and assist the relieving-officer there—at 10 o'clock on the morning of the 27th March, I was in the relieving-office, near the gate at which the deceased was gate-porter—I heard the prisoner had been at the gate nearly an hour before, it must have been before 10, when he came first—I was in the office when he came the second time, and I saw him shoulder and force his way in, and the old man resist him, saying, "You can't come in till the time"—I then saw the prisoner and him struggling together—the prisoner took hold of the iron railing with his left hand, and his crutch with the right, and delibe<lb></lb>rately threw the old man down—I ran to him, and he said, "Oh, mate, my thigh is broken"—I did not see the prisoner strike the deceased—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186306080050"></xptr>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of St. Luke's workhouse—on the morning of 27th March I was assisting in the relieving-office—I heard a noise at the gate where Sully was, and went to see what was the matter—I found the prisoner and Sully quarrelling—the prisoner had his hand on some iron railing close to the gate—I went up to him and asked him to go out, at the same time taking his hand from the railing—he made no reply, but used some abusive language to the deceased—he struck at the deceased two or three times, but I cannot say whether he hit him or not—the deceased instantly fell, but whether or not from the effect of the blows I cannot say, and the prisoner flung himself upon his body—I and a man named Hill took him off with some difficulty—we were in the act of taking him out when Mr. Gilchrist came up and ordered us to detain him—I heard the old man say, "My God! my thigh is broken!"—when the old man fell I was within a yard or two of him—I did not strike the prisoner—he was very violent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at 240, City-road—I am the medical officer of St. Luke's workhouse—I knew the old man Sully, and was called to attend him on 27th March—I found him in the infirmary, and proceeded to examine his thigh; it was severely fractured, and the bone was nearly protruding through the skin—I attended him from that time up to 17th May, when he died—he died from the irritative exhaustion of an unhealed fracture—he was a very hale man for his age, which was eighty-three, but he gradually sank—there must have been considerable violence used, but how it is difficult to say—there must have been more violence than a simple fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the thigh was broken by the deceased's own weight in falling to the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was broken by some one falling on him; as if some person had dropped on him with the knee; but that is only an inference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I knocked at the workhouse door about a quarter-past 10, and asked for relief. The deceased, who opened the door, made me no answer, but slammed the door against my forehead. In a moment of ex<lb></lb>citement, I said I would give it to the old rascal, little thinking what would happen. I waited outside a few minutes, and seeing some people go into the workhouse tried to go with them. The deceased seized me by the neck, and Hill, who was crossing the yard, came and struck me on the eye Bowker then came, and Hill pulled me down and tried to put me out.</p>

               <p>Several people about the door cried "Shame!" I was then on my back, and on getting up the deceased attacked me a second time, seizing me by the neck. We struggled together, and both fell, and that was how the accident happened. I had no desire to injure the old man.</p>

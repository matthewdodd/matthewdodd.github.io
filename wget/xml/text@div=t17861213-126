               <p>I was with my wife in my room at the back shop; I heard somebody in my passage; I got up to see who it was; I heard Sears call Jack; I saw these two prisoners run towards Mr. Cosby's shop; I then went in and sat down in the parlour, and in a very few minutes, Mr. Alfred sent the boy to desire I would watch these boys motions; I went over the way, and saw Sears put his hand to the latch of the door and open it; he then started back all of a sudden to Allen; he went in first; Allen stood just at the door; I saw Sears buy something of Cosby; I perceived they were talking together; Mr. Cosby turned round to get something out of a drawer, and at that time Allen took the sugar, put it on his shoulder, and ran across the way with it, towards me as fast as he could; I said, where are you going with this sugar? says he, what is that to you? I am going about my master's business, where do you think I am going? says I, you have been stealing it; no, I have not says he; and he tried to throw it down on my toes; I caught hold of the string, and held it in my hand, and he got away; then Mr. Alfred seized him; Mr. Alfred took Sears in about twenty minutes after.</p>

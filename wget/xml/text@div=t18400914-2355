                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Charles Griffith and his partner, whip-makers, in Hoi born. I missed a whip yesterday, about five minutes to one o'clock in the afternoon—it was worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed it from the right-hand counter—I had seen it safe one minute before I lost it—it was stolen by a youth about sixteen years old—there had been no one there but him, and immediately he went out I missed it—that boy has not been found—I went to various pawnbrokers to see if it had been offered—I went to Mr. Wells, and the shopman was in the act of taking in the whip of the prisoner—that was about an hour and a half after I lost it—I said to the prisoner, "How do you come by this?"—she said she bought it in the morning, of a tall young man, in Monmouth-street; that he had asked 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and told her it was worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that she gave him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; but that could not be true, as it was then safe in our shop—I have reason to believe, from what I have heard since, that the boy is the prisoner's son—while we were walking from Mr. Wells's shop to my employer's, the prisoner tore up some duplicates, and threw them into the mud—I met an officer, and gave her in charge—I told him he ought to take care of the duplicates—he took the pieces up, but he gave them to her again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When you came to the pawnbroker's the young man asked if you could swear to the whip; you said no, but there was a person who could tell it, if I would go to your employer's shop, and said, "Have you any objection to go?"—I said, "No, I bought it of a tall young man, quite a stripling," and then you took me to the station-house—I told you it was twenty minutes past one o'clock when I bought it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, you said it was of a tall young man, in the morning.</p>

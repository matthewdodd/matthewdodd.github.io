I am in the employ of Mr. Firth, No. 2, Aldgate, a woollen warehouseman—I know the prisoner—he carried on business as a tailor in White Rose-court, Coleman-street—he had dealt with Mr. Firth—on 13th Oct. last, I called on the prisoner to solicit orders—he told me he wanted a nice smart doe skin about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—he had given me an order for black beaver in Sept.—we send out goods on approbation, when parties</p>

               <p>are in want of these things; we send them in about the price they mention and they can return the goods if not approved—this beaver and doe skin were sent on approbation to the prisoner—he held out a ticket and said, "I am coming out in this style," and on the ticket was "Bumble's guinea trowsers"—I believed the statement he made that he was coming out in that style—I called on him again a day or two afterwards, and he said he thought it would do—the black doe skin he said he should like damped—it was sent back to be damped, and was sent to him again; that was what he had on 13th Oct.—I believed his statement about the guinea trowsers—I had no other inducement to let him have those goods, but that he had dealt with us before.</p>

I am of the firm of Boney and Newton, woolen warehousemen—the prisoner dealt with us—he said he wanted a black beaver from 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he wanted it to make up boys' coats, as he worked for a great many families—he selected a piece—I believed the statement he made that he wanted it for boys' coats, and that he was work<lb></lb>ing for a great many families—he took thirteen yards at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he wanted another that he was obliged to make better; I showed him a better, and he selected thirteen and a quarter yards—he then said he wanted another piece of black doe skin, the same as the last, alluding to one he had of me before; I told him I had not one at the same price—when he bought the first piece, he said he wanted it for guinea trowsers—he selected eventually thirty-eight yards of the last piece I showed him—he said he had sold almost all the previous one to boot makers to make ladies' boots—the goods that he alluded to were sold on 5th Oct.—we had not done business with him very long, and I called on him on 5th Oct., and sold him some goods—a bill that we had drawn on him before, was due on 4th Oct.—I had sold him these goods on the 5th, and I intended not to have sold him any more—I was induced to part with the goods on 26th Oct., because I believed the statement he made was true, and that he wanted them for coats and guinea trowsers—I had not intended supplying him again, and three weeks had elapsed, and I had not called on him—the amount of the goods he obtained on 26th Oct. was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen the duplicates of the goods he had on the 26th, and of the goods he had on 5th Oct, that he said he had sold to boot makers.</p>

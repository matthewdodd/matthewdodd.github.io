                  <hi rend="italic">Ellen</hi> and put them into the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi>—I stowed them in fives; they were thirteen rows high, with fifty in each, and. five over—I dropped her down fifty or sixty yards, to where we moon our craft, and went ashore a very little after five, leaving no one on the barge—I returned to the barge at ten minutes or a quarter past five, with George Burke and Vorley—I saw man on the pile of lead, and the moment he saw me he sprang over into his boat—I ran forward and said, "Hollo! what do you want?"—he said, "I have got nothing! I have got nothing!"—I sprang into the barge, and missed three pigs off the foremost pile against the bulk—head—I sang out, "Police"—I saw one man in the skiff and another in the barge—I believe the prisoners are the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Phillips and Company—on the evening of last Saturday week I went with Wyatt, Corty, and Vorley to the <hi rend="italic">Ellen</hi>—when we got there I saw the prisoner Bean on the gunwale of the barge, and Johnson in their boat—Bean was easing a pig of lead down to Johnson—I jumped out of our boat on to the barge gunwale, walked on the cabin top, and shouted out, "Police"—no police were near—I said to my companions, "Stop them, Charley"—the prisoners could hear what I said—my companions rowed after them, and Wyatt got hold of a bit of rope attached to their boat and turned it, and we made the best of our way to the shore—when they had got hold of the rope I heard one of the prisoners say to the other, "Throw them overboard," and Bean immediately did so—Johnson, who was rowing, got up from his sculls and assisted in throwing the lead overboard—I saw the lead, and saw and heard the splash—it was thrown overboard from the prisoner's boat.</p>

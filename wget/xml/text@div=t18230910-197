The prisoner has been in my service ten months or a year, and received money for me, which he should account for immediately as he came home. Langhorn was a customer of mine; she owed me money. I asked the prisoner if she had paid him; he said, No. I discharged him on the 24th of August, 1822. I saw Langhorn next week. He was apprehended in July last, and has never accounted to me for money received of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was very active in getting you customers - A. Yes; he had 8 s. a week. I advanced his wages (as he got customers) to 1 l. I never asked him to make up money which they did not pay. He gave me the money as being paid by the customers. There was a dispute between him and my brother, in consequence of which he left. I never offered to give up the prosecution for money. I do not think I ever said, if his friends paid me I would give it up. I told his father I would not hurt him if he would give security for the money he had received. He would not do that unless I received him into my service again, and stopped it out of his wages.</p>

            . I live in Union-street, Somers'-town. I dealt with the prosecutor. On the 24th of June, 1822, I paid the prisoner 3 s. To the best of my knowledge I gave him 3 s. I must have given him a shilling. The week after the prisoner left the prosecutrixes service, a bill was sent me amounting to 2 l. 9 s. I had paid it all but 4 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not you have given him a half-crown, a sixpence, and halfpence - A. I gave him no halfpence. I remember paying him.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of July, at a baker's shop in the Borough-road. I told him I took him for embezzling 30 l. from the prosecutrix. He confessed his guilt, and afterwards asked how much she charged him with. He then said it was between 20 and 30 l., for he kept a book, but it was not so much as 30 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I engaged with her I was to have half out of every ten loaves sold. I was induced to give credit, and have paid bills out of my own pocket. I became indebted to her in consequence of giving credit, and intended to pay her all. An account of it was made out. I had words with her brother, and left. She offered to take it by instalments.</p>

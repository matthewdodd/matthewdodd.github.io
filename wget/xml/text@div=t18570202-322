                  </hi>. I am a seaman, lodging at No. 7, Star-street, Shad<lb></lb>well. On 22nd Jan., between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was walking along Chig<lb></lb>well-hill, St. George's—somebody came behind me, gave me a poke in the lug (the back of my head), sent me down in the street, and then fell a'top of me—I was two or three seconds before I could recover myself, and when I did, I found the prisoner with his hand in my pocket—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Murder!" and "Police!"—I had no sooner <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, than a young woman flew from a house on the other side of the street, and fastened on the prisoner—she held him till I got up—the policeman came up, and he was given into custody—I missed two or three shillings from my pocket—he succeeded in getting my watch—while he was pulling it, I put my hand on my pocket, but he tore it away, and drew it through my waistcoat; tearing off the buttons—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—while I was down, the prisoner kept his knee on my belly, or side, so that I could make no resistance—I did not receive any blows while I was down—the prisoner dropped the watch, and a witness picked it up.</p>

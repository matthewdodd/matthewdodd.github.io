I am a porter out of employment—I have known the prisoner six months, or a little longer—I pawned the things produced at Mr. Harrison's on 18th August—the prisoner brought them to me at a public-house in Carthusian-street, Aldersgate-street—I pawned goods for him several times in different names—there were marks on them, and I saw him take them off—I found him waiting in the public-house when I came back each time—when I came back and gave him the money, he gave me sometimes 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> sometimes 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my trouble.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a buyer in the linen department of Messrs. Bradbury and Co. of Aldermanbury—the table napkins and lawn produced are all their property—I know the prisoner—he lived in the house in 1859—he was there about four months in the next department to mine—since he left the service I have seen him on some occasions when he has called there, the last time being about the 5th or 7th January—generally when he has come to the house it has been to ask for some outlandish thing or some extraordinary sized crumb-cloth, a thing not generally kept in stock, or something of that sort—he has had access at such times to the place where the stock is kept—I have never sold him anything in my life to my knowledge—some of the marks on the articles produced have not been removed, so that I am able to identify those goods by the marks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The prosecutors cannot state when the goods left their stock; Greenbury says that I never bought anything of him; I never went into the house with the least intention of purchasing; I only wanted to know the prices; I never asked for outlandish or extraordinary sized things; I was not in the warehouse since November, and then only in the presence of others; I went one day to Gibson's, a public-house opposite the General Post Office; I went into one of the back rooms, and joined in the conversation going on; I waited till all the company had left but one person, who said he recognised me as a Scotchman by my talk; I met him again by chance, at various places, not by appointment; one day he said he wished to have some private talk with me, showed me some table-cloths, and asked my opinion of their value; I said I could pledge them for more money than the price for which he proposed to sell them; I asked him more than once where he had them from, and he told me from parties who had advanced money on them to other parties who were pressed for cash; he said the reason he asked me to dispose of them was that he knew I would oblige him, and that I could get a better price than himself; at various times I lent him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and half a crown; about the middle of December I said "Could you get me two or three of those pawn-tickets, because I think I could sell them?" he said, "I think I can," and he gave me the ticket dated 17th November, and one or two others; a few days prior to 9th January two pawn tickets I had disposed of to Mrs. Davis; she sent the servant with the money; the servant was told that one or both the tickets were stopped; the first time I saw Mrs. Davis she told me about the tickets being stopped; I thought it was a joke, and paid no attention to her; the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186601290040"></xptr>
               <p>next time I saw her she asked me in a serious way what was to be done With the tickets; I said at once that I would go with her the first oppor<lb></lb>tunity to Walters'; I went by appointment to Mrs. Davis' and then ac<lb></lb>companied her and another woman to Walters'; I went voluntarily for my own satisfaction, and I was immediately given into custody, the policeman being in the next shop at the time; I leave you to judge whether, if I had known that those goods were stolen, I should have spontaneously gone to Walters'.</p>

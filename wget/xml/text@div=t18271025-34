I did not give it to him, but took it down to the house door; he went with me, and wanted me to give it to him there again; I could hardly get it out of my pocket with one hand; he put his hand and took it from me - he went round to the back of the house, saying he would go round to the kitchen door - he came back, and said he was going to bolt the gate, and they would bring me the two sovereigns; he went towards the gate, and then began to run; I ran after him, hallooing Stop thief! he was stopped at the corner of Northumberland-street.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ESDAILE. I sent Ferguson on an errand, and while he was gone the prisoner came in, and said, could I give Mr. Brooks, the cow-keeper, change for two sovereigns; while I was counting it he said I must send it round directly, as he had not got the sovereigns; the boy came in, and I sent him with the money.</p>

On Monday morning, the 23d of October, the prisoner came into my warehouse, when he saw me disengaged, he said, he had a few pounds to lay out in jewellery. The person that he had hitherto dealt with having offended him, and if I would serve him on the same terms he had been accustomed to buy he would give me the preference. In consequence of this I showed him such articles as he wished to buy; he looked out goods to the amount of 14 l. he then looked up to the clock, and said it is my breakfast hour, but observed, that business must be attended to in preference to eating and drinking. I then told him that my breakfast was ready and much at his service.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it. - A. About eight o'clock in the morning he breakfasted with me; we then returned to business; we had not been at business five minutes together before I observed one corner of this paper parcel under his coat. I immediately laid hold of him, desired him to walk up stairs, which he did; and immediately pulled from his breeches-pocket, the rings and the broach: he fell down upon his knees begging forgiveness; he then told me who he was. I sent for his father; an officer was sent for and he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for on the morning of the 23d. The prisoner was up in one of Mr. Wilson's rooms, he begged hard of Mr. Wilson to be sent on board a tender. I informed Mr. Wilson. I could not do it without an order from a magistrate. I searched him, there was no property on him; the property was taken before I came.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the property, I have had it ever since. There is six gold neck chains, two gold rings, and a gold broach; I took nothing from him, he put his hand into his pocket and gave them to me before I asked; this paper I found under his coat, it contains the neck chains; the other things he had in his breeches-pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to purchase these goods; when he turned back I had two rings and a broach in my hand, I wanted a neck-chain, the chains were not under my coat; I asked him how he sold them; he squeezed my hands together and took me up stairs, he asked me what I had there. I told him it was a neck-chain; he said, he would send me on board a tender.</p>

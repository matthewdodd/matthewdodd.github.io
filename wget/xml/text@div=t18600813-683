               <p>in December last I remember a person calling for an account for coals supplied by the Great Northern Railway—I think it was on the 29th that he first came—I only know the date by the man writing the 29th; I have no independent memory of the day—on that occasion my mistress offered him a cheque which he was unable to change, and he went away—my mistress directed him to call at 10 o'clock the following morning—next morning the prisoner called—I have not any doubt that he is the man who called—I opened the door to him—he said he came from the Great Northern Railway for Mrs. Bond's account—I asked him into the parlour, called my mistress, and she came up stairs to him—I did not go into the parlour with her—I did not see him go out; I opened the door to him when he came back, in about a quarter of an hour—he said the people would not give him change, but he would go round to the Rose, that he was well known there, and they would give him change—he went and returned in about ten minutes, and gave me the change, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he then left—he had no moustache or whiskers that I noticed.</p>

Fisher, December 30th, 1859—at that time I gave him an order for more coals, and he wrote," two ton of coals"—they did not come—in consequence of their not coming I wrote to the Great Northern, and then found out I had been defrauded—I have since paid the bill—I should think I was about a quarter of an hour with the prisoner altogether—he is the man who called the second time, the one that I paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Clifton-place, Finsbury—I remember the prisoner being on a visit to his father, at Clifton-street-north, on New Year's Day—he had a moustache at that time, of the same character that he wears now—I spoke to him over the wall of the garden—I have known him 16 years—he is much respected, and all his family.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—I have known the prisoner 16 years—I never knew anything against him—I have known him to wear a moustache for the last two years, or nearly so—I remember seeing him about Christmas time; he then had a moustache of the same character that he has now.</p>

I live at Shaftesbury-street, New-north-road—I have known the prisoner from a boy; he has always borne a very good character—I saw him last boxing-day and in New Year's week, and I teased him about his moustache; he had a light moustache at that time—it might have been a trifle lighter than it is now; I think gentlemen mostly dye their mous<lb></lb>taches to make them look a little darker.</p>

On Saturday, 12th April, about 3 o'clock, a.m.—I was in Lower Richmond Road, Mortlake, about five miles from Mr. Webb's house at Teddington, and saw the prisoner with this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him what he had in the bundle—he said a water proof cloak and dress belonging to his mother, which she had left at his house at Kingston the previous week—he looked very bulky and I asked him to unbutton his mackintosh, under which I found three coats; he said that two of them belonged to his father—he has one of them on now—he gave his aunt's address near the railway station—but he said that he could not exactly recollect the name as she had not been there long—I told him that his account was not satisfactory, and took him to Richmond Station, and found on him a pocket-book, a hymn-book, two pairs of gloves, a whistle, a punch, two knives, and a pair of studs—he did not appear to have been drinking.</p>

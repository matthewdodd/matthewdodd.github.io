                  </hi>. Izzard has been in my employment some time—it was his duty to go the Clapham Common round with the cart to get orders, enter those orders in his book, and when he returned to hand the book in and assist at the counter—it was part of his duty to go out and deliver goods, except the other man was ill, and then he would take his place—he resided next door but one to Gurr—his wages were 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—if he wanted goods for his own consumption, I should haw allowed him to have them on his paying cash or having them entered against him—I received a communication—Panther and Mellish watched his house from next door—on 31st May I had some information from the police, and Izzard was taken into custody—before I gave him into custody I said "What have you taken into your house this morning?"—he said he had taken nothing—I said "What did you take in the day before and the days previously"—he said he had taken in bottles of milk—I said "Probably you have taken in bottles of milk, but parcels?"—he said if he had taken in any parcels they were paid for—I afterwards went to his house in Bellamy Street with the police, and saw a variety of articles found there—I found two parcels, one of which I speak to, containing sugar, tea, and cocoa, of the value of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found two bottles of stout, and a variety of bottles containing sauces, and five packets of different kinds of grocery—I saw 32 empty condensed milk cans found in the dust-bin—I had given instructions to the men with respect to refreshments.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Izzard had been in my service nearly 10 years, and up to this time I have had no complaint to make against him—I communicated to all the men who went out with horses and carts, and I am sure this man was there—the price of the tins of milk full is 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; they are of no value at all empty—the value of all the other things that were found will be under 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if he wanted goods he would order them of any of the shop<lb></lb>men, and there are twelve or fourteen—if he paid for them at the time, they would not be booked; it would not appear what he had had, but only so much money received.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). Mellish and myself watched the premises of Izzard in Bellamy Street, from the 23rd May till he was given into custody—Mellish took notes at the time—I saw Izzard in his cart on the 23rd, 24th, 26th, and 27th—I saw him take things from his cart into the house; they appeared like parcels of grocery—on the 28th he drove up with the cart at 12 20—he took a small parcel from a basket, and put it in another basket,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180187"></xptr>
               <p>and took it into the house; came to ask to the cart, took two bottles, one wrapped in white tissue paper, into the house, and back to his cart, let down the tail board, and took out a square box of plants in pots—that was all I saw that day—on the 29th he drove up at, 7. 37 in the morning—he did not deliver anything there—he came again at 1. 36, took three parcels from the cart, one rather large, in brown paper, and two black bottles—he put them in a basket, and put them in—I saw him again in the afternoon, but he did not take anything in then—on the 30th he drove up at 1. 54, foot a basket containing several small parcels, and two black bottles and a large brown paper bag full of Something—I saw him on the 31st about 2. 40—he took into the house two black bottles, one large dark brown paper parcel, a light paper bag, and a deal box—on the evening of that day, a communication was made to Mr. Wright, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mellish and I were at Rose Cottage at the same time—I was looking through 'the curtains—I don't think anyone could see in—I have not tried it—I found the things at Izaard's house which have been spoken to by Mr. Wright—the prisoner is a married man and has a wife and children.</p>

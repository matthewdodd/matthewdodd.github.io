                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Thomas Kirkwood, pawnbroker, Brick-lane, Old-street. It is his own house, and is in the parish of St. Luke, Middlesex—on the morning of the 4th of February, about nine o'clock, I was in the shop, and heard a noise in the window—I urned round, and saw the prisoner's hand in the window—I saw him plainly—the square of glass was entire before he broke it—I ran out, and he ran off with two watches, which I saw him take out of the window—I ran after him, crying "Stop thief," and the policeman stopped him—I saw him throw the watches down—one of them fell on a ledge over the baker's shop, and the other fell in the road—I took them up, and knew them to be Mr. Kirkwood's property—they are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the window had been repaired the day before, and was sound at the time this occurred—I found pieces of glass within the window.</p>

               <p>in—the putty was quite fresh, being put in only the day before—it seemed as if some instrument had been put in to star the glass, and then it could be pushed in—I think it did not require force—there was an impression in three places in the putty.</p>

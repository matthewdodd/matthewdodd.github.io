               <p>Q. You are the wife of Richard Elden, the constable of Guildhall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going, on the 3d of June last, to a house in Cock-court, Snow-hill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there? - Mrs. Sullivan was there, and her husband at breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other there? - Not the first time that I went. I went and asked her for as much of her money that she sold as she could afford for three shillings, (I only having three shillings) she said, if I took it in halfpence and small sixpences, I should have seven shillings and sixpence for my three shillings; I refused them and went back again, and told my husband; I told her I did not know that they would do, but I would go back and ask, and I came away; nothing more passed at that time. I went back and told my husband and the other two officers. As soon as I told my husband he sent me back again, for the halfpence, if I could not get silver. Then Mrs. Sullivan was in the house and Conway; I told Mrs. Sullivan that the halfpence would do, and I was come for them; and then I gave her three shillings of good money into her hand, and she put her boanet on and went out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010057"></xptr>Q. Had any thing passed between you and Conway at that time? - No, I did not speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Sullivan you say went out? - Yes, and was gone the best part of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass while Sullivan was out? - Yes; there came another young woman into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Sullivan say when she was going out? - She said she was going to get the money. While she was out a young woman came in, Conway asked the young woman whether she would take a walk with her that afternoon? and she asked her where she was going? and she told her she was going over Blackfriars Bridge, into the Borough, and so over London Bridge, home the other way, for the people of the Borough were very easy to be done, and it was some time ago since she was there, that she thought they might welcome her again, for she made a very good afternoon's work when she was there before; and the young woman promised to go with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she meant by that expression? - Passing of bad money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it to be explained? - Conway was telling the other young woman that she had but two shillings in her pocket the last night, and one she changed for some eggs, and the other for some thread, and the remainder she had got a good supper with.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Sullivan say when she came back? - She said she had not got the money, but she had paid for it, and it would be ready in an hour's time; I told her I had not breakfasted, and in that time I would go home and get my breakfast, and come back again. I went and told my husband that it would not be ready for an hour.</p>

            When you returned again what happened then? - Both the prisoners were there then. The money was not come then. Mrs. Sullivan says to Conway, would she go and see if it was ready, and she went, and was gone the best part of a quarter of an hour; Conway went out for it, and came back again, and told Mrs. Sullivan that the gentleman was not at home; then Mrs. Sullivan said, she thought it was not finished. Then Conway sat a little space of time, and then said to me, will you take some large shillings? and I told her I did not know what she meant by large shillings; then she told me she would shew me; and she pulled a piece of paper out of her pocket, where she had got seven shillings wrapped up, and she gave Mrs. Sullivan six of them, and Mrs. Sullivan gave them to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you give for these six? - Three shillings. Sullivan told me that she sold the great shillings at sixpence a piece. I went and carried the money to the officers, and they made me go down and shew them the woman that gave me the money. My husband and the other officers were waiting for me in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money? - I marked it first with a fork, before I delivered it out of my hand, and gave it to my husband in a paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now, Mrs. Elden, who were you employed by to give all this evidence? - My husband had information and he sent me.</p>

            Were you ever on any of these errands before? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Quite a fresh hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband sent you, you say; was that by the direction of any body else? - Only by the solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. So he was determined you should find it out. You went for shillings at first, and then they offered halfpence, and then you came back to him for advice. The money would not have been put off at all, unless you had gone there? - They would hardly have brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. So this is the first time that you have been here as a witness? - Yes, it is the very first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that when you asked Mrs. Sullivan the first time, you asked her for money? - I asked her for as much of her money as she could afford for three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of the word whites? - I did not use that word.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were searched? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing found on Sullivan? - She slung a sixpence out of her left hand pocket, and Conway threw away a shilling, wrapped up in a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Conway was the person that took the seven shillings out of her pocket, and she was the person who gave it to Mrs. Sullivan? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mrs. Sullivan did not give you the money out of her own pocket, but she gave you what she received from Conway? - Yes; Conway brought it in and gave it to Mrs. Sullivan.</p>
               <p>Q. So it was Conway's payment to you, and not Mrs. Sullivan's? - I did not say any thing to Conway about it. Mrs. Conway says to Mrs. Sullivan, after I told her shillings would do, she says, Mrs. Sullivan, I will lend you six shillings, but I must have them again in the course of the afternoon, because I am going out.</p>
               <p>Q. So she gave them you by the desire of Mrs. Conway? - Yes; she lent them to Mrs. Sullivan, for I had paid Mrs. Sullivan for the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find them both in the same house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it? - Mrs. Sullivan's house, in Cock-court, Snow-hill, a private house. Mrs. Sullivan sat by the fire side, and Mrs. Conway by the window; going in I was surprized to see her, because I knew her; I had her here last session; she threw down a shilling before I could take hold of her, and I see Mrs. Sullivan throw a sixpence into the ashes, which I picked up; then we searched them, and found nothing about them, and went and searched about the house, and found nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any good money on them? - No, nothing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. So this was a scheme of you and your wife, to lay hold of these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010059"></xptr>defendants by any means? - By all means.</p>

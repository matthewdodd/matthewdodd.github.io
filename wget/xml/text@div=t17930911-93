               <p>Q. Had you seen yourself what number of candles were in this box? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. We have just heard a prosecution a little while ago of a piece of hessian cloth, I believe you never saw such five candles in your life, they are all broke in pieces? - They were all whole when he gave them me.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know how long this man worked for you? - About four months.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has a pretty large family? - I don't know that he has any; he is a married man.</p>
               <p>Q I believe you do now and then allow there men to take a candle? - I don't know that we do.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How far was this from the warehouse where this man was taken back from? - About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a common course warehouse candle, four-pence is the very utmost value of them? - I cannot say whether it is or not; I am not a tallow chandler.</p>

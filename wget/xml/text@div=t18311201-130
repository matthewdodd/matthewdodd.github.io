            . I am a City-officer. A gentleman came to the corner of King-street, and gave me information; I went with another officer, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner - we took hold of him; a great many persons were closed round the prosecutor; I had hard work to get up to him - I did not know the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to see the procession, and had the misfortune to be shoved into the crowd; the gentleman accused me of robbing him of his pin - I said,"Take me into a shop and search me," but he would not; I am not the man who robbed him - when a man is taken a crowd generally follows.</p>
               <p>MR. GADSDEN. He asked me in the middle of the crowd to search him; I am positive it was him who thrust his hand and took my pin.</p>

I employed the prisoner to help me to remove my goods from there—among the rest of the things there was a gallon-bottle of gin—it was sealed up—I missed it when I got to Chelsea, at we were unloading the things—I went to the prisoner about it—he said it was all right, I should have it again—I gave him in charge—I have employed him before—I have never got the gin back.</p>

            . About six o'clock on Thursday night, the 3rd of March, I happened to be in the field in which Mr. Stow's sheep were grazing; I shut the gate of the field after me - it is a common barred swing gate; it will not stay open unless it is kept back - I counted the sheep as they were put there to be drawn by Mr. Stow on the following morning; he was to take them home - I left home about seven or half-past seven o'clock the next morning; I passed by the field, but did not notice whether the sheep were there - I returned about one o'clock, and hearing they were gone I went to the field, and could see that they had been led out, not driven out in a flock; I could tell that from the footsteps - we should not have suspected them to have been stolen if that had not been the case; they had driven one or two away from the rest, and then the others had followed, as if they were going to water; they naturally follow in that way - they had gone out at a swing gate; there was no other way for them to get out - they were nearly full bred Southdowns; they were what I should call Southdowns. On Friday, the 11th of March, I accompanied Attfield, the officer, to a butcher's-shop in Long-alley, near Worship-street office; young Mr. Stow. the prosecutor's son, was with me - I saw eighteen sheep skins there; they appeared quite fresh, as if the sheep had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070016"></xptr>not been killed above five or six days; I desired Mr. Stow, Jun. to wash one of the skins, which he did, and I observed the letter S. distinctly on the rump - from that mark and the quality of the wool, I have not a doubt of their being the skins of the sheep which were lost; I did not observe more than the mark of one then; I have since - the quality of the wool was an age, which is not usually sent to market; the whole flock were not more than fourteen or fifteen months old; the prisoner is the person who kept the shop in Long-alley - I went to Deptford that day, before I came to London, and found twenty skins at Mr. Agutter's the fellmonger, in Mill-lane, Deptford; they were undergoing the process of limeing - I had them taken out, and then discovered the letter S. on them distinctly, on the rump, and on the side of one - I found the mark on the whole twenty, but more distinctly on four, which the officer brought away; I had them marked by the fellmonger - an officer named Smith and young Mr. Stow were with me; the wool is precisely the same quality as that on the skins that were in Long-alley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.The skins had undergone some process? A. They had been put into line, which is to take the wool off, but I had gone over on Thursday night as soon as I had got information, to stay the process, and they had not been long enough in the lime to injure the mark - they had not been in lime more than four hours, I should judge; I selected four of them - three were marked on the rump, and one I think on the rump and side; I am able most-certainly to say they were the marks which were on Stow's sheep - I never saw the prisoner in Lewisham or the neighbourhood.</p>

            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's son. I had seen the sheep which my father had sent to Mr. Tyler's to graze, and I believe I assisted in branding them. In consequence of information on Thursday, the 10th of March, I went to Worship-street office, with Attfield; I went from there to a butcher's-shop opposite the Dyer's Arms, Long-alley - I went into the back yard of the butcher's premises, and saw blood and other filth at the corner of the yard; I examined the privy in the yard, and found what I suppose to be the entrails of sheep - this was about noon; in consequence of what happened there, I went with Attfield to Leadenhall-market - Attfield apprehended the prisoner there: I did not see the sheep skins at the butcher's yard at that time I believe; Attfield said to the prisoner, "You are my prisoner," and asked him where he got the thirty-eight sheep - he said, "I bought them in Old-street-road, of a man," but he did not know the man - he said he gave 30l. for the thirty-eight sheep, but he did not inquire the man's name; after taking the prisoner to the office we returned to the butcher's-shop, and found eighteen skins - that was the same day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who first mentioned the number 38? A. The prisoner; we found eighteen skins in the front shop - they were in a very dirty state; I went next day to the same shop - we had left the skins there, and found them there; I washed part of one of the skins, and found the letter S. on the rump - I do not myself know whose shop it was; we searched, but found nothing more; we searched the privy more minutely; we found nothing but the entrails; there was no me it hanging in the shop for sale - it had the appearance of a butcher's-shop; we saw no meat there on the Thursday - there was no meat of any kind in the shop; I found a cleaver, a saw, weights and scales, a jacket, and other wearing-apparel there - Attfield took the jacket away with him; I went down to Mr. Agutter's at Deptford, on Thursday evening - I went to his yard, and found twenty skins in lime; I examined four of them particularly that evening, and saw the letter 
               <persName id="t18310407-11-person242">S. </persName>
            - we desired they might be taken out of the lime, which was done; the wool was of the same quality as that on my father's sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you ever been able to find more than thirty-eight skins? A. we have not - my father has no partner; when we saw the prisoner in Leadenhall-market, he gave the answer I have stated in reply to the questions at once - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>EDWARD WOOD. I am servant to Mr. Warmington a hide and skin salesman, of Leadenhall market. It is part of my business to go round to the butcher's-shops to collect skins for my employer; I do not know where the prisoner lived on the 8th of March, but I fetched on that day twenty skins from the house in Long-alley; the prisoner himself and two more younger men delivered them to me; there was a conversation between him and the other two, about the valuation of the skins - I brought them away, and delivered them to Devonshire, my master's foreman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your master here? A. Devonshire is - I was present when Mr. Agutter bought the skins of Devonshire; we collect skins, and sell them by commission - this transaction was in the ordinary course of business; I fetched the skins from Long-alley about one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you been in the habit of fetching skins from that place? A. No, I had never been there before.</p>

            ; there was no household furniture in the shop or apartment- there were knives and a chopper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner, in the conversation, tell you he had sold twenty of the skins to Mr. Warmington? A. I cannot recollect, I am not quite sure- I went to Warmington from information I received from Stow, Jun.; he took me there - I cannot say whether he had been there before; I believe the prisoner did say we should find eighteen skins in his shop in Long-alley - he told me they were there without my asking him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say the other twenty would be found at Warmington's? A. I cannot recollect whether he did or not - such a conversation might pass, but it has slipped my memory if it did.</p>

            . JUN. re-examined. The prisoner told me he had sent twenty skins to Warmington, but Leadbetter had been there before and given me information, which induced me to go there; when we took the prisoner he told us he had sent twenty skins to Warmington for sale.</p>

            . I produce the knives, chopper, saws, and two drover's sticks found at the butcher's-shop; they were in the shop where the skins were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not salesmen in the market use such sticks as those? A. I do not know - I have seen drovers use such.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BARRETT. I live at No. 7, Harding's-buildings, Long-alley, and am a private watchman in that neighbourhood. On a Friday morning in the beginning of March, about five o'clock, I was on duty near Finsbury-market, and met a flock of sheep - two persons were driving them at the time I met them; I firmly believe the prisoner at the bar to be one of those persons, but I cannot swear to him - the sheep were in a very dirty state, and on one or two of them there appeared to be a mark on the rump, but what mark it was I cannot swear - I saw them driven into a house opposite the Dyers' Arms; I cannot say how many there were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not said there were between thirty and forty? A. I never named any number to a correct quantity; I might have said there were between thirty and forty, but I cannot swear to the number; Finsbury-market is about two minutes walk from Long-alley - it is not in the direct road from Old-street road to Long-alley; I saw them come down South-street into Long-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Finsbury-market in a direction from Old-street-road to Long-alley? A. No, it is not - it depends on which way you go; Friday is a market-day at Smithfield, and a morning on which cattle are brought to London.</p>

            . I am a drover, and lodge in the prisoner's house in Long-alley - I pay him 1s. 6d. a week for my lodging. On Friday morning, the 4th of March, I was disturbed by some sheep coming into the house, between five and six o'clock, and the noise of people; I did not go down stairs then - I went out between eight and nine that morning, and saw in the yard between forty and fifty sheep, as I should guess; they were smallish sheep -I came home again between four and five o'clock in the afternoon - the prisoner was at home, killing the sheep; he was assisted by three persons - they continued killing the sheep till eleven o'clock at night, and next day, when I came home to breakfast, at eight o'clock. I found them killing sheep; they did not cut up any of the carcases - they skinned them; the prisoner had no furniture in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Then the prisoner did not live there himself? A. No - the place is much like a slaughter-house; one of these sticks is such as salesmen use in the market, to keep sheep together - the other is a drover's stick; it is not mine; another man lodges there, but he is not a droven - I had never seen the prisoner kill sheep there before; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070018"></xptr>only lodged there about six days when this happened, and had just paid him 1s. 6d.; I have not said that I believed there were between thirty and thirty-five sheep - I do not recollect saying before the Justice that it was thirty or forty.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ROBSON. I am landlord of the house in Long-alley which the prisoner rents. On the 4th of March I remember seeing the prisoner and some other persons killing sheep in his yard - I did not observe any marks on their backs; I saw some skins there the next day or the next day but one - they were fresh skins, but dirty; I saw the letter S. on the rump of them.</p>

            . I am a constable of Lewisham, and am paid for watching on some nights. On Friday morning, the 4th of March, I remember being on duty at Lewisham, and about a quarter before one o'clock, at midnight, I saw a drove of sheep coming along - I consider that there were from forty to fifty of them; only one person was driving them - I believe the prisoner to be the man; he was in quite a different dress to what he is now - I have not any doubt of his being the man; they were small sheep - I know Tyler's field very well; the sheep were being driven in a direct road from Tyler's field towards London - they were driven unusually fast; they seemed very fresh under foot, not at all fatigued - they were about a mile and half or a mile and a quarter from Tyler's field.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you before the Justice? A. Yes; there is no other Lewisham watchman here that I know of - I have a distinct recollection of what I said before the Justice; I did not say there were four beasts with the drove of sheep - I believe there was another watchman before the Justice, but I did not hear him examined; I am quite certain there was but one person with the sheep I saw at Lewisham - I spoke to the prisoner, but did not stop him; I had a dog with me, which frightened the sheep, and he swore at the dog - I told him the dog would neither hurt him nor the sheep; he bade me good night, and went on - this was a little before one o'clock in the morning, between the White Hart and the Castle, beyond the watch-house; it was higher up the town of Lewisham than the White Hart - I am employed as a night constable and a private watchman as well, occasionally; there is a private subscription for watching at night - he was perhaps three or four minutes passing me; he went along very swiftly, swifter than drovers go in general - I thought he drove them too fast for a regular drover; I had never seen him before with sheep to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you ever seen him before without sheep? A. I have seen him before - I know his face familiarly by seeing him about, but I cannot exactly recollect where.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you ever spoken to him before so as to know his voice? A. No, I heard his voice at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About how near were you to him when you had the conversation about the dog? A. About four yards - it was a star-light night.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prisoner stand opposite to you during any of the time? A. I was about four yards from him - I stood still and he was moving on; I swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>JOHN PINKS. I am servant to Mr. Hulme, a meat-salesman, in Leadenhall-market. On Saturday morning, the 5th of March, about five or six o'clock, I found the carcases of seven taggs left at my master's shop for sale, and on the Monday following I spoke to the prisoner about those sheep; I told him they were dressed very bad, and he had better pay a man 1s. to have them dressed as they should be - he said his son did not come home till late at night, and he was in liquor, but he was very well satisfied with the prices he got, thought he got nothing by them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has your master been in the habit of selling sheep for the prisoner before? A. yes, several times before.</p>
               <p>One of the skins found at the prisoner's house, and one found at Mr. Agutter's were handed to the Jury, with the brandmark.</p>
               <p>MR. STOW. The growth of the wool in the sheep would extend the mark - they were marked seven months ago; I have no doubt of the skins being mine - I swear to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the officer took me I told him where the skins and things were, and where I bought them - I bought them in Old-street-road, joining the City-road; I drove them home into Long-alley, killed them. and sent them to market, some to Pinks, and some to another gentleman's - he asked what I gave for them; I told him 30l. - he asked if I knew the man I bought them of; I told him I did not - he asked if I had got any witness: I told him yes, and I believe they will be here - when I got to Worship-street the Magistrate asked me where I bought them; I told him in Old-street-road, and what I gave for them.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

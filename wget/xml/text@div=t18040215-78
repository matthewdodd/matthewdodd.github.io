When I got into Harley-street, I think he then observed me following him, upon which he began to run till he came into East-street, Manchester-square; he went into a court that leads into the mews, I run after him, and he dropped the bundle at the end of the court, in the mews; he had got his coat off, and thrown across his arm; I asked him what he had done with his bundle, and he denied ever having it. On my turning back, I found the bundle where I supposed he had dropped it; I took it up, and brought it home with me; the prisoner lived in a room over my stable; I went there, and waited till he came there; I gave him into custody of the watchman about half past eleven o'clock, and he went to the watch-house. He was intrusted with locking up my warehouse, he had 17 s. 6 d. a week, my old clothes, and victuals from my house, and his wife had about ten shillings a week; he was placed in a situation far above want.</p>

He never paid me the 2s. - he had not quitted my service: I said to him, "Mr. Wilson is running more than he has done for three years;" and in a day or two afterwards he told me that Mrs. Wilson desired me to make out a bill - I gave it to him; it was 1l. 0s. 8d. - he look it, and said she was quite satisfied, that she had kept an account against me, and that she should receive money in a fortnight, and would pay me; I said, "They are very respectable people, let it go on till Christmas;" in a few days the prisoner was taken ill - I went out with the beer, Mr. Wilson took it in, and said "This is three days' beer;" I said, "It is a mistake, there are four weeks."</p>

On Friday, the 26th of December, I left my daughter in my room, about nine o'clock in the morning, and went out - I returned about five in the evening, and found the room broken open; my box was broken open - the room door was not injured; I had left there two coats, a pair of shoes, and two razors in a case- I gave them to my daughter to put into the box; I found the lock of the box broken, and these things gone- I had left the box sound; the officer has the things in his possession - I found him in the room with the articles; I am certain they are mine - I swore to them at Worship-street Office; I missed a sixpence from the corner of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150021"></xptr>box - it was silver, but so thin as not to be passable; I shall know it again - I saw it before the Magistrate; I went there on the Wednesday - a cupboard in my room was broken open, by the top of the door being broken; I heard a noise in the court when I came home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. He is a neighbour's child; I support my daughter myself - I have not many visitors; I know one Hooper - he might be acquainted with my daughter, but not in my place; I would not permit it - I do not know where Hooper is; the value of all the articles is 14s. - all the rooms in the house are let out in separate apartments; there are two other lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how often Hooper has been tried here? A. No.</p>
               <p>JANE MULLINS. I am going on for seventeen years old, and am the prosecutor's daughter; I lived with him at No. 28, Cock-alley - he left me in the house on the 26th of December, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; I remained at home about an hour, and then went out - I am quite sure I locked the door; I was gone about half an hour - on returning I found the door locked as I had left it; I unlocked it, and came into the room - I found no difficulty in unlocking it; I heard a noise under the bed, and saw the top of the cupboard-door had been broken inside; the cupboard is in the corner of the room, and one end of it comes into the staircase, and there is a little board like a window in the partition - he had broken through this piece of board to get in; the board was nailed like a window that opened into the cupboard, and then the top of the cupboard-door was broken - it could not be unbolted, because there was a bureau bedstead against it, but it was broken away sufficient for the body of a person to come through; a box, which I had left on the bureau, had been taken down and put on the chair - it was not locked; I had left some clothes in it, but not my father's clothes in that box - there was another box under it on the bureau and that had been broken open; the lock was broken quite off, and two coats taken out which I had put there in the morning - I saw them on the bed, also a pair of shoes, and a sixpence; the two coats were on the bed - I did not see them on the bed when I came into the room at first, but I did afterwards; I saw the prisoner searched, and the sixpence found on him, but before that I had given an alarm to the neighbours - I locked the door and went out; I had not seen the prisoner in the room then - I went over to Beavis the constable, and gave an alarm, and he came back with me; I then found the prisoner sitting on the chair - the constable searched him, and found a sixpence, a bad sixpence and 4d. on him; I had locked Mrs. Betty in the room when I went out to fetch the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you there when the clothes were found? A. I saw them on the bed; I knew the prisoner as a neighbour's child - he used to come to my father's, but had not been there that morning while I was there; a Mrs. Farrow, who my father knows, had come up - I locked the door when I went out, and left nobody in the room; nobody else had been there - I am not acquainted with Hooper; I know him - he had not been there that morning, nor had I seen him.</p>
               <p>MARY BETTY. I live opposite to Mullins; she gave me an alarm out of window, and I went up to her room - I heard nothing, but she said somebody was under the bed; I then looked and saw the prisoner under the bed - he came out; she then locked me and the prisoner in the room while she went for the constable - she returned in about ten minutes with an officer, who took him; I saw him searched, and two bad sixpences found on him, and while Beavis was looking to see if there were any more property on the bed he ran away - the officer ran after him and stopped him, and then he was secured.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BEAVIS. I am a headborough of Norton Falgate. In consequence of the alarm I went to the prosecutor's room, about one o'clock in the day, with Mullins, and saw the prisoner - I found in his waistcoat pocket a sixpence, mutilated; she said it was her father's -I was looking about the room, and he made his escape down stairs; I ran down, and look him - I returned to the room, and found two coats on the bed - some person handed me a pair of shoes and a razor-case, which they found under the bed; I found an old chisel on the floor.</p>
               <p>JANE MULLINS. These are the two coats, which I locked in the box, and these shoes - they are my father's; these are the razors and case which were in the box which was not locked, and were taken out of there - this is the sixpence; there are only three rooms in the house, one above another - the landlord does not live in the house.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MULLINS I know these coats to be mine, the shoes, the razors, and the sixpence - the chisel does not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Seven witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

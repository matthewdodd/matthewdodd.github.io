                  </hi>. I am a shipwright, and lodged at No. 17, Hand-street, Woolwich—the prisoner was landlady of the house—I was about to leave my lodging on the 17th of April—I left my chest in my bed-room when I went out to work—I returned about seven o'clock in the evening, and found the chest removed down into the kitchen—I found it still locked, and took it away in about an hour and a half to Martyn'a-passage, where I removed to—I had seen six sovereigns safe in it on Monday, the 13th, but not afterwards—I did not open it till the 18th, and then missed the six sovereigns—the prisoner told me she had moved my chest into the kitchen when I came home—I had the key in my possession—I was going to leave, but my time was not up till the evening.</p>

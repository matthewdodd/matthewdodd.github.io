                  </hi>. I am manager of the White Hart Inn, Bishopsgate-street-without—on Thursday, 19th March, a little before 1 o'clock, the prisoner came for a bottle of lemonade, and gave me in payment a bad half-crown—I said to him, "This is a bad half-crown"—he said, "I took it in Leadenhall-market"—I said, "This is not the first half-crown you have passed here; you were here three months ago, I shall look you up. I have been looking out for you for this last three months"—a woman came in with him, and when I said that she <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> out of the place and ran away—the prisoner stood very quietly till the police came, and then I gave him in charge—all he said was, "I took it in Leadenhall-market"—three months ago he came in for a bottle of lemonade and a cheroot—I was rather busy at the time, and alone in the bar, and had not the chance of taking him—he then gave me a bad half-crown, and I gave him change—I did not examine it till he had gone, and I put it on the side-board where we keep the small change, and afterwards tested it, and found it was bad—I marked it, put it away, and gave it to the policeman with the one passed on the 19th—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man—I could not be mistaken—I took notice of him.</p>

               <p>a chemical test for all money, caustic—I bent the half-crown first with my teeth, and then tested it—I did not call the woman back who was with you—you did not try to get out—you had as much chance of getting out as the female—when I told you the half-crown was bad you immediately gave me a good one—I found the first half-crown was bad before you went out—I had seen some one very much like the prisoner before that first occasion, but not a person I could swear was he—I had not seen him between the first occasion and the 19th of March.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fur and sealskin dresser, of 41 and 42, George Wharf, Bermondsey—I have been in business two years this month—on 8th July the female prisoner came to my private house and asked me whether I was a buyer of furs—she was a stranger to me—I said "I</p>

               <p>don't know, what sort are they?"—she said "Ermine"—I said "What is the price?"—she said "We generally get 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, but lately we have not been able to get more than 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—I told her that I was not a buyer generally, I was merely a dresser; that I did not know the exact value of the skins, but if he she would call again at my place of business at 7 o'clock in the evening, I would inquire in the meantime and let her know—she produced a bundle of ermine from under her dress; about twenty skins—I told her I should require the bundle to ascertain the value and she left it with me—she came to my warehouses, No. 41 and 42, about 7.30, that is about 100 yards from my private house, No. 67—I had communicated with the police, and was acting under their directions, and they were outside during the interview—I wrote a letter to the inspector—only us two were present; the work-people were in other parts of the building—directly she came in she saw some nut galls which are are used in our business, she said "Do you use these?"—I said "Yes"—she said "I can get these, in fact Indigo, or drugs of any sort, we get them from the navigation boats from Hamburgh and those places, there are four men in our gang who work these boats; sometimes it is jewellery, spirits, silks, drugs, or furs"—she asked me whether I had made up my mind as to having the ermine—I told her I could not give her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I would give her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said that she could not take that, and I agreed to give her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were forty-six dozen and seven skins—I asked her whether she would bring them that night—she said "Yes, I would rather bring them at night"—I said "Very well, have you far to fetch them?"—she said "No, only in Gillett Street" I thought she said, but I find there is a Gedling Street about 250 yards from my place—she was to bring them to my house, No.67, as soon as she could—she left and returned in about an hour with forty-six dozen and five ermine skins, and she brought the other two next night—I told her I could not pay her all the money because I was short—she said "Very well, I will call again next night"—I had paid her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and got this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she wrote the "E. White<lb></lb>combe" and I wrote the rest—I told her I was very sorry I could not pay her the balance then—she said "Oh, never mind, we are never short of money; I have been at this business fourteen years and never made a mis<lb></lb>take yet, in fact there was a man who used to live in Bermondsey Square and had apartments there who started some few years ago with nothing hardly, and he has made so much money by it that he will take very little of us now; he is almost independent"—I told her to call again on Satur<lb></lb>day—she said that most likely she would see me in the latter part of the next week; that there were two boats coming from Hamburgh to London, from which they got the goods, and that she was very busy this time last year and doing a rare trade—I paid her 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more on account, and it was put on the same receipt—she said that she had made a mistake the previous night and signed her right name, and she had better scratch tha out and write her false one, and she scratched out the name and signed "M. Hall" underneath it—that was in my private house—a detective was present; he got into a cupboard when he heard her knock—I had been in<lb></lb>clined to have the door open at the previous interviews so that the detective, who was in another room, might hear our conversation, but she suggested that the door should be shut, and it was through that that I had the de<lb></lb>tective in a cupboard on the second occasion—when she came-in I asked</p>

               <p>her whether she had anything; she said "No, not yet, but my husband is out to night and will be out late, and I shan't know till he comes whether we shall have anything or not"—she spoke again about the four men in the gang, <hi rend="italic">lumpers</hi> who bring these things ashore—she said that the things were brought to her house, and there was a secret passage leading from her house to another, and that they did not bring them to her house till the goods had been sold by the sample, and that the things were generally brought ashore at 11 or 12 o'clock at night, and sometimes 1 or 2 o'clock—a deal of conversation passed, as the police told me to draw as much as I could out of her—the man in Bermondsey Square was referred to again, and she said "Do you know that party?"—I said "No"—she said "He lives over the water, and rides about in his carriage"—there was one skin over, and I asked her what she would charge—she said "We will not be particular about a skin. I will charge you three halfpence for them"—she said that she was in the habit of taking about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week at various places from publicans and chemists—she also said that she did not know what they were going to get till they got them; sometimes it was grebes and sometimes it was ermine—she said "In the case of jewellery we take the stones out and burn them, and in the case of skins we cut the marks out and burn them, so that they should not be known"—she also said "I would rather bring them here as it is handy for me, because there is the 'bus hire over the water, and another thing, we have to be very careful what we are about"—I paid her 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time, the balance of the account—she gave me a receipt, I said that I was very sorry I could not pay her at the time—she said "Never mind, we shall understand each other better in future"—I have seen her since she was in custody—I went to her house, 31, Gedling Street, that evening, 30th April—the police advised me to do so—I saw a little girl outside the door—there were some gloves in the window for sale—I went in with the excuse to buy a pair of gloves, saw her there, and she introduced me to her husband—I said "I suppose you have not been able to get any<lb></lb>thing lately"—she said "No, sometimes it is a month and we don't get anything, but we may get something within an hour from now; through the strike taking place last year we have lost a great deal of our trade"—that was the strike on board the boats—her husband said "Sometimes they like a change, and don't bring them to us but to other places"—the female prisoner brought out some tobacco and I bought 1 1/2 lbs. for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said that they had a great deal of that, and the man said so too—I said "It is a bad job you have not been able to get anything lately"—he said "Yes, it is a very bad job, but I will come round and see you as soon as I get some<lb></lb>thing "—he also said "I have got some black grains"—that is leather—I said "They will be no use to me"—I had no other interview; the next time I saw them they were in custody—this <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I wrote to the inspector—it is dated 8th April—this is the receipt.

This is only a small lot; this time last year we were very busy; we were having large quantities of skins from the steamboats, and I have no doubt next week, the beginning or the middle, I shall see you. In fact, even to night we are likely to have some; there are <hi rend="italic">lumpers</hi>; there are four in our gang they sometimes bring them at night," and she asked him if he would do with some tobacco or spirits—he said "I don't use that sort of thing, I don't require them"—she said "You will be sure to see me during next week"—I followed her home to 21, Gedling Street—on Saturday, 30th May, I went with Inspector Charlwood with a search warrant—the female prisoner opened the door—I told her to call her hus<lb></lb>band, and he came—I told them who I was, and that I had got a search warrant to search their house—I said to her "I am going to take you in custody for having in your possession, on 8th April, forty-six dozen and a half of ermine skins which you sold to Mr. Whichelow of Grange Wharf"—she said "I know nothing about the ermine skins at all, I have not sold any"—I took them to the station and produced these two ermine skins, and the receipt, and said "These two skins are a sample of the skins which were sold to Mr. Whichelow, this is your receipt"—she said "I know no<lb></lb>thing about the skins, I have not sold any to Mr. Whichelow, I know nothing about them;" Mr. Whichelow gave me the bulk of the skins and they were shown to Mr. Hirschel—the prisoner's house was searched and some pipes were found.</p>

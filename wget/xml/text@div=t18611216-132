                  </hi>. I am a stick manufacturer, and five at 1, Rutland-street, Kingsland-road—I am acquainted with the prosecutor—on Monday evening, 25th November, I went with the prisoner to an eating-house at the West-end, where there was some little altercation between the prisoner and the prose<lb></lb>cutor</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186112160072"></xptr>
               <p>—next day I went into a beer-shop in the City-road with the prosecutor—the prisoner came in perhaps two or three minutes afterwards, and sat not far from us—words passed between him and Monpion, but I did not notice what they said—Monpion was not very sober—the prisoner did not look tipsy, but I could not say that he was sober—they continued talking a minute or two, and a few minutes afterwards I saw them on the floor; the prisoner had a penknife in his hand—I took it from him, and put it in my pocket—I did not notice whether there was any blood upon it—the men got up, and we went into a public-house opposite, where we remained perhaps half an hour, till 7 or past 7—we had two quarts of drink between four of us—my home is twenty minutes' walk from there—we all four left together—the fourth man came with the prisoner into the first beer shop—the prosecutor got home first; I found him in my place when I got there—he had fallen down on the floor—my wife told me something, and I saw blood on his trousers—they were taken off, and I saw two wounds on his thighs, with a great quantity of blood coming from them—I stopped the blood, and then sent for a doctor, and had the prosecutor conveyed home in a cab—when they were on the ground, I heard the prisoner say in French, "What for did you insult me last night?" and afterwards he struck him—I did not notice what reply the prosecutor made; I do not understand per<lb></lb>fectly—three or four minutes after that I saw him on the floor—I gave the knife to the policeman.</p>

I am a wheelwright, and live at Murray-street, New North-road—I work for an employer—I am a French<lb></lb>man—I knew the prisoner before this occurred—I was with him in a French house at the West End, and he attacked me with words—on the next day, Tuesday the 26th, I went to a beer-shop in the City-road with the last witness, about half-past 5 or 6, and the prisoner came there with his lodger—I do not know his name—I asked the prisoner why he had insulted me the day before at the West End; he said, "Yesterday, when we had that</p>

               <p>tussle I might have hurt you if I liked, but I did not wish it"—I said, "That is true; I took it very cool, the inault yesterday;" he said, "That is very true"—we had a slight quarrel, and then we had a pot in the tap-room—a few minutes afterwards I went to the bar of the beer shop, and then went out to make water—as I came in the prisoner had his back against the bar, and caught hold of me and gave me some blows—I continued to stand, but I threw him to the ground and fell on top of him—I was over him, and directly I got up he got up—nothing more occurred there, but we went to another beer shop opposite and had something to drink altogether—an Englishman there showed me that there was some blood on my trousers—I stayed there a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, or half an hour, and then went to my home—I did not go anywhere first—from my home I went to Calle'a, to get one of my children who was being taken care of; and Calle came home ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards—I then found myself bleeding, and gave Mrs. Calle half-a-crown to send for some camphor, as I was fainting—my clothes were removed; I was taken to a doctor, and sent home in a cab—I am not well yet, but my wounds are not quite so bad—I never said anything to irritate or provoke the prisoner before the blows were struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on Wednesday morning, 27th Novem<lb></lb>ber, about 1 o'clock, I was called to Callers house to see the prosecutor—I found him with four incised wounds; one on his left groin, one on bit left thigh, one on his right thigh, and one on the lower part of the left side of the chest—they might have been produced by a knife like this—that in the groin was about half an inch long; I did not think it judicious to probe it; that on the upper part of the left thigh was three inches long and half an inch deep; that on the right thigh an inch and a half long and half an much deep; that on the chest was about a quarter of an inch long and down to the bone—there was not very considerable haemorrhage—the wounds are comparatively well now he is out of danger—the most dangerous wound was the one in the groin, as it might have entered the abdomen.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, White-hart-row, Battle-bridge: I am a constable. On Sunday, September 28, about nine o'clock in the evening, I observed the prisoner come, with two more, and run from the corner of <placeName id="t18231022-160-crimeloc859">Dean-street, Oxford-street</placeName>

I spoke to the gentleman, and they crossed over to another person. I watched them carefully down Oxford-street, towards St. Giles's. I saw the prisoner stoop forward, and whip the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, and put his hand under his coat. They were all three together, and all ran away. I pointed out the prisoner to Reardon. I went over to the gentleman and stopped him, and told him what had happened. He said he would come forward, but the lady with him would not allow him. I do not know his name. I pressed him hard for it. I afterwards saw a parcel of people running, and went up and found the prisoner struggling with Reardon, near Soho-square. The handkerchief has not been found.</p>

            . I live in Grenville-street, Somers-town, and am a mason. Sometimes I work for Mr. Smith, and sometimes for myself. I am acquainted with Colton. I was with him on the 28th of September, in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner there with two other men, in company together. I watched them half an hour. I saw Ash go up to a gentleman with two others, and the prisoner took a handkerchief from his pocket. They were going down the street, towards St. Giles's. I saw the prisoner rush down the street, and attempt to strike a gentleman. I saw him and the two others cross the way. I crossed near Dean-street. When Ash flew up to the gentleman, (who had a lady with him,) the other two were behind him. Directly I saw him take the handkerchief out, I crossed the street. There is a short street near Grafton-street. The prisoner ran round the coach-stand, and I after him. One of the coachmen struck me with the whip; the other two ran away. I thought Colton would pursue them. There was a gentleman who was present when we stopped, but he is not here. The prisoner was so violent I was forced to get him into a door-way to hold him; he kicked his shoes off in the struggle. I saw him fling the handkerchief between the wheels of a coach. I went afterwards to the stand, and the coaches were gone. There were only the watermen left. I do not know the other two men that were with the prisoner. I have worked very lately at my business as a plasterer; I worked at the Foreman's house about a month ago; I have sometimes jobs every day in Somers'-town. I have not been in constant work, but do jobs when I get them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the robbery. I was going to my sister's.</p>

             was with me, and so up comes the Prisoner in a Riding Hood, and ask'd me how I did, I told her I had been very ill, And so have I too, says she, and after a little more Chat, she desir'd me to let her go to my necessary House, which I did, and she came back in about 2 Minutes, and staid talking with us about half a quarter of an Hour. On the 6 of September following, the Night Men came to empty the Vault, and found a Child, which they laid upon some Straw in the Yard, and said they must charge a Constable with it, before it was carried away. - It was a Male Child at its full Time, and I saw no bruises on it.</p>

             the Night-man thus depos'd. Mrs. Holiday's Vault and this are both in one at the bottom, and there is only an Arch that parts then at top. I had empty'd 6 Tun, and was about the 7th when as I sunk the Soil, I saw something pop out of Mrs. Holidays Vault, which at first I thought was a Dog, but when I brought it up in a Pail, I found it was a Child. I believe it had laid there 5 or 6 Weeks, though it appear'd very fair, but I could give a pretty good ghess, because I had been such things before.</p>

             the Midwife thus depos'd. The Child came at its full Time. I saw no hurt on it. It came into the World without the help of a Midwife, but whether born alive or dead, I cannot tell. I ask'd the Prisoner if she had ever had a Husband, she said no, I examin'd her Breasts, and made her draw her Milk, which I carry'd in my Hand to the Jury; Then I told her, that she had had a Child. She said no, but she had miscarried about 5 Weeks ago, when she was 4 Months gone, which I could not contradict, for she might have had Milk, if it had been 8 or 10 Weeks after such a Miscarriage. The Prisoners Confession was then read in which she owns; That being about 4 Months gone with Child, she fell down, in the Old Paved Alley in Pall-mall, and finding herself very much disorder'd with a violent pain in her Back, she went into Mr. Bowchers Vault, (which is not the Vault where the Child was found) and there while she sat on the Seat, the Child dropt from her Body, which was what she did not expect when she went thither.</p>

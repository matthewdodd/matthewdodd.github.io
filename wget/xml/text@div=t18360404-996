                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 150.) On the 9th of March I was in Wentworth-street, about ten minutes after eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner carrying a side of pork, in two cloths, on his shoulder—I crossed, and asked him what he had got—he paused some time, and I asked him again—he said he did not know—I took him to the station, and he told the inspector he picket it up in Whitechapel—the pork was quite clean, and it was a very wet night.</p>

                  </hi>. I deal in pork and poultry. I saw the side of pork which the officer took—it was my property—I had lost it from my cart at the door of the White Swan, in Whitechapel—I was going to take it to Mr. Taylor, in Jewin-street—I had business in the White Swan, and left my cart there for an hour, in the care of my boy—I went out several times to see that he was giving a sharp look-out, and I thought he was doing so—I did not see the prisoner there—I knew the side of pork by comparing it with the other, which I had in the cart—it was my own killing, and I know my own cut—these cloths are mine.</p>

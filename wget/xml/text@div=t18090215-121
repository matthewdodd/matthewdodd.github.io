On the 3rd of February, both the prisoners came into my house between eleven and twelve o'clock, and called for two or three glasses of rum; after they had drank and paid for what they had they both went out together; the pots were drying in the taproom by the fire; while they were there my servant found two of the pots missing; I followed the woman down to her lodging No. 2, Saffron hill; I asked her what become of the pots; I took her back to my house; the man prisoner came in to know what was the matter; I felt a pot on his side under his coat and another in his pocket; I laid hold of him, in the scuffle he got me down; I got up and knocked him down; I kept him till I sent for Wood the officer, he took the pots from him. The prisoners have lived together, they do not live in the house; I heard the woman say that she had lived with the man prisoner five or six years, he had used her very ill. The man prisoner offered me a seven shilling piece not to send for an officer, when I had him down.</p>

At half-past twelve o'clock at night, I returned with my master's horse and cart to his brewery at Lambeth—the prisoner followed me into the stable and asked me how I was—I told her I was very well, and to go about her business—I went to look for the ostler, but did not see him—I went back to the stable and the prisoner was gone—I sat down, being very tired, and went to sleep—there are two doors to the stable—I had shut the bottom one—some time after I awoke—I looked for my watch and it was gone—I then missed my money, a half-crown, thirty-four shillings, three sixpences, two groats, and 2%<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I ran out and met a constable—I asked if he had seen a person dressed as I described the prisoner to be—he said he bad, and he went alter her—she saw him and ran away—she drew this watch from her bosom—it is mine—I had been drinking, but was not drunk—I sleep w a bed opposite the brewery—I had not seen the prisoner in the stable after she asked me how I was.</p>

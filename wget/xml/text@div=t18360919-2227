The prisoner was his porter—I di<lb></lb>rected him, on Friday evening, the 12th of August, to get some corn for the horses—he was gone longer than he ought to have been—I went to an where he was, and found him behind the counter, where he had no rights as be—I missed a pair of half-fronts of boots—I charged him with it the next morning—h acknowledged he had them, and said he took them to a person to be made for his own feet—they have not been found.</p>

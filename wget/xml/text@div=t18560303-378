                  </hi>. I live at Rope-yard-rents, Woolwich, and am a labourer. I became acquainted with the prisoner when we were hopping; and on Friday, 25th Jan., about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I met her in Woolwich—she proposed to go and have some beer—we did so, and, after I <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> the beer, she asked me if I had any more money—I said that I had fourpence more—I turned it out, and said that I had got no more money—we had some gin with the fourpence, and I then lit my pipe—I had my hand on the money in my pocket, took out my box, filled my pipe, and she was talking to the publican—I was not paying attention to her—she was on my right side, and I turned round and she was gone—I put my hand in my pocket, and missed all my money except two shillings—I have not seen my purse since; it contained seven sovereigns and four half crowns—one sovereign was of the reign of George the Fourth, with a dragon on it; two of George the Third, and four of Queen Victoria—I gave information to the police—when the prisoner was talking to the publican I saw her with half a sovereign and a shilling or two.</p>

On Sunday morning, 27th Jan., between 8 and 9 o'clock, I met the prisoner in Woolwich, and took her into custody—I asked her what money she had got about her, and if she had got a purse—she said that she had got a purse and a two shilling piece—I asked her if she had any more—she said, "None whatever"—I touched her dress in front, and said, "You have some more there; just let me know what it is"—I took her into the station at the dockyard, and she took out some coppers and a half crown—I received from Sergeant Monahan, four Victoria sovereigns, two George the Fourth's, and one of George the Third's—I asked the prisoner if she had any more money—she said "No"—she was apprehended on another charge.</p>

I am the wife of William Burridge, a police constable, of Erith—on Sunday, 27th Jan., I searched the prisoner at the Woolwich police station, and found on her seven sovereigns and a half crown—she said that she had just told the sergeant in the office a story, that she had no money, and asked if she would be punished for it.</p>

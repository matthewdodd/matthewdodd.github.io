               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I only know him by making and mending my shoes. On the 26th of February, I went to my sister at Fulham; she asked me to bring a parcel for her; a tea caddie, a counterpane, a piece of linen cloth, and a silver watch, the watch I locked up in the cadie, and all which I left at the prisoner's room till I called for them; it was Sunday half past two o'clock in the afternoon I took them to his house, as I could not get into my master's premises, nor did I like to carry them about on a Sunday. On the 6th of March his wife came to me, said they had quarrelled and separated, and that the things were left at the landlord's house; he had a room there, No. 8, Silver street, Clerkenwell; and when I called they were locked up in the prisoner's room, the prisoner had the key; this was on Wednesday, the 8th; on the following morning, the landlord came down to me with the constable to inform me they had broken open the room, and they found the things had been taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your property - A. Yes; they were at the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the things from the 26th of February, till the 8th of March - A. I knew the prisoner very well; they were left there for my sister; he had always behaved very well, I do not want to hurt him.</p>

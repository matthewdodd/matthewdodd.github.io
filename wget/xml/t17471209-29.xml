               <p>Akins. It was advertis'd, when I came to Mr. Rogerson I ask'd him what sort of a man it was that robb'd him, and he said it was a man in a seafaring dress, and had on a checkt shirt; the person that brought the watch answer'd to the description given by Mr. Rogerson.

               <p>Prisoner.

            . I am waiter at the Coach and Horses. On Saturday morning, the 3d of October, I saw the prisoner, with half a dozen others, the prosecutor got outside the door, a girl accosted him, and kept dancing round him, when six or seven pickpockets surrounded him - one of them

             the watch out of his pocket, the prisoner ran and received it from him, and then ran away with it. I went for an officer, and described him to the officer; in the meantime he came up in a different dress. I laid hold of him, and gave him to the officer. I saw the watch taken from his right hand pocket. He resisted being searched.</p>

            . I am headborough of Whitechapel. Burrell described the man to me; the prisoner came in at the door, I thought he answered the description, and said</p>
               <p>"Look at this man;" he came out, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." I secured him, and said I must search you, for this man has been robbed of his watch. He resisted terribly. After a great deal of resistance I searched him, and found the watch in his right-hand breeches-pocket.</p>

               <p>"Hold this a few minutes, for I am going to fight." I left the house to get shaved, when I returned the officer asked the potboy if I was the man? he said, Yes. He asked me if had a watch? I said I have, but it is not mine, I have come back to give it to the man who gave it to me. I pulled it out, and he took it. I did not resist.</p>

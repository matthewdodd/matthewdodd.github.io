On 23d March I was watching Parry and Harris—I saw them leave Mr. Brading's public-house in Eagle-wharf-road, Hoxton—they had a van and two horses—they drove to the prisoner's house, the Prince of Wales, Hyde-place, which is about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Brading's, and in an opposite direction to the prosecutor's—Parry got out of the van, and went into the house—he came out in a moment, and received a bottle from Harris from the van, and took it into the house—this is the bottle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is full of gin—I sent in a lad named Mansfield, who was with me, and followed in myself in about two minutes—Harris had also gone into the public-house then—when I got in I saw Parry talking to Capes, and Harris just behind him—Capes was in the bar, he could see the door through which the gin was taken; it was just in front of him—I asked Parry for the delivery-note and permit for the bottle that I had just seen him bring in—he said, "The landlord has it"—I then asked the prisoner for it, and told him I had seen a bottle brought into his house—he said he knew nothing of it, if there had been a bottle brought in X had better find it—Parry then went towards the passage at the end of the bar, where the bottle was standing, and attempted to take hold of it—I pre<lb></lb>vented him, and took the bottle back to the front of the bar, and said in the prisoner's hearing, that I knew they had no business to leave the bottle there—the prisoner said he knew nothing of it—I told him he had better go with me to the distillery, and explain the matter there—he went with me and Parry in a cab, and saw Mr. Beckwith—Mr. Beckwith's account of what passed is correct.</p>

I live at 58, Leman-street, Whitechapel, and am sixteen years old—about half-past 10 on the morning of 23d March, I was with Underwood—I saw a van driven up by Parry and Harris to Mr. Binding's, and afterwards saw them drive to the Prince of Wales—we followed them—Parry got out and went into the house, and returned in about a minute, and received a bottle from Harris, and then they both went in—I followed in, and Parry was just coming from the passage, Harris was standing in front of the bar, and the prisoner was behind the bar; he could see the door, Parry then came to the bar and spoke to the prisoner—I did not hour what was said—Underwood then came in.</p>

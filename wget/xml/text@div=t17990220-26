               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing in the course of the night? - A. Yes, I heard a garden-pot, that stood in the cellar-window, come down with a heavy found, about ten minutes after I had been in bed; I did not get up, I thought it had been my children above, I thought they had pushed the headboard out of the bed; I got up the next morning about eight o'clock, I then discovered that the door which comes out of the cellar into my room had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you fastened that door the night before? - A. With a bit of a slight bolt, and the staples were forced quite out. The first thing that I missed was my children's clothes, which they had worn before I put them to bed, some of them were up stairs, and some down upon a chair; my children slept in the two pair, and I in the one pair of stairs. The next thing that I missed was my victuals out of the cupboard, and the things mentioned in the indictment, as well as a great many others, Last Wednesday I was going down into Wapping, and happened to see a child belonging to the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200020"></xptr>soner, he lived about a quarter of mile from me; the child had on a coat, a waistcoat, and a pair of trowsers, belonging to a dress of my children's; the coat and waistcoat belonged to one child, and the trowsers to another.</p>

No; as I knew the child, I went down to see for the father, and met with him in the street; I stopped him, and asked him how he came by these trowsers; he said, he bought them at a Jew's; I asked him if he would go home to his own apartment, and I would speak to him there, and when I went in, I perceived some part of my property, two candlesticks upon a high shelf, and a rug upon a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner with you when you saw these things? - A. Yes; I asked him how he came by them, and he said, he bought a lot in Rosemary-lane; upon that I went home and sent for my husband; my husband came a-shore and went to the prisoner, but I did not go with him.</p>

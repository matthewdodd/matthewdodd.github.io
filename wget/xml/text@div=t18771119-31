                  </hi>. I keep the Bunch of Grapes, Bennett Street, Fitzroy Square—in October last I was about disposing of a public-house and I employed the defendant for that purpose as my broker—the intended purchaser paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit into his hands—the defendant told me he had received the deposit—I asked him to give me over the money and he refused—the matter went off and the deposit was forfeited to me—I ulti<lb></lb>mately brought an action against the defendant, which came on in January, 1877, before Mr. Justice Field—this is the judgment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—debt and costs 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I ultimately issued execution against him, and a judgment debtor summons was taken out by me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which came on for hearing before Mr. Justice Fry—the date I believe is the 21st September—the defendant applied on that day before Mr. Justice Fry, as also did I—I made this affidavit which was read in his hearing. (<hi rend="italic">Office copy produced and read, which set out the facts relating to the payment of the</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">deposit, and that judgment was recovered against the defendant on the</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">for the debt and coats</hi>.)

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The summons was heard at Judge's chambers—I have not said before to-day that the defendant swore the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid after the date of judgment—I left that out—I have no note of what took place—the defendant applied for an adjournment in order that he might produce his books as to dates—my solicitor refused the adjournment—he is here—the defendant was sworn after the adjournment was refused—I have since heard that he had a suit with his late partner, and that he paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 23, Great Marlborough Street, and am a clerk to Mr. Alsopp, solicitor—on the 21st September I attended before Mr. Justice Fry, on the hearing of the judgment summons which has been produced, when the affidavit of Mr. Silver was read—the defendant was sworn and admitted that the contents of the affidavit were accurate, but he could not say to a penny as to the amount—I asked him what he had done with the money in hand, about 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he had paid 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the Court of Chancery pursuant to an order in an action by his partner since the date of the judgment—upon that statement being made, Mr. Justice Fry said he could make no order and dismissed the summons—I saw the defendant sworn—I went to the Accountant-General's office in the Court of Chancery on the 16th October, and have searched the books from time to time, from the date of the judgment, and there is no entry of the payment of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by him—I served the defendant's clerk at his office with a written notice to produce his books, and I called for them before Mr. Justice Fry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before the Magistrate—I always give my evidence perfectly correctly when on oath—upon my asking for the books the defendant's solicitor asked for an adjournment for a week—if you take the context of the depositions you will find I said "I swear they did not offer me an adjournment for a week"—I say now they did offer me an adjournment for a week—I called for the books to be produced—they said the books were not there, and he said he would get them from Southampton Buildings, if it were adjourned for a week—I said "He only offered to produce the books if there were an adjournment for a week"—I refused the adjournment—it was not then that he said he could not tax his memory as to dates—I don't think anything was said about dates—the books were to prove the amounts—I swear that—there were no notes taken of the proceedings—I rely on my memory.</p>

                  </hi>. Hive at Yardley, near Birmingham—I attended with the defendant at Judge's chambers on the 21st September on his behalf for Mr. St. Aubyn, solicitor—Mr. Alsopp's clerk tendered Mr. Silver's affidavit—I am not certain whether Mr. Justice Fry read it or not—I read it to myself and referred to the defendant upon it—I remember now Mr. Justice Fry did read it, and then he said "What answer have you to make"—I told him we had no means of paying, and I tendered the defendant for examination—he was then cross-examined, and he was asked if he produced his books, and he said "No, I had no intention of attending the summons until I met Mr. Lawrence, who advised me to attend it myself, otherwise I was not going to do so; my solicitor was going to apply for an adjournment," or "had arranged an adjournment"—Mr. Justice Fry looked at the summons and said "Oh, your office is not far off, you can get the books in ten minutes"—upon that I volun<lb></lb>teered an adjournment for half an hour to produce the books, but before that conversation took place they proceeded to cross-examine or examine the defendant, and I said, to cut the matter short, "We admit having received the amounts mentioned in the affidavit, but we do not admit the dates specified"—Mr. Justice Fry then said to them "Do you wish the books produced, if so, take an adjournment for half an hour, but mind if you proceed with the case, and ask for an adjournment at the end. I shall refuse it"—they elected to proceed—the very words used were, "We will go on now"—I pointed out to Mr. Justice Fry the fact that certain sums were mentioned in the affidavit as having been received—we admitted these sums, and were perfectly willing to show how they were disposed of, but the dates they said we received them were not correct, and that had arisen in this way; upon the signing of the contract for sale of the public-house a certain deposit was placed in the defendant's hands, and he anti<lb></lb>cipated his commission, and therefore on certain days, sworn to in the affidavit, there was little or nothing to receive—then they proceeded to examine him as to how he disposed of this money—first of all he said he paid his late partner 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle a Chancery suit, either in the Rolls or the Exchequer, I don't know which—he went on to say he had paid his office rent, and the rent of his private house—he did not say he had paid 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a Chancery suit to his partner since the date of the judgment—he said he had paid 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the money which they said he had received to settle a Chancery suit brought against him by his late partner, Fletcher White—Mr. Justice Fry then said "Did you pay the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before or since the date of the judgment?"—the reply was "I am not sure, I believe I paid some before and some since, but if I produce my books I can show you"—he said it was paid in several sums—upon that Mr. Justice Fry posted up on the corner of his blotting paper the sums he had paid, and said "You have not proved to me that this man has means"—at the end they asked for an adjournment—this receipt of the</p>

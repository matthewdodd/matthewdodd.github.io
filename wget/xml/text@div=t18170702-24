               <p>JAMES HUDSON. On the 14th of June, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock at night, I was going up <placeName id="t18170702-24-crimeloc130">Crooked-lane</placeName>

I looked at him, and he pushed me one side; I turned round to pursue after him, when some person caught hold of my collar - I got loose and ran after the prisoner, gave the alarm, and followed him to the end of Crooked-lane, but lost him in the crowd; I got into Fish-street - hill, and saw him in Monument-yard - He was secured in Pudding-lane. I am sure he is the man. I felt my watch go from me - I did not see anybody with him until I turned round and was collared.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Bailey, Pudding-lane. I heard the cry of stop thief, and opened the door-the prisoner passed and reeled down by Mr. Williams's step, he went to set down and then another man collared him; in about three minutes I heard a watch was stolen, I went out and saw a man find the watch on Mr. William's step, close by the door where the prisoner was found.</p>
               <p>ANN OATES. I am servant to Mr. Williams, Pudding-lane. I heard the cry and went to the window, a man came up to our door and found the watch on the step-four or five of them went up the lane with it.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Lamb gave me information on the 26th of August, and described the person of the girl to me; he said he had been robbed of seven sovereigns, about nine o'clock the evening before - that the girl was a little pock-marked, and fresh coloured on the cheek-bone - the prisoner has been out of the way some weeks; I took several girls up before this, but he said they were not the persons; when I took this girl, she was in a place with twelve or thirteen men and women, and he identified her immediately.</p>

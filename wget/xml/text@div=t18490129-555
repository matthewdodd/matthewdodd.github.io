                  </hi>. I live at Round Copse, near Uxbridge. On 5th Sept. I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>; in consequence of which I went to Dawson's Stables, Crown-street Westminster, on the 7th, and asked to see the horse referred to in the advertisement—Perkins was there, he showed me two horses—I treated for the bay one—it was a showy-looking horse—I said I was going to Collins, a dealer in the Kent-road, to see a horse, but looked in there on the way, and I would call in on my return—I afterwards returned, saw Perkins, and said I did not think the horse would quite match the one I wanted him to go with—he said, "You have not seen him enough," and pullrd the cloths off—he asked 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but said he thought Mr. Burrows would take less—I asked who Burrows was—he said he was in the wool business in the City, and lived in Fludyer-street, Westminster—I went and saw Burrows—he said he was in the wool business, and had got the horse to sell for his brother who was abroad, and he said he had had another and a carriage with it, which he had sold, but he did not like selling horses—I asked if the horse was sound and quiet in harness—he said, yes, anybody that understood driving he would go very well with, and he was perfectly sound—I asked what he wanted, and he said he had refused 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him a little while ago, but he would take thirty-five guineas—I said, "Won't you take pounds?"—he said he would not take less; that I might have him on trial seven days, and if I did not like him, by forfeiting a guinea, he would take him back—I asked, if I did not approve of him, if he would let his man come down and take him back, in case any accident should happen—he said, "Certainly"—I asked him to lend me a saddle and bridle, and I would ride him down—he said,</p>

               <p>"Oh no, you had much better not do that; "that he would tend him down properly with his cloths and kneecaps on by nine o'clock next morning—I agreed, and wrote a check for the money—he said, "We had better have an agreement"—I wrote one, he signed it, and I gave him this check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then said, "But if I am not to have the hone, I had better keep my check"—he said, "You may depend on my sending him down quite safe;"—I took his word—Perkins brought the horse home about half-past eleven next morning—he was not fit to ride; one of his shoes was only hanging by one nail, I had to send him to the farrier's—Perkins told me that Burrows said, if the horse did not suit me, he was to come and fetch him back—he left directly, before the horse came back—next morning I tried him—I had not been on him half a minute before he made a tremendous noise, and in less than a minute I found he was a tremendous roarer—I went up to Fludyer-street the same day—I could not find Burrows, but left a message that I would be there on Monday—his wife said he would be sure to be at home—I went, but did not find him—on Tuesday, Perkins came down and took the horse back, he said Burrows had appointed ten o'clock on Wednesday to meet me, and he would be sure to be there—he looked at the horse, and said he was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. better than before, and as fresh as a lark—I went on Wednesday and found this letter, and should say from the memorandum which Burrows signed that it is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">this letter was signed 'J.P. Burrows,' stating that he was sorry he could not keep his appointment, but that he would come down to Mr. Thompson next Monday</hi>)—I went to my attorney—I afterwards received this letter from Burrows—(<hi rend="italic">this letter requested Mr. Thompson to call on Burrows on Monday, between eleven and twelve</hi>)—I sent my attorney to him—I have never teen horse, check, or money since.</p>

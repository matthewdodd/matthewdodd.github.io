                  </hi>. On the 19th of September I came from Brighton—I had my handkerchief in my breast-pocket, and on opening my coat it fell out, and I put it into my great coat pocket, at Charing-cross—I called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went to Suffolk-place East, and missed it there—it must have been taken while I was getting into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody, at Charing-cross, on the 19th of September, about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon, and in his coat pocket I found the handker<lb></lb>chief, which I produce—I asked him where he got it—he said it was his own, and he had had it in his possession for the last two months—he was standing by the Worthing coach—two gentlemen gave me information, that made me search him.</p>

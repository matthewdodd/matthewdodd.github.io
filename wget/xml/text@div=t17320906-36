I told the Boy that I would not go, except the Man who came for me would stay, and go with me. When I came down Stairs, I found the tall Man waiting, and went with him; but we had not gone far before I was attack'd by 2 Men in Masks, one was a little Man, and the other middlesiz'd. I look'd for my tall Friend to assist me, but he join'd with the other Rogues; one of the two clapp'd a Pistol to my Breast, and demanded my Money; they robb'd me of 6 s. 6 d. my Cane, and my Coat, and then bid me go forward towards Mother Red-Caps. I believe the Prisoner Bumpus is the tall Man who came for me. He's like him, but I will not be positive.</p>

            . On the 4th of May last, the 2 Prisoners and I met at Mr. Blackwell's, the Cakeman, in Purple-Lane, by Hatton-Garden, and we agreed to go and rob upon Enfield Road. We went to Stoke-Newington, and sent Bumpus to Mr. Haycocks, the Apothecary's, to tell him that the Man at Mother Red-Caps was taken with an Apoplectick Fit, and wanted him presentl. Bumpus came and told us (for we wanted hard by) that the Man would not come except he staid to come with her. We bid him go back and wait, which he did, and brought the Prosecutor with him; Shelton demanded the Prosecutor's Coat and Money. I afterwards heard that Shelton was taken up at Maidstone, and so to ease my Conscience, and for fear of being hang'd, if he should swear against me, I made my self a voluntary Evidence, as soon as I had an opportunity of taking Bumpus, which was on the 29th of July last. I met him accidentally in Newgate-Street, and asking him to go and drink with me; I took him to the Sun Coffee-House, under Sir William Billers's Office. I left him there, and finding Mr. Taylor the Constable, at Sir William's Door, I surrender'd my self, and went with him before Sir William, and gave my Information, and then we went and took Bumpus in the Coffee-House.</p>

               <p>Shelton. I am sorry to hear that Gentleman gave me such a Character, I did not expect it from him above all Men, for he knows nothing of me, but by common Fame.</p>

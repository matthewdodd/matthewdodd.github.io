            , Esq., the barrister. On the 4th of November my master went to a party in Harley-street, and about a quarter to twelve o'clock I was directed to procure him a coach; I went to Mary-le-bone-street - there was none on that stand; I was going to Paddington-street, and at the corner of <placeName id="t18250113-1-crimeloc3">Little Chesterfield-street</placeName>

I endeavoured to get away - she told me not to be in a hurry: she pulled me along the passage, and I fell upon my head down the kitchen stairs - she was pulling me up, and at the same time tried my breeches pocket; she pushed me into the kitchen, and bolted the door, and then asked if I was going with her - I said I would not; she demanded 1 s. 6 d., and in order to get away to fetch the coach I gave it to her - she then demanded 2 s. 6 d.; I said if she would return the 1 s. 6 d. I would give her half-a-crown - she did so, and I said as she was so imposing I would not give her any thing. I endeavoured to get out: she called to Larkin, and unbolted the door to let her in. When Larkin came in she put the light out; the door was bolted again. I struck several blows at them, and got to the door, and pulled it open, and was rushing up stairs - my head then came in contact with something; Larkin then came and caught hold of my coat - I got from her, and got up; she followed, and caught me round the waist, and put her face to mine; I shoved her back; she caught me by the cravat, and took out my gold pin. I got to the door; she endeavoured to catch hold of me again - I pushed her into the street, called watch, and she was secured; she denied having my pin, but produced it at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far did you walk with her before you got to the house? A. She ran after me, and took hold of my arm about six yards from the door. I was sober. I could see no watchman. I had my hands in my pockets, or I could have got from her, if I had been aware of it. She said she would let me out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Larkin say she had a pin, and if you described it you should have it? - A. No; she denied having it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty, and took Larkin to the watch-house. When the watch-house keeper was writing the charge she produced this pin, and asked the prosecutor if it was his - he said it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she say,</p>
               <p>"I have found a pin on the ground, and if it is your's, here it is?" A. Not that I heard, but I did not particularly notice what passed. As we went to the watch-house she asked if he got his pin would he make it up - he insisted upon her going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Lloyd put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had accosted her, and accompanied her to Larkin's room, where they remained half an hour, when he gave her 1 s. 6 d., having promised her half-a-crown - that he took the 1 s. 6 d. from her in consequence of her complaining to him; words followed, and Larkin came in and turned him out. Larkin's Defence was to the same effect, and stated that she had found the pin on the floor of the room, and he must have dropped it in the scuffle with Lloyd.</p>
               <p>DANIEL ALLEN re-examined. Larkin caught me by the cravat, and took out the pin, I am certain - and when I got to the street door she denied having it.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you ever say to any one that you might have dropped the pin? A. I never did, nor any thing to that effect. I saw Peter Hill at the office; he offered me 10 s. to say I had lost the pin when I was in the yard of the police office; I said I would have nothing to say to him - that is all that passed between us.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Lawrence-street, Bloomsbury. I was at the office when this man made his charge - I cannot say whether it was taken down in writing or not. I heard the Magistrate order the prisoners to find bail for an assault. I had a long conversation with the prosecutor at the office; he said he did not know, but he might have dropped the pin, and that he should not have appeared against the prisoners, but from his master's compulsion.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130004"></xptr>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you? A. I live on some little property, left me by my father, who died last Michaelmas twelvemonth. I have known Larkin from her infancy; I met her sister, who told me she was ill custody. I never offered the prosecutor 10 s. to say he had dropped the pin, I swear that. I offered him no money.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had you to talk with him? A. I wished to know what she was charged with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the Magistrate when the prosecutor gave his evidence,</p>
               <p>"Why, this man has just told me that he might have dropped the pin?" A. No, I have no recollection of saying so. I am sure they were ordered to find bail, for I attended with bail in the evening. The Magistrate approved of them, but a whispering took place between the officer and Magistrate, and he then required time to enquire.</p>
               <p>DANIEL ALLEN. (Looking at the depositions taken before the Magistrate,) these are the examinations; I signed them that morning - there was only one examination.</p>
               <p>PETER HILL re-examined. Q. Did you hear what Allen stated to the Magistrate? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say,</p>
               <p>"When I got into the passage Larkin held me round the waist, and then I felt my shirt pin wrenched from my breast?" A. I cannot recollect the particular words - he made a charge of taking a pin. I did not tender myself as a witness. I lived in Chesterfield-street last Session, in the same house in which the robbery happened, but at the time of the robbery I lived in New Tuthill-street; I moved to Chesterfield-street on the day after the robbery, as their lodging was vacant; I had lived there three or four weeks before, for about two months. I moved to Lawrence-street three days ago. I have done no work since this property was left me - I may have changed my lodgings ten times since I received my legacy. I was not within two miles of Chesterfield-street on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor's deposition being read was precisely to the same effect as his evidence in Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor was with two or three prostitutes—he hailed me, and told me to take him to a gin-shop—I took him to Langham's, in Bridge-street—he went in there, and had half-a-pint of gin,</p>

               <p>and gave some, which he could not drink, to the company—he then got in again, he told me to drive over the bridge, and said, "If you can see two nice girls, stop, and I will invite them into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi>" and about half-past one o'clock in the morning, he called two girls into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went to a night-house—he got out and drank again—he invited the girls into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, but they would not come—he said he had friends in Thames-street, and I drove him over there—I asked him to pay me—he refused, and I said I must drive him to the watch-house, which I did, and he said he had been robbed—I declare the money found in my pos<lb></lb>session was my own hard earnings.</p>

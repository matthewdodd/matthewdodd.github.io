                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Thomas Steel, who is a tailor, in Gray's Inn-lane. On the afternoon of the 3rd of January, I saw the prisoner and another—they passed the shop, returned, looked in, and then came in—the prisoner asked me the price of a fustian coat—I went to the parlour to ask my brother the price, and returned directly—the other</p>

               <p>person was then gone, but the prisoner remained; and directly I went into the shop, he went out—he closed the door almost, but I put my arm between, and he closed it on my arm, which prevented my fol<lb></lb>lowing him for a moment—he had bought nothing, and had not waited; for my answer about the price of the coat—my brother went after him directly, and he was brought back in a few minutes—we missed a coat from off some drawers in front of the shop—the shop-door was left open while the prisoner was there—his companion could go out without having to open it.</p>

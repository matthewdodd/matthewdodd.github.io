I missed it about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock, when I went to bed. The prisoner had come to the house about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and stopped till half-past twelve o'clock. He did not come afterwards I believe. I have recovered some of the notes. On the Saturday following I went to a public-house in Essex-street, where he lodged, and saw him sitting in the parlour, talking to some friends. I shut the parlour door, called Edwards and Baker; I turned round and saw him run from the parlour towards the cellar. The officers came in.</p>

            . I live at the Crown, public-house, Essex-street. The prisoner lodged about eight weeks at my father's house. On Saturday the 30th October, the officers came; the prisoner was in the parlour. I saw him run from the parlour across the yard to the cellar, to the place where the notes were afterwards found; he was not there more than a minute, and returned shortly; the officers came in in two minutes and took him. The property was found on the Monday following. I saw them come in with a light, and go down to where the prisoner had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the yard enclosed where the cellar is? - A. It is, and belongs to my father's premises only; persons could not get to it without going through our house.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 30th of October, I went with the prosecutor and Edwards to the Crown, public-house, and met the prisoner coming out of the yard, took hold of him, and said I wanted him for Mr. Gasson's felony; he seemed agitated. I got a light and went down to the privy. On the Monday I went there again, took a light, and in the cellar, by the right-hand side of the water-closet, on a beam, I found a bundle of Bank notes, which I produce. I showed them to the prosecutor, and he claimed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Kerslake at the place - A. Yes; she stated where he ran down. The yard is enclosed, and only belongs to that house.</p>

             re-examined. The notes are mine. Here is a 5 l. note which I took of a gentleman's servant that morning. They all have my name on them, and were in the pocket-book when it was stolen; it contained about 57 l., here is 27 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. At the examination you said you lost them between eleven and twelve o'clock, and then said you did not miss them till between five and six o'clock in the evening - A. No; I said I missed them about twelve o'clock at night, but must have lost them about one, as I had then locked the till, and it was not unlocked till I went to bed. I concluded it must have been taken before I locked the till.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it. I was in the habit of going to his house; I was there on the Sunday; almost as soon as I came in his wife gave me the baby to mind. I nursed it till about one o'clock, then went home to dinner, and did not go there again. I was there on Monday morning; I was ill in my bowels, and had a glass of white wine. I was there on the Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Friday I was ill, and kept at home. On Saturday I was taken as I was going to the vault. There are thirteen lodgers in the house who have access to it.</p>

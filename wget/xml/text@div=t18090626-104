               <p>Q. Is your son a soldier in one of his Majesty's regiments - A. Yes; in the West Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at any time at home and absent from his regiment - A. Yes; he deserted from his regiment; he was at home with me in last December.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all desirous that he should be released from being a soldier - A. No; otherwise than this man said he could do something for him. I never saw him before he called upon me on the 1st of December; my son was in prison for desertion, and the defendant found me out, he told me he had heard that I had a son in trouble, and that if I would give him a little money he would stop my son from going back to his regiment; he told me thirty shillings would be as much as he should want; at that time I gave him one pound note, I told him I had no more change then; I believe he said he would call on the next day for the remainder. When he went away I said sir, I hope you will not deceive me, as you are a stranger; no, he said, he would not; he called again on the next day at an earlier hour than he did the day before, he told me he was short of money, he should be glad of the other ten shillings; I told him I hoped he had done something that would be of use to the lad; he said, oh, yes, he had, and that Mr. Trott had got a detainer to lay against the lad; I advanced him the other ten shillings in silver; he said he could got my son discharged. I never saw him after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son go back to the regiment, notwithstanding all these promises of his - A. He was taken to the Savoy; Mr. Pringle did nothing for me, he was sent to the regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see this man next - A. I seeked after Mr. Trott, the officer of Hatton-garden; he said he knew nothing about it. Mr. Trott took him up by my description.</p>

On the 1st of December the prisoner came to Mrs. Miller's house, 24, Harp-alley; he said I hear you have a son in a little trouble, and for a little money I will hinder him from going back to his regiment; she asked how much money, he said thirty shillings; my mistress gave him a one pound note, and said she had no more change at present; and then she said, I hope you will not deceive me, as you are a stranger; he said no, he was well known by some creditable people. He came again on the 2nd, on the next day; and said I am come for the other ten shillings, he was rather short of money; my mistress said have you done any thing towards being of use to the lad, he said yes; that Mr. Trott of Hatton Garden had got a warrant or detainer, and at three o'clock the business will be settled; my mistress then gave him the other ten shillings; the prisoner came alone.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen, I was applied to by Mr. Brooks, who desired me to call upon Mr. Smith, a pauper in Newgate, to do some business; I called upon Smith, who introduced me to Miller, who was sentenced to go in the condemned regiment; he desired me to go to his mother, said she would not mind what money she paid. I said in that case we must get a copy of the commitment, and afterwards a copy of the conviction; humbly hoping that his Majesty would be pleased to let him go in the regular regiment instead of the condemned regiment. I went with a messenger who introduced me into his mother's company; she said how much money, I said about thirty shillings for the copy of his commitment and the certificate of his conviction, and the preparing the petition. She gave me one pound; I called the next day and received the ten shillings. I immediately applied at the clerks office for a certificate to prepare the petition; when I was informed that the prisoner Miller was to be sent to the Savoy. I called upon Miller, said to him, that I found his crime was worse than he represented; he having deserted from the condemned regiment; and as that was the case, I must decline having any thing more to do in the business; as the time would not permit the result of a petition; I would return the thirty shillings to his mother; notwithstanding the trouble I had been at. A few days afterwards I sprained my ancle; was confined in my room, and attended by a surgeon.</p>

About 5 weeks ago, I missed 8 guineas out of my bureau in my chamber, and the linen mentioned out of a great chest; I always had the key of the room in my pocket. I told the prisoner of it; she said, how could I suspect her, when I always had the key. I said the money and things were gone, and no body goes there but she and I. After breakfast she came running up to me (this was about the 12th of March) she went down on her knees, and said, Madam, if you'll promise to forgive me, I'll confess; saying, I stole the linen, and sold it to a Jew. I said, Have you any body concerned with you? She said, Yes, madam; I'll tell you, if you'll promise not to hurt them. Then she said she burnt my bank-note I lost some time ago. I said, What made you burn it? She answered, the d - l appeared to her over her shoulder. She confessed to the taking all my things mentioned in the indictment, but owned to taking but 50 guineas; and that she opened my bureau with false keys, and had thrown the keys down under some lighters, at the end of the street. I asked her why she did so; she said the d - l appeared to her; she said she would send for the man where she bought the keys; he was sent for: she said the same before him: I never found none of my things again.</p>

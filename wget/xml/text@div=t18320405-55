The prisoner called on me on Saturday, the 18th of February, about five o'clock, to hire my truck for a job, and the truck was never returned; he called about eight o'clock, and asked if the truck was come home - I said No; he said, "I sent it by a boy from the top of Queen-street, and it is very strange it has not come;" I let out my truck by the hour, but there was no bargain made - the prisoner knew what he was to have it for, as he had had it it before for his master, but he said this was for a job of his own; he came to my house a second time, and asked if it was come - I said No; he seemed quite astonished, and asked what was the value of it - I said about 4l., and he said, "I suppose I must pay for it;" I found it in Milbank-street, Westminster.</p>

            . I am a slater. I met the prisoner on the 18th, about eleven o'clock; he asked me if I knew any body who wanted to buy a truck - I said I did not; he said he had one to sell very cheap, and asked if I could recommend him to any one; I had known him for some time - he asked where I lived, and I gave him my card at No. 22, Milbank-street; he asked what time I should be at home - I said about six o'clock; he said he gave 50s. for the truck, that his wife had run away with some money, and he wanted 1l. to go after her - he came to me in the evening; I let him have 2s., and told him to go over the way and get some beer - he left the trunk with me that night, and the next morning I saw the prosecutor's name on it, and went to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he owed Banfield 2s., and he had taken the truck from the public-house door, in payment, without his consent.</p>

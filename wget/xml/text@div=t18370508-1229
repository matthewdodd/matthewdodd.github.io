                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Rolfe, a linen-draper, in Brighton-place, Hackney-road. On the afternoon of the 24th of April the prisoner came into the shop in company with two other women—<hi rend="smallCaps">SHE ASKED</hi> to look at some print dresses, which my husband showed her—was in the parlour, and had a view of the shop—in consequence of what I observed I came into the shop—the prisoner said she would have a dress, and pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it, and leave it till the following Wednesday—the others bought some calico, and all three left the shop—I spoke to my husband, and he brought them back, and said to the prisoner, "I think you have something that does not belong to you"—she denied it—he said, "I think you have a print dress"—I took her into the parlour to search her, and she dropped the dress on the floor—a policeman was sent for, and she was taken into custody—I gave him the dress—it has our shop mark on it.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Southgate: I looked after the Woolpack public-house for a man in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any cattle coming to that house at any time? - A. Yes, four or five, about the latter end of July, as near as I can judge; there were two cows, I did not particularly notice them, but there was a fat beast.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was the person that brought them to your house? - A. I do not know his name; I never saw him but once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he the person that brought them there? - A. No, the man seemed to be a drover; and he wanted the cows to be in the yard a little while, while he went round to the gentlemen's houses to see if he could sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it? - A.Between ten and eleven in the morning; he was gone an hour and a half, or two hours, and then came back with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is the prisoner's house from your house? - A.About two miles and a half; they went into the yard and looked at the two cows that were in the yard, and Reynolds asked him the price, and he asked him twenty-two guineas for them, and he bid him twenty pounds, he would not let him have them; he then dropped to one-and-twenty, and the man persuaded me to get him to have them, because they were a good bargain; I told him, then he must drop half-a-guinea lower; at last they agreed for twenty-one-guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him pay for them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen these cows since? - A. Yes; they went away together, and drove them towards Edmonton; the drover said he had got more cattle on the road that he wanted to meet; I saw these cows yesterday morning at Bedfont.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they the same cows that the prisoner agreed with the drover for? - A. Yes, they are she same.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any knowledge of the value of cattle, to say whether it was a fair price? - A. No, I am no judge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You did not see the money paid? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you may know that, in point of fact, no money ever was paid? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that this was a counterfeit sale? - A. I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard any thing to cause you to believe that all that bargain was counterfeit? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear any thing said to that effect? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard any thing about it, whether it was counterfeit or real? - A. I never heard any talk about it, I think it was real, in my judgment, because I always believed him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw these cows yesterday morning? - A. At Bedfont, a boy was driving them to the common.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour was it you saw them? - A. About ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken for the express purpose of seeing if they were the same cows that you had seen at your house? - A. Yes; I went down on purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What were the marks of these cows? - A. One was a red and white pole cow, the other yellow.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A.About three quarters of a year; I live two miles and a half from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A cordwainer.</p>
               <p>Q.What is he? - A. I do not know; only he used to sell milk, and go to day-labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him rent any quantity of land? - A. No; I never knew of any land that he had.</p>

                  </hi>I am in the employ of the poet-office at Brompton—the prisoner was also employed there. On the 19th of May last in the morning I was on duty at the branch office at Chelsea—the prisoner was there sorting letters, separating them to different divisions—he is a carrier to one of the divisions as well as a sorter—his division is Chelsea—some<lb></lb>thing struck me while he was sorting his letters, in consequence of which I watched him and observed him take a letter from a bundle which was before him, and put it into the left-hand breastpocket of his coat—I mentioned it to the charge-taker, Mr. Vorley—I went out into the street—the prisoner came to the door—I beckoned him, and asked him if he bad not got a letter that did not belong to him—he said he had not—I asked him a second time, and he then said he had not—I then asked him to let me look in his breast coat pocket—upon this he pulled out come letters himself, amongst them was one which did not belong to his walk—it was directed to "Mrs. Sha<lb></lb>lor, 45, Arthur-street, Chelsea"—I told him he had no business with it, and it did not belong to him—I felt money in it.</p>

                  </hi>I am charge-taker of the Chelsea division of the Post-office. On the 19th of May I received a communication from Blackall, and I observed the prisoner to leave the office shortly after—I then went out, and saw him in the street—I believe he had just left Blackall—I said, "Reed, I think yon have a letter in your possession which don't belong to you"—he said he had not—I said he bad, and he had better give it up to me, and he took the letter out of his breast-pocket—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I only saw this one—I looked at the direction, and also at the hour stamped on it—I said, "Reed, how could you think of taking a letter that did not belong to you? "—he said if I would not report him he would not do it again—I wrote to the Post-office, and he was taken that day, but not at that time—my impression was, that I could not act in this case without instructions—this letter was not within his delivery—it might have come into his possession in sorting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Is it your business to superintend the sorting? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I take account of all the letters that come down to the Chelsea division—this letter ought to have been given up to me, to transfer it to the Brompton delivery, to which it belongs—it was a mis-sorted letter, but being directed "Chelsea, " it came down in the Chelsea bag—it ought to have gone in the Brompton delivery, being No. 45, Arthur-street, and ought to have come in the Brompton bag—two bags come down by the morning dispatch, the Brompton carriers take the Brompton, and the Chelsea carriers the Chelsea letters—there are seven carriers in the Bromp<lb></lb>ton delivery, and six in the Chelsea—the prisoner was given into custody about two o'clock, when he returned to the office—he had been round, and made his morning's delivery.</p>

Yes—the bags containing the Chelsea letters, and the Brompton letters come at the same time—they are placed for the different sorters to sort—the prisoner is a Chelsea sorter—part of Arthur-street is in the Brompton delivery and part in Chelsea—a letter for No. 45, Arthur-street, ought to be sent in</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>She gave you directions, Mrs. Barrington did, where to send it? - She gave me that direction to Portsmouth-street; I made no enquiries where she lived, but I took down the Turk's Head, Portsmouth-street; I know Lincoln's-inn-fields.</p>

               <p>Is there any shop mark on it? - Yes; Mr. Jeremy's; as soon as I picked it up, I put my own mark on it; I know it to be Mr. Jeremy's property: I saw Guard attempting to conceal something she appeared to take off the compter, she was close to the compter; I did not know immediately what it was, but I plainly saw that attempt to conceal something.</p>
               <p>How far was you from Guard? - About a yard and a quarter; Barrington never shewed me any money, I did not take the direction down till I saw the attempt to take something; I did not like Guard's appearance, I don't say I saw her take any thing from the compter, I saw the muslin under her arm; they were all together, Lloyd was nearest the door, I suppose there were six or seven people in the shop besides, but none at my compter; this is the same muslin that dropt between Barrington and Guard, I was nearest them at the time, and no other persons, I am sure it is the very same parcel Guard endeavoured to give Barrington, I kept my eyes upon them pretty clear; I have sold such kind of muslin before with such marks, I did not see her take it, I suppose Lloyd was a yard and a half off, she was near the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You told me you perceived Guard concealing something under her cloak, I plainly saw that, are those your words? - Yes; I did.</p>

               <p>Court. The manner in which this indictment is framed, makes it a capital offence against the prisoners; the circumstance of stealing privately in the shop, if above the value of 5 s. is a capital offence, and will affect their lives, if you are satisfied of the evidence; all three are charged with having committed this felony; it is not possible that every one of them should be the actual hand that took it, that is not necessary in point of law; if you are clearly satisfied of the circumstances of the case, they came all of them together for the purpose of stealing any thing from his shop, and that one was privy to the intention of the other, in that case, if they were privy to that intention, and present at the time, it is equally a felony in all, the same as if they were the very hand that took it; and said it was laid down by the judges as law, if any person saw them take it, it is then not privately stealing, and ceases to be a capital offence.</p>

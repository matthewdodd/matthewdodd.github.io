                  </hi> I am a sculptor, residing in Hampstead Road—on the evening of the 26th October I was coming down the Tottenham Court Road at about ten o'clock, and when I arrived at Messrs. Maple's establish<lb></lb>ment a man came and struck me a blow in the throat, and another snatched my watch—I followed prisoner to Tottenham Place, when I lost sight of, him at the corner—he went round into the Euston Road—I still pursued him, and only caught sight of him for a moment—I raised a cry—I have no doubt prisoner is the man who took my watch—it is worth 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

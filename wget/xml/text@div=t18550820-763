                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Preddy, a hatter, in Bridge-street On the afternoon of 28th July, the prisoner came and asked me to oblige him with change for half a crown—he was without a coat, and his shirt sleeves were tucked up; he gave me half a crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I noticed the half crown, and perceived it was counterfeit—I said, "This will not do, it is counterfeit;" and held out my hand for the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I placed myself between him and the door to stop his egress—I asked him where he came from; he said, "Just by"—I repeated the question, and finding he would not give me a direct answer, I sent for a policeman—the pri<lb></lb>soner made a rush past and attempted to escape—I seized him, and we struggled and fell over a chair, which was broken—the policeman came, and I gave him into custody—I marked the half crown and gave it to the officer.</p>

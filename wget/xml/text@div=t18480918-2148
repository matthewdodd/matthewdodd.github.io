                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Christopher Paul, of New-stree, in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney—it is his dwelling-house. Last Thursday three weeks he left his watch on the kitchen mantel-piece—I saw it safe there at eleven o'clock—Papps, who lodged in the house, came into the kitchen about one—he went out, and I missed the watch in about a quarter of an hour—it is jewelled in ten holes, and worth ten guineas—I afterwards found Papps nt the Cricket-ground at Bow, and gave him in charge—on the Saturday Haswell came, and asked me to give him Papps' shirt—I asked who told him Papps was in prison—he said a tall man—I told him to come for the shirt in the evening—he came, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I saw Unwell at Mile-end-road—he said he was about to emigrate to Sidney—I asked why—he said he wished to leave the country through fear about a watch which had been stolen, but he was innocent of stealing it—I asked why he was afraid—he said, "To tell you the truth I received it, and soldi'. to a Jew in Petticoat-lane for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" that he had got 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at home In his box, and had bough: those clothes with the remainder—I went with him to Clerkenwell prison, left him outside, and gave information.</p>

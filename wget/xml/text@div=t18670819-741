                  </hi> I am a commission agent, of 9, Edward Street, Caledonian Road—on 20th July, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in Euston Road—I had been drinking, but knew what I was about—two gentlemen took me down the road, as I was unable to walk, from a pain in my side, and was obliged to sit down—the prisoner and some other men came and hustled me—I got to my own door and was endeavouring to get ray latch key out, when I was pushed down, and the prisoner took my watch—I said, "You vagabond, you have robbed me"—some one behind struck me a blow which laid me flat on the pavement, and they all ran away—I informed the police and the prisoner was taken—I am sure he is the man.</p>

Q.</hi> will you swear I took your watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you were on my left side, and I caught hold of your hand—two men were not hold<lb></lb>ing me up against a shutter—I was as able to go along then as I am now—I have known the prisoner ten years—he is a shoeblack—I have employed him—he joined me at the corner of the Caledonian Road—the others were boys of the same class, and I think I can identify one of them—the two men who were helping me conveyed me to my own door, and said, "He is safe now"—I said, "Yes; all right, I live here; good night, thank you"—I felt my watch at the corner of Caledonian Street—I do not know the two men that took me home.</p>

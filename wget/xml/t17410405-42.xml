I had nothing in my Pocket, my Bags were on my left Shoulder, and had in them brown Hairs, pale Hairs, ash-coloured Hairs, grey brown Hairs and grizzled Hairs, to the Value of about 8 l. as near as I can guess. The Prisoner followed me down the Lane, and in a Minute's Time I was down, and my Bags were taken from me. I can't give a true Account who put me down, I was not knocked down, I was shot down or pushed down, for I am sure I could not fall myself. The Hairs which I had fell down with me, and were taken away. Upon this I advertised them, but could get no Account of them till Mr. Boucher informed me that he had bought some of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your Bags fall from you?</p>
               <p>Bois. I felt somebody snatch my Bags away, and they went off as I felt; - I have a Guess, - a rough Guess how they went.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the Bags fall with you?</p>
               <p>Bois. To the best of my Thought they were taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was he not fuddled?</p>
               <p>Bois. Yes, I was in Liquor, but I had my Senses about me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw him till I was before the Justice, and then he swore I took the Bags off his Back.</p>
               <p>Bois. What I do I will answer, but I leave it to the whole World whether any Body else could take them, when no Body else was near me.</p>

            . I am house-keeper to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280063"></xptr> Burr. I went to bed at 10 o'clock. I was the last person up. I made the house all fast, and in the morning I got up at 6 o'clock, it was light. I opened the yard door, and I found the wash-house door open. I left it shut. The wash-house is in the yard; it is an inclosed yard, and when I went in I found the copper down, and taken away, I looked at the line; there was a sheet gone, and two table-cloths. They were all carried away.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get in - A. They got over two walls. The wash-house was not locked; I am sure it was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other part of the house broken open - A. No; the wash house door was not broken, - only opened.</p>

            . I am a labouring man. On the morning of the third of October, I was mowing for Mr. Francis, near Kentish Town Road. I heard the sound of chopping; I went to see what it was. I saw the prisoner chopping a copper; I saw one copper lay chopped up, and he was chopping the other. It might be about a quarter to seven. I looked round; I saw some linen lay in the ditch. I asked him, if that was his property; he said, yes. I told him he must go along with me. He dropped his axe, and run away from the property. I pursued him, and took him. He begged and prayed me to let him go. He said he had a wife and family. I secured him and the property.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READ. I produce the property. There was another copper stolen from the next door; the man will not come forward.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe that to be my copper, and my linen.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. About ten minutes before twelve o'clock, I was at the turnpick-gate, and saw the two prisoner come out of the toll-house - an officer asked me it it was all right; I said, yes - it was Eves' brother, and knowing him, I had no suspicion of him; he was very much in liquor, and could scarcely stand - I then went up my beat, returned, and saw the door open; I went and said to the prosecutor, "Charles, you will lose your shirt" - I saw the back door was open; he then looked and missed his property - we went to several places, and on coming back found the prisoners in custody; they were taken to the watch-house, and Eves threw this key, two or three little bits of paper, 2d. and a bad shilling on the table; he caught up the key again to put it into his pocket; the prosecutor said, "Put that down, it is mine."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Had the backdoor been fastened? A. I do not know; the front door was open eight or ten inches.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before eleven o'clock, and saw the two prisoners coming along the Commercial-road arm-in-arm and seriously talking together; I stood on one side to try to hear what they said - when they came up to me, they silenced their discourse, and crossed to another beat; I saw no more of them till about twelve o'clock, when I saw Gough on the foot-path at the end of the Cannon-street-road - I walked by him, returned, and said, "It is a cold night;" he said, "Yes; will you have a drop of gin?""No, thank you," said I - I then saw Eves on the other side, talking to some girl; Gough said, "I will take good care he shall not go with that girl;" and he went and spoke to him - Eves then left the girl, and they went on together; I followed them to a public-house door, they knocked, but the publican refused to draw any more liquor - I then went and said, I wished him to open the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090123"></xptr>door; we went in, and the prisoner asked what I would take - I said, "A small glass of rum;" and they had a pint of porter and some gin - Eves said to Gough, "You must pay for this;" Gough put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a wooden box, he took something out of it, and put it into his right-hand trousers pocket - he shut the box again, and Eves laid down 9 1/2d.; the publican said there was another halfpenny wanted - Gough paid the other half-penny, and handed the box to Eves; Eves said, "I shall not be done, put them back again;" Gough then put a brooch and a pin into the box - It was a twisted pin as far as the centre part of it, and the brooch had a kind of stone in it; they were in a box-wood coloured snuff-box, rather brown, and a little the worse for wear - Eves again said, "I shall not be done, there is some more;" Gough then put his hand into his pocket, took out a watch-key, put that into the box, and Eves had the box - I am sure there was a watch-key, pin, and brooch, in the box; but this is not the key, I did not see this key at all; that was a long smooth key - I afterwards took them, and when we were at the watch-house, I was ordered to search Eves, he said he would not be searched - he threw this key on the table and took it up again; the prosecutor said, "That is my property, I will swear to it;" Eves twice attempted to run away from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it before you apprehended them? A. I suppose three quarters of an hour - we went to the Commercial-road, and they went, away; I merely went to the public-house for information not for the sake of the rum - I would drink vinegar or turpentine for information; they were not long in my company - there was no attempt at concealment; I had not known them before - the toll-house is not on my beat; Eves was much the worse for liquor.</p>

            . My snuff-box was a dark brown, something of a box-wood colour - it contained two pins, a brooch, and two keys; the brooch was an old fashioned one, with three letters on it - this is very much like one of the keys; I had kept it in the box because it had lost its ring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you were on the most friendly terms with Eves? A. Yes; his brother is one of the superintendents of the trust, and it would have been his duty to be there at half-past five or six o'clock the next morning - I went to sleep about eleven, and was awoke about ten minutes before twelve; this robbery must have been between eleven and twelve - I have seen many other keys like this, and I will not swear to this; I have seen no other property - it was Sunday night, and the shops were not open.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Have you seen many such keys without a ring? A. No.</p>
               <p>Eves' Defence. I know nothing of the business; the Policeman is quite mistaken in saying it was a wooden box- it was a tin tobacco-box, and the articles in it were the brooch out of my shirt, the ring off my finger, and the key, which I put into the box for safety.</p>

            . I am a master mariner, and live at No. 5, Johnson-street, Old Gravel-lane. On Sunday night, the 5th of December, I saw the two prisoners going into Mr. Ireland's, at the Crown and Dolphin, at the corner of Cannon-street-road. soon after ten o'clock - they sat drinking in the tap-room, and I went into the bar, which commands a view of the two entrances; I was there till near twelve o'clock, and during that time I never saw Eves go out till he went out for good, which was between a quarter to twelve and twelve - I saw Gough go out twice during the time; he was absent but a short time - I saw him come in again each time; perhaps he was out about five minutes - the reason they left was, Mr. Ireland was desirous of getting rid of them. as Eves was very much in liquor - he could scarcely stand; he stood twenty minutes or half an hour at the bar - I am quite positive Eves did not go out.</p>

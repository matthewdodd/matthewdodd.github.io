I staid there about twenty minutes, when she went out; I waited in the room for her about twenty-five minutes, but she did not return - I then missed my notes; I am certain they were safe when Green left me. I alarmed the watchman, and Mansfield was brought to the watch-house about an hour after.</p>

I was at the corner of King's Head-court, just by the house, which is in Bowl-court, the prosecutor came to me, saying, he had been robbed - He was sober - I asked him if he should know the woman, he said he should; I had seen the two prisoners together at ten o'clock. I apprehended Mansfield at four o'clock in the morning in Angel-alley, and told her what she was charged with - She denied it; the prosecutor said she was the woman; she said there was somebody else concerned in it, and she was not the person, and that he had been with other women. I found nothing on her. I knew she lived in Green's house in Bowl-court, I went to the house, and knocked at the door, Green answered me, and said that she would not let me in; I asked her if Mansfield was there, she said, No; she said she could not speak to me, and at last she let me in. This was a little after one o'clock. I asked her about it, she said she had only two 1l. notes, which she had received of Mansfield, and she had left them at the public-house. I went to the public-house in Angel-alley, and got 1l. 4s. 6d.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Cooper, and live at 6, Tavistock Street, Bedford Square—on 11th January last, about 1.30, I was walking in Endell Street, Long Acre—the prisoner came in front of me, and seized my gold chain—it was a very strong chain—I held on to him, and he dragged me into the middle of the road—I screamed out all the time, but no one came—he tugged on till my chain broke, and then he ran down Short's Gardens—I ran after him—I don't know whether he struck me or not, because I did not recover myself until I got to the police-station—I found my lips bleeding; my teeth had been struck into my lips, but I don't know whether that was done in the struggle, or whether he struck me—he dragged me about six or seven yards into the road—the chain did not break at first—I lost nine or ten inches of the chain—I have not seen that since—I also lost my gold eye-glass; and a bunch of charms was picked up in</p>

               <p>the road after the robbery, and given back to me—I hate not the least doubt that the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you wear glasses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, sometimes—I went to the police-station several days afterwards to identify the man; nearly a fortnight, I should think—the same day as the examination at Bow Street—I picked out the wrong man first, the constable told me to walk round and take another look—my sight is defective in one eye, and when I am excited it affects the noire—I went again and looked at the prisoner side-ways, and then I knew him—he was sideways to me when be robbed me—I did not use my spectacles when I picked him out—I said to the prisoner "I could have taken you myself, for you did not run very fast"—he said "No, my lady, I could not run very fast, for I had hurt my knee"—I did not use my glass when I picked him out, I did afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at' 43, Clifton Road—on 11th January, about 1.30, I was in Endell Street—I saw the prisoner go up to the lady and seize her chain—he pulled her into the road, broke it, and ran away—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man, he ran down Short's Gardens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you next see him?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three weeks after, at Bow Street—he was placed with some other men and I picked him out directly—a detective came for me and took me to the station—I gave information the day the robbery was committed, and they took my address.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective S.</hi>) On 11th January I received information, and on the 27th I went to King's Court after the prisoner—I found him in bed—before I told him the charge, he said "I suppose it is for that job in Endell Street"—I then told him I should take him into custody on suspicion for assaulting and robbing a lady of a gold eyeglass, 'a bunch of charms, and part of a chain—he dressed himself—on the way to the station he said "Give me a fair chance"—I said "What do you mean?"—he said "Well, let us have some one something like myself"—he was placed with ten others—I sent for Mrs. Cooper and she at first picked out the wrong man—she was a little excited at that time; I told her to collect her<lb></lb>self and walk round again—she walked round to the back, and when she got to the prisoner she pointed him out—she then came round to the front, and said "Will you allow me to see him side face"—I told him to turn, and then she said she had no doubt at all—he said he was lame at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did she give you a description of the man who robbed her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she said be ran lame—the first one that Mrs. Cooper picked out was a man about the prisoner's height—I did not draw her attention to the man when I told her to look round again—the prisoner is not lame, he was suffering from a sore on his knee—about two days after he came out of prison he fell down and out his knee on the kerb—when the lady said the man limped a little, I went and looked after the prisoner—I did not see Mrs. Cooper till the day I apprehended the prisoner—I received my information from the description at the station—the description was "A young man about 22, dark brown hair, rather full in the face, shabbily dressed, about 5ft. 2 in."—there was nothing in our information about his running lame at all—when I saw Mrs. Cooper she told me he did not run very fast, that was not taken down at the station in our information.</p>

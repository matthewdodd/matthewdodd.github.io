                  </hi>. I am a machine ruler, of 16, Abchurch Lane—on 15th February, just after midnight, I was in Bishopsgate Street, with two friends—the prisoner and two others came up to me—the prisoner pressed against me and wanted to ask me a question; I tried to get away, but they followed me, and I felt his hand at my pocket—I seized him with my watch in his hand, which was passed up—it is my property.</p>

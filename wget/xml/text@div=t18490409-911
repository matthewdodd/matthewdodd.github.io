I am foreman to Mr. Bourne, a hatter, who has a shop in Regent-street, which I manage, and another in Lamb's-conduit-street—the prisoner was the errand-boy and porter about six months—I used to send the prisoner every evening to Mr. Bourne, with a statement of the day's proceedings, the cash taken, and any memorandum I might have to send—he used to carry it in his right-hand trowsers' pocket—on the evening of 23d Feb. his wages were due—about twelve o'clock in the day he asked me to advance Is. for his dinner; I told him to ask the man in the shop, and he after<lb></lb>wards told me he had got it—in the evening, at twenty-seven minutes after six, I sent him to Mr. Bourne with a bundle of goods and a small parcel, containing a statement of the day's proceedings, five sovereigns, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and two notes addressed to Mr. Bourne—as he stood by me I placed a box on the counter, and it swept the parcel on to the floor—it fell weighty, as if there were sove<lb></lb>reigns in it—he heard it fall—I said, "George pick that up, it is the cash and the day's statement"—he did so—I did not see which pocket he put it in, it I was about the size of a card.</p>

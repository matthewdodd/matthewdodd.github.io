               <p>Court. The lead you say was cut in pieces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What, in regular pieces? - I cannot say, I went up to see what lead was missing, I think there was a matter of a hundred weight of it taken that morning more than we missed before.</p>

               <p>I was at Mr. Moorish's house the 17th of May, I was called up between three and five, by Mr. Longford, I ran up stairs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290145"></xptr> in my shirt , and observed the prisoner with a bit of lead in his hand, and I saw him take it across the leads towards his own house, and he came back and put some dirt where the lead had been taken from; he was then upon Mr. Moorish's house, I observed the top of the house, the lead had been taken from off the place recently, it was taken off that morning , I was up the night before to see if I could see anybody, because we had missed some before, that was between twelve and one, and it was not off then: there were eighty or ninety pounds weight of lead missing the next morning as I imagine, I did not weigh it, I was present when the constable came , and we went to the prisoner's house, he was there, and I observed in his house a bag of lead, containing about eighty or ninety pounds, and there was a door, and when I laid hold of it down tumbled a parcel of lead, some appeared as if newly cut, they were pieces of different sizes, there was a cooper's adze by the bag: the prisoner said, he was then moving of his own things , sometime had elapsed, near upon an hour, it was about four when I was first called up to go to the top of the house; I went up afterwards, and measured three pieces that were in the prisoner's house, and they matched with the places exactly, but we could not match more than three pieces; the three pieces of lead I found in the prisoner's house, were exactly of the same sort and size with those taken from Mr. Moorish's house, the lead that was in the bag was beat up , I could not tell for certain what it was beat up with, it was cut a little bit, and then torn, it was folded, we were forced to unfold it, but we did not use any instrument in unfolding it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear to any particular mark in my face? - No, I cannot, but I swear to his person altogether , he is dressed different.</p>
               <p>Jury. What parted the two houses at top? - A bit of a wall, about five or six feet.</p>
               <p>Was there any part where you could walk straight on, without getting over? - No.</p>
               <p>Could a man with tolerable case get over that wall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are there any steps or any thing that could assist a man? - Only the brick work, the house where the prisoner was, was an empty house, there was no place for any person to sleep in, I am sure of that, I observed nothing but straw and tubs.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, at a quarter before five in the morning, I was called by Mrs. Longford, I went with him, and waited outside the prisoner's door half an hour, I heard a hammering, but what it was I could not tell, the noise was in his own shop, close to the door; we waited, and the prisoner opened the door, I said, halloo! what do you do here, and I desired Mr. Jenkinson to mind the door while I looked about, I saw a cupboard door placed close underneath the window, and under that there were several pieces of lead, and I saw this adze just over the lead in the window, the prisoner seemed very much confused, and did not give me an answer; we searched all the house, but found no other tools: there was a wheel-barrow, and a few staves in his own business, I asked the prisoner how he could be guilty of anything of that sort, he said he had laid out a good deal of money on the house, he said nothing else, I made no promise to him; I went up to the top of the house to see which way he got out, and I went out, and could get on Mr. Moorish's house, as easy as I can go down these steps; there is a gutter that goes from the prisoner's house to Mr. Moorish's house, his trap door was open; there was a great deal of lead missing, and I afterwards examined the lead with the places they came from, at the top of Mr. Moorish's house, and these three pieces tallied exactly, they came from the middle; I cannot say whether these three pieces were in the bag, but there was some of the lead taken upon the prisoner; these pieces were folded together<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290146"></xptr> all of them, I beat it out at my own shop, and then took it out flat, but when I measured it, I trod it down with my feet, I only smoothed the others.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the situation of the roof such that a person not being very conversant with the two houses, could suppose himself to be on one house, when he was actually on the other? - He could not, there is a gutter between the two roofs first, and then there is a gutter adjoining to the wall, the wall is between three and four feet.</p>
               <p>Is the roof of the house he lived in leaded? - No, it is not, only the gutter and the trap door at the top of it, and not leaded.</p>
               <p>Does the house he lives in and that from which the lead was taking join in any part? - No.</p>

               <p>Jury. How did you see to pack up your things? - There was a sky light, and a sufficient light over the door, and the windows gave light enough.</p>

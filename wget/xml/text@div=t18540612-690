                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mr. James William Watts, a gutta percha manufacturer, No. 27, City-road. On the Saturday before the 29th April, I was directed to take some capes to No. 9, Beehive-passage, Leaden-hall-market—I there saw Mr. Smith; I asked for Mr. Gillman, but was not able to see him—I was not able to obtain the money for the capes—in con<lb></lb>sequence of that I took them back to my master's—a man then came to my master's shop, and I was sent again to Beehive-passage; I took six capes, and I waited there a quarter of an hour—I then saw Newman; he asked if they were the capes that were brought for him to look at—I said, "yes"—he looked at them, and gave me back the highest priced one, and the lowest priced one—we went to the Cape of Good Hope public house, and the other prisoner, Staines, came there, and they looked at the four capes—I then folded them in a separate parcel; I took them with me, and Newman said they were for his brother, and he and I went to lime-street-square—I</p>

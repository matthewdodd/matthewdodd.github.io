               <p>Q. Did she say hit or kick? A. Both; I was so frightened, I thought the place would fall in; they appeared up in arms together; she was screaming and begging for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any sounds proceeding from blows? A. Yes; I should think he was hitting her, or she would not scream like that; I heard her get out into the passage, and begged my husband to get up and get a Policeman; I heard her say in the passage "You b - y w - 's son, you had better come out, and finish me; and murder me, as you did your first wife, and honest little girl;" upon which Sullivan said, "Did I;" I do not know whether he hit her or not, but her screams were then dreadful; she then ran down as if the stairs would fall from under her: she screamed violently at the foot of the stairs, and I saw no more of her till the following day, after dinner - she then complained of being ill - I went into their room about halfpast ten o'clock on Sunday morning, and perceived a good deal of blood about the floor - I saw none about the wall; the deceased was not there then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you known her long? A. Several years; at times both the prisoner and her used to get very tipsy - I did not see her on the night in question; I only knew her voice - she did not fall down the stairs - for I heard her run down every stair.</p>

             - I live at No. 1, Union-yard, on the first floor; Sullivan and his wife came in to my lodging between one and two o'clock - he came first, and his wife about five minutes after; they were both the worse for liquor - but he appeared the most sober; they got their living by selling things in the street - they appeared comfortable for some time, and then she seemed to say he had gone into his sister's house, and spent the money there; he said he had not - she used very bad language - called him a wh - 's son, and said he went into his sister's house and spent the money they wanted at home - he did not answer her much, but said he would not live with her any longer; she said he need not live with her, while he could go and live with his sister, as he had done before - we then saw it was jealousy; he stood up and struck her with his open hand on both sides of the head - he hit her two blows, and her tooth went into her lip; she held her head down, and let the blood drop from her upon the floor - she was sitting on a market sieve; she crawled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050060"></xptr>under the bed, to get out of his sight, and I told him she was gone home; I told him to stop a moment and sit down - he then sat on the sieve, and laid his hand on one of her legs; he then pulled her from under the bed -I came up, took her leg out of his hands, and made her set on the sieve; he did nothing to her - he did not kick her at any time; my husband then jumped out of bed, dressed himself, and took him away with him to have something to drink, to get him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state, that from the time he pulled her from under the bed, till he went away with your husband, he did not strike or kick her? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she call murder? A. She hallooed murder, and every thing which come to her mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she call murder about? A. She did not halloo murder - I took no particular notice of it, if she did; I heard her say nothing about his hitting or kicking her - she did not leave the room while the prisoner was there, nor go down stairs till she went with me; Carter sleeps in the next room - there is a small thin partition between them, and we can hear what passes in their room; my husband took the prisoner away - but he was doing nothing to the woman; we wished to have our place clear - after my husband and the prisoner were gone, the deceased went and sat on my stairs, and began to cry; I said, "Mary, don't kick up a row at this time of night - the neighbours will think it is me; but let us go out and meet him, and you can both go home together;" we went into Broad-street, and met the prisoner coming out of an eating-house - this was about four o'clock in the morning; she said she would not speak to him, nor see him: she wished me good night, and went along home; she lived in the Old Bailey - on the Sunday morning, she came to me about twelve o'clock; I gave her permission to move her things to my place till she could get a place of her own - she took a place in Milford-place, Tottenham-court-road, and moved her things there herself on the Monday; and on the following Friday she was taken ill, and sent for me - when I got there, she could not speak, but she made signs of having a pain in her chest; I afterwards saw her at St. Pancras workhouse, dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What furniture did she bring to your place? A. Two beds, a table, chair, bed-clothes, and two kettles - she brought a bedstead on the Tuesday; they were very weighty, and as much as a man could carry - she was quite exhausted; she had been unwell last winter, and complained of a complaint in her said - she had been troubled with a liver and a bowel complaint; I have known the prisoner three years - he was the most affectionate husband I ever knew; if ever he had a sixpence, he always brought it her - she called his sister a wh-e, and told him to go and spend his money among his wh - es; I do not recollect her falling in the room.</p>
               <p>MORGAN SHEEHY. The prisoner came to my house, as near as I can guess, between twelve and one o'clock, on Saturday night; I was sitting up in bed with my two children - the deceased came in about four or five minutes after the prisoner; they seemed quite peaceable at first, but afterwards great words occurred from her, saying that he spent his money at his sisters - she began the words; she sat by the side of my bed, on a sieve - he got up, and gave her two slaps on both sides of the head; I cannot say whether his hand was open or shut - I did not see any blood at that time, but I did soon afterwards; after receiving the slaps she turned herself off her seat, and got under the bed- the prisoner sat on the other side by the fire; he was not drunk, but had had something - he knew what he was doing; she was worse than him - he moved from where he sat, and saw her under the bed, he got up, and pulled her out by the leg.</p>
               <p>Q. After she crawled under the bed, had she said or done any thing to him? A. I never heard her speak a word- when he pulled her out, my wife ran between them; I jumped out of bed, and cannot say what my wife did, but I pulled him on the bed - I did not see him give her any blow nor kicks; I saw nothing but the two slaps - she was crying out, but I cannot say what she screamed, if I was to die this moment; I heard no cry of Murder! nor a word about his hitting or kicking her - she did not leave the room at any time; there were no cries of Murder! in the passage - I cannot hear in my room what passes in Carter's; the rooms are separated by thin boards - I saw the deceased spit blood as she sat on the sieve near my bed, but cannot say whether it was before or after he drew her from under the bed, as she sat on the sieve again when my wife separated them; she called him names, and used shameful language about his sleeping with his sister - I cannot say whether that was before or after he pulled her from under the bed; I left the room with the prisoner, leaving the deceased and my wife there; this was about half-past two o'clock - I went to Broad-street, St. Giles', with the prisoner; he lived somewhere in the City.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been long in bed before they came to your room? A. Three or four minutes; it was the deceased that used the provoking language - I heard the prisoner use none, except about his leaving her; he appeared desirous of being peaceable and kind to her- they always seemed very comfortable together.</p>

            . I live at No. 19, Pancras-street, Tottenham-court-road, I was called in to nurse the deceased on Friday, the 11th of May, at her lodgings, in Milford-place; she was laying in the corner of the room, in a very bad state - there was a lump on her left side, near the hip; it did not appear very black - it was swollen about the size of an egg; she said she was a gone woman on the Friday evening, when I went - she asked me on Saturday to go to the workhouse for a doctor, and said she never should recover, she thought she should die.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you judge from her conversation, that she expected to die almost immediately? A. Yes, she said so twice; she was removed to St. Pancras workhouse on the Monday following - I did not attend her afterwards; I saw her dead on the Thursday following - I saw her on the Sunday at her lodgings, about one o'clock; she was worse then than on Saturday, and said if I had got her into the workhouse on the Saturday, she should not have been alive then, and she never should recover, and I thought that probable; she was considerably worse than on Friday.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 14th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the deceased at the infirmary of St. Pancras workhouse; she was exceedingly ill - I thought her not very far removed from death; she told me she was done for - she said, "You<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050061"></xptr>cannot do much for me, ease my pain if you can, I am done for;" she said the pain was in her bowels - I placed my hand on her bowels, and she said she was in very acute pain - I have not a doubt she was suffering from inflammation of the bowels; her pulse was very low - she told me she had received a blow in her belly from a man's shoe; she did not say who the man was - I examined her after death, but there was no external mark on the abdomen.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she be seriously injured by a blow or kick in the belly, without the appearance of external injury? A. I think undoubtedly she might; she died the next day, and I opened her body; I found very extensive inflammation of the pertoneal cord of the bowels - the liver presented an appearance of long standing disease; it had evidently been affected by chronic inflammation - there was a collection of serum in the abdomen, and an enlargement of the uteras; some degree of inflammation on the pertorneal coat of the uteras, and a tumor in the womb, about the size of a large orange - it was a chronic disease of the uteras, which I think would predispose the subject to inflammation, which would undoubtedly be excited by external injury; I attribute her death to inflammation of the bowels- I cannot say how it was produced; a kick in the belly might create the inflammation; it depends entirely on the degree of force - it might have arisen from many other causes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you form any judgment how long the inflammation had continued? A. I should think it must have existed a week or more - it is very uncertain; I should think inflammation might have arisen from a blow which caused the lump Donoghue describes.</p>

On the Sunday after she told me that if she had been in the workhouse she should have been dead, she laid in the corner of the room; I said, "Mary, you had better let me put you on the bed, and let your son lay on that bed;" I lifted her up - she screamed out, and said I had laid her on her side; I asked her to let me see her side, which she did, and I saw the lump; I asked what had caused it; she said at the time Sullivan pulled her from under the bed, he gave her a kick, and that was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you married? A. No, I live with my father - he maintains me; I never went by the name of Lake; I had known the deceased about three years, and knew the prisoner - I never quarrelled with him - I have no ill-will towards him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. EASTCOTT. Q. From the post mortem examination, I take it for granted there was considerable disease? A. There was chronic inflammation and acute inflammation - I cannot swear of what standing the acute inflammation was, but suppose it must be within ten days or a fortnight - I could swear it had existed less than a month; drinking ardent spirits would render her exceedingly susceptible of inflammation, and a slight injury would produce it - I saw no external mark of injury; if she had fallen against a projecting substance, in a state of intoxication, it might produce inflammation, particularly as the chronic inflammation existed before - I should expect if the external injury had been of a very violent nature, there would have been some contusion, but I do not think it absolutely necessary - the belly of all parts is the least likely to show inflammation; it might have been caused by a comparatively slight injury; kicks and blows generally leave marks; the tumor was on the middle of the belly - I saw no external tumor.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is it possible that an external tumor should have existed on Friday, and you see no trace of it on Monday? A. I should think it quite impossible - there would have been some marks; I should think the tumor on the uteras was of three or four years standing - I think that predisposed her to inflammation.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then would a slighter injury produce fatal effects than if the body had been perfectly healthy? A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine with a view to find an external tumor? A. I looked at her body generally, but had received no information as to any tumor - I pointed out the body to Dr. Roots.</p>

            , ESQ., M. D. I live in Guildford-street. I went in accidentally to the dead-house, and saw body, which Mr. Eastcott pointed out - I watched the progress of the post mortem examination; there was a very active inflammation of the whole of the membrane, covering the bowels and the different viscera - there was a considerable effusion of watery fluid, mixed with flakes of lymph; the liver was obscured, and changed in its structure; what is called a nutmeg liver, which is very common with drunkards; the uteras was enlarged, and was just rising above the pelvis; it was about the size of a cricket-ball, or large orange - the external seat of the uterus was inflamed, and the kidney; I attribute her death to the inflammation covering the bowels and the whole of the viscera.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment would a kick in the belly from the shoe of a man, about a week before, be likely to produce the inflammation in the bowels? A. I conceive it possible; but having so frequently seen the same appearance arising without any injury, and not knowing of any injury at the time, I was perfectly satisfied her death took place from natural causes; a kick on the 6th of May would be very likely to produce the inflammation - I conceive she must have been suffering under inflammation for a long time, more particularly the part covering the uteras and liver - dram-drinking, or exposure to cold, is very likely to produce the same effect.</p>

             (Police-constable E 61.) I apprehended the prisoner on the 15th of May, at No. 18, Pancras-street - I told him his wife was laying dead at the hospital; he asked what I was going to do with him - I said he was going to Hatton-garden; he said he should be sure to go to Newgate, for he always thought he should be hung for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lords and Gentlemen, -The deceased and I had cohabited together under promise of mutual support and comfort to each other three years; we never were married - during the period of our intercourse I trust, I have shown that I always treated her with every kindness and attention; I had been very ill for six weeks previous to the melancholy catastrophe, on which evening I was very poorly indeed; the deceased and I had words, because I would not indulge her that night in her propensity to drink - she had by some means obtained it; I left her at my sister's, and went to New Inn-yard - the deceased followed; irritated at her shocking reflections of an unnatural kind, as regarded my sister and myself, I struck her - I gave her two or three slaps on the face; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050062"></xptr>away from her to a cook-shop in Holborn - she followed me; I saw her it is true, but we did not speak to each other; I left her - she was then in company with Mrs. Sheehy; she was smoking a pipe, to which she had got a light from the gas in the cook-shop - I saw her once after this, which was on the Wednesday following; I saw her at that time in Tottenham-court-road - we did not speak to each other; from this period I never afterwards saw her.</p>

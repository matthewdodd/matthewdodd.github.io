                  </hi>. I keep the "Kings' Arms," Queenhithe—the prisoner was my potman two months—I kept my cash-box in a drawer in the bar<lb></lb>parlour—on 16th September, about 11 o'clock, I went to the drawer and took some change from the cash-box, which was there safe, with 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, some fourpenny-pieces, policies of insurance, and other papers—I locked the drawer, put the key on a shelf just above, as I usually do, and went down into the cellar—in about four minutes the barmaid called out, and I came up and missed my cash-box and the prisoner; he returned in about an hour—I accused him of stealing it, and gave him in charge—he said that he knew nothing about it—he had no right to be absent from 11 to 12—I had given him a week's notice, and he was to leave on the next Saturday.</p>

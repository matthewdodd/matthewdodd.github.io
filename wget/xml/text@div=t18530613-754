                  </hi>. I am a comb manufacturer, of Park-road, Greenwich. The prisoner was in my service from 2nd Nov. till the Saturday previous to Whit-Sunday—he never had any work to do at home—he worked on my premises—he had no occasion to take anything from the premises—he was at work on my premises on 2nd May—on 15th May I went with a constable to the prisoner's lodgings—I did not see him there—my wife was there the previous evening—I round in a bedroom some unfinished combs—this (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>) was made in my establishment, and it is a peculiar kind—I know the work of it—I found some comb makers' took—these things were safe on my premises while the prisoner was with me—I did not miss them all at once.</p>

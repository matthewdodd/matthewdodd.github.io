On the Saturday following he came with a black girl, and another woman - he said he wanted to treat his wife with a beaver bonnet, and a fine feather in it; I objected to let him have it, but I was prevailed on to do so by my daughter; he said the ship would be paid off on the Monday, and he would come and pay for the hat and bonnet; he got to the window, and was pulling some of the travelling caps about, and put some of them upon his head; I then saw him lean against the counter, buttoning his jacket. As soon as they went out of the shop I followed - they went into a chandler's-shop at the corner of Little Union-street - I then crossed the way, and peeped in at the window; I saw him with a travelling cap on his head, which I had been shewing to a gentleman an hour before. When they came out I followed them to a house in Little Union-street. The next morning I went to the Lord Exmouth, public-house, where he said he boarded, but he was not there. I then took an officer to No. 3, Little Union-street, where he found the cap and the prisoner. I waited for them at the chandler's-shop, where I had seen him the night before; he had left his hat at that house. I am positive the cap is mine - I made it myself.</p>

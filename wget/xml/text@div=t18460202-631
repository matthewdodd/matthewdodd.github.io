                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Broom<lb></lb>field-place, in the parish of St. Paul's, Deptford. On the 21st of July Mar<lb></lb>garet Lawrence came to my sale shop about a quarter before five o'clock in the afternoon—in consequence of what transpired there she was taken into custody—we went to her room at No. 3, Union-street, Deptford—she gave the officer the key of it, and said it was her room—we there found shawls, table-cloths, gowns, sheets, and the other things mentioned, which were my property; and a great many duplicates—we found this picture, which I had had safe on the Saturday previous to Margaret Lawrence being given in custody—this pair of boots were safe on the Monday—these are all my property, and have all my marks on them—they had been taken by somebody from my premises—I had not sold them.</p>

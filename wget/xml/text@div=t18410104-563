                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs White and Green well in Blackfriars-road—the prisoner was also in the employ, in the fancy de<lb></lb>partment. On the 26th of December I was standing behind the counter in the fancy department, and saw the prisoner take down a box from behind the counter, and take out two handkerchiefs, one she placed under<lb></lb>neath the counter, and the other in a drawer, which she had the use of, and which she closed—she bad no customer with her at the time—I was about three yards from her—about five minutes afterwards, she got some paper, folded them both in it and put it in the drawer—she then opened the drawer, took the parcel out, and put it into her pocket, paper and all—I soon after told Mr. Hubbard, one of the partners, what I had seen—the two handkerchiefs now produced are the same I saw her put into her pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of William White and Green well. Morgan made a communication to me, in consequence of which I called the prisoner into the counting-house, and said I was afraid she was not so honest as she ought to be, and I believed she then had some of our property in her pocket—she said, "You cannot suppose I have any of your property," or something of that sort—I said I had reason to believe she had, and desired her to turn her pocket out—she did so, and turned out these two handkerchiefs—I asked how she accounted for having those—she said she had taken them in exchange for a black one, which she had put into the black box, and that the price was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I searched that box through, and there was not one at such a price in it—it was full of all sorts of prices from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. up to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but none at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am certain she told me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she had no right to exchange, unless she had consulted some one in authority, to give her leave to do it, and then it ought not to be done, except by showing to some person that such an exchange had been made—she</p>

               <p>must have known that was the custom of the firm—every body in the house knew it, for some little time ago we stuck up a notice to that effect—she should go to another person to serve her, who would either take the money for it, or enter it to her—that is a system we have ar<lb></lb>ranged to prevent our being robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you swear that she said, "You can't sup<lb></lb>pose that I have any of your property in my pocket?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to the same effect—those were her words, as well as I can recollect—I do not think I have ever forgotten that—I have always told the same story in effect, and I believe the same words, very nearly—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his depo<lb></lb>sition</hi>)—this is my name and hand-writing—her answer is not here, cer<lb></lb>tainly—I really do not know whether I said it or not—I cannot say that I did say it before the Magistrate—what I said was read over to me—I suppose I did not say it, by it not being down here—I do not recollect that I did not state it—I do not know whether I did or not, but I per<lb></lb>fectly remember her saying so—there were perhaps fifty handkerchiefs in the black box—it is impossible for me to tell the price of every article in it—I do not think there were any at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I cannot swear it—we have no entry in the books of her buying one at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the books are not here—the prisoner lived in the house—we open at a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning, but the young ladies are not down till half-past—we have between seventy and eighty hands—the prisoner has been fourteen months in our service—she came from Sewell and Cross, where she had been seven years—we should not have taken her without an unblemished character.</p>

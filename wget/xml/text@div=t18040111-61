               <p>Q. Was that other bellman walking, or standing still? - A. I could scarcely distinguish whether he was or not, it was very foggy; I heard his bell ring, and called to him; he took my letter in one hand, and pressed it in the other, and then, apparently to me, dropped it in the bag.</p>

To the end of Bond-street, where a man is stationed with a cart to receive the bags; that is the rendezvous for all of them at that end of the town to go to Bond-street, that they may assist one another not to come so far.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you to say, the prisoner was on that beat that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him upon the beat? - A. No; it was his duty to be upon the beat that night.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether he was, or not, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. One postman will very often assist another in his duty? - A. If a man is taken ill, or has leave of absence, we have people to do that duty; it is never done without acquainting me; we have proper officers for that duty.</p>
               <p>Q. The corner of Bond-street is the end of his district? - A. No, his district is Portman-square, and he brings his letters to Bond-street, which is a general place of rendezvous.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes they do not go to the full extent of their beat? - A. No, they are saved by one another.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, supposing a man with that bag did not go to the extent of his beat, and another person taking the letters on that part of the beat that he did not go to, would have the letters? - A. He would have the whole bag; sometimes another man carries the bag, but the letters of that district are all in one bag.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at your book, and see if he was on duty that night? - A. Yes, and on the 25th; he came upon duty after his illness; he came to the office on the 25th.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon the 26th, was he there? - A. He was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time receive that Banknote, (shewing him one), and from whom? - A. I received this note from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a regulation at the Post-office, that the Bank-notes passing through the hands of the carriers, shall have their names written upon them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that the prisoner's name upon it? - A. Yes, and I wrote my name under it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you received it from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. He said he could not make his money even for the Receiver-General's office, without change for a pound-note, and I gave him change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not able to ascertain the actual day, I understand? - A. No; I paid it into the Receiver-General's office that same morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember sometime afterwards, an enquiry being made respecting this note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, had you any conversation with the prisoner? - A. Not till after he had been at Mr. Parkins's; he then said to me that he had taken them of Mr. Jennings, at the Three Compasses, by carrying him silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he had taken from Jennings at the Three Compasses? - A. He said he had carried six pounds worth of small change, and had taken six one-pound notes; he said this was one of the six one-pound notes he took at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of what he had done at the time, as to writing, or any thing of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how long before he had taken them? - A. No; he said he always signed the name of the persons he took them from, and as he took that of Mrs. Jennings, he had signed her name to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the name of Mrs. Jennings appear upon it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When this conversation took place between you and the prisoner, you don't know? - A. No; this was the day he had been to Mr. Parkins.</p>
               <p>Q. But when that was, you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a letter-carrier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an uncommon thing for you to find publicans in change, where you stop to get refreshment? - A. No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing particular in the account the prisoner gave, that made you think that uncommon at all? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the Post-office yourself? - A. Fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your custom to put upon a note the person's name from whom you receive it? - A. I generally get the person I take it of to sign it themselves, and then I put my name upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how long the prisoner has been in the office? A. Many years, I cannot say how long; he was there before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person in the Post-office entitled to a better character than he was? - A. I never heard a better character given to any man in my life, in the office, or out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Jennings's house? - A. I have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of getting notes changed there? - A. I have, in the course of last summer, been with the prisoner to Jennings's house, when I have seen the prisoner give him some change, and he has given him ones and twos for it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When was it - do you know? - A. On the 10th of December, I requested Folkard might be sent for into the inspector of letter-carrier's room; I sent for both, but I sent for Folkard first; I asked Holmes if he had paid that note to Folkard; he said, if I did, it has my name upon it, and when I shewed it him, he, without the least embarrassment, acknowledged the name of Holmes to be his hand-writing, and appeared perfectly unembarrassed; I asked him if he had any recollection from whom he had taken it; he begged to look at the note again, and said, yes, I have written the name of Jennings upon it, from whom I took it; he keeps the sign of the Compasses, in Portman-mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass? - A. He went out of the room, and I made out the usual statement for the information of Mr. Parkin, and there I left it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Then he appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110045"></xptr>not to have the least suspicion, and made no secret of any thing? - A. Perfectly unembarrassed.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't mean to say you never gave him any small notes? - A. I cannot say I never did; I don't remember the time when I did give him any; I have given him two-pound notes.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You are solicitor to the Post-office? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time, in consequence of this letter, and Bank-notes being missed, see the prisoner, and receive any account of the transaction from him? - A. On the 12th of December, Mr. Jennings, Mrs. Maxon, Mr. Fergusson, the inspector of letter-carriers, and Mr. Coleback, came to my house; a Bank-note at that time was produced to the prisoner; he looked at it, and saw his own name upon it in his own hand-writing; he saw also upon it the name of Jennings; he said he had it either from Mr. or Mrs. Jennings; it was pointed out to him that the name upon it was Mr. and not Mrs. Jennings; upon which he said, then he must have had it from Mr. Jennings; Mrs. Maxon stated the circumstance of delivering the letter to the <rs id="t18040111-61-deflabel370" type="occupation">postman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18040111-61-defend619 t18040111-61-deflabel370"></join>, and described the place; she also said, the postman, who received the letter from her hand, apparently to her put it into his bag; the prisoner observed upon it, that if it was put into the bag, he could not get it out, or at least could not without great difficulty. Mr. Jennings suggested to the prisoner, that he had been ill, and probably he might not have been upon duty on that day; the prisoner said he had been ill, but did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110046"></xptr>know whether he was then recovered, or not; I asked the inspector if there was any means of knowing whether he was upon duty, or not; he said, there was; I then sent to the Post-office to ascertain that fact. Nothing more passed at that time, the parties separated, and I believe he went to the Post-office. On the 18th, I sent to him to come again, he came, and I desired he would particularly state the circumstances respecting his having taken a note of Mr. Jennings. Upon that occasion, I took down in writing what he said, that on the morning of the day on which he received the note from Mr. Jennings, Mr. Jennings spoke to him, and said, he wanted a good deal of silver and small change against the evening, and that about half past four in the afternoon, he called upon Mr. Jennings with six pounds worth of small gold and silver; that Mr. Jennings was not at home; that he saw Mrs. Jennings, to whom he gave the six pounds in small gold and silver, and she gave him six one-pound Bank of England notes for it; he took a pen and ink, which stood upon the mantle-piece, and wrote Mrs. Jennings's name and his own under it, in her presence; he did not see where she took the notes from; this was done in the same room where he gave her the gold and silver; on Saturday he received the Bank-notes from Mrs. Jennings, and on Monday, having five pounds fourteen shillings to pay into the Receiver-General's office, he requested change of one of the letter-carriers, that he might give even money; Folkard gave him change, and he paid the other five notes into the Receiver-General's office; he does not know the number of any of the said notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long had the prisoner been in the Post-office? - A. I understand, about sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he would in a few months, or a short time, have been entitled to an annuity of fifty pounds a year for his life? - A. Of that, the inspector can inform you best.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the character he has maintained in the Post-office? - A. I understand he has maintained one of the best of characters.</p>


               <p>Q. From the 12th of December to the 18th, when he came again to you upon the second summons, he was going about his business? - A. He was suspended upon this enquiry, but he was at perfect liberty.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you fix when about those times were? - A. The first time was in the summer, in very hot weather; the next time was the latter end of the summer, when he gave me change for a five-pound note.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You don't mean to swear positively you did not give him six one-pound notes? - A. I cannot recollect it; to the best of my recollection I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see him come with the prisoner to your house? - A. I really cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he use your house? - A. Very seldom; I cannot say I ever noticed him coming in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever give you change? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. If you had at any time given him six one-pound notes, is it likely you should forget it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Holmes taking a pen and ink from the mantle-piece, and writing upon the notes? - A. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Fergusson.) Q. Can you say whether, according to the course of the Post-office, the prisoner would, in the course of a few months, have been entitled to an annuity? - A. Not a few months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. A few years; twenty years is the allotted time, if a man is not capable of doing his duty, and then by the approbation of the post-master.</p>
               <p>Q. That annuity is fifty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I received six one-pound notes of Mrs. Jennings, and this is one of them; I signed my name upon them, and her own, in her bar, all at the same time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character, when the Jury declared they were satisfied as to character.</p>

I told him I was, and we had a good deal of conversation about ships, and I found he did not know any thing. I went into a house with him, and we had some more beer, and I threw down five shillings for some beef steaks. I fell asleep, and he took the watch out of my pocket, I felt him, and rose up immediately. I asked him what he was about, and he said he was only taking the watch out of my pocket to give it to the landlord for security; I told him he had broken the chain. He said he would mend that easily. I however caught hold of him, and had an officer sent for. He knocked me down; but I caught hold of him until the officer came. I gave charge of him; I never saw the watch from that time to this. When I first awoke, the watch and chain were both in his hand.</p>

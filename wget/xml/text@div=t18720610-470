                  </hi>. I live at Southampton—on 10th August, 1861, I was present at the Registrar's Office, when the prisoner, Mr. Cavendish, was married to Alethea Thomas, who I saw in Paris on 16th May last—I am certain she is the same woman who was married to the prisoner—I signed the register.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was living in the neighbourhood, and was fetched out of my house into the Registrar's Office—I saw the man and woman for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—we were waiting for a few minutes—this was eleven years ago—I held no conversation with the lady or gentleman—I do not think the lady I saw in Paris on 16th May, 1872, was pitted with small pox, I cannot pledge my oath that she was not—I did not see her more than five minutes—Mr. Carrick, the solicitor, took me over there—I had no interview with Sergeant Ham before I went to Paris; I did not see him—I did not bring the lady away—there was a change in her, certainly, but I had seen her five years ago—if I had met her in the street, I might very likely have passed her as a stranger, but I quite recognised her as the same person—I had a gentleman with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I saw her, five years ago, I was called as a witness on a former trial—she was alive then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Bell, of Southampton—I was present at the marriage of Henry Cavendish with Alethea Thomas at the Registry Office—I have compared this document with the original register at Southampton—it is correct—the prisoner is the man who was married that day in the name of Henry Cavendish—I saw the lady at Southampton about five years ago, and on 16th May at Paris—she was the same person who was married in 1861. (<hi rend="italic">The certificate was here put in of a marriage at the Registrar's Office, on 10th August, 1861, between Henry Cavendish, bachelor, aged 63, and Alethea Thomas, spinster, aged 27.

               <p>pledge myself that I met them more than once afterwards—I held no con<lb></lb>versation with them on the day of the union, nor afterwards—the bachelor bridegroom was not 75 years old then, that is 12 years ago—I saw Alethea Thomas five years ago—I went to Paris with Mr. Carrick—he told me that he went for the purpose of identifying her—I recognised her by coming to the office—she came there three times—I had seen her twice before the marriage, but I do not know any of her relations—I did not see her husband till he came to the office—I saw the lady for about half an hour in Paris—I did not observe that she had suffered from small-pox since my first acquaintance with her—I saw nothing of that description—I should have recognised her if I had met her in High Street, Southampton, in 1872—I never saw a little girl with her, and if I had that would not have shaken my notion of identity at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Hart Street, Bloomsbury—I made the defendant's acquaintance and married him on 9th August, 1869, at St. James's, Pimlico—he gave the name of Richard Edward Conway Seymour—I cohabited with him for some time, but ultimately I found out certain things which induced me to leave him, and institute these proceedings—he mentioned Alethea—he said that he met her one day—he did not men<lb></lb>tion her name—it was not to me he said it, but to somebody else—that was last summer, after our marriage.</p>

I was on the look out for some time for the prisoner since last January—on 30th May I saw him leave 129, Laurie Terrace, St. George's Road—I followed him, touched him on the shoulder, and said, "Mr. Seymour, I believe"—he said "No, certainly not, you have made a mistake."—I said "Cavendish, then?'—he said "No it is not, you have made a mistake"—I said "No, I think I had the pleasure of meeting you a short time ago in Brussels?—he looked up in my face and laughed, and said "Really, I should not have recognised you if you had not recognised me"—I said "Well, I am going to take you in custody for intermarrying with Miss Pugh, knowing at the time that your wife Alethea was alive"—he said "Oh, yes, very well; this is the second time you have had me; I should think you were doing pretty well"—I took him to the station—I was here in July, 1867, and heard an indictment read over to the pri<lb></lb>soner in the Third Court—I then heard it stated in his presence that Alethea Thomas was alive—I heard no exception to that statement.</p>

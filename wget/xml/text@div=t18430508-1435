                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On Sunday morning, the 23rd of April, I met the prisoner Davis in the Back-road—I cannot say what time it was, but it was between two and four o'clock—I told her I wanted a place to lie down—I was not perfectly sober, but I had been walking for two or three hours since I was drinking—she took me to a house, took me up stairs, and asked me to give her some money—I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she went down stairs, came up again, and asked me for more—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she immediately went down stairs, and brought five or six women up—they took hold of my arms, and Barrett picked my pocket—Hillman beat me about the face, and othert ill-used me—they took a crown, two half-crowns, and six shil-lings, out of my pocket—after that they let me go—I made the best of my way out of the house—I walked about till 1 could get home to my lodging, which is at Mr. Salter's, the White Lion, Old Gravel-lane—I was covered with blood—my money was safe when I went into the house—I went to a policeman, and took Barrett into custody—I let her go again—when I found the state I was in, I got another policeman, and gave her in charge again, in about five minutes—I was perfectly sure of her—the first policeman is not here—it was directly after I was robbed that I first gave her in charge.</p>

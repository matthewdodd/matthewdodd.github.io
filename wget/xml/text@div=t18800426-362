                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Hargood, a pawnbroker, of 168, Vauxhall Bridge Road—we close at 7 o'clock—Young came in March, just before 7 o'clock, and asked for the loan of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I looked at it, and suspected that it was not gold—there is a mark on it purporting to be the Goldsmiths' Hall mark, the crown, the leopard, and 18, meaning 18 carat gold—I tried it with aquafortis, and found it was silver—I asked him where he got it—he said that a man gave it to him in pay<lb></lb>ment of a bet, which he owed him on the Lincoln Handicap—it is worth from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I would have advanced 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it if it had been gold—I gave him in custody—on the road to the station Beer ran across the road and followed us to the station—he came in while Young was being charged, and asked what was the matter—Young said "You know that watch that man gave me over the bet on the Lincoln Handicap; I have got locked up over that"—Beer said "It is my watch; I bought it of a watch-maker"—they were then both charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is a silver watch, and supposing it had the proper Hall-mark it would be marked in a jeweller's window at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the works are pretty fair—we took in three watches of this description for gold, but found they were not, and sold the three for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We scratched the cases, and the man knew perfectly well that they were duffln watches—we did not scratch over the mark, but we scratched the gold off so as to show the metal underneath; we left the mark as it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been one of the assayers of the Gold-smiths' Company for 33 years—this is not the impression of their mark; theirs is an English crown, and this is a foreign one, and where the leopard's head should be is simply a mass of confused dots; the letters belong to the mark of 1813, but our mark came into use in 1847; any one in the trade would know that this was not a genuine mark.</p>

I said at the police-court, "If it was handed round a sale-room the public might take it for a gold watch"—this watch (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) purports to have the Chester mark, and it may be genuine, but I doubt it—Chester has a Hall of its own—any person has a right to burn out or erase a forged mark.</p>

            . I saw Mr. Mills drive by, and saw the prisoner follow the gig, which went very fast, he drew the coat off gently from the gig by degrees, he then ran off - I called the hostler, and asked where he was going with it, he made no answer. I sent the hostler to ask the gentleman if he had lost it - he said he had. I followed and saw it on his arm, but when I caught him it was gone. I did not see him throw it away, he said he did it through distress, and did not know where it was.</p>

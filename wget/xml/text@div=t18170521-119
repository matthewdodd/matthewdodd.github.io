               <p>THOMAS METCALF, ESQ. I live in Queen-street, Bloomsbury; the prisoner was my <rs id="t18170521-119-deflabel602" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18170521-119-defend728 t18170521-119-deflabel602"></join>, and lived in the house. On the 16th of May, the prisoner had my plate in his custody, which was of considerable value. I went out, and returned home between eight and nine o'clock, and found he was not at home - He was the only man I had left at home in the care of the plate; he came home a little before ten o'clock - I had returned home quite unexpectedly. I told him the impropriety of his being out. About eleven o'clock, as I was getting into bed, Jane Atkinson came to my door. In consequence of what she said, I got up and went to the prisoner's bed-room, which was in the lower part of the house - I found his door locked, and told him to open it; he answered, that he was getting into bed. I was kept at the door sometime, and insisted on his opening it, which he did. He had his coat off, and the rest of his things loose. I told him I understood there was somebody in the house; he said," how could you suspect any such thing?" I said I would satisfy myself. I searched his room. I made him follow me, and looked round the rooms, and was going up stairs quite satisfied. I met my wife and Atkinson on the stairs, and told them to go to bed. My wife was not satisfied, and made some observations. The prisoner said," do you possibly suspect me of intending to rob you?" - She said" I do not know that I suspect you, but am sure, from what Atkinson says, that there is some person concealed in the house." I said I would make another search to satisfy her. The first place I went to was a closet in the prisoner's room, which was close by the door-way, and which I had omitted to search before. I opened the door, and there found a black negro. I retreated back a few paces - He came forward, and I presented my pistol to him. He said," for God's sake, sir, do not fire." The prisoner also put his hand up, and said"pray do not fire!" and I think he said he could explain it. The black man then made for the door; I got entangled between the prisoner and the bed, and he escaped. The prisoner then said, he hoped I would he merciful to him, and nothing of the kind should happen again. I called the watch, and gave him in charge. I desired the constable to ask him for the key of his box - He gave it to me; we opened his boxes, and found the articles stated in the indictment, and some bottles of wine, with the seals cut off the top; he had a key of my celler - I suspect the wine to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I never gave him the waistcoat to get mended-it was quite new.</p>
               <p>JANE ATKINSON. I am servant to Mr. Metcalf. On the 16th of May, about ten o'clock at night, the bell rang - I went to the door, and a black man asked for the prisoner; I told him he was with my master, but I would let him know when he returned. I shut the door, and he waited outside. When the prisoner came into the kitchen, I told him a black man wished to see him, and that if he must see him, he had better speak to him through the area-gate, as I thought my master would not like to hear any person going about the house at that improper time of night. He said it was very late, and returned to the drawing-room to my master. When he came down again, I asked him if the black man was gone, and what he wanted? he said, he was gone, and that he only wanted a direction that he had for him. I stopped in the kitchen a little while, and went up stairs to go to bed. I went into the drawing-room, to see if the fire was safe, and as I came out, I heard a gentle ring at the street - door. Expecting the prisoner to come up to answer the street - door, I leaned over the banisters till he came. He did not come up stairs, but I heard him open the kitchen door, which leads into the front area (it was barred before). I heard him unbar it, and shut it immediately. I was convinced that he had not time to speak to any person if they had wanted any thing. I felt curious to know what it could be, suspecting something, I took my light up stairs and left it there, and returned down stairs in the dark. I went to the top of the kitchen stairs and listened, and was quite certain that I heard another voice talking, as well as the prisoner's, in his room. I went up to my master, and told him what I had observed. He went down without me, and I heard my master tell the prisoner of the ring at the bell. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210038"></xptr>prisoner said it was Edward (a man who had been employed there) gone out. I then called out that it was not so, and he did not contradict me - I knew Edward had been gone sometime before. The second time that my master went down I went with him, and saw the negro; I opened the street-door and let him out, fearing that my master would shoot him.</p>
               <p>JAMES DUNHAM. I am a constable. On the 16th of May, the prisoner was given into my charge - He gave me the key of his box. I opened it, with Mr. Metcalf, and found the articles stated in the indictment in his boxes - I borke one box open. I searched him - He gave me a bottle label out of his pocket, and said he had taken it to be mended.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The black man called upon me for some money that I owed him; while I was talking to him, I heard some person coming down stairs, which alarmed me, and I, imprudently, instead of explaining it, denied that he was there. I placed the property where it was found for safety. <rs id="t18170521-119-verdict603" type="verdictDescription">

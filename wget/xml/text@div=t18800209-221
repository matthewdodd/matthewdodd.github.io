                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor in this case and reside at Rose Cottage, Egham—Meldrum was the printer of the Beekeeper and Martin was my copartner, and editor of the Beekeeper—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are copies of the Beekeeper for the months of October and November 1879—I am the Mr. Edward Rossiter referred to in the imprint—I was publisher and part owner—it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) purports to be a copy of December 1879. (<hi rend="italic">This paper contained the following announcement;</hi> "Apology.—The letters we have received complaining of delay in answering inquiries, acknowledging subscriptions, and of attending to business generally, have lately been so numerous that we cannot reply to each one separately. We take this opportunity of making an apology to all who have addressed us, and of informing them that owing to the unsatisfactory state of affairs brought on by this great dilatoriness, we have taken the business away from our late publisher, and shall pro tern, carry it on ourselves. 'If you want a thing done do it yourself.'—George Rose.") I purchased this on December 30th, at 39, Catherine Street, the office of the paper, and also the office of the prisoner, Mr. Meldrum—the date is December 15th—Mr. Martin was in the habit of writing in the name of George Rose, and letters were so addressed to him—this is the register of Stationers' Hall of my name as the pro<lb></lb>prietor on the paper, dated 18th December—my duties as publisher would be to buy the paper and arrange with the printer; a manager would do the same, obtain advertisements, and dispatch the paper through the trade—Mr. Martin never complained of my not carrying out my duties—I was not</p>

               <p>guilty of any negligence—I acknowledged subscriptions when they arrived—Mr. Martin, as a rule, received and opened letters—I acknowledged all subscriptions that came into my hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not swear before Sir James Ingham I had been 20 years a publisher, but that I had been in the trade 20 years—I am now 37—I went to school at Exeter when I was about four or five—I left school in 1858, and went to Messrs. Smith and Sons in 1859—I was then 16—I was dismissed in May, 1863, I had received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week there—in 1863 I went to Smith, Holmes, and Co., as confidential clerk—I left them the latter part of 1864—in 1865 I went to Willing and Co., the contractors—I had 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I left there in March or April, 1865, of my own accord—I then took over <hi rend="italic">The Grocer</hi> and canvassed for advertisements—no com<lb></lb>plaint was made of my conduct—I became a bankrupt—in 1868 I went to Messrs. Hopkins, of Carey Street—I was there two years—then I became the publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Commercial Review</hi>, at 144, Fleet Street—I have testimonials in Court now from them—I left in 1868, and published the <hi rend="italic">Marlborough Magazine</hi> for the same proprietors—then I went to the General Omnibus Company, who contract for advertisements—I was con<lb></lb>nected with <hi rend="italic">The Examiner</hi> last March—I was there three months—two policemen were called in and turned me out last May—I simply kicked the proprietor, Elim D'Avidor—J. will swear the police have not been called in at other times—I brought an action against <hi rend="italic">The Examiner</hi> to recover money—M. D'Avidor got a. judgment against me for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he levied on my furniture, but as I had a bill of sale in favour of Messrs. Thornton and Burton on it, he had to go out again—I think that is the only time I nave turned out executions by the same bill of sale—I will swear it—I was dismissed by <hi rend="italic">The Mechanics' Magazine</hi>—I do not recollect being complained of in money matters after I left <hi rend="italic">The Examiner</hi> I started <hi rend="italic">The Beekeeper</hi>—the idea was brought to me by Mr. Martin—I know it is a misdemeanour to make a false entry at Stationers' Hall—I did not disclose that there was another proprietor, because Mr. Martin's desire was that his name should not appear—there were other reasons—I did not start the Warehousemen and Clerks' Association—I was asked to become a director and became one—I put down Mr. Meldrum's address—I never paid any rent to him—a man may live in a house without paying rent—I have not done it often—I may have written "I attended the board meeting and voted Cheshire 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for his services; he is I believe to receive it from Vacuum and Chaos"—this is my writing (<hi rend="italic">Letter dated</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th October</hi>, 1879, <hi rend="italic">to Mr. Martin,' and stating:</hi> "Do not be disheartened, old man, we must drag this number out some how. I think the January number will look after itself. I think it is best to see me at Co vent Garden at 10.30 to-morrow. Sigh no more, Martin, sigh no more, coin is a deceiver ever!") I provided 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for <hi rend="italic">The Beekeeper</hi>—this is a statement of accounts—I never concealed the fact of receiving money for <hi rend="italic">The Beekeeper</hi>—the letter I wrote to Mr. Martin in September, appointing to call on him on Monday, at 10.30, is the first I think—this is also my letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated October</hi> 10, 1879, <hi rend="italic">and asking Mr. Martin to pay Mr. Meldrum</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) Also the letters of 7th October and 18th December—I did not carry away the books and papers on the 18th—I took the letters and the subscription book connected with me—I cannot say that I got a post-office order from James Vertu, of East Field Terrace, Dumfries, N.B., for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 17th December—every item I took for <hi rend="italic">The</hi>

               <p>Beekeeper is in the subscription book which is in Court—I would not sue a man of straw—I look upon Meldrum as a man of straw—I have not said I would give 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to see him in the dock, and did not care what became of the case afterwards—I believe the December number of The Beekeeper was printed on the 23rd December—I wrote those letters to Martin. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd and</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th December, declining to send subscription book and papers, and that of 29th stating: "You are by nature taciturn and suspicious, and as such impossible in business. I write this without any unkindness, for you are no more responsible for your nature than the dogs in the inn were for theirs</hi>") I did not send back the papers—I do not think that a libel because it was not published, it was a private letter—I have no regret of writing that—I think just the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. It was a mutual guarantee given to Meldrum—23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid for printing the first number of The Beekeeper—Martin paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I paid the balance—the amount for the second number if barely due—it has not been paid—Martin pays my share and his too as agreed—to call me "dilatory in would seriously injure me—we were to use Meldrum's office so far as letters for The Beekeeper were concerned—my name and that address were put down as a director of the Clerks' Associa<lb></lb>tion without my knowledge in the first place—I had nothing to do with it—I suppose the secretary put my name in the prospectus—he if a friend of mine—the bill of sale has been in existence for a long time—I never will pay costs for actions—I do not know what my qualification as a director was—I have never given Meldrum notice that I consider the agreement to pay half the costs of printing The <hi rend="italic">Beekeeper</hi> at an end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was an altercation between myself and the manager of The Examiner, and we both lost our tempers; that is the explanation—when I joined it its circulation was about 500, and when I left about 700—in this statement of accounts there is a balance of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for miscels<lb></lb>laneous expenses of Martin and myself—I received my letters at 1, Catherine Street as a matter of course—Hose Cottage, Egham, was my private address.</p>

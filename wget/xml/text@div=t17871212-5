               <p>I am waiter at the Northumberland Coffee-house; the prisoner came in about four into the coffee-room; I did not observe him do anything; he staid till very near six; I observed him go out of the coffee-room; a gentleman called me out of the coffee-room, and apprized me if there was any plate on the side-board to remove it, in consequence of that I had my eye on the prisoner, after this till he was going out; then the gentleman said, do you know waiter, the Irish gentleman that paid for part of my wine in the coffee-room? I said no; he said nor I; he went out; I looked after him; I thought he had something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120013"></xptr>in his pocket, and at the same time he ran, before he got ten yards from the coffee-room; there is a long passage; I took him directly; he was not out of my sight till I took him; he ran as hard as he could; and I followed as hard as I could; he went a little way in the street, about thirty yards, and he dropped his hat; he took no notice, that made me pursue him with more vigor.</p>
               <p>Did he stop to take up his hat? - No; I was coming rather close to him; I cried murder, and stop thief, thinking that would ring in the ears of the people; just as he got to the middle of Charing Cross, near the statue, he put his right hand in his pocket, and made a rattling, and flung the tankard down in the street; I saw him do it; I ran and took up the tankard, and still pursued him with the same cry as before; just as he got very near the Spring-garden Coffee-house, a man came out and opened his arms, and took him; his name is Anderson.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the person that was in the coffee-room at that time? - Yes.</p>

            25. 18.)</p>
               <p>Carns. This is the tankard; I have cleaned it many times.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my property; it was the property of Aaron Young, who died, and left it to his wife, and she was my wife's aunt, and left it to me, and some more property; I believe the figures 25, 18, mean the ounces; but I know the tankard perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long Mr. Young had his tankard you do not know? - No, Sir, his widow kept the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>It came to your wife as a legacy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell what it cost at first? - No.</p>
               <p>It is an old tankard? - So it shews on its face.</p>
               <p>What is the lowest value you would set upon that? consider it is a capital charge. - The Gentlemen of the Jury can judge better.</p>
               <p>But we are to hear your evidence? - The value I put upon it was five pounds; there is but one value for old silver, that will sell for nothing else.</p>
               <p>I should be glad to know what you value it at, as it affects his life? - I should be glad to recommend him to every lenity from the Jury; I suppose it cannot be worth less than three or two pounds.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, to be sure of the thing, rather than rest on supposition only, you might think it less than two pounds? - You may call it if you please one pound.</p>
               <p>We must have some value from you, the law requires it? - Then value it at twenty shillings; and I recommend also to the Jury to shew every lenity.</p>
               <p>Court. Old silver receives a certain value at goldsmith's shops; I suppose they would give you five shillings an ounce, or five shillings and four-pence? - I believe they would thereabouts.</p>
               <p>You have not weighed it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the Jury will form their judgment how many ounces it weighs.</p>

               <p>My Lord, to deny the fact would be very horrid; at the same time I leave myself entirely to your mercy; at the time the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120014"></xptr>fact was committed, which my witnesses will prove, I was very much intoxicated, or else no man in the world could attempt to do a thing of the kind, to put a tankard in his pocket where there was forty or fifty people in the room; as such I leave myself entirely to your mercy; I never was guilty of such a crime before; I never was at the house before in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you observe that the prisoner was in liquor? - I did not perceive any signs of it indeed.</p>
               <p>Jury to Carns, the waiter. Did you discover any marks of intoxication at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness in Court, who is the keeper of Tothill-fields, who can prove that I was so much intoxicated, that I even fell out of the coach as they carried me to prison, and that I did not know I was in prison till the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think that will be of any use to you; if you was to prove that you was ever so much intoxicated; because an honest man, if he was ever so drunk, would not steal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Very just, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character; one of whom said he was a ship-broker.</p>

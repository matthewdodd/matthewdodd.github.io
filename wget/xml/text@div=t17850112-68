            , and I stood at a considerable distance, and I suspected there were thieves; I got a man from the George to come over to this house, and we waited about ten minutes, I saw the prisoner come from the back door, he had nothing upon him but two small keys, and a knife; we apprehended him, we went in after with Mr. Tutt, and found a quantity of lead laying within the door, and an iron grate and two cheeks, and a horse-pistol, and a bill-hook, and a garden line and rule; there was a bag that part of the property was in, and some part would not go in, we found these things within the door; he said, he was a very poor man and in distress, and came into this house to lay down and refresh himself; and there is a shed behind the house belonging to it, with peastraw in it; he said he laid there two or three hours before, and finding himself very cold, and seeing the house open came in there.</p>
               <p>How came he to go out? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you make a noise in going there, I suppose you went as silent as you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there pea-straw under the shed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a noise was it you heard? - I heard a noise at the top of the house, as if they were ripping off the lead.</p>
               <p>What at the top of the very roof? - It appeared to me to come from the top, but I cannot say whether it was withinside or withoutside.</p>

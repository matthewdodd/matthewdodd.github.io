               <p>Was there any thing said to induce her or frighten her at the Justice's? - Nothing at all in my hearing, Mr. and Mrs. Pye were sent for and swore to the property; at first the prisoner said it is my property, I do not know the value of it, she said, the money was better to her than the pin, she asked no price at all; it is the custom of our shop, first to agree for an article in order to get the address to know whether they come honestly by them.</p>

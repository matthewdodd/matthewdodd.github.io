                  </hi>. I am an engine fitter on the Eastern Counties Railway in August, 1862, I was acting as sub-treasurer of this society—these entries on 27th August, 1862, are in my writing—the entry of John Jones, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is my writing—it was received on that day—the prisoner was present as secretary on that day, sitting close by me—I do not see any entry in the prisoner's book of John Jones—there is an entry of Jowers Francis—there is a something here that has been altered—there is no entry of Francis Jowers in the book that I keep—it stands in my book as John Jones, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is no Jowers in my book, and in the prisoner's book there is Jowers and no Jones—the name is not distinct in the secretary's book—the sum total in the two books that day agree—the amount paid over to the treasurer would be the same—on 26th November I find an entry in my book of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to John Jones, and in the prisoner's book there appears to be an alteration, something similar to the former one—the sum total in the two books is the same that day—that is the only difference between our books on that day—I do not think the prisoner paid in any money on his own</p>

Q.</hi> I see the accounts of 27th August were audited and found correct on 8th September? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—for that purpose the sub-treasurer's book and the secretary's book would be compared—if the name of Jones had then been in one book and Jo were in the other it would have been discovered—it might have been altered since—at that audit it would have been discovered that Jowers was in arrears, supposing the name had not been altered before then, and if it had been altered the auditors would have found out that the names did not correspond—the other account was audited and found correct on 26th November, 1862—that is put at the bottom of the page.</p>

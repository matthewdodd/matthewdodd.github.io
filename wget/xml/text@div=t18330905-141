            . I had the care of Francis Bignell's shop; on the 1st of August, the prisoner came into the shop and said she wanted to look at some leather shoes; I showed her some which she said would not do, and asked if we could make her some; I said, "Yes;" she said she would come in on the next day; I then saw a pair of boots under her shawl - and as she was going out I asked her for them; she said, "What boots;" I said,"Those under your shawl;" she then ran off with them - she had bought no boots, and she had none when she came in: these are the boots, I saw them picked up by

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did you have a hand in making them? A. No; they have the mark D on the bottom; it is done with a stamp which is kept for bespoke goods - these were the only pair in the shop that had been bespoke; they had only been from the makers two or three days; they were sent home and would not fit the lady - I did not see the prisoner take them, but I saw the place in the case where they had been; she dropped them opposite the shop, and I saw them picked up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you make them? A. No; I stamped them - I can swear to the workmanship of them - I can swear to these by their having an extra heel to them, which is not usual.</p>

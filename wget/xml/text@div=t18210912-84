            . I live in the Mile-end-road. On the 1st of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was going home on the <placeName id="t18210912-84-crimeloc473">Mile-end-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18210912-84-crimeloc473" type="placeName" value="Mile-end-road"></interp>

I was walking on the broad stone, and went on the gravel to let them pass, and all of a sudden, just as they were passing me, I received a violent blow on my right breast, which knocked me down, and was senseless for a minute or two. As soon as I recovered. I found one hand at the pocket where I keep my pocketbook, and another at my other pocket - I was laying on the ground. I was strong enough to keep my hand before me, to close my pocket. I pressed my arms together, which held the man's hand. I wanted to get up, and found one man holding me down by the collar behind; I found a hand very near my left-hand pocket, I dropped my left hand and took the man by the wrist. I then found he was attempting to put his hand in my right-hand pocket - this was not the person who was before feeling in my pockets, as I was holding those hands. On dropping my right hand to take hold of the hand that was going into my right-hand pocket, a knife, or some sharp instrument, cut off part of my fore finger - my nail, and part of my finger were cut off, and the surgeon cut off two or three bits of the bone when he dressed it. On receiving the cut, I cried out as loud as I could for assistance, and Mr. Watson, who I knew very well, came to my assistance - I knew his voice, and said,</p>
               <p>"Watson, for God's sake come and help me, for I am robbed, and likely to be murdered." I did not then know but what I was robbed; he assisted me, and one or more of them said,</p>
               <p>"Somebody has knocked this gentleman down, and we are helping him up." I said,</p>
               <p>"You are the very rogues and thieves that knocked me down, and attempted to take my life;" the men all got off - I do not know whether they walked or ran. I was taken to Mr. Langley's, where a surgeon dressed my wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you state how many men there were upon you - A. There were at least three. I do not know what it was that cut me. I was attempting to seize the hand, but do not think I had touched it when I was cut. I was sensible of the wound at the time, and called out</p>
               <p>"Murder," it gave me much pain.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had hold of the other hand, had you squeezed or twisted it - A. Yes, I twisted that man's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120050"></xptr>hand with my left hand, so as to make him feel. I do not recollect any thing being said. I am positive the prisoner is one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the opportunity of seeing him, so as to speak with confidence - A. I saw them at a little distance before they came up, and observed the prisoner particularly, and when I was on the ground, after Watson came to my assistance, I saw all four very plain, three of them I can positively swear to. When Watson came up, one laid on my legs, and another was by my side, with his hands at my side - I do not know whether he was on me or not. I cannot say what the prisoner did, whether he was the person who cut my hand, but he was one of them; three of them were about me when Watson came up, and the prisoner was one of those three; there were four together when they knocked me down. I do not know whether there were more than three when Watson came up. My hand is very bad now, and in a good deal of pain. It happened on Saturday, the 1st of September. I saw the prisoner in custody on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, and knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Was it a light night - A. It was star-light, and there were lights from the lamps; it is a very few doors on this side Charrington's brewhouse - there are some trees there, the lamps are parish lamps, there was one very near me, and the houses and shops were not shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not trees between the lamps and where you were knocked down - A. I am not certain. I was alarmed certainly. I never saw any of them before. I had no reason to remark one more than another. I saw the prisoner in custody at Lambeth-street office; he was pointed out to me, and I was asked if he was the man, I said, Yes. I went there to see whether he was one, the officer said he had got a suspicious man.</p>

            . I know the prosecuter. On the 1st of September, I was passing towards London, on the Mile-end-road, and about twenty yards off, I observed a bustle, I sprung forwards, and called out very loud "Hallo! what are you all about?"</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a bustle - A. Four persons, were attacking the prosecutor, and when I came up, I found him on his back, and two holding him by his feet or knees, and the other two at his arms, holding him down; the sudden manner of my coming up alarmed them, and the two who held his arms stood up - I then recognised Maunder as a neighbour - they were bending down before, and the other two were actually kneeling on him. My coming up gave him confidence - I told him not to be alarmed, as he was among his friends. I should have laid hold of the prisoner at the time, but one of the men or a gentleman came up, and said, I think the gentleman is tipsy, this took off my attention, and finding he was wounded, I lifted him up, and took him to Mr. Langley's, saw his wound, and fetched a medical gentleman. I am certain the prisoner was one of the men, he was at his left arm, and rose up when I came up; I had an excellent opportunity of noticing him - I looked him very hard in the face, and observed his features and dress, and have no doubt of him. Mr. Maunder called for help, and said he was robbed. I do not know whether it was the prisoner or a gentleman, who said he was tipsy. On the Friday, following I went with Partridge to the Earl of Effingham, public-house, Whitechapel, and took the prisoner - he was with fourteen or sixteen more; I follow the officer, he called on him to stand up, he stood up - I gave the officer, a nudge as a signal, and when we came out, I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The whole four were strangers to you - A. All of them. There was nothing particularly remarkable in the prisoner. I was more collected than I am now. I found the prosecutor on the gravel. There is a regular pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officer point out any particular man - A. He told one man to stand up; I do not know whether he mentioned a name. I remarked one other young man in the room. I have always been as positive to the prisoner, as I am now. None of them attempted to run away, nor was any resistance made - he came quietly. I wish to say that I am positive the prisoner is not the man who inflicted the wound, nor did he use any violence to the prosecutor while I was there. I am certain he is the man, who held the arm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutor appear in any respect intoxicated - A. No; he was agitated.</p>

            . I am beadle, of Whitechapel. On Friday night, Watson came with one or more gentleman to the watch-house, and described the prisoner's person to me; I said, it must be such a person, and in a few minutes, I should have him in custody - I went with him to the Earl of Effingham, public-house, he went into the room first - there were about sixteen sitting in a box; the prisoner was two from the door. I saw Watson look round, and I called to Tom, to stand up, as he was more out of view than the rest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You called to him by name - A. I said, Tom stand up, and he did, and nearly all the others stood up to. They said, let us all stand up. He made no resistance.</p>

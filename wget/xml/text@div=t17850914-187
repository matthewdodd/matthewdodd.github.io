               <p>Mr. Fielding, of counsel for the defendant. My Lord, I am sure you will not be surprized, in a case of this kind, that I should wish all the witnesses to retire before Mr. Morgan opens.</p>
               <p>Court. Let lists of witnesses, except to character, or those that are to prove what passed in Court, be given to each party, and let them all go out of Court; there can hardly be a subject that requires a more serious and solemn investigation for the security of the subject on the one hand, and the safety of the defendant on the other.</p>

            ; upon that trial, which was for a highway robbery, there was not any witness to the fact of the robbery but the prosecutor himself; there was no other material evidence obtained on the trial but that which was given by Harvey, and that that was material, you will in a few moments, I think, be properly convinced: fear and slight are in general pretty certain signs of guilt; and supposing what the defendant swore on that trial is false, he knew the consequences of his evidence by charging Newberry with having exhibited those two signs of guilt; after stating that he had been to the place, and came back, being asked if he had found either of the prisoners, he answered thus;</p>
               <p>"No; I</p>
               <p>"went back to Limehouse-corner between</p>
               <p>"fifty and sixty yards, where the affair</p>
               <p>"happened, and went into a public house,</p>
               <p>"and I looked round the taproom, and</p>
               <p>"there was the prisoner Peter; but I not</p>
               <p>"knowing him, he passed me as I was</p>
               <p>"drinking a glass at the bar, and he went</p>

               <p>"into the street, and the prosecutor was</p>
               <p>"leaning over the post at the corner of</p>
               <p>"the street, facing the public house, and</p>
               <p>"he called out constable, constable, there</p>
               <p>"is Peter, there he runs; I ran after him</p>
               <p>"directly, and he ran through a narrow</p>
               <p>"passage out of Fore-street into Ropemakers-field;</p>
               <p>"he kept running on, but</p>
               <p>"I lost sight of him; then he went into</p>
               <p>"a little alley, but I took him about ten</p>
               <p>"yards from his lodgings, where I had</p>
               <p>"been to search for him; the prosecutor</p>
               <p>"and the man who called me to his assistance</p>
               <p>"were leaning on the nosil of a</p>
               <p>"pump; the prosecutor was bleeding; I</p>
               <p>"brought the prisoner Peter to him, and</p>
               <p>"said, is this the man you want? he said,</p>
               <p>"this is Peter, and this is the man that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140211"></xptr> " took me by the throat; and I took him</p>
               <p>"away immediately, and put him in the</p>
               <p>"cage." After reading the evidence, I need not repeat the observation,</p>
               <p>'that it</p>
               <p>'was very material?' I shall only observe, that no other evidence respecting Newberry was given but by the prosecutor that any ways affected him. Gentlemen, upon the evidence, I may say of these two men, the prosecutor and the defendant, both the prisoners were convicted: it being afterwards heard by a variety of people, who knew the prisoners, what evidence had been given at the Old Bailey; they insisted upon it that the evidence of both the prosecutor and Harvey in the most material parts were false: an investigation took place, I believe some affidavits were procured, and, if I am not misinstructed, laid before the Recorder, he inquired into the circumstances, and his humanity induced him to procure a respite for these two convicts the day before the day appointed for their execution; the matter afterwards underwent an investigation before the King in Council, and in a fortnight a pardon was issued for the two men. Gentlemen, as this is a prosecution instituted merely for public justice, I shall not make any observations to inflame your passions, or to mislead your judgments, I shall content myself in submitting to you simply, and in as plain a manner as I can, the evidence I mean to produce to you on this occasion. I understand the defendant means to call witnesses, if he does, and I think it necessary and proper, I may trouble you with a few observations on that evidence. Gentlemen, I have no wish on this occasion but that justice should take place; this poor man,

            ; Goodman got his living that way; he had been at work all day, and just before the present defendant, and the said soldier, who alledged he had been robbed were in search of Newberry, Newberry had been out, and was returning home, and a person met him, that I shall call as a witness, and told him there were the old soldier and the defendant Harvey, whom they knew to be a kind of constable, pretty active in taking thieves, and they advised him not to go home; his answer was, I have done no harm, I am not afraid of any one, I certainly will go home: the witness went with him to his lodgings, and saw him go in, and when the prisoner entered the lodgings, the old soldier and Harvey were up stairs searching for Newberry; on his coming in, a woman called to him, and told him here is Newberry; Newberry is come in; upon which the old soldier and Harvey came down stairs, and in the lodgings within the house took Newberry into custody. I am instructed, and shall call another witness, who advised the man not to go home, and his answer will be proved by four or five, if not more, witnesses, who were all present at the time of the caption of Newberry, and they will, upon their oaths, tell you, that Newberry had been taken in the lodgings, and consequently had never been guilty of these two great signs of guilt, fear and flight. Gentlemen, if upon the evidence you should be satisfied, that what the defendant has sworn is false; if you should be convinced that what my witnesses say is true, it will then become your duty to convict the defendant of the crime imputed to him; but if you have any doubt, in that case you will acquit him: I shall press it in no manner, I shall make no observations without I find it absolutely necessary.</p>

               <p>When you came back with Newberry, how long was that after Harvey had been the first time to the house? - I cannot tell, indeed, how long.</p>
               <p>Do you know what public house they went to? - Yes, they went to the Pink.</p>
               <p>Did you see them go into the Pink? - Yes, Sir, and my father went with him; I did not see my father and them go into the Pink.</p>
               <p>How far is the Pink from your house? - It goes down a turning close by our house.</p>
               <p>How far altogether may it be from your house? - I believe it may be twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Then I think you say you met Peter about the length of this court from your own door? - Yes, Sir, in Ropemakers fields.</p>
               <p>You met him and told him that these people had been looking after him? - Yes, and he said he had done no harm, and he would come home; I was out of sight of my own door; our door does not look towards Ropemakers fields, because the ruins are broad; I went back directly with Peter, I was only gone the time I should be walking the length of this court and back again, after that we came home again.</p>
               <p>Then though your father and mother and Lockell had gone to the Pink public house, yet they had made such haste that they had got back again, and had got up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your father up stairs then? - Yes, they were coming down and they met Peter in the lower room, and took hold of him, there is no passage, we go through the lower room to the stairs; we all knew he was gone to the sawyers.</p>

               <p>Then your father took them to the Pink on purpose to take them out of the way? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Where was this boy when Harvey and Lockell first knocked at your door? - He was up stairs binding of wood; the boy was up stairs from that time to the second time that Mr. Harvey came; my wife called me down when they came; I went with them to the Pink, when I came back again I found my boy in the same room.</p>

               <p>But how far did he go? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Now how long was this before somebody said, here is Peter? - It was a little before that time that the boy went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the boy did not go down stairs till after the people called out here is Peter? - Oh yes, he was down before.</p>
               <p>How long did the boy go down before the people called out here is Peter? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Where was the boy when Peter came in? - He was along with Peter; I stood upon the stairs and saw him.</p>
               <p>Any person standing on the outside of the street-door might have seen all the people in the passage? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then, that person might have seen your son as well as Newberry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before that moment had you seen him? - Five or six minutes; I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Then your son was lost to your sight for about five minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you say that you went first with Harvey and Lockell to the public house to look for Peter? - Yes, I left him there, and I came back again, and he was there.</p>

               <p>Was the door shut or open? - I was up a pair of stairs, I cannot be positive as to that, he clapped his hand to the jam of the door, and stood a trifle of time, a minute or a minute and a half, and then he went into the house, and as I understood the soldier and Harvey, they endeavoured to take him to the Compter, but they all three came out together in a little space of time.</p>

               <p>When was it that the attorney or anybody in his business applied to you to come here? - I will tell you Sir, I was in bed, when I was sent to first, and I was called out to a job as I thought, when I went to the house where this attorney was, as I understood to be his attorney, and Mr. I do not know his name, who keeps the public-house, served me with a subpoenea, and gave me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Any thing to drink? - Yes, there was three pots of beer, this is three weeks ago, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was three weeks ago the first time that was you spoke to? - I never was spoke to, nor never had any imitation about this business.</p>
               <p>Do you commonly wear a white frock? - In general.</p>
               <p>You saw Newberry in the custody of Harvey in the streets? - I saw him in the street before he was in custody, and afterwards.</p>
               <p>What should have led you to the window then? - There was more noise before than there was after, he was in custody, there was an uproar about a robbery, that led me to the window, the man said he wanted his money.</p>
               <p>Court. That was publickly made a noise of about the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Newberry come home alone, or did anybody come home along with him? - I saw nobody come home along with him, but I saw him, I know him perfectly well, the street was wide to one person as well as to another.</p>
               <p>Did you see anybody go into the house along with Newberry? - No, Sir, he went in voluntarily of his own accord, as I could observe, I saw him plainly go in.</p>

Gentlemen, although I stand here an advocate for Harvey, and he has a right to expect the exert on of my feeble abilities; yet I go with the learned Judge who tried this cause, in all the observations I have heard him make on the crime of perjury: I perfectly agree that there is nor a crime more deserving punishment; that if committed in the extent suggested here, punishment should fall on the wretch without the accompanying commisseration of any one soul; for if it be true that the man standing before you has committed a wilful and corrupt perjury, on the trial of two men for their lives, my desire is that he should be punished with the utmost severity; at the same time you will be cautious of letting that indignation set aside the weight of the evidence necessary to criminate the person that you have before you: Gentlemen, I cannot say I feel the task upon me to-day of vindicating the defendant an arduous one; because added to the consciousness that I persuaded myself of before I came into the Court, of Mr. Harvey's innocence, I now am more and more confirmed of the propriety of that persuasion from the evidence that has been laid before you: Gentlemen, you know very well that to constitute the crime of perjury, the will must go with the action, and there must be a corrupt motive all through; and whereever therefore that crime is imputed to a man, you will necessarily enquire into the motive: Now what can be the motive of Mr. Harvey for the commission of this crime? Gentlemen, it is necessary for me to state to you a little more at large the nature of this trial, and the reason of Mr. Harvey's being now prosecuted for this as a perjury at the Old Bailey: two men, foreigners, Newberry and Iverson, were tried for a supposed robbery, committed on a man of the name of Lockell; Lockell, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140228"></xptr> that trial was the prosecutor, and the man before you was the other witness; and my learned friend, with some little ingenuity I must say, introduced that circumstance to you, pointing where the evidence of Mr. Harvey became material, for he seems to suppose that you will be persuaded of Mr. Harvey's being conscious of such materiality of his evidence, when he told you that the materiality of the evidence depended on the circumstance of flight; if he could have established in proof a fabricated lye or falsehood, that would have been a different matter from what you have now to consider; but let not the guilt of the prosecutor Lockell lay at the door of Mr. Harvey; if Lockell was brought to justice, then every man would be satisfied and pleased with the verdict, but there is not the least idea, it is not insinuated that there is any privity at all between Harvey and Lockell, or that Harvey spoke to any other circumstance than merely the apprehension of these two men. Then, gentlemen, permit me to ask you, what could have induced Harvey to go a little beyond the truth in his evidence on this prosecution? I will tell you, because it is the only evidence that can be suggested, in hopes of gaining a part of the reward on their conviction; now, this is the circumstance they are to make out, that he, being apprised of the effect of a flight being given in evidence, had confined his perjury to that idea; trusting to that idea having the effect of convicting the two men at the bar. Gentlemen, that you may clearly understand the nature of this case, let me tell you the story of Mr. Harvey; he was the constable of Limehouse, and the evening, when this robbery was committed, about seven in the month of January, it was dark, he was at that time at home in his house, he was called out by the alarm of a robbery that had been committed; the person supposed to be robbed was very near at hand, and he saw him instantly: upon his coming up to him he told him that he knew the men that had perpetrated the crime, that one was Peter, and the other was Will; that he knew where Peter lodged, and in consequence of this information Harvey went to the house of Peter; now, part of this evidence, that you have heard in support of this prosecution is true, for it hardly ever will be the case, that witnesses will come before a court with a story that will be false throughout; Harvey went with this man to the house of Peter, he knocked; he was answered by a woman from above, and he got into the house; Peter was not to be found there; then Harvey went away; he went to a public house; he had not an idea of missing in this public house the person he went to look for, but as he was drinking a glass of liquor at the bar, Lockell, the prosecutor, from without, called out to him, constable, constable, there goes Peter; there had been a man that left the house merely on the arrival of Harvey, whether it was or was not Peter, I am not able to produce to you, more than the assertion of Harvey; Harvey thinks that man was the person; Lockell calling out to him, he necessarily followed; a chace took place; some times he had him in view, and some times he lost sight of him, but as the man was going towards the house of Goodman, Harvey took hold of him; Harvey's evidence say this, that he took the prisoner Newberry within ten yards of his door, but the evidence of the witnesses in opposition to this say, that Mr. Harvey did not take Newberry within ten yards of the door, but in the very house; now, how could it have entered into the mind of the man before you, that supposing there was a difference, supposing the fact to be, (which I deny) that he was taken in the house, and that Harvey had said he took him within ten yards of the door, could it have suggested itself to a mind like his, that any materiality would have depended on that part of his testimony? Does it strike you so? Here are two or three persons committing a robbery, and immediately one of them is pursued, not the least doubt of the person, the prosecutor swearing positively to his having committed the crime, and by he bye, suppose I say one word, as it is fair here, upon the supposed guilt of these women<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140229"></xptr> that are now luckily pardoned; if the evidence of Lockell or his story had gone to complain of one man only as taking this property, I should have thought it fabricated, but when Lockell speaks of two men doing it, either of whom might have proved himself at a different place, I should presume there is a strong reason to suppose Lockell is not hasty in his opinion of these two men; his property was not much that he lost; he was extremely ill used; he was bleeding; they call you evidence to that, and that little boy said his face seemed as if it had been scratched by women; that circumstance convinced me that I had very little to expect from the ingenuousness of a boy so young; he says he is eighteen, perhaps he may, I am sure he possesses the craft of eighteen; but, however, now to return to the situation of Mr. Harvey: in taking this man within ten doors, what could have induced Harvey to have said more to the Court than that he took the man in custody; could it have appeared to him to be a material distinction, whether he had taken him within ten yards or ten feet, or in the house? But I am to call witnesses to you in support of that story that Mr. Harvey has told, and as to the witnesses on the part of the prosecution, I would recount their contradictions, if it was not that the extreme ingenuity of the learned Recorder will, I am sure, amply supply that defect; certain I am, however, that the boy is materially contradicted by the father; certain I am that the boy is materially contradicted by Mrs. Milledge, and it seems to me as if the only evidence I had to apprehend the least possibility of danger from was the evidence of Mrs. Brookes; for, I rely entirely, as to the other witnesses, on the observations which I am sure will be made by the learned Recorder. Mrs. Brookes standing up here, seeing her called on their part, I thought her a decent looking woman, coming with a child in her arms, I thought there would be more regard to truth; and altho' I observed confusion, I thought it did not signify: but, gentlemen, when I call your attention to the circumstance of the case, I am bold to say that her evidence cannot be true, if much of that evidence which has preceded it be true; therefore, wherever there are contradictions as they cannot be both true, the safer way I take it, is to reject such evidence entirely; if the evidence of Goodman be true, the evidence of Brookes is not true; if Brookes's is true, Goodman's is not true; the safer way, and that which has always been taken, as I conceive, by every Jury, is, to reject that testimony entirely; and therefore when I recur to this, that Harvey acted merely in his duty, and if he is here prosecuted without great foundation, deserves the compassion of every man in Court; when I say he has interfered only in his duty, and there cannot be any positive motive assigned to him, except that one of the reward; and when you take into your consideration the probability which yet remains of this robbery's being committed in fact; I say you will attend carefully to the evidence; I say you will dispassionately attend, never presuming guilt, always intending innocence, carefull to give weight to the evidence laid before you, but not to let it hastily involve a man in guilt. On the other side, the evidence I shall lay before you on the part of Harvey will be extremely satisfactory as to the beginning of this business; afterwards I shall lay before you in evidence, a character, which I am sure ought to have, in a case like this, the first weight; not that it will be necessary as I think for your verdict, but that he may return with honour and credit to his neighbourhood. I have the satisfaction of seeing a prosecution like this fairly contradicted and reprobated. The Recorder has with great liberality and ingenuity investigated this business, and he is still to lay before you the result of that testimony; I persuade myself that an equal attention will be paid to our witnesses, and I wish it should; if any of my witnesses should deserve a severity of treatment in cross examination, or if there is any suspicion of their veracity, I wish they may go under every possible trial; but if you think so, the acquittal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140230"></xptr> of Mr. Harvey may perhaps lead to some investigation of the author of this business.</p>

               <p>Court. Give an exact account of all you heard and saw? - I know nothing at all of it, but that I saw him take a man in Vine-street; I recollect nothing that I heard besides.</p>

               <p>Was it near the house? - No, it was near a pump.</p>
               <p>Did not your curiosity carry you a little further than that? - No Sir, my business called me away.</p>
               <p>Were there many people about in the street? - There might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you know Newberry? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know his person? - It was dark, he came to our house three days after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Once in your lifetime you saw Mr. Harvey take up a man in Vine-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let me pay you the same compliment my learned friend has paid most of our witnesses; where did they pick you up for a witness, you are a notable one? - I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>When? - The 20th of September.</p>
               <p>Who first applied to you? - The subpoenea was brought to me, I was surprised.</p>
               <p>I rather supect that, you know that is no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140231"></xptr> answer to my question; who first applied to you to be a witness for Mr Harvey; - I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon that oath that you have taken, who first applied to you to be a witness for Harvey? - No body at all.</p>
               <p>Who subpoenaed you? - A boy brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that before that you had not talked to anybody on this subject? - No, Sir, nobody at all had advised me on the subject.</p>
               <p>Did I ask you about advice? - Nobody at all talked to me, I did not tell any body at all, I was not applied to at all to be a witness.</p>
               <p>You have sense enough to answer the question, do you mean to state to the Jury, that without anybody having applied to you, and without your having applied to any body, you are come to be a witness for Harvey? - I told no story, that is the true state of the case.</p>
               <p>Court. Do attend a little to the nature of the question, it is not whether anybody made any improper application to you to be a witness, but the meaning of the gentleman's question is this, how came Harvey or anybody concerned for Harvey to know that you could say anything upon this subject? - I do not know, I very likely may have said so, upon my honour I cannot tell you, I never troubled my head about the business, Mr, Harvey might have seen me there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did not you see him there? - I saw him, but I do not know whether he saw me or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Cannot you fix the time when you saw this? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What month was it in? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Is it a twelve-month ago, or is it two years ago? - I am sure I cannot tell you, I dare say it is not two years ago, but I cannot say how long ago it is.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell no nearer than that, can you tell whether it is seven years or a week? - I cannot say, there was a piece of work or a noise in the street on that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Then your evidence goes for nothing at all.</p>
               <p>What was the noise about? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you hear anything about it? - It was not so long ago as seven years, but I cannot say when it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Where do you live, young woman? - In Fore-street, Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Who with? - With my father and mother.</p>
               <p>What countryman is your father? - He is a Dane.</p>
               <p>Was your father willing you should come here to day? - Yes, if he had not I suppose I should not have come.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Harvey that very evening, that the very man he afterwards took hold off, was Peter? - Me! no, Sir. I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you call God to witness, girl? - I did not, no, I did not, I would not wish to tell a story for any man living.</p>

               <p>Court. You have heard the oath, it is to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; now if you answer to any question, and say you do not know it when you do, it is perjury? - I say, I do not know what that gentleman asked me.</p>
               <p>Was this that you saw three days ago, or three years? - I am very sensible it is more than three days.</p>
               <p>Was it so much as three years? - I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Was it two years? - Upon my honour I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath are not you sure it was less than two years ago? - I do not take my oath at all about it.</p>
               <p>But you must take your oath upon it, are not you sure that it was within these two years? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>If you do know, I only tell you that you are perjured, and liable to be punished? - But I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Go about your business.</p>

               <p>How came you to take such particular notice of it? - Because it was on Wednesday night, and my master was at his lodge, a freemason's lodge, they meet once a month.</p>

               <p>How far from the old man that was leaning on the nosil of the pump? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had she any conversation with the old man? - Not that I have heard.</p>
               <p>Newberry was standing still when the young woman pointed him out? - He was standing still, and Harvey came directly and took him.</p>
               <p>She and the young man were close together, she and Peter, and she told Harvey that was Peter, and he took him directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had they been talking together, the old man and her? - No.</p>
               <p>Now tell me how this young woman came to know that Harvey wanted Peter? - I do not know.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>What is the estimate of Mr. Harvey's honesty? - A very good one.</p>
               <p>Harvey. I have a great many more witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly, as far as evidence has weight, we are to take this man's character to be a very good one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Gentleman, I shall only take up two minutes of your time; on behalf of the prosecution seven witnesses have been called, who have sworn positively to the man's being taken within the house, and that into that house he went a volunteer; some contradictions have arisen, not very necessary for me to repeat, as the Recorder will make his observations very attentively and accurately, as he always does, which will (as they ought) have much more weight with him than any observations that can be made by me; only one observation strikes me, which is, that though several contradictions relative to trifling circumstances have arisen in the course of the evidence, they might be the effect of want of memory, not of design: after having said that, let me advert to the evidence that has been called by the defendant, his character is as good as can be; however there are times when a man forfeits a good character; and, permit me to observe, that the evidence which he has called by way of defence amounts to nothing; recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140234"></xptr> in the first place, the evidence that he gave on the trial; now the evidence of the master of the publichouse is this, that he and Harvey walked to the door together, and I take it that had Peter been there, it was impossible but he must have seen him pass by him; whereas the master tells you, that he saw this man, who he says Harvey took on the other side of the way; and his other witnesses flatly contradict each other: Gentlemen, this is the case requiring a great deal of your cool deliberation which I am sure you will give it, if you are satisfied that the prisoner is not guilty, you will acquit him; if you are clearly convinced of his guilt, you must be under a necessity of convicting him.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this trial has taken up a great deal of your time and and attention; but not one moment longer than justice requires; for you have been called upon this indictment to decide upon as important an enquiry as can well come before a Jury and Court of Justice: the prisoner is indicted for perjury; a crime in itself, and under all the circumstances, where it is wilfully and intentionally committed, with a corrupt intention, of very great magnitude; a crime that cuts up by the roots the only bond of confidence that can subsist between man and man, and the only security that we can have for the due administration of justice both between party and party, and between the public and those that are accused of the crimes; but if a perjury of itself, is a crime of such magnitude, when we consider the circumstances under which the present defendant stands charged with that crime it raises it to a height still greater; for the perjury that is charged against the defendant, is stated to have been by him committed upon the trial of two men for a capital felony, and the evidence given against these men, is charged to be false, and to have been knowingly and corruptly given; and therefore if that is true, the whole catalogue of crimes does not contain one of greater enormity, for though, in the denomination of law, such an evidence, if the event of it should be to take away the life of an innocent person, does not come under the legal description of murder: yet, in point of malignity, it seems to be a murder of the foulest die. The question therefore for you to decide this day is, whether the defendant has in defiance of the laws of God and man, committed in the face of his country, knowingly and corruptly, a perjury, with a view to take away the lives of two innocent persons; or whether an innocent man having appeared for the sake of public justice on a former occasion, stands charged with a crime of so much enormity: you therefore will not grudge your time and attention in this enquiry; it has been stated to you in the opening of this business, that from persuasion of the falsehood of the evidence given on the trial of two men, Newberry and Iverson, they have since, upon great deliberation, and with the intervention of those concerned in a judicial capacity, obtained the King's pardon for the offence: the first part of my duty therefore is to tell you that you ought to lay that out of the question; and not to let it make the smallest impression on your minds, for there might be just and wise reasons for that pardon, without the smallest imputation on the truth perhaps of all the witnesses, but certainly of Harvey's testimony; for though his evidence was necessary, yet the truth of that evidence is perfectly consistent with the innocence of both the prisoners; and that that circumstance may be wholly erased from your minds, I think it right to let you know that a conviction of truth or falsehood of Harvey's evidence never came under consideration, when that pardon was the subject of deliberation, but it arises from circumstances in which the account given by Lockell, with respect to himself and his own situation at the time, threw such a suspicion on his testimony, that it was thought unsafe to run the risque of executing two men on the evidence of a single witness, who stood impeached and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140235"></xptr> contradicted: you, gentlemen, are called here to decide, whether the defendant has sworn falsely in the evidence he gave on the trial, and if he did, whether it was done with a corrupt intention: the latter question, which is always the material one to constitute the crime of perjury, will depend on your attention to the nature of the cause, and of the evidence given, and I will therefore state to you, from the indictment, the evidence which Harvey has now been proved to have given on the trial of Newberry and Iverson.</p>
               <p>(Here the learned Judge repeated the evidence as read by the Short-hand Writer.)</p>
               <p>Now, it is manifest, that the effect of this evidence at the time was to shew a consciousness of guilt in Newberry, and to confirm the testimony of Lockell, for the sum of the evidence of Harvey was, that when he went in quest of Newberry, Newberry slipt out of the public house when he saw the prosecutor come in, and that he actually ran away from him, and escaped, and that he actually took him at some small distance from his lodgings; the effect of that evidence was to shew, that Newberry fled from justice, which is always considered as a circumstance of guilt; then the indictment charges that the evidence was false; that he did not run after him at all, nor did he run away; that he did not keep running, or go into a little alley; and that he did not take Peter about ten yards from his lodgings, but, in fact, he did take him in custody immediately on his coming into his lodgings; now, the evidence given by Harvey on the trial being material in the light I have stated to you, if you believe it to be false, it is difficult to suppose that he could have been mistaken, for it was a fact within his own knowledge, and which it was his particular duty as a constable to attend to, therefore if it was false, and if, instead of pursuing him, and taking him in the street, he never, in fact, pursued him, but took him in his lodgings; Harvey must have known it was false, and if he did, I believe you will not find much difficulty in concluding, that a person, who knowingly gives false evidence against a prisoner, must necessarily do it with an evil and corrupt intention: the principal question therefore for you to decide in this case seems to be, whether the evidence given by Harvey upon this trial was true or false; for if false, the nature of it seems to leave very little room to doubt tha t Harvey must know it, and give it with a corrupt intention; but if it was true, he is an innocent man: the principal question is therefore this, and that upon which the present trial turns, whether you believe, on the whole of the evidence, that he took him in the street, or that he took him in his lodgings? for the story told on the part of the present prosecution certainly does, instead of shewing the consciousness of guilt in Newberry, shew the direct contrary; that Harvey being searching for him at his lodgings, he went home to those lodgings voluntarily, into the very hands of the people that were in quest of him; and that, in that very house, Harvey being in quest of him, took him; a great number of witnesses has been called, most of whom have positively swore to the fact, that Harvey did take Newberry in his lodgings, and not elsewhere; but in swearing to that fact, they have been called upon to state the circumstances; and it is one of the principal advantages in the mode of administering justice in this country, that the examinations of the witnesses are publicly conducted in the presence of the parties themselves, their counsel and agents, as well as the courts of justice, so than an opportunity is given of not resting satisfied with swearing merely to a fact, which, if the depositions were taken in writing, he might do, but there is an opportunity of enquiring into all the cases attending that fact, in order both to judge of the probability and consistency, and to compare that testimony with those circumstances, and with the evidence of other witnesses examined to the same fact; and it is not because one or two, or ten witnesses, positively swear to a particular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140236"></xptr> fact, that a Jury are bound to rely on that evidence, on the contrary, they are called upon to exercise their own understanding, and apply it, and fist out the truth by the comparison of the testimony of the different witnesses, and by an attentive consideration of the evidence that has been related: you will therefore judge for yourselves upon the whole, which of the two facts you believe, to wit, that this man, Newberry, was taken in his lodgings or in the street. The first witness called is

            , a young looking lad, and his evidence is, that Lockell and Harvey came to the door of his father's house, and knocked at the door; that his mother opened the window, and asked what was the matter; and upon their telling her they wanted Peter, but not what for, she came down, and opened the door for them, and that after going into the house, they went away again; and that when they did go away he himself knowing where Peter was gone to, went to tell him that these people had been after him to take him up, and to advise him to keep out of the way, that he met Newberry a short way from the house and he gave him that advice, but he trusting in his own innocence would go home; the witness went home with him, Lockell and Harvey were returned to the house, and took Newberry as soon as he came into the house, so that by his account they were twice in the house, and had gone away in the intermediate time, and he had taken the opportunity to go and apprize Newberry that they were in pursuit of him; in order to fist the matter more fully, he was much further cross examined, and the first enquiry will be how far the account he gave on his first examination is confirmed or rendered probable by his own testimony on cross-examination; the next enquiry will be how far it is consistent with or contradictory to the evidence of the other witnesses, on the part of the prosecution, he said the door of the house was quite open, and added, their door always stood always open; he describes himself as going out to look for Peter, and his meeting him within not more than the length of this Court off his own door, they not stopping or going anywhere else, but returning directly back, but he says that Harvey and Lockell came twice, and that they went after the first search to a public house, and were come down again and near the bottom of the stairs when he came back with

            ; now it is scarcely possible that this account can in all these circumstances be correctly true, for if they came twice, and went up stairs with a view of searching for them, and his father went with them to the public house their enquiries there, their return, their going up stairs again to make a second search, and coming down again, all must have passed according to his account, within the time that the witness would be walking the length of this Court: when he first said the door stood always open, I dare say it would not suggest to your minds that it was latched, and if it stood always open Lockell must have known it, and therefore would not knock at a door which he knew was always open. The evidence of Stones does not very materially differ from the account given by the boy, he speaks only to the last time of Lockell and Harvey going into the house, he rather increases the time, he says on his cross-examination that Peter came home by himself, and shoved the door open with his left hand; Goodman the father swears that the boy was up stairs till he came back from the Pink, and then he went down stairs, and was absent a few minutes; it is very remarkable that the evidence of the father, whose knowledge if they were relating a true fact, would be more likely to coincide with the son than other witnesses, is more directly contrary to him than any other witness, he describes the time between the first and second search very considerable, he makes it from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes between the first time of their coming and the time of their apprehending Newberry; but he directly contradicts the evidence of the boy. The story therefore of the father and the boy cannot both be true: by the account of Reynolds,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140237"></xptr> instead of their coming and enquiring for Peter without alarming the house, there was an uproar about a robbery, the man talked about his money, so that the idea suggested by his evidence, and that of the father and the son, who swore he only guessed they wanted Peter, is extremely different. The boy mentioned nothing of Peter's stopping at the side of the door to listen; Brookes also contradicts the boy; the boy says they were upon the stairs near the bottom of the stairs, when he and Newberry went in, and that he saw them the moment he came to the door; the other witness, Mr. Stones, says, they were in the lower room, and this Mrs. Brooks says they were quite upstairs out of sight when Peter came, and that they did not come down stairs till Harvey was called down; another important contradiction is, that if these men came but once, the whole story told by the boy and the father, which is so contradictory in every other respect, must be a fabrication as to the twice coming; here are seven witnesses on the part of the prosecution, who all positively swear, that the man was taken in the house, but in relating the circumstances under which he was taken, it is hardly possible to conceive greater variety in the examination of witnesses, or in the different parts of the examination of the same witnesses. You are to judge whether you think these contradictions could occur in a story that was absolutely true, whether they arise from witnesses speaking to different facts, or whether they arise from witnesses coming to speak one fact, and not being prepared for questions that they have been forced to answer, you will judge. The general observation is with respect to the propriety of the whole story, whether it is likely that this man Lockell, in search of a man, truly or falsely, that he said had robbed him, should go and knock at a door he knew was open. No observation can arise against the defendant from the evidence of

            , but if it did make any impression, it must be the other way; there are witnesses who are called to confirm the evidence originally given by Harvey at the Old Bailey; you are to judge whether you think it likely that a man of that character, for the mere hope of sharing in the reward of blood, should have been wilfully guilty of such a crime; you will take the whole into your consideration; you will take the positive evidence and the contradiction, and whether that is to be imputed to the defect of memory or to fabrication; if you are satisfied that this is not a story against the defendant, but that in point of fact the man was really taken in the house notwithstanding all the contradictions of their evidence; in that case it is a crime of an enormous magnitude, and loudly calls for punishment. If on the other hand, you think that the circumstances of the case, together with the evidence that has been called in support of the testimony of the defendant, though not so numerous as the witnesses for the prosecution, yet tell a story more probable and consistent in itself, and without those contradictions which occur in the evidence for the prosecution, in that case you will find a satisfaction in acquitting the defendant, and restoring him to that credit which he has formerly enjoyed, and it is to be sure a most painful consideration, on the one hand, that a man of an extraordinary character should have been for a very small temptation, guilty of a crime of the blackest die; or that on the other hand, a most wicked conspiracy has been framed falsely to accuse him of that offence.</p>

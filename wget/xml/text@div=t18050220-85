               <p>Q. Then the person who drew up this indictment ought not to put them all in one charge, because the prisoner does not know how to defend himself, therefore, we suffer no more than one transaction in one indictment; if you can separate one, which you please, you have the choice of all the different articles; the one you can best bring home to the prisoner? - A. I will take the 11 s. 3 d. - the 6 s. 3 d. and 5 s. were both on the 23d of January.</p>

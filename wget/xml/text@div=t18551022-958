                  </hi>. I am a dairy man and boarding house keeper, in Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-Grand. The prisoner was a daily servant to me for fifteen or eighteen months—she was accustomed to carry the milk to the customers, and collect the money, and pay it to me or my wife—I had a foreign silver coin, which I had had by me since 1852—I gave it to my wife on Tuesday, 9th Aug.—on the next day I came in to tea, and I observed my wife was confused—I asked her the reason, and she said to the prisoner, "Kitty, show Mr. Toogood that piece of coin"—she put it down on the table—I took it up, and said to the prisoner, "How did you come by this? "—she said she had taken it of a customer—I said, "Who?" she said, "Either Coney's, the Butler's Head Tavern, or at the butcher's in Newgate-market"—I said, "You know you have told me a lie, and it is not the first"—I got up from tea, and went to those two persons that she had named—I saw them—1 came back to my own house, and charged the prisoner with robbing me—I told her that she had told me a falsehood, that neither of the parties she had named had given her that piece of coin, and she must have stolen it out of the writing desk, and I would give her into custody—I sent for a policeman, I told her before the policeman that if she would go with me and the policeman, and search her boxes, if</p>

               <p>there was nothing belonging to me there, I would forgive her about the coin, but she refused to do so, and I gave her into custody—I did not know where she lodged—I had asked her, but she would not tell me—she was taken to the station, and a key was found on her by some female, but I was not present when she was searched—the searcher produced the key, and said in the prisoner's presence that she had found it in her pocket—the inspector told the policeman to go home with her—they went, and I followed—the prisoner went to the back of Holborn, and to one place and another, and at last she said she did not know where she lived, and if we bothered her for a month she should not know where she lived—at length it occurred to me that some time ago she spoke about a murder having been committed in the house she lived in—I went back to the station, and told the officers—they then referred to their book, and found that it was in Three Diamond-court—she was living there with her sister—I went to the room with the officer—I found her sister there, with sixteen or seventeen men and women—the prisoner was then in the station—we examined the room, and found a linen sheet and various other articles in a box, which the key fitted that was found on the prisoner—amongst other things was a piece of Irish linen, that was cut off a piece that was in Mrs. Too good's bedroom—the two edges correspond exactly—this sheet has my name in full length on it—this other sheet was on the bed—I believe it is not marked—here is a child's frock, a hair brush, and other things—as far as I know, these things were never given to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I know this coin, my husband gave it to me on 9th Oct.—I placed it in my daughter's writing desk—it was not locked—it was kept in the parlour—that is a room to which the prisoner occasionally had access as my servant—on a day in Oct. the prisoner accounted to me for the money for the milk, she paid me this coin for a shilling—I recognised it as the one I had put in the writing desk—I said to her, "Where did you get this coin? I think it is mine"—she said, "Oh, dear, it can't be yours, I have taken it from Coney's, the Butler's Head, or from somebody in Newgate Market"—I said, "I think it is mine, I am sure it is mine, I am certain"—she seemed very much confused, and did not wish me to say anything about it, and said that she would get it changed next day—I said if I could not</p>

               <p>find mine I should tell about it—I went to the writing desk to look for mine, it was gone—I went into the parlour where Mr. Toogood was, and showed this to him—he went to Mr. Coney's, and the other place she had mentioned—he came back, and said they had not given it her—the prisoner then said she would tell me all about it, if I would not say anything more—she said she had taken it off my table in the morning, while I was up stairs—I said she could not have done that, she must have taken it from the writing desk—Mr. Toogood said, if she would let him look in her box, and there was nothing there belonging to us, we would forgive her about this coin—she said that she had got the key of her box, and she defied us looking in her box—I afterwards saw some things which were said to be found at her lodging—this piece of linen was in my house—the policeman brought a piece which fitted it exactly—these cuffs are my daughter's, this sheet is my hus<lb></lb>band's and these other things—I never gave them to the prisoner, nor allowed her to take them.</p>

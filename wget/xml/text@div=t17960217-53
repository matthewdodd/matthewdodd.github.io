               <p>Q. Who was that John Henry Gade signed by? - A. The prisoner at the bar. I cannot be positive who was the Bank clerk that attended the transfer, but I think it was Mr. Bicknell; at the time of the transfer, there was an observation made upon the name of the person who signed it, that there were two f s put instead of one name, upon which, the prisoner was informed, that as there was a mistake in the transfer of the name, there must be an affidavit made, to prove him to be one and the same person; I informed him, that he must go with me to the clerk who usually makes out affidavits, but he was not there; I desired him to wait till I came to him again; and when I returned, they had absconded.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had absconded? - A. The prisoner, and the young man be brought with him to represent Harrison.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was it that signed the name of William Harrisson in this way to this transfer? - A. I cannot say who it was; it was a young man that he represented to be

               <p>Q. Every thing upon the transfer, so far as the transfer was concerned, was complete? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did you ever see the young man or the prisoner again? - A. On the 25th of January, I met the prisoner, and apprehended him; I never saw the young man again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. It is my duty to submit to your Lordship, under the correction of your Lordship, the objection I now take, at the moment that transfer is about to be offered to your Lordship, as purporting to be a proof of an interest in Harrison. My Lord, I take it, that not only all indictments, should bring the words within<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170092"></xptr>the express Act of Parliament, but that the evidence should also bring the facts within the express words of the indictment. The indictment here charges this man with forging, or causing to be forged, a certain transfer. Now, my Lord, I humbly submit to your Lordship, that that which is charged to be forged and counterfeited, and that under which Harrison is said to derive his interest, is not a transfer; and that under that, Harrison had no legal interest. My Lord, to complete and constitute a transfer, it must be signed by the party transferring, and accepted by the transferee, and it has been admitted by the candour of the learned Gentleman who opened this case, that the latter constituent part is entirely wanting; that Harrison did not accept this transfer, which the executors on their part undertook to convey to him. And, my Lord, without these formalities, I submit to your Lordship, that it is that sort of thing which could convey no currency, and consequently no imposition upon society; that it is nothing more than a dead letter; that under which, no dividend could be received, and upon which no action could be maintained; but, my Lord, I do not stop here, for the Act of Parliament will be admitted to apply to every fund constituted by Government, and which is inserted in the very act, creating those funds, and the second section of that act runs thus: "And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England,"&amp;c. (reading the clause of the act).</p>
               <p>My Lord, I therefore submit, that that which is stated to have been a legal interest in Harrison, could not be a legal interest, inasmuch as it wanted that sort of formality, constituting an interest in law.</p>
               <p>The learned Gentleman, in his opening, has endeavoured to establish a distinction between a transfer on the part of legatees, and to an ordinary purchaser; from whatever source the learned Gentleman may have drawn that distinction I know not; sure I am, that the highest authority he can produce is a loose and lax, and perhaps reprehensible practice; but your Lordship will adhere to that sort of practice only, which by the act is expressed in terms as strong as language can be. My Lord, I will suppose for a moment, the converse of the proposition, and that, instead of this being a signature, without an acceptance, it had been an acceptance without a signature; is it possible to suppose, that such an instrument could be in law, capable of that sort of forgery, now charged upon the prisoner. My Lord, it can no more be said, that such a thing is a transfer, than that the preparation of a deed of assignment can be called an assignment, wanting the names of the parties.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I will refer your Lordship to two cases in my humble judgment, extremely in point; the first is the case of the King and Mossatt, tried at the Old-Bailey Sessions, in January 1787; it is in Mr. Leach's book 337."

I, which enact, in order to restrain them under a limited sum, that the place of abode shall be described, and other particulars; and the section concludes with saying, that all notes and bills of exchange negociated under this act, shall hereby be declared to be void. My Lord, in that case, the question referred to the Judges, was, whether if the bill of exchange set forth in the indictment be void by the above statutes, the forging of it can become the subject of a capital offence, within the meaning of those statutes. In February sessions, 1787, Mr. Justice Gould signified that the Judges had taken this case into their consideration, but that they thought it a subject which required further deliberation. In the May Sessions following, Mr. Justice Ashhurst delivered their unanimous opinion, that as the forgery was committed before the expiration of the statutes 15

            . chap. 51, and 17 George III. chap. 30; the bill of exchange, if real, would not have been valid or negociable, and that therefore the forging of it was not a capital offence. I submit with great deference to your Lordship, that this is a still stronger case than that which I am this day called upon to defend, in-as much as the bill of exchange was that sort of thing, which, by currency in society, might obtain, but not so in the present case; this could not legally be transferred to a second person; no second person could receive a dividend, or maintain an action under it; but is for want of that grand legal formality enjoined by the statute, a dead letter.</p>
               <p>My Lord, there is another case within the present experience of your Lordships, that I own appears to me analogous to this, because, if this be a transfer, it is not the thing charged in the indictment as an instrument establishing an interest in Harrison; I mean the case of Lyon, who was indicted for forging a certain receipt, or acquittance, purporting to be a receipt; it was demurred to, that the instrument was neither a receipt nor an acquittance, inasmuch as it was not filled up by the name of the person from whom the money was received.</p>
               <p>The opinion of the Judges was delivered in May, 1795, when one of your Lordships was pleased to say, "The"instrument must be set out, that the Court might see,"from its tenor, what it purported to be; and that it is"that which the law has protected. These receipts"ought to be filled up with the name of the subscriber;"it is then, and not before, an acknowledgement of the"payment of money, and becomes a receipt. If any"one takes a blank (for it is not a receipt), without a"name; he has no reason to complain of it as a fraud,"because, if he had looked, he must have seen that it"was no more than waste paper."</p>
               <p>My Lord, I submit, therefore, that this piece of paper, called a transfer, is not a transfer, unless it be attended by those formalities enjoined by the statute; for those formalities, essential as they may be in this case, happen to be entirely absent; and that it is that which, for want of acceptance, conveys no legal interest to Harrison.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Jackson was followed by Mr. Balmanno, on the same side; and on the part of the Crown, by Mr. Fielding, Mr. Knowlys, and Mr. Giles, to whom Mr. Jackson replied.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. It appears to me, that this comes to the single question, whether the acceptance is a part of a transfer? if it is, the transfer is not complete; the indictment is for forging a transfer. Let us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170093"></xptr>see what a transfer is. - The Act says, that for all transfers of any sums of money, there shall be books kept, and an entry made of them; which entry shall be conceived in proper words for that purpose, and shall be signed by the persons making that assignment. It seems to me, that the transfer is complete on the part of the person who undertakes to assign that stock; however, if upon turning it more in my mind there should occur any reasonable doubt, then, unquestionably, in a case of life and death, I will take care that the opinion of the Judges shall be taken, if any doubt should occur to me that I am not aware of at present.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Giles. Q. Look at that book, did you fill up that transfer? - A. I did; on the 14th of January, the prisoner came to me with Mr. Unwin, and a young man whom I did not know, to execute a transfer; after it was filled up, the prisoner signed to the identity of the young man who had signed William Harrisson; as the young man was signing his name in the book, I saw him sign two f s, whereas the transfer was filled up with one; I asked him, if that was his regular mode of signing his name; he informed me it was; I told him it differed with our books, and we could not admit it as a legal transfer, unless he went before a Magistrate and made an affidavit; they then went from our office, and I never saw them after.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the young man in the soldier's cloaths, is that the young man? - A. I don't think it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. You are a clerk in the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a standing order among the Directors, that no transfer shall be made till it is previously accepted by the party?</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are not all the orders of the Bank Directors in writing? - A. I believe they are.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. I believe you are one of the superintendants of the Three per cent. Consols office? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. If the order be in writing, I have no right to ask you, but are you under such orders from your superiors, that no person shall transfer stock unless it is previously accepted by the party? - A. Public orders are stuck round the Bank of England, with clauses of the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what extract, and from what Act of Parliament it is, that is adjoined to those orders so stuck up? - A. An extract from the clause "That all stock must be accepted before the transfer is made." In the Three per Cent office we don't stand for acceptance before the payment of the dividend; but we don't suffer it to be transferred till there is an acceptance, unless it is by mistake or inaccuracy.</p>
               <p>Q. When dividends are about to be made, warrants are of course made out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any distinction made in those warrants, applicable to such as have, and such as have not been accepted? - A. In all the rest of the offices there are, but not in mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any check made in the ledger upon such occasions? - A. Yes; a mark, by which the clerk knows whether it is accepted or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The rule is, that dividends may be paid without acceptance, but cannot be transferred without acceptance? - A. Yes; there are positive orders from the Directors to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Suppose a person who has not accepted the stock comes to transfer it, do you make it accepted first, and then transfer it? - A. I don't know that they do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. It does sometimes happen that it is done without acceptance, when it is done by stock-jobbers? - A. Yes; it is too often.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. William Smith and Alfred Robins, printers and stationers, of Queen-street, Seven-dials. On the 26th of July, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, a man, who I believe to be the prisoner, came to the shop—I do not swear to him—he asked the price of paper—I told him—he asked to look at some letter-paper—I showed him some, and told him the price was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ream—he said it was too dear—I agreed to let him have it for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he being a dealer—he agreed to that—he selected a ream of whitey-brown, and then another, bundle of whitey-brown—he was to pay, I think 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the other—they were ordered to be put up separately, as he wanted them to go to different places—he said the lad was to accompany him, and bring the money back—I made out a bill to him, which be had—the boy went with him—he was directed not to let him have the paper without the money—the prisoner did not leave his address—the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bundle was left at the public-house where the boy took the paper, and was brought back to us—I believe the prisoner had the bill of parcels—I cannot say whether I wrote a receipt or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman—on the 3rd of August, in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I took the prisoner into custody, in the Strand—I was in private clothes—he asked me who I was—I said a constable—he asked what I took him for—I told him—he said it was only a debt—at Marlborough-street he denied having any paper at all from the shop. Prisoner's Defence. I did buy the paper; I deal in paper, the parties know that; I had an order for the paper; I came to meet a customer at this public-house; he was gone; I went up to Long Acre, but could not find the person out; I did not come back for half-an-hour, and then the boy was gone; I met my eldest son coming up St. Martin's lane; he told me that my second son had met with a very serious accident, in Villiers-street; I live in Buckingham-street; I went home, and took him to Charing-cross hospital, and consequently I had to sell the paper; I spent part of the money, and had not the means of going back again; but</p>

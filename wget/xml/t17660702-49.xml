            . I was taking a walk with some company on Sunday was se'nnight. The prisoner was running after 2 sheep in a field by Sadler's Wells house; he desired us to stop her; we opened a pen; she ran in, and we catched her; I asked him who was the owner of the sheep; he said it belonged to a man in Swan-alley; he did not mention any name; I had a suspicion he had stole it, so I followed him; when he came into Goswell-street, he took the sheep to a butcher, who said he knew nothing at all of him or the sheep, so I stopped the sheep and prisoner there. I sent a watchman for the constable, and delivered them into his care.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Who catched the sheep?</p>
               <p>Goff. The man that was along with me did. The prisoner at first said it belonged to him.</p>

            . I was the constable of the night; on that Saturday night, I was desired to go and secure the prisoner, which I did, and sent him to Bridewell, and the sheep to the watch-house in Golden-lane, where the last witness saw her. Mr. Brown came, and he and the evidence swore to her before the Justice. The boy said he knew the sheep by the tooth, by the face, and by the mark; I not knowing Goff, went and enquired his character, and found he has the character of a very honest man.</p>

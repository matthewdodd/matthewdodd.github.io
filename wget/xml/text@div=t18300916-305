               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not your son going abroad at the King's expence? A. That I know nothing about; he is under sentence of transportation - I did not see the prisoner at the Black Horse on the 8th of June, nor accuse him there of being the man; I do not keep a shop - I work for several Lambeth-street officers - I purchase things, and dispose of them; I sell secondhand clothes - I have a workshop in Petticoat-lane, but do not sleep there; the things were worth about 2l. or 2l. 6s. he said he would leave his jacket till he came back - I did not exactly say he left it as a deposit; I am sure this was on the 7th of June - I cannot tell the day of the week; I took him about one hundred and fifty yards from where I live - I was told by several persons who live in Rosemary-lane, that he had absconded; the jacket is not worth 2s.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Davis present when the hamper went away? A.

I said he must be out of his mind to think of such a thing; I could get no employ, and went into the country to hay-making; I returned in six or seven weeks, and met this man three parts drunk - collared me; he kept me about ten minutes, then said,"Paddy, I'll tell you what I will do?" I said, "Well, Moses?" he said, "Give me 1l., and I'll let you go about your business;" I said, "No, not a farthing;" the Police - man came, and we went to Lambeth-street - they refused to come into the office against me, but the Magistrate sent out for them.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and worked on board the brig Mentor, at ballast-heaving - she laid in the river, between Execution and St. Katherine's-docks. I began work at seven o'clock on the Monday morning, the 7th of June, with two other men, the prisoner and another - one of them took sick about nine, and the prisoner and I finished the job; we were working there till near eight o'clock in the evening, and finished the job - I have known the prisoner a year and a half or two years; I never saw him with such a jacket on as the one produced - he is not a seaman, but goes to harvest work; I never knew any harm of him - the sick man did not return; I have not seen him since.</p>

               <p>Q. What makes you know it was the 7th of June? A. Because I heard the people coming after this man, and heard it was the 7th of June - the prisoner lived in Cartwright-street; he went to harvest work a few days after this - he had employed me to this job, and paid me my wages; the captain was to pay him - it was the 7th of June that he paid me, as the job was finished at eight o'clock on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for saying it was the 7th? A. Because I kept it in my head; I did not hear he was accused of this till a fortnight or three weeks ago - I knew it was the 7th of June, because we never worked together since - the Mentor has sailed; I do not know whether I went to Mass on Trinity-Sunday - I kept the 7th of June in my mind, seeing these people were after the man that night; I saw two officers looking for him about ten o'clock that night - they came to his apartment; he was not at home - I know I had been working with him that day, and thinking there might be something serious, I kept it in mind; I did not make a memorandum of it - I can neither read nor write; the Mentor sailed that night - I lived in the same house as the prisoner.</p>

               <p>HENRY DAVIS. I believe this man is the prisoner's brother.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to Witness. Q. On your oath, did you ever pass as this man's brother? A. I never did - I did not go to see him in gaol; I was not present when he was taken.</p>
               <p>HENRY DAVIS. That man was standing at the corner when I gave the Policeman information, and he said that was his jacket - that is my reason for saying I thought he was his brother.</p>

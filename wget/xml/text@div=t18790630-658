At 3.45 a.m on Thursday, 15tb May, I was on duty at the Chase, and saw Perry come through the area window of 42—I went down to arrest him, when Sharp also came through the window—I turned round and struggled with him, but getting on the steps he had the advantage of me—I drew my truncheon and struck him' twice, once across the back and once across the legs, and he got away—I then arrested Perry and took him to the station, and charged him with burglar<lb></lb>iously breaking and entering a dwelling-house—he said, "You can't call that breaking, as I got in through the window, which was unlatched '—I found on him a knife which has one blade broken off and made into a screw-driver—I went into the house, and there was a bookcase opened in the room—they could not get through the room, the door being locked on the outside.</p>

I live at 42, The Chase, Clapham—on the morning of 15th May I was called by the police-sergeant, and on coming down the area steps I saw the policeman with Perry, who was sitting on the window-sill, and the policeman told me he had arrested him—the window was open—it was shut the night before, but I will not say it was fastened—I found a book-press open in the room which I had locked the night before.</p>

I keep the "Stanhope's Head" beerhouse, Garden Street, Whitechapel—on Wednesday morning, 5th July, between one and two o'clock, I was disturbed by a dog barking—I got up directly and looked out of the window that overlooked my private bar—I saw both the men outside first—I saw one of them get through the window, I don't know which it was—as soon as I threw up the window and looked out they were off directly—I missed nothing at first—next morning I missed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in coppers, done up in five-shilling packets, and a white tablecloth—I have not recovered the tablecloth—the window was bolted before I went to bed—I described the prisoners to a policeman who is not here—I had previously seen them drinking in my house two or three times—I am quite sure Wright was one—I can swear to him—the other was much the stature of Wilson—Wright wore a white cap—the policeman Carling afterwards showed me some copper moneys and brown papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are like what I lost—there was a bad halfpenny among them—my wife did them up.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 163 H). From information I received from the constable on duty, I went with Sergeant Reed, about half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 5th July, to No. 5, Bell's Place, Whitechapel—the door was open and I went in—I found the prisoners there—Wilson was in bed in his shirt—Wright said, "What do you want here?"—I said, "Nothing particular; I've come to search your room to find some stolen money in your possession"—he said, "Oh, you can look"—he didn't say if he had any or not—I asked Wilson to jump out of bed—I looked underneath the head of the bed—there was nothing there—then I looked underneath the bed and found this cap full of copper money—I found these papers on the table—I asked Wright how he came by the money—he said he was a dealer in fish at Billingsgate, and got it for some mackerel—he said, "That is my money; I earned it honestly."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edwin Whitburn—on the Monday before Thursday, 5th July, I made up some packets of halfpence—this halfpenny is one that was in one of the five-shilling packets—when we put the halfpence up we always put the French halfpence or any of that sort by themselves, and then if any are wrong we allow to the brewers for them—I can swear to this halfpenny—this is another which I did up—I can swear to this also.</p>

I wish to state how I came by the money—we are two hard-working men, and get our living by selling fish—on the Wednesday previous to the Thursday we were taken I went to Billings<lb></lb>gate Market and bought some mackerel—we were going with it along Whitechapel, when just outside the London Hospital a man asked us if we wanted to sell the mackerel—I said, "I will take 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them if you like"—he said, "I will give 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—I said, "All right, you shall have them"—he says, "I have 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers," and counted them into my cap—we had some supper and went to bed pretty near daylight—the police came and asked me what I had got there—I said nothing belonging to them—they searched the place and found the cap of money—I said, "It belongs to me."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not describe him as marked with the small-pox? A. I said I thought he was; there is not a single mark on the prisoner - he was two or three minutes with me; when I saw him in the public-house, I said I thought he was the man, and then I said I was certain - I could tell by the look of his face and his clothes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say to the officer to make him know the man? A. I said he had a black suit on, and a hat; I did not describe his eyes, heard, or whiskers - we went to some public-houses, and did not find any body like him, but at the Merry Carpenters I said, "This is like the man," and said he was the man when he stood up; I told the Magistrate I thought I had seen him before at my master's - the parcel and a book were in the bag- the prisoner asked whether I had the book to sign it, but that was not the book to sign; it happened against Franks', in Beech-street - the prisoner overtook me; I received the parcel in my master's shop, not far from the door, and I was then told to take it to Mr. Beaks - my master's is a private house.</p>

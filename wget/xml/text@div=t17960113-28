I got on a little distance, and he laid hold of them again; while he did that, Thompson came up upon the right-hand side, and Parry called him a buggar, and made use of very bad language to Thompson, that he did not come forward sooner, to hold the horse's head. They both presented pistols, and Parry came to my side, after Thompson was at the head of the horse; they drove the wheels into the ditch, so that the horse's head stood in the middle of the road; Thompson stood at the left-side, with a pistol to my wife; and Parry at my side, with his pistol to me, swearing at me, and demanding my money. They kept asking me for money, and I told them I had none, for, I suppose, three or four minutes; my wife was very much alarmed, and begged I would give them some money; when she intreated me, I put my hand into my breeches pocket, and pulled out all the silver I had, which amounted to eight or nine, or ten shillings: Parry took it of me, They then were not contented, but threatened me very hard; my wife jumped out of the chaise; they told me I had more, and insisted upon having it. Then Thompson looked back behind him, and saw some persons in the road, as I suppose, for they went off immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some persons came up? - A. There were five or six men not sixty yards off all the time, on foot. Mr. Chapman, the Magistrate, passed me just after, in a chaise; he knew me, but did not speak to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What opportunity had you of observing their faces? - A. They had white handkerchiefs up to their mouths; but the wheels being in the ditch. I had a full view of them both.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long did the whole transaction continue? - A. I suppose five or six minutes; I cannot say justly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp, prisoner Parry's counsel. Q. You live at Kingston? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You were a good deal alarmed, I take it? - A. Yes. My wife was much more so.</p>
               <p>Q. You were considerably alarmed? - A. Not as much as she was.</p>
               <p>Q. You described the prisoners to have had a white handkerchief as high as their mouths? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Beyond their mouths? - A. I don't know that it was. Parry's handkerchief dropped down almost to his chin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a part of it remaining up? - A. There was some remaining up; they had great coats on, which supported it.</p>
               <p>Q. What hats had they on? - A. Round hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Over the face, like? - A. I saw their faces.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the prisoners before, you were somewhat alarmed, and yet you mean to swear positively to the person of Parry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect these men are trying for their lives? - A. I am very sorry there is occasion for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to undertake to swear positively to him? - A. I was alarmed most, on account of my wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally, prisoner thompson's Counsel. Q. What time did Thompson come up? - A. Long before I delivered my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you examined at Brentford after the men were apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear you could not at all speak to the person of Thompson? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I am a builder and bricklayer: On the 16th of December, about one o'clock, or half after one, I was going down the lane nearly opposite the Crown at Twickenham. I had not gone more than forty or fifty yards down the lane, when I observed a gentleman and lady in a single horse chaise, and two men on horseback, they stood cross-ways in the road: the chaise was in the lane, and stood cross-ways on the road, the men seemed to be detaining them; the chaise was run back into the ditch and out again, I was a great way from them, I was on horseback; I supposed, from the loudness with which they were talking, that they were quarrelling; I was going to make haste forward, I was afraid there would be mischief; as the chaise went into the ditch, my man came up to me and desired me not to go on, he said they were highwaymen; I turned into a house, one Captain Harding's, and desired them to lend me some fire-arms, I found I could get no assistance, I turned me round, and saw the men go from the chaise; I heard the lady holloa murder! Some men were standing with pitchforks, labouring men; I said they were very inhuman men, when they heard the lady cry murder, not to assist; I followed the men, they went on towards I Isleworth, they turned the point of the road that leads up towards Twickenham; I observed through the hedges which way they turned, and continued the pursuit; the first person I met was Mr. Twining's servant, of Isleworth, his name is Smith; I said there were two highwaymen, and I begged him to follow me; he did not immediately follow, but soon after turned after me; they rode through Twickenham town, I did not see them in Twickenham, but I saw them soon afterwards; I still kept crying out highwaymen; the people directed me that they were just before, they turned a number of corners; I got up to very near Lord Orford's gate, at Twickenham, and saw them again riding together.</p>
               <p>Q. What pace did they go? -. Fast; a very good pace; they pulled up there, rather slackened their pace, and seemed inclined to let me come up to them; I had nothing to defend myself, I was not in a hurry to come up with them, I kept at about sixty yards distance, they kept on the road to Hampton-Court: there is a parish gate which a woman keeps, she opened it to the first, and he went through; I holloa'd to her, stop thief, and desired her to shut the gate, which she did; as the second man was going through, the gate came in contact with the horse's breast, and almost threw him down, the rider fell from his horse just before I got up to the gate; the first pulled out something and turned round, I cannot say it was a pistol; I went as fast as I could to the gate, where the man had fallen off; Mr. Twining's man came up, and said, O Lord, he was killed; I said, to Mr. Twining's servant, he is very safe, and called to a smith, of the name of Watts, to assist him, while I pursued the other. I then observed the other was down, at Teddington village, at a considerable distance, but within sight; immediately a baker's man came up, on horseback, I desired him to assist me in the pursuit, and we pursued him together; when we were down to the end of the town, he had got round the corner and I could not see him: the baker's man turned the wrong way, I turned right, and pursued; I then saw the horse and not the man; I met a carriage, and asked the man if he saw the man that rode that horse? he said he knew nothing of him. I then saw the man endeavouring to conceal himself in a hedge; I thought I could go to the place where he was, but in leaping the ditch, my horse sell. When I came to the place, I could not see him just for a little space,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130054"></xptr>he had secreted himself in the hedge out of my sight; I desired a person that followed me to stand where he was, for I was sure the man was not far off; there was a boy in the field with a gun, I asked him to lend me his gun, he hesitated, and I took it from him; and then I heard a holloaing behind me, and saw some people had got the man; I immediately came up to him, and he came to me, and begged to shake hands with me; he said, he hoped I should not use him ill; I told him he should not be used ill there by any body, and begged him to walk up to Teddington village, to the first house; several persons went with me, and he begged I would use him as a gentleman; he said, he believed I was a gentleman, and he would be no other to me; he begged me to search him, and said, he had not taken the advantage of me that he might have done. One of the foot people, the first that came up, pointed to his coat pocket; I said as he had desired me to search him, I would just see what was in that pocket, and he pulled out a short pistol; immediately a man who came up from Teddington, whom I knew, of the name of Bird, put his hand to his breast, and took out another pistol. I said, Bird, are you a constable; he said he was; I desired him then to take care of the man, and take care of these pistols; he took charge of him. I rode with him up to Teddington to the village, and left him in charge of the constable, and went in search of Mr. Sidebotham, that he might come and see them: Thompson was the man that fell off at the gate, and Parry the man that hid himself in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of horses had they? - A. They were both rather bay; the short man had a sort of a dark green coat; it was he that fell off his horse, Thompson; the other was Parry, he had a lighter coat, of a brown cast.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the colours of the horses? - A. Both bay; about a hand difference in the height: Parry rode the tallest.</p>
               <p>Q. For what length of time, during the pursuit, were they out of your sight? - A. About two minutes, not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt in your own mind, that the men you began to pursue, were the men you took and carried to Teddington? - A. I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, at any one time, was Thompson out of your sight before the gate was shut upon him? - A. Neither of them was more than that out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you begin to pursue them? - A. I saw them at the chaise, and when they quitted the chaise, I began the pursuit.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt, that the men you took in those two ways were the men that quitted the chaise? - A. I believe them to be the men, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Trebeck, prisoner Parry's Counsel. Q. Parry behaved with perfect peaceableness? - A. Quite.</p>
               <p>Q. He shewed no symptoms of violence? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You found upon him two pistols? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He wished to be searched? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His demeanor was perfectly peaceable? - A. In every respect.</p>

             were riding after them; they cried, "Stop, highwayman," and told me to come on.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on horse-back? - A. I was not then, but my master's horse being by, I took it, and followed them, and, just as I overtook them, they had got one man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. At the gate of the Common, at Teddington.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it either of the prisoners? - A. That man in dark clothes (Thompson); I immediately went after the other; Chapman desired me to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130055"></xptr>after the other, that was gone forward; I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him at any time? - A. I lost sight of him just going round the corner of Teddington.</p>
               <p>Q. For what length of time did you lose sight of him? - A. For the space of a minute or two; the prisoner Parry was got off his horse, and got over into a field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him get off the horse, or see the horse without him? - A. I saw the horse without him; he had crept into a ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - A. In the ditch; I found him in about two minutes; he was crept into a ditch, under some bushes; as soon as I saw him, I said, to the people that were by, here is the man, and he immediately came out to me; he told me, I need not be afraid of him; he would not hurt me; and he came up to me, and gave me his hand; then we had them off to Teddington.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure, in your own mind, the man you pursued, and overtook, is the prisoner at the bar? - A. I be.</p>
               <p>Q. That is James Parry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man you left at the gate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Though this man, Parry, had a brace of pistols, one in his pocket, and another in his breast, he immediately came out to you, gave you his hand, and did not offer any violence at all? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What pace was he going? - A. As fast as the horse could go, apparently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what sort of a horse it was? - A. A bay mare.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the man you saw before? - A. Yes; I crossed a gentleman's park, to come into the road where they were; Mr. Chapman and a good many other people were in the road; I went up to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see the man that was taken, here in Court? - A. Yes, Parry: when I came up, I saw a pistol in his breast; I took it out; it was loaded and primed.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a constable? - A. Yes; I searched his pocket; I found nothing but some powder, wrapped up in a paper, with a letter, in his right hand waistcoat pocket; and twenty-one shillings and sixpence, that I returned him; I took him into custody, and took him before a magistrate, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took the pistol from Parry's bosom, and it was primed and loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not attempt to make any violent use of it against any body? - A. No.</p>

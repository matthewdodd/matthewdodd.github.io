             - A. Yes, and the little girl, Rebecca; they were at my house on Monday the 18th of November, in the morning about half past ten; Mrs. Dillone had bad eyes, she went to the doctor's, and left the children at my house under my care.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were under your care did any person come into your shop - A. Yes; a lady came into my shop about half past ten, to buy two penny worth of apples.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the lady at the bar, is that the lady - A. I cannot tell whether it is or not. When she came in I had the little boy in my lap, and my sister had the little girl, and when the lady asked for the apples, I put the little boy down, and then the sister, the little girl got down, and then both went to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was the little girl - A. About five years old, and the boy had just turned three. I served the lady with two pennyworth of apples, and then she asked for two pennyworth more; she gave me six-pence and I gave her two-pence; she then said good morning to me, and I said good morning to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak to the children - A. She never spoke to them in my shop. When she went out somebody came to my shop for six pound of potatoes; I served the six pound of potatoes, and somebody came in for three pound more before I missed the children. When I had served them, I said, Beckey, do not go from the door; I ran to the door, and the children was not there. I ran half way up St. Martin's-lane; I called Beckey, Beckey, they did not answer; I returned down to No. 11, to the yard, and called, Beckey. I did not find them there. I did not think of their being stolen away; I ran down to the wharf, and as I was crossing of Swan-lane, I saw the little girl returning with a penny plumb cake in her hand, and an apple; she was coming up Thames-street; I ran across to her; I said Beckey, where have you been.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the children dressed - A. The <rs id="t18111204-3-viclabel14" type="occupation">boy</rs>

               <p>Q. What sort of hair had the little boy - A. Light hair, and the hair turned up on the right side; his hair rather wanted cutting.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the lady was dressed - A. She was genteely dressed; I did not take notice any thing she had on, I little thought of what would happen, or else I should have took notice.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not seen the little boy since - A. No. I never saw him since he went out of my lap.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose it was between the time of your serving the lady the apples, and the time of your last serving the last customer with the potatoes - A. Not more than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time that you missed the little girl, and when you saw her come up Thames-street - A. About ten minutes after. This is the little girl.</p>

I cannot swear that she is the person; she had a straw bonnet on with a blue flower in it, and a blue cloth cloak, her cloak was trimmed with fur. She had a little boy with her in her arms in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how the little boy was dressed - A. I cannot say positively how he was dressed; he had on a blue pinafore, and a light coloured frock, he had no hat on; he had light hair and very thick. She had the little boy in her arms, and placed him on the counter; she asked me for a hat at half a guinea, upon which I arose and placed a hat on the child's head; she then asked me for a feather; I got a feather and she approved of it: I asked her if I should sew it in; she said, no, she was in a great hurry; she put the feather in the child's hat, and put it on its head; she paid me eleven shillings and went out. That is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were afterwards before the Lord Mayor - A. Yes, and at Union Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when the little girl pointed out the prisoner - A. Yes, she pointed out the lady at Union Hall; the lady was mixed with other people; she was standing with other ladies at the time at Union Hall.</p>

               <p>Q. When did this pointing out happen - A. At the first meeting at Union Hall.</p>

               <p>MR. SHERGOLD. I am a labourer in the service of the East India Company.</p>
               <p>Q. You I believe, are the uncle of these little children - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your sisters loss did you enquire after the little boy - A. I was distributing hand bills for three days before I could hear any thing. From information I went to Trafalgar-place, No. 7; I went to the house where the prisoner lodges, I took Goff and Clark (another officer) with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you get there for whom did you enquire - A. For Mrs. Russell. I was informed that she was not at home; the landlady desired me to walk up two pair of stairs, she desired me to wait, and the prisoner came into the room to me; I asked her if her name was Mrs. Russell, and informed her that I had a great deal of trouble to find her out, but did not inform her the real business I was on. I entered into a light conversation with her; I asked her if she had another room; I was anxious to see her other apartment, to see if I could discover any thing before I hurt or troubled her mind; she asked me if I wanted to go to it already; I said, yes; she then shewed me the other room; I then held her in conversation a minute, the same as I did in the other room, and walked about the room to see if I could see any thing that led to a discovery. I then told her it was too early to sit down to spend the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. This was on the Tuesday, eight days after the loss. I asked her then if she would put on her cloak and take a walk with me, as it was a fine evening, which she refused; she said she would light a fire and make me a comfortable dish of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your object in asking her to take a walk with you - A. I wished to see the colour of her cloak.</p>
               <p>COURT. All this time you had not given her any hint what you came about - A. No; she pressed me very hard to let her light a fire, but I still refused it. She then asked me who that was standing at the door; I informed her it was my servant; she said I had better go and send him away, as she supposed I was going to stop with her all night; I gave her no positive answer; I told her I would go down and speak to him; I then went down to Goff, who passed as my servant; I asked him what we had best to do in it, whether we had not best candidly tell her our business; I went back with Goff and desired she would not distress herself; I told her I had deceived her, my business was in search of a child who was my nephew; she was very much hurt, and asked me from whence I could get any information of her; I told her that I had heard a gentleman say that there was a person once took away his girl, but it was restored to him again, and that this person who took away his girl had before left a cloak there to be dyed blue, and that she was in the habit of wearing feathers in her hat or bonnet; Mrs. Russell then denied having any such clothes; she said she would shew me her clothes if I would look at them; I refused to do it. I told her if she was an innocent woman I hoped she would have no objection of seeing that servant who served a lady with two children with bunns; she answered, she was willing to see any one; I then sent for the servant,

             not to be too hasty, but to recollect herself, and be cautious before she said she was the person. After she first said she was the person I gave her this caution; she looked at her again and persisted in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you suggested of some person having lost a child, did you tell that gentleman's name - A. I did not. I then asked Mrs. Russell if she was an innocent woman to walk with me to Fish-street hill to the hatters there, which she consented to do; I asked her to accept of my arm, and she should be treated with every degree of politeness. and if she proved to be an innocent woman I would civilly conduct her home again. On our way to Fish-street Hill there was a deal of conversation; Mrs. Russell questioned me closer which way I got my information; I asked her to confess to me if she knew any thing of the child; I told her that I heard that she once before attempted to take a child away; she confessed to me that she was accused of the same, but that the mother of the child gave her permission to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who that mother was - A. No, not to my recollection. I then asked her why, if she had permission, why she beat the child, the mother informed me that she did; she said she did slap it a little, but not hurt it. I asked her if ever she had a child herself; she answered, that she had, and that it was a girl. Any more particulars I do not recollect untill I got into the hatters shop; I then asked the young lady sitting behind the counter if she knew that lady; I mentioned no name.</p>

I then asked her if she was any way like the lady who had bought a hat there on Monday the 18th; she answered she could not tell, but she was about the same heighth. Goff, the officer, being just behind me, asked the lady at the hatters shop to ask Mrs. Russell a few questions.</p>

             then told her her voice was like the voice of the person who bought the hat, and then asked her to stand beside of her, and told her heighth corresponded with the heighth of the person who bought the hat for the boy on the 18th. She then informed her that she did believe her to be the lady who bought the hat, though so differently dressed. That ended her conversation.

               <p>Q. Did you any time in November last, and what day, see any lady with two children - A. On the 18th I saw the lady who is arraignod at the bar now bring two children out of Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at her, are you certain of her - A. Yes, I am, or else I would not say it; I saw her come out of St. Martin's lane, having two children before her; then she took the youngest up; she walked along a few paces; the young one began to wimper; she said to the oldest that she was going to buy them cakes. I walked along with them to the end of Thames-street. The prisoner went up Thames-street, which is Mrs. Russell, I suppose, and then she went up Fish-street Hill. I did not see her any more that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how she was dressed - A. I will not swear whether her cloak was blue or brown, it was furred all round. She had a straw bonnet on, the children had both white frocks on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the dress of the children correspond with the dress of the lady herself - A. The children were dressed as a working man's children might be dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she dressed as a working man's wife - A. No, she was too tawdry for that. I was at the front of Swan-lane; I walked after up Thames-street; my attention was directed to her because she rather snubbed the children.</p>

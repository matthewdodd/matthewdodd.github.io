                  </hi>. I live in Edward-street, Bermondsey-street. On 19th Jan., about twelve o'clock at night, I was going along Bermondsey-street with another young man—the prisoner came up and asked for something to drink—we went with her to a public-house—we had some gin and beer which I paid for—the prisoner then went out, and a party who was with my friend said something to me—I felt in my waistcoat-pocket, and missed my purse which had about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I know I had had it there about a quarter of an hour before—I went along the road, and met the policeman bringing the prisoner back with my purse—this is it—I cannot say that I had it when I went into the public-house.</p>

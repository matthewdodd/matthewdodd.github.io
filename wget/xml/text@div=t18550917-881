                  </hi>. I am a builder, of West Ham. I am the proprietor of Belgrave Villas, in the turnpike road there—about the end of June I received information, went to the house No. 1, and found that it had been entered, part of the first floor water closet fittings were broken off and taken away, the cup and handle, and also a quantity of brass taps—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to the police—about the last week in Aug. Mr. Whitworth showed me a handle and cup which I recognised as my property—I compared them and they fitted—on 8th Sept., after the prisoner had been bailed by a Ma<lb></lb>gistrate, he came to my house, and said, "I am very sorry that this has occurred, and I shall be very glad to make any recompense in my power"—I said that if he was innocent and did not do it, he had no occasion to come about it—he said that he hoped I should look it over in the best way I could—I said that I did not want to hurt him—he had not been employed by me to work in that house, but he had in other houses near that spot—this cup and handle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are mine, and this other is the part which was fixed to the water closet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Chatsworth-road, West Ham. The prisoner was in my employ, and about the middle of June he came with these two articles, and laid them down in the yard—we had a few words on business, and he walked away and left them there on a piece of timber—they were taken into the shop by a labourer who was clearing the yard—they remained with me till 22nd or 23rd Aug., and then Mr. Plater was relating the circumstance of his place being robbed, and I showed them to him.</p>

About 23rd June, I received information from the prosecutor—I went to No. 1, Belgrave Villas, and found that the brass fittings of the water closet were gone—in Aug. Mr. Plater gave me this cup and handle—I went to the house, found that they fitted, and brought the other part away—I tried to find the prisoner, but was not able to do so till 6th Sept—Benton was in search of him as well—he was not at work—I inquired for him at various builders—I did not know where his residence was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 381). I am stationed at West Ham. On Thursday, 6th Sept., I went after the prisoner, and found him at Hudson's-town, in the parish of West Ham, about three quarters of a mile from this place—I asked him if he had sold any bell knobs or a cup of a water closet to Mr. Whitworth; he said, "No, I have not"—I asked him if he had taken any to his place; he said, "No"—I asked him if he had given him any; he said, "No"—he then said that he had sold some bolts and locks to Mr. Whitworth—I told him that I must take him to the station for stealing some bell knobs and the cup of a water closet, the property of Mr. Plater—he said, "Very well, the old b—owes me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." he asked me to let him go down stairs to put his clothes on—he went down to the kitchen, and I waited up stairs on the landing—I said, "Jex, come, you are a long while"—he had then been about five minutes—he said, "I</p>

               <p>am coming"—he did not come—I went to see for him, and he was not there—I looked into the next house, got up, and saw him 300 or 400 yards off, running—I made inquiry as to where he lived, and went to his house at Leyton about 10 or 11 o'clock on the same night—I went the back way, and sergeant Manning went the front way—I heard the sergeant in the house—I shut the door—it was opened to me; I do not know who by as it was very dark, and Jex came down stairs—I said, "Jex, how came you to run away?" he said that he only went into the town to look after a job—I said, "You must come along with us now"—he said that he would be b—if he would—he swore for some time—I said, "You had better come quietly", and took some handcuffs from my pocket and persuaded him, and his wife said, "You had better go quiet"—I took him to the station, produced the cup and said, "Do you know anything about this cup, Jex!" he said, "No, I do not, it was never in my posssession"—I said, "Mr. Whitworth says that you took it to his place"—he said, "If Mr. Whitworth says so he must prove it."</p>

"—I believe he was within a yard or two of me; I know he was—Manning was with me in the first instances—I met him just at this side of the Castle—I had found out where the prisoner was at work—I went to Hudson's-town in consequence of information—the prisoner was in his working dress, plastering—I believe sergeant Manning was close by when I went up, and saw the prisoner 300 or 400 yards off—the sergeant was at the front of the house, and the prisoner went out at the back—there are about twenty carcases of houses there.</p>

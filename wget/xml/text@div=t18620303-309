I am a teacher, and live at 9, Gun-street, Houndsditch—on 6th February about half-past 7 in the morning, I went to 23, North-street, Commercial-road, East, and saw the prisoner jump out of the first-floor window and runa way—I followed him and took him, without losing sight of him—I had previously been to Mr. Child's, the pawnbrokers and saw part of the property which had been stolen from the house of the Rev. Aaron Levy, 1, Smith's-buildings, Leadenhall-street.</p>

I am a detective officer of the City-police—on 6th February, in consequence of information I received, I went to 23, Commer<lb></lb>cial-road East, with Mr. Abrahams and Sergeant Shepherd—I knocked at the door—a woman's voice said, "Who is there?"—I said, "A friend, open the door," but instead of opening it, I found that she was bolting it—I called out to Sergeant Shepherd, who was down stairs at the back, and Mr. Abrahams who was at the front, brought the prisoner to me—he was then charged with committing a robbery on 17th January, at the house of the Rev. Mr. Levy: he said that he knew nothing about it—I examined the room, but found nothing connected with this case—I then got the pawnbroker, Mr. Child who identified him at the station-house—that was a few hours after the robbery was committed.</p>

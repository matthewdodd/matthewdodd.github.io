                  </hi>. I now keep the Ben Johnson public-house, Good<lb></lb>man's Yard, Minories—in June, 1877, I was the owner of the licence of the Green Man, Price's Street, Blackfriars—in that month I entered into a negotiation for the sale of the stock, fixtures, and furniture to the defendant—he was to pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">all at</hi>—on the day of the change 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in cash, and I consented to take two bills, one for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 21 days, the other for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at two months—when the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill became due it was dishonoured—no communication had been made to me in the meantime by the defendant with reference to my attending before the Magistrate about a protection order—when the bill became due I placed the matter in the hands of Mr. Webb, my solicitor—from the 25th June till the 19th July I had called frequently, often two or three times a week, at the Green Man for my letters—being out of business I was at different places, but my place of residence for my wife was at the Lilford Arms, Lilford Road, Camberwell—I slept there occasionally when in London—some<lb></lb>times I would be in the country—about the 21st July I first went out of London; it was after the dishonouring of the bill; I went to discharge an engagement of brewing at the Hanwell Asylum—I was there off and on I suppose eight weeks—I was there for two or three days, and then would go back again—I was in town two or three days a week—I called on several occasions at the Green Man—I was there on August 3rd and received a letter, the envelope of which I produce—I received it from a lady behind the bar—after the first bill was dishonoured I went to see the defendant—I saw him at the Green Man—Mr. Woodman was not there—I did call on Mr. Woodman, the broker, on several occasions—when I saw Glancey I asked him how it was he had not met the bill—he said he did not intend to meet it; he did not intend to pay it—I asked him why, and he said there was not the trade that I represented—I told him that there was no trade whatever represented, it was the valuation; there was no trade represented at the sale—the value of the fixtures and fittings was told me by Mr. Woodman—the valuation was made by his clerk—I said to Glancey that the valuation was worth more than the money—I told him I should have my money—he said he would not pay me—I afterwards attended at the Southwark County Court on the 4th October and obtained a judgment upon my 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—before attending there I had been shown that affidavit of Mr. Glancey's—I cannot tell the date—it was at the solicitor's office I saw it—he wrote to me on receiving it—Glancey did not attend at the County Court on the 4th October—I knew that Mr. Hatton was acting as the prisoner's solicitor, by receiving a letter—this is the letter and this is the envelope it was in—I saw the defendant the night of the day I received the letter, the 3rd August, in the parlour of the Green Man—I did not say anything to him nor him to me—I am sure I saw him—he saw me—I nodded to him but he took no notice—that was the day I took the letter away that has been produced—when I got to the Lilford Arms I received a letter from Mr. Hatton—I was not aware of the application to the Magistrate at Southwark for a protection order till some time after the next transfer day—I was not aware of it up to the 4th August—I was not asked to attend any such application—the second bill was dishonoured.</p>

               <p>Duchess of Edinburgh or the Union beer shop, nor Mr. Horton, the public-house broker—in the presence of Mr. Wakeling a stranger did not ask me for the bills to prosecute Glancey—no stranger has said to me he would be glad to prosecute Glancey for doing them out of the Artichoke—I do not know that Jones and Horton have been before this Court for forcible entry—Mr. Straight was counsel at the police-court—I did not commence proceedings in December, but in January, on the declaration, on Saturday week—I went previously to get the declaration, but I kept no record of it—when I was told by the inspector that a declaration had been made I inquired at the police-court, but they keep no record and I could not obtain it—Mr. Woodman acted for me and Glancey—I have been in several public-houses and one beer shop—I am acquainted with the mode of transfer—I kept a public-house four years—I have not had beer shops at Holloway, Tottenham Road, and Kingston, nor Wandsworth—I keep a public-house at Wands<lb></lb>worth, not at Holloway, nor a beershop—I am not a barman—I have kept a beerhouse at Kingsland, the only one I ever kept—I have not been a barman at Lillie Bridge Grounds—I have-betted occasionally, but am not a professional betting man—when I transfer I sign the usual notices—it is usual for the forthcoming tenant to sign for the mortgagee to act, not the outgoing tenant—I cannot swear that I did not sign a power of attorney to Mr. Woodman—I do not possess a power of attorney, and if there is any the prisoner has got it—I signed all necessary papers—when<lb></lb>ever the notice was served the transfer ought to have been the first transfer-day that there was a chance to serve it—the first transfer-day was not the 11th of July—if it was there would not have been time to serve the notice—you have to give 14 clear days' notice to serve—the first transfer-day was on the 14th July—I went to the Court on 14th July and found that the notice had not been served of the transfer—the bill was not then due—possession was given to Mr. Glancey on 25th June—I took nothing from the house that was in the inventory—I took my bed and things for my own use—there was not a room full of furniture, a small proportion—the bulk of the furniture had been sold with the public-house—my wife and I slept at the Queen's Head on several occasions—we took a room there to put the furniture in, and stopped there till we got to business again—as early as 31st July I issued a summons, giving as my address the Lilford Arms—my wife was living there then—I did not instruct her if any one came, to say she did not know where I was to be found, I had no reason to do so—I did not give her instructions—she is not able to come here to-day—I did not know she was required—I did not see a Mr. Deas at the Lilford Arms—I did not know he had called there to ask for my address—I called at the Green Man two or three times a week for my letters—I do not recollect whether or not I swore before the Magistrate on 30th July that I got that envelope—I swear so to-day because I came up from Hanwell on Friday night, the 3rd August, I called at the Green Man to see if there were any letters for me, when I saw Mr. Glancey—I went from there to the Lilford Arms, where my wife was, and then I re<lb></lb>ceived a letter from Mr. Hatton, and that brings it to my mind that I received the letter—I did not say at the police-court that I received it on the 30th July—it was posted on that day, how could I receive it?—I was at Hanwell, my furniture at the Queen's Head, my wife at the Lilford Arms, and my children in the country—I got the letter at the Green Man from the lady behind the bar—she never offered to forward</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have offices at Somerset Chambers, 151, Strand—I have been acting for the defendant for many months past, more particularly in reference to the matter of Mr. Sayers—Mr. Glancey called on me with the summons—I had met Sayers at the change, which I attended, and I saw him from about 2 o'clock till half-past 5 or 6—after an interview with Glancey, I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I obtained the address from the summons—I saw Mr. Myers from Mr. Webb's office—he called on me on the 4th August—my letter is dated the 2nd—I presume that Glancey would be at my office on that day, because I should write immediately—I prepared an affidavit about the 10th August for him to swear in the County Court proceedings—this(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is the copy affidavit I supplied—I took my instructions from my client, Mr. Glancey—leave was obtained to appear—this letter, dated the 7th August, which I wrote to Messrs. Webb, is a letter apologising for having written to the client instead of the solicitor—between the 2nd and the 7th I had seen Mr. Webb's clerk—I can't say I had seen Mr. Glancey, I presume I had.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I acted in the change, that is, I did what was neces<lb></lb>sary as solicitor in the change—it was not an understanding that until the bills were paid Mr. Sayer would not concur in the transfer of the licence—that is not true—if that had been so I should not have allowed my client to complete, because there was some trouble at the solicitor's for the brewers as to arranging the sum to be paid and the amount of the bills—it was a distinct agreement that the transfer should be made at once, and a short</p>

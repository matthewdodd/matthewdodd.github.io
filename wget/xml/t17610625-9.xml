            . The prisoner lodged with me three weeks all but one day. She went out to go to work on the 25th of May. By and by she came home, and said her master would not employ her any more; and said she would go and clean herself. I had taken the prosecutor's shirt out of a box, and laid it on the top of it; the prisoner desired me to lace her stays on. I did, we were at the window, she said, you let the people see me; then I put the curtain too. The shirt was then lying by us. In about 5 minutes after she was gone I missed it; she returned very much in liquor at night, and had money about her, and she had borrowed a penny when she went out in the morning. There was nobody in the room but her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the shirt since?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. No, I have not. It was Mr. Potts's shirt; I took her up the next day, and two of her relations held me by the throat, while she got away; and when she got on the other side the way, she clapped her hands at me, and bid me do my worst, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure nobody besides the prisoner and you were in the room?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I am sure noby else was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a thoroughfare through that room for all the lodgers in the house?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. That door goes out into the yard, but no body passes there but the gentleman of the house and I, and at that time the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was the shirt lost?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. It was lost between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I have known her by sight, I believe, twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good character with her when she came?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I had, she said her husband was abroad, and she would have no men after her.</p>

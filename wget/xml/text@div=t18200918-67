            . I am parish-clerk of Enfield, and have been so twenty-seven years. On Friday, the 30th of June, I was in the church at prayer-time till half-past twelve o'clock, I then locked the vestry-door and the north door. The church was hung with black cloth in memory of the Earl of Lisburne. A surplice, marked E P 3, hung in the vestry. I have many times known the church to be hung with black - most of it is given to the vicar, and part to the clerk. I was called up on the Saturday morning, a little after two o'clock, by the beadle, and went to the church with him and the constable. I found the cloth and surplice gone - a candle was found in the church; I received it from the Vicar and gave it to the constable. A small piece of cloth had been left on the sounding-board of the pulpit. Some cloth was afterwards brought to Enfield - I compared it, it tallied with that left on the pulpit, and corresponded in quality - I have no doubt of its being the cloth. The surplice was also produced. The churchwardens provide the surplice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who has the care of the church - A. I take care of the vestry and the sexton the church. I keep the keys of the vestry and north doors, and take them home with me - they hang in my room if they are wanted. The vestry is part of the church, and communicates with it.</p>

            . I am the sexton. I shut up the church about nine o'clock, the night before the robbery. I locked the front door. I went there at two o'clock the next morning with the beadle, on hearing the alarm, and found the south door open, which I had locked; we were the first that entered. I could see that the door had been unlocked, but no violence had been used. The vestry door appeared to have been unlocked too, but not broken - the cloth and surplice were gone. I found two pieces of wax candle and some pieces of matches in the church.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the wax candles used at the funeral - A. The funeral was a month before. I had been at work near the church till nine o'clock, and went all over it at eight, to drive a bird out, and locked it at nine. I delivered the candles to the Vicar.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Enfield. On the 1st of July, in consequence of the alarm, I went in pursuit with Cufley. We received information, and got into Kingsland-road, and observed a waggon, with two bundles on the shafts, going towards town. The waggoner was with it, and three men walked by the side, rather behind, the prisoner was one of them. I went up and spoke to the waggoner, then one of the men came up and asked my business, and where I was going? I said I had been to meet my mother, who was coming up by the waggon, but she was not come. I walked on till we came nearly to Essex-street, Kingsland - there one of the men gave the waggoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180039"></xptr>some money and left him, the other two went on with the waggon. It was just before we came to Kingsland turnpike. I first saw the waggon nearly a mile from Shoreditch Church. One of the men that remained had a grey-coloured coat and the other a blue one, the prisoner was one of them. The man who left had a black coat and waistcoat - the prisoner had a blue coat, light waistcoat, and boots on. Before the man in the black coat went away the one in the grey coat stepped back and said to the other two (one of whom was the prisoner)</p>
               <p>"Shall we take our luggage off here?" I did not hear what answer was given, or which answered - they did not take it off. The man in the black coat left, and the waggon proceeded up to the Mail Coach, public-house, about one hundred yards nearer to Shoreditch than Essex-street. It stopped, and the waggoner said to them,</p>
               <p>"You had better take your luggage off here before I go any further" - they were both together at the time. The man in the grey coat then went round to the horse on the offside of the waggon, and the prisoner came on the nearside. I observed him push very close towards the waggon, apparently to take the luggage off - he was close to the luggage. I went round and caught hold of the other man, called a man to my assistance, and gave him to that man, while I ran after the prisoner, who had set off as soon as he saw us scuffle (that man escaped). I ran after the prisoner, and gave an alarm of Stop thief! Two or three people tried to stop him, he knocked one or two of them down. He was not ten yards from me all the time. He had a nosegay in his hand, which he threw apparently at my face, but it went against the wall. He stumbled on some rubbish, and I gained ground on him. He tried to get through a door but could not; he then put his hand into his pocket, and threw away a canvas bag, it went on a shed close by - I saw some skeleton keys fall out of it; another person picked them up. I secured and took him to the Cherry Tree, public-house, searched him, and found a small crow, a snuff-box with tinder in it, a steel, and a small piece of wax-candle. The bundles were left on the waggon till I returned; I took them into the public-house. I found a surplice, and about fifty-five yards of black cloth in them - I compared it with that in the church. it appeared to be the same. A piece remained on the sounding-board, which I produce - I compared it with the cloth. it matched with the rest of the cloth, and fitted the different parts of the Church. I saw the skeleton keys tried, they opened the vestry-door; those I saw tried did not open the doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you overtake the waggon - A. It was between ten minutes and a quarter before five o'clock when I was at Shoreditch church. I had been out on duty till past one that night. The man who came and spoke to me walked at a greater distance from the waggon than the others, but they were altogether when I first saw them, and kept together till he came and spoke to me. I saw them for a hundred yards before I came up to them. I do not know whether the other man put his hand on the luggage. I did not see the prisoner lay his hand on it, as I drew back. As soon as he saw me draw back, a signal was given and he ran. I saw the prisoner hold out his arms, as if to take it.</p>

            . I am a waggoner. On the 30th of June I was coming to town from Cambridgeshire - when I got a little on this side the Two Brewers, at Ponder's End, in the parish of Enfield, a man came up, and asked if I would take a parcel as far as Shoreditch church for him? I said he might bring it and lay it on the shafts if he liked - this was about twenty minutes past two o'clock. He said</p>
               <p>"Very well, my mate is just by with it," or</p>
               <p>"them." He was dressed in a dark or blue coat; then a man came up in a grey coat, with a parcel in a bag, and the man who first spoke brought a parcel in a silk handkerchief - we put them on the shafts, and the man in the grey coat said,</p>
               <p>"Give me the whip, and I will drive for you;" he did so, and I sat on the shaft, laid my head on the bag, and went to sleep. I awoke near Tottenham, got up, and looked back - the two men were then walking together, and one was driving - this was about three miles from Ponder's End - the prisoner was one of the two that were walking. The man who drove gave me the whip, and waited till the other two joined him, then all came on together. The man in the dark coat had got a handful of flowers out of a garden; I saw the prisoner with the nosegay afterwards. I went on with the waggon; they all walked conversing together. I heard Mead examined, his account is correct. The man in the dark coat went away before the other two - he gave me 1 s. for bringing the parcels. The prisoner and the other came on. I stopped opposite the public-house, and told them to take their parcels off; they were then on the path. The man in the grey coat went on the off-side, and the prisoner came up to the horse on the near side - I did not see him do anything. An alarm was given, the prisoner then went round the hind part of the waggon and ran away. I remained with my waggon, Mead pursued.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The man who came up to you at Ponder's End was not the prisoner - A. I cannot tell. I first saw the third man at Tottenham. I cannot say which it was, as I took little notice. The man in the grey coat drove. The bundles lay between the shafts, they might be reached from either side - the largest was more on the off-side than the other; the nearside was the handiest to get the least bundle. The man who first spoke to me in the dark coat had the small bundle, and the prisoner went nearest to the small one, when I said,</p>
               <p>"Take your bundle."</p>

            . I live in Kingsland-road. On the morning of the 1st of July I heard an alarm of Stop thief! I went out and saw the prisoner running down the road with a nosegay in his hand; I came in contact with him at the corner of Union-street, he ran down there and I after him; he placed himself against the wall, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have I done?" the officer said</p>
               <p>"You have robbed a church, you know it." He then put his hand into his pocket, and took out something bright, which I supposed to be a crow, and said</p>
               <p>"D - n my eyes, I will serve you out!" I thought it was a knife, and immediately ran from him. He struck a blow with his fist, and knocked a man down, who was behind me. He returned from the lower end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180040"></xptr>the street, and ran towards Union-road, took a bag of keys from his pocket, and threw it on a high shed - I got it off the shed. One of the keys fell out of the bag, and it contained two double and one single one; there were only two in the bag. I tried the keys to the church; one opened the vestry-door. I found a large needle near his feet at the public-house, after he was searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you try them to the church-door - A. None of them would fit. I saw the bundles, they were done up in a bag, and directed to Mr. Robinson, Tailor, Houndsditch, it was sewn with the same sort of twine as that in the needle.</p>

               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. What are you - A. A carpenter, and work for Mr. Clark. The prisoner is a bricklayer, he takes jobs for himself. I did not go before the magistrate, as I did not hear of this till Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first called on to be a witness - A. The day before yesterday; I did not hear he was taken up for a week or a fortnight after the robbery. I understood he was in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you heard of it on Saturday night A.- I heard he was absent. I never heard about what hour the robbery was committed. Speering knew and saw him as well as me.</p>

I saw him go out and fastened the door after him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODERICK. Q. Will you swear you saw him go out at half-past two o'clock - A. Yes; I came here part of the way with Sidnell; we both talked about what we were coming here for. I told him more than a week ago that I remembered hearing the hour cried, and since that we have often spoke of it. He said he remembered hearing the watchman call the hour, and so did I. I cannot say that I saw Speering when the prisoner called me. Our rooms are both on one floor; I did not hear him speak to the prisoner.</p>

             re-examined. Tottenham is five miles from Shoreditch. I should think it is six or seven miles from Whitechapel. I first came up to the waggon about a mile from Shoreditch Church, and got to the church at twelve minutes before five; I took particular notice. I was at the church before I saw the waggon. I had been to town, and was returning; it was about five when I met him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry John Lewis, who is in Australia. I keep a general shop, in Gun-street, Spitalfields. On 10th Dec., about a quarter past 1 o'clock in the day, the prisoner came, and asked the price of bread—I told him 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked for a half quartern loaf—I gave it to him—it came to 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I gave him the change, and put the shilling in the till, where there was only a sixpence, which I gave him—I afterwards went to the till, and found that the shilling was bad—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the date is 1820—I bit it, and there is the mark of my teeth on it—I put it on a shelf on the window, apart from other money—about half-past 2 o'clock the prisoner came again, and asked for some butter, tea, and sugar—I recognised him—he put down a shilling; I looked at it—it was bad—I called my brother, and told him to shut the door, which he did—I then took the other shilling from the shelf, and having got both shillings in my hand, I spoke to the prisoner about it—he said he had not been in the shop before—I am certain he is the same person—he said if they were bad, his master gave them to him for his work—a policeman was sent for, and he was given in charge, with the shillings.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector Woolwich Arsenal</hi>). on 20th February I was on duty—I received information and noticed this bearing in this handkerchief under some deals in a shed in the store timberfield—I undid the handkerchief and gave instructions to Cull—on the Saturday I saw the prisoner coming towards the Plumstead gate followed by a constable—as he was going out the constable touched him on the shoulder and said "Come this way"—he brought the prisoner in and pulled this bearing from his overcoat pocket, which he was carrying on his arm—I said "Is there anything else?" and the prisoner pulled a bearing out of his trousers pocket—he said "I do not know how I come to do it"—he previously said that he picked this one up in the fore part of the week near the proof square—the bearings are in a good state of preservation and would be used again—lots of them lie about at the Arsenal—they are the Queen's property—the prisoner is a foreman.</p>

I am attached to the Woolwich Arsenal—on 20th February I received directions from Inspector Parker—I watched the Arsenal from Wednesday till Saturday, when I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner walk through the shed and look towards the entrance gate—he turned round and took this metal bearing, which was wrapped in this handkerchief, from under some deals in a shed, placed it in his coat pocket, and started towards the gate—I followed him to the gate—when he was going out I apprehended him and took him into the inspector's office—I told him to take the bearing from his pocket—he produced this one—I asked him if he had any more on him—he said he had, and produced these two from his trousers pocket—I asked him where he got them from—these said that he picked them up near the proof office, near the Royal gun factories, that he picked one up in the fore part of the week and con<lb></lb>cealed it under the deals.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 92, White Lion-street, Pentonville, and keep an oil-shop; I know the prisoner, he lodged at my house about eight or nine weeks, the outside; he had not quitted there as I know of, he continued lodging up to the 4th of April; I never saw the woman that lived with him come to the lodging; he did not come home from the 4th to the 28th; he had two rooms up two pair of stairs; he slept there three or four nights, not more; he bought a pencil or two of me, but I thought it belonged to his business; he asked me whether I sold white varnish; I said I had none, but could tell him where to get it; a Mrs. Hindmarsh, who took the apartments for him, came to him twice one Sunday, he was up stairs, but he desired our lad to say he was not at home; there was a young man visited him twice, he did not go up stairs, but spoke to him in the shop; he asked me if Mr. Holt was at home, he came down, and the young man bought a few brushes. Mr. Holt said, I did not know, Mrs. Painter, that you sold brushes, for I use a good many in my business. I remember Mr. Loaring coming to my house, it was the prisoner's apartment he saw, he paid five shillings a week; I shewed Mr. Loaring the apartment, there was a cup in it, and a piece of paper, that gentleman found in the room, and a table with Indian-ink on it. When I taxed Mr. Holt with not being at home regularly at night, he said, Mrs. Painter, you are regular people, don't fet up for me; for any time, I can sleep any where for a shilling. When he came to my lodging, he had an excellent character; I was informed he was a landscape painter, and brushes are used by them.(

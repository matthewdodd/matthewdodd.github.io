                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer and builder in Snow's-fields. I have the lease of a house and shop in Mermaid-row, Bermondsey—I have known the prisoner three or four years—he is a labouring man, a handy man—he has worked for me from time to time—he had cleaned out the house in question about a fortnight before the fire—on the day of the fire, I found fault with him for leaving his tools about, and got another man to work—he muttered a something; I do not know what, for I walked away from him—I was at the house on Thursday, 29th November, to show it to a person; it was empty—there was no furniture in it—between 2 and 3 o'clock on the morning of the 26th, I was roused from my sleep—I dressed and went to the house with a policeman—I saw the stairs smoking; they had been in fames—five of them were destroyed—a quantity of rags was lying on the stairs, and some matches, half consumed—they appeared to be greasy rags—I saw the prisoner—he came to my door, I believe, in charge of the constable; that was the first time that I saw him that morning—my superior landlord is Captain Henry Creed, of St. Albans—the fire had been extinguished when I got to the house, it was still smoking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live at 126, Snow's-fields, at the corner of Ship and Mermaid-row, fifteen or twenty yards from the prisoner's house. On Tuesday morning, 26th November, I was returning home about 2 o'clock, and my attention was drawn to the smell of fire, as I was passing the row—I looked down, and saw smoke and a light issuing from the first-floor window of Mr. Cropper's house—knowing the house to be uninhabited, I went and hallooed to know whether there was anyone there—I received no answer—I immediately ran and knocked at my own door—my son came and opened it, and we returned to the place—as I got back to the honse, I saw the prisoner coming out of the gate of the house—he closed it behind him—I went up to him, placed my hand on his shoulder, and asked him if he had been in there to sleep, or whether he had been kindling a fire in the room (I knew him before)—he said, no, he had not—I drew his attention to the smoke, and so did my son, and I then said to my son, "Fetch a policeman directly"—the prisoner said he would go either for a policeman or an engine—I said, "No, Jack; you shall not budge an inch from where you are"—my son went, and returned with a policeman—I drew his attention to the smoke—he asked the way to get in—the prisoner took him to the door—I told the prisoner that he knew that door was fast—he then took the policeman to the gate, as if to open it, but he pressed his hand against it—the policeman put his hand to it, and opened it, and he said, "Why, these gates are open!"—that was the gate I had seen the prisoner come out of—we all went in, and I saw the staircase on fire, and likewise an accumulation of rags the full width of the staircase, burning, and the flames rushing up the stairs—I should say there were as many rags as you might take lightly in your arms—they were only on one stair—I ordered my son to fetch some water, and the prisoner followed him out, and the prisoner threw the water up the stairs—the fire was put out—there were two or three quantities of water fetched—I did not see any</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 108). I got to the premises between 2 and 3 o'clock; it was then smoking—I found the prisoner, Mr. Jones, and my brother constable, at Mr. Cropper's door—in consequence of what Jones said to me, I kept my eye on the prisoner—I followed him to Mr. Cropper's door, and said I wanted him to go with me to the station; with that Mr. Cropper opened his door, and said, "Take that man into custody," pointing to the prisoner—but I had got him in custody then—the prisoner was knocking at Mr. Cropper's door at the time—I told him that I wanted to take him to the station about the fire—he said, "What is Jones going to say about it?"—I said I did not know—he said, "He set it on fire, not me"—I searched him, and found a lucifer loose in his pocket.</p>

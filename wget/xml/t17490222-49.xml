I lost two lawn aprons Wednesday was three weeks, and a silk handkerchief; I did not know who took them; I was sitting in the fore parlour. Cassey came in the next day, and ask'd for the gentlewoman, that is Mrs. Clark, to know whether she had lost two aprons; she said she had; he said he would tell her what was become of them, if she would not hurt him; she said she would not hurt him. I was by. He said he was indebted to his landlady fourpence halfpeny for gin , and he had left them with her; then the gentlewoman of the house said she would go with him ; and then he said he had pawned them for eighteen pence. I was for having a man to go with him; says he, no man shall go with you; but we ordered it so, that a man walked behind cassey and me, and he did not perceive it. We went into St. Giles's; he went to his lodgings there, and he desired the man's daughter to go and get them; he had given them to her to pawn; she said she would not get them without the money, saying she had two shillings and sixpence upon them; cassey said she had but one shilling and sixpence; then he said they were pawn'd to a woman that was in Bridewell. We took cassey a day or two after before the Justice; he said he sold the handkerchief for three pence; but at first he said it was pick'd out of his pocket. I have nothing to say against the woman at the bar, any farther, than cassey said she forced him to steal them: she did own she had sixpence of the money. cassey staid at his lodgings, and the woman went for the things, and I owned them at first sight.</p>

On the 6th of August, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, alone, and asked for nothing, but was handling a piece of cheque. I was waiting on some customers - nobody was serving but myself, in a moment or two, she turned round and asked if I wanted any mats, I said "No," and she went out; in a minute or two, Mrs. Ballard came in, and I immediately missed a piece of cloth which was close to the cheque - it measured twenty-six yards. I then went out, saw her within twenty yards of the shop, and took the cloth from under her apron; she begged of me to take my property, and let her go about her business.</p>

I asked the price of a bit of cheque, and went out, and came to an archway, where a man asked me to take this cloth for him, and he would pay me - the lady came up, and would not let me stop for the man who gave it to me.</p>

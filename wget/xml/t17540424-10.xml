            . I am a carpenter, and was at work in the house in fixing the goods for the prosecutor, who was just removed to it. Being called by the last evidence I saw the glass lying in the window, and the prisoner standing by the door. I knew that it was just before screwed up to the wainscot. The woman walked off, but was soon brought back.</p>

               <p>I went in to get a handful of shavings, but on my going out that evidence asked me what I did with them. I went back and laid them down; he then said, It was this glass that you had. They bid me get away, but after that came and took me back, and said I took the glass. I said I did not, but they hurried me away to the Gatehouse directly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Revear. Did you see the glass in her possession ?</p>
               <p>Revear. I did, and saw her put it down in the window.</p>

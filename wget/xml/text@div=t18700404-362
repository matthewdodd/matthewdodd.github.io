I am foreman to Charles Pembroke, butcher, High Street, Forest Hill—on Saturday night, 5th March, about 8lbs. of brisket of beef was safe in his shop, at 12 o'clock—Sergeant Fox came to me and said he wished to go into the shop—I went in and found that the piece of beef had gone—I had left it hanging up in front of a ventilating hole in the shutter, large enough for it to be got through—it could have been reached by a person standing on the window-sill—I misted it at 8 o'clock next morning—I saw it next at the police-station—I know it was the same piece.</p>

At 6.15, on the morning of 6th March, I met the two prisoners together, at Forest Hill, going from the direction of the prosecutor's shop, and about twenty yards from it—when they saw me Curd went on in front, and Walsh lagged behind—I went after Curd and said "Where are you going?"—he said "Going home"—I said "What have you got about you?"—he said "Nothing—I said "You have got something under your coat," and I saw a piece of beef—I said "Where did you get this from?"—he said "I found it in a water-closet"—I brought him back to Walsh, and he said "No, I did not find it in a water-closet, I found it in a urinal at the Dartford Arms—Welsh said "Yet, I saw him pick it up—I took them in custody for the unlawful possession of the beef—I went to Mr. Pembroke's shop, and saw some marks under the hole of the ventilator—I then went into the shop with Alloway, and he said he had missed a piece of beef—he went to the station with me and identified the beef.</p>

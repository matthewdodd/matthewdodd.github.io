            . I am clerk to Mr. Myers. On the evening of the 26th, I watched the prisoner, and saw him leave the shop with a basket. I went after him over into Bishopsgate-street, and asked where he was going, and what he had got; he made no answer. I brought him back, he said he hoped I would say nothing to Mr. Myers. It contained a cod fish, and four pair of soles; I said I must inform Mr. Myers, he said, then he would send him to gaol, and he must go off. I called Mr. Myers, and we overtook him by the Exchange.</p>

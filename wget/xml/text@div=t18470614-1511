                  </hi>. I am a smith and farrier, in the employ of Mr. Jones, in Great Leonard-street, Shoreditch. The prisoner worked there for about fourteen months—he left on the Saturday evening before Easter Sunday—he came to the shop on Monday, the 31st of May, about half-past six o'clock in the evening—I was working there—he had left some tools there—he came to fetch them away—I think he had some beer—he was there a quarter of an hour before I spoke to him—I was at work at the forge making a shoe for a gentleman—I was half an hour about it, and he kept on blackguarding me—I told him to be quite and hold his tongue—I had done that shoe and then I went to do another little job—he came up to me and, "Jarvis, you are a d—d thief, and a rogue"—I said, "If you call me that again, I will give you in charge"—I pushed him from me, and told him to go away, and come when Mr. Jones was at home—at that time he had got his tools in his apron, and he said, "You are Mr. Jones's foreman, look at what tools I have got"—I looked, and saw a hammer which did not belong to the prisoner—it had been there two years before he-came—he had put a handle in this ham<lb></lb>mer, and was going to take it away—I told him it was not his—he said, "If it is Mr. Jones's hammer, it is my handle, and I will saw it off"—some time after I went to put my hand to him to take the hammer, and I said, "You go away"—he said, "I will go when I like"—I went to put my hand to it and he took up the hammer and hit me twice on the head with it—I bled a great deal, and was taken to the surgeon—I was in bed from Monday till Thursday, and did not leave my room till Saturday—I had not struck the prisoner before I received those blows.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at Mr. Jones's—I remember on the evening of the 31st May, the prisoner coming to the shop—Jarvis was there—I left the shop for about ten minutes, while the prisoner was there—when I came back Jarvis and the prisoner were wrangling—the prisoner was abusing Jarvis—I told him he had better come in the morning, when Mr. Jones was at home—I was about to leave the shop, I heard a noise, turned round and saw the prisoner strike Jarvis twice with the hammer—a man took the hammer from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Jones's service. On the evening of the 31st of May, I was on the stairs which look into the shop—the prisoner came for his tools—he had been there some time—I heard him ask Jarvis to look at his tools—Jarvis said he did not want anything to do with him, to go out of the shop—after he laid his tools down on his apron in the shop, Jarvis saw a hammer, he said it was his master's, and the prisoner should not take it away—the prisoner called Jarvis a d—d thief and a rouge—Jarvis told him to go out of the shop, he did not want anything to say to him—the prisoner came round to Jarvis, while Jarvis was at work by the fire, Jarvis turned round and said if he did not go he would pull his nose—he put his hand to his face, I did not see whether he pulled his nose—they were quarrelling for some time—I did not hear what they said—they walked down the shop as if they were going out of the gate—Jarvis put his hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and said he would take the hammer from him, he should not take it out of the shop—the prisoner turned round and struck him twice on the head with the hammer—I was frightened, and went away.</p>

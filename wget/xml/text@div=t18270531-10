On the 11th of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner shoreing fish from the fish-boat to the stairs - he, (being a waterman plying at those stairs), contrived to get his wherry between the fish-boat and the stairs, and as he carried the fish on shore, he contrived to drop part of the fish into his own boat; there was no occasion for his boat to be there; after the fish-boat was unladen, all but two fish, he went on board, and took out two plaice, which he put into his own wherry - he then put the board of the wherry over the fish to conceal them - I then desired my man to go on shore, while I hired a boat, and went round in his rear to secure him - I got round without his perceiving me - he was in his own boat - I told him he had got stolen fish there; he said he had not; my man got into his boat, and under the boards we found sixteen Dutch plaice and two maids; he said he would not be taken out of his boat, but we secured him; he surrendered quietly; the fish belonged to Mr. Spashett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was the boat Hero there? A. That is the boat he took the fish from - I never knew him in Mr. Hall's employ; they have 1s. for carrying the fish from the boat - I never knew any fish given to them besides.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Goldham's employ. I saw the prisoner coming on shore with fish in his own wherry; when he delivered the fish he kept part back in his wherry; he sheered up from the stairs, and went to another fish-boat, which I believe is called the Hero - he took two maids and put them into his own boat. Mr. Goldham went to him, and said, "You have got some fish there;" he said he had not - I took up the boards and found the fish under them; they could not have dropped through there by accident; he then said he would not be taken out of his own boat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know him very well? A. I have seen him about for four months - I carry a few fish when master tells me - I take the condemned fish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you take a few when you think you are badly paid? A. No.</p>

            . The Hero is my boat. I have partners - I did not see the prisoner till about eight o'clock on this morning; these plaice would have sold for about 6s., and the maids for 1s. - I had not given them to him, nor was he employed to land any fish from our boat - I paid another man 12s. to shore them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not persons you employ hire others to help them? A. We had three men; but he was neither of them; they sometimes employ others, but none were wanting.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was hired by the waterman to bring the fish on shore for 1s.; the man on board said I was to have a bit of fish as well.</p>
               <p>MR. GOLDHAM re-examined. I saw the waterman who brought Spashett's fish on shore give the prisoner 1s.; it is usual for them to get men to help them; he gave him the 1s. on board the Hero - I do not consider that the waterman was at all implicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. In 1846 I Jived in Millman-street, Bedford-row. On 31st Aug. 1846, I fell in with a person named Philip Magnus—Imade a complaint against him of robbing me, and attended next day before Mr. Aid. Wilson, at Guildhall, and charged him—what I said was taken down—I signed it—this is my signature—I received a paper, placing me under 401 penalty to appear, and as far as that paper went I knew that I ought toattend the trial of Philip Magnus—Maria Allen lived with me—she wentwith me to Guildhall—before we went into the Court, Hannah Decastro cameup and asked if we knew what time the Court opened—I said I thoughttwelve o'clock—she said, "Are you going?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "What for?"—I said, "To give evidence against a young man for picking my pocket—she said, "Come here, my dear, I want to speak to you"—Maria Allen went on one side—Mrs. Decastro said, "He is my next doorneighbour; I have very great respect for him, and if you will not go, I willtake you anywhere you like, and you shall have what you like"—Allen heard it—the prisoner called on me the next Monday morning alone—he said he cameto see me concerning the prisoner Philip Magnus, to see what be could dorespecting ray not appearing, and said the family were very respectable, oneof the sisters kept a shop in Chancery-lane and another in Gray's-inn-road;(which I found she did;) that he was very ill, and his wife was just confined, and for the sake of his wife and family wished me not to press against him—I said I was under 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bail</hi> to appear—he said he that was of no more conse<lb></lb>quencethan the dust under his feet—I said I was afraid it was—he said heknew the law, as he was in the law, and was always brought up to the law—two days afterwards the prisoner came again with Mrs. Israel, as far as I canrecollect, but I was very ill—they pressed me not to appear—Mrs. Israeloffered to send me a physician, and Mr. Lazarus offered to send me a bottleof wine and a physician, if I would not appear—Mrs. Israel said I shouldhave a home in her bouse, sit at her table, and be one of her own family, if I would not appear—Allen was with me—they wanted me to go outof town—I cannot say which asked me—I went that evening to inquirewhether they were respectable, as Mrs. Israel said her husband was a tax<lb></lb>gatherer—I found they were very respectable—I do not know whether itwas that evening, but we went to Mrs. Israel's house, and saw her and herhusband, who took a sovereign out, offered it me, and said I must be in wantof money, having had my money taken from me by the prisoner—Allen wassitting by me, and told me not to take it—Mrs. Israel said her brother wasgoing to be married—she did not mention bis name—when we went downinto the shop the prisoner was there, and asked us to go to the wedding, and offered to lend us his sister's clothes, white or satin dresses, or anythingwe liked—I said I would not go if my own clothes were not fit to go in—on 15th Sept., Mrs. Israel and Mrs. Decastro came about eight o'clock, before I was up—I got up, and saw them—Mrs. Israel had been to me theprevious evening to know how it was to be settled—I said we bad better goto the Court, and let the Magistrate decide it—she came next morning ingreat distress, with her sister, and said her mother and all her friends werevery much cut up—I would not consent to go away unless I had a lawyer'sadvice—they had offered to Lake me to any lawyer I liked to go to—they</p>

               <p>said Lazarus would be there in a few minutes—he came, and said he hadcome to take me so any lawyer I liked, and we went out with that view—on going along he said Mr. Wooller was always considered very clever insuch cases, but he did not know where he lived, and so he would inquire in astationer's shop—Maria Allen was with us—we went into a stationer's, andlooked at a directory, and then went to Mr. Wooller—Lazarus told him thatthe prisoner was a friend of mine, and I did not wish to prosecute—I do notknow whether he said the prisoner's name—I said, "Mr. Wooller, I wishyou quite to understand what it is"—I showed him my recognizance, andsaid I had no animosity against the party, and wished to do what was righton both sides; but I did not want to place myself in any da Dger—Mr. Wooller said he recollected hearing of the case, and if I acted according tohis directions I might do it with perfect safety; that it was a thing that wasdone every day; that we must go out of town, but he must know where wewere, and we should be perfectly safe if we acted under his directions—I leftthe recognizance with him—Lazarus gave Mr. Wooller his card, and promisedto let him know where we were—he said he would conduct the trial, and ifwe were wanted he would send for us—I saw no money paid to Wooller, but Lazarus had money in his hand when we were speaking, and he sent me and Allen out of the room, and joined us in about three minutes—we then allwent to Mrs. Israel's—she said she had written to a person, who she fre-quentlystopped with at Gravesend, for apartments, and she wished us to godown that afternoon—I said we could not go that day, for we could not leaveour lodging without giving a week's notice—she said if we paid for the weekit would not signify, and gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the rent, and half-a-crown to payour coach-hire to the Grotto Tavern, with our luggage, and she would meetus there—we packed up our things, and went to the Grotto—we met Mrs. Israel in Holborn—we were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and she followed us to the Grotto—Allen stopped with the luggage—I went with Mrs. Israel to Chancery-lane, to see if Elizabeth Magnus was come—we found her, and went back to the Grotto, and took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Blackfriars-bridge—we got on the packet, and then Mrs. Israel said she had a letter from Gravesend saying that the apartmentswere full—we all went to Woolwich—Mrs. Israel took apartments of a Mrs. Dawson, and told her she had brought me down for the benefit of my health, and her sister was come to accompany me, and would wait on us—Mrs. Israel went home that night—Mrs. Decastro was the first person who visitedus; it was the next day, or the next but one—she went back the same. Day—on the Sunday Lazarus came down—I did not converse with him; I waslying on the sofa, very ill—he went back the same day—I think Mrs. Israelcame on the Tuesday, and I think Lazarus did—I am not sure whether hecame twice or three times—on Thursday, Mrs. Israel and James Magnuscame, and before Magnus had been there five minutes he offered, metwo handfulls of sovereigns, and said, "Miss Davis, you must be inwant of money; my brother has taken yours; you are welcome to as much as you like, but don't say anything about it to any of your friends"—Allenwas not present—I said I did not want money from any of them, I did notwant to make anything by it—Allen then came in with the tea—next day, Friday, Mrs. Israel came down about dinner-time, and shortly afterwards Lazarus and James Magnus came to fetch us home, as I had said" I could notstop longer than Friday, whether it was settled or not—Lazarus said it wasall over, and the prisoner was released—Mrs. Israel wanted us to stop till Tuesday, when our week was up—Lazarus was present—I objected—shesaid she wanted to stop for the benefit of her health—we all went home by</p>

                  </hi>. In Sept., 1846, I kept a lodging-house in Woolwich—Ilet some apartments to Mrs. Magnus—she was in the house the whole of thetime with Davis and Allen—they staid eleven days—they frequently hadvisitors—the prisoner was one—he came on Sunday with a basket of provi<lb></lb>sions, again on Wednesday and on Friday—when the trial was over hefetched them home with another man, if not two—Elizabeth Magnus usedto give Allen money to fetch things in—Davis was ill and never fetched any<lb></lb>thing—they very seldom went out.</p>

Davis and Allen occupied two rooms there, for nine orten days—the prisoner came, I think, twice—they went away with a Jewessand two more people who came down to fetch them—I do not rememberseeing the prisoner that day.</p>

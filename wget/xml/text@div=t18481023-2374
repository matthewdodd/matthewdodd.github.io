                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector, B</hi>). In consequence of a letter I received on 14th Oct., I went to Mr. Baring's, 13, Eaton-place, Belgrave-square, about eight o'clock in the evening—I saw the housekeeper, and in consequence of what she told me, I desired a constable that I had left outside to go in pursuit of the prisoner—I waited at the door, and he soon returned with the prisoner and a basket—I took her into the housekeeper's room, and</p>

               <p>desired her to put the basket on the table, which she did—I then said, "I have received information that you have lately been delivered of a child"—she said, "Yes, sir, I am sorry to say I have"—I said, "Where is it?"—she pointed to the basket, and said, "It is in that basket"—(I did not tell her she was not bound to answer my questions unless she chose—I told her who I was, and my business)—I said, "When was it born?"—she said. "on Saturday last, between two and three o'clock"—I said, "How long did it live?"—she said, "Only a few minutes"—I said, "Where were you going to take it?"—she said, "To a woman in Chelsea, who promised to bury it for me"—after this, she said, "Oh, sir, what do you think will be done to me; tell me your real opinion; do you think I shall be hanged?"—I said, "It is impossible I can know "—she said, "I would not have done it, if that woman had not promised to put it out of the way"—I then took her to the station, and the basket also—Mr. Pearce, a surgeon, was called in—I examined the basket in his presence, and found it to contain the dead body of a male child, forced into this stocking—the whole of it was forced into the stocking, headforemost—a mark, which was on the upper part of the stocking, was cut out—it was wrapped round with this piece of gown, and I found a gown of the same stuff in the prisoner's bed-room—I searched the room, but could not find any baby-linen, or anything of the kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mr. Baring, Eaton-place. The prisoner was cook there, and had been in the service five months—at the time this matter occurred, the family were out of town—I, the prisoner, and the housemaid, were the only persons there—I spoke to the prisoner several times about her supposed pregnancy—I said I thought she was in the family-way; she always denied it, and said she was not—I last spoke to her about it about a month before the policeman came—on the Sunday before he came, I asked her what had been the matter with her, and she said she had a very bad sick headache—I said I saw a little difference in her size.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PEARCE</hi>. I am surgeon to the police. On 14th Oct., I was desired to examine the body of a child at the station-house—Inspector Cum<lb></lb>ings was present—it presented the appearance of a full-grown male infant, born at the full period—it had eighteen inches of the umbilical cord attached to it, which had been divided, without any ligature, and the body had been forced into the half of a stocking—I opened the body, examined the chest, removed the lungs and heart, and from the appearance they presented, I was fully satisfied that the child had respired—the lungs did not appear to have been completely inflated—it is sometimes the case that a child will have a partial or even a full respiration before it actually leaves the mother's body—there was extravasated blood within the lips; the eyes were strongly injected with blood, and the membranes of the brain, and the brain itself, gorged with blood; those symptoms are all referable to pressure—I cannot say confidently that those symptoms must have been occasioned by pressure after the child had wholly left the mother's body—there were no marks of external violence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In your experience, how long a time have you known the head of an infant to be protruded from the body of the mother, and the remaining portion of the body to remain within? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Without assistance it night be an hour or more—in the course of that time a child would breathe—the amount of my judgment in this case is, that the child had been alive</p>

            . The prisoner came and knocked at my window, and told me, she had something for my child. I opened the door; she gave my child three halfpence, and said, she had got a watch; she said, a black had picked it up in Gray's-inn-lane, and wanted me to sell it for her. I asked her where she lived? she said, with one Williams, that kept a green-stall in a court at the further end of Gray's-inn lane. I said, stay here, and I'll help you to a customer for it. I carried it to my landlord; he bid me keep it till it was advertised. I went back again, and desired the prisoner to go with me to her master At first she said she would, but after that, she would not; I said, I was afraid it was her master's watch. She burst out a crying, and said it was. Then I went to enquire for one Williams, and by enquiring about, found the prosecutor out, [The watch produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor, who knew it by a dent on the back of the case.]</p>

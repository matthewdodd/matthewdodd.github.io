                  </hi> I am a tailor, at Knightsbridge. On the evening of 14th Oct. the prisoner case to my shop, about half-past nine o'clock, for some work—I was engaged in the cutting-room—she advanced three-parts down the shop, she retreated a little, and went to a side counter, where there was a long brass rod, with about twenty pieces of waistcoating on it—I went on the opposite side of the cutting-room, and by the reflection of a looking-glass I saw her distinctly take a piece of waistcoating from the bar, and put it under her arm—she came into the middle of the shop directly—I went to let a gentleman out, and the prisoner walked back to the cutting-room—I asked her to step up stairs—my wife went up before her, and I after her—when she got within four steps of the top, she stopped, and laid down the waistcoat-piece on the stairs—I said, "You brought it from the brass rod thus far, you might as well have taken it all the way"—she said, "Me, sir?"—I said, "Yes, I saw you take it"—my wife said, "Yes, I saw her too"—I said to a female, "Get a policeman;" but I told her not to get one—I gave her into custody afterwards.</p>

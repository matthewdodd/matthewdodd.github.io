Spinks was in my employ as bar-man—Beckwith had been in a great many times during the day in question—on the 17th of May, among other things, I marked this half-crown, which Mrs. Kershaw got, and the officer marked it also—here are two black marks on the top of the crown—it is marked differently from the others that were put into the till—Brannan brought Beckwith into the counting-house, and this half-crow was taken out of his pocket, and some halfpence—I do not recollect any<lb></lb>thing else—the officer said to him, "Do you call these halfpence?"—Spinks then said, "I gave him change for a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, for half-a-pint of stout"—they were both sober—there was more silver on him than the change for a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece.</p>

             a Porter, depos'd, He was call'd to the Prisoner to the Marine Coffee-house in Birchin Lane, who sent him with the Bill to receive the Money of Messieurs Woodward; and that he asking the Prisoner his Name, he told him it was in the Bill, which Name was Thomas Smith, which made him think the Prisoner's Name was so; but they suspecting the Bill, refus'd to pay it, and Mr. Woodward went with him to the Prisoner, to the Coffee-house. Mr. Woodward depos'd, That having some Suspicion of the Note, though Mr. Cavendish's Hand was very nearly imitated, he went with the Porter to the Marine Coffee-house, to the Prisoner, and there asking him if his Name was Thomas Smith, he reply'd, No, but it was Yewel: That he was just come from Portsmouth, and had receiv'd that Note of one Thomas Smith, a Clerk in the King's Yard at Portsmouth. That then he desir'd him to leave the Bill with him, while he sent to enquire of the Reality of it, and took an Account where the Prisoner lodg'd; which being done, he sent to Mr. Cavendish, who acquainted him that it was counterfeit, for he had drawn no such Bill on him. Mr. Cavendish depos'd, He had drawn no such Bill, nor knew no such Person as Thomas Smith, and had sent to enquire, but could not hear of any such Person. That as to the Bill, it was not his Hand-Writing; but the Prisoner having formerly been his Clerk, and having written Abundance for him, he knew his Hand so perfectly well, that he could take, upon him to swear, that the Body of the Bill was the Prisoner's own Writing, for there seem'd to be two Hands. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, insisting that he had it from Thomas Smith aforesaid; and being call'd upon to prove it, said he could do it, but that the Person who could prove it was gone to Ostend. The Fact being plainly prov'd the Jury found him <rs id="t17240117-68-verdict344" type="verdictDescription">

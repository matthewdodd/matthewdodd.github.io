                  </hi>. I keep the Chancellor's Head public-house, in Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On the 23rd of July I took four shillings out of my pocket, and placed it on the table early in the morning—I missed the money for a time, and then found it secreted under a china ornament on the same dressing-table or chest of drawers—I marked the shillings on the head and left them where I had found them—the next day I missed them—I made a communication to Hopper—I then called up the prisoner, who was my ser<lb></lb>vant, and asked if she knew about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had left on my table—she said, "Yes, I saw them there to-day or yesterday"—I said, "Will you accompany me up stairs?"—she said "Yes"—she went up with me and the policeman—she went to the ornament, and said she would swear that they were there—I said, "I know they were, but I want to know where they are"—she said, "I know nothing about them, I am innocent"—I had her searched, and nothing was found—I searched the kitchen, and between a partition and the dresser there was a chopping-board—I pulled it out, and a roll of brown paper, folded up, came out with it—I found in it some cigars, some sugar, four shillings, three of which were those I had marked, and sixpennyworth of halfpence—she said, "I am innocent"—the policeman said, "Who do the halfpence belong to?"—she said, "To me"—he said, "How many are there?"—she said, "6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth"—with respect to the other money, she said, "I brought them down, and intended to give them over the counter to Miss Catharine, but I forgot it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old. I live with my father—I worked with the prisoner—on Monday, the 2nd of April, I had been out for some eggs—when I came back my mistress, Mrs. Clark, was in the room—the prisoner came in, and I gave him the change—he said, "What makes yon so long making it out, you rogue? you are cheating me"—my mistress said, "Give the boy time"—the prisoner said something to her, and she gave him a <hi rend="italic">punch</hi>. and knocked him off his chair, and ran out of the house—he did not do any thing to her—I told the Magistrate this—I did not see him do any thing—nobody has been speaking to me since I was before the Magistrate—I told him the same as I say now. (The prosecutrix being called, did not appear.)</p>

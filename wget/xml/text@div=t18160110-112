            . I sent my lad on the 26th of December, to take one hundred pounds of glue to Holborn-hill.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUGHES. I am in the service of Mr. Roe; I was to go to the Borough to fetch a hundred weight of glue to take to Mr. Powel, oilman, on Holborn-hill. I went into the house of Mr. Lowe, in Bishopsgate-street, in my way from the Borough, I left the truck at the door, and when I came out again, it was gone. I saw the truck about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100057"></xptr>ten o'clock the next morning, it was brought from Petticoat-lane, by a young man, who was Mr. Lowe's porter. I saw the glue and the prisoner in custody at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN COHEN. I live in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner came and knocked at my mother's door, and asked was Lumpy at home; I told him I did not know whom he meant; no such person lodged there. He then asked me would I buy any thing; I told him, no; I did not buy any thing; I did not even ask him what he had to sell; I am sure it was the prisoner; he had another man with him. The prisoner said to the other man let us be off, or we shall be nabbed. When I heard that, I instantly called the patrole, who took the prisoner into custody, with the property.</p>
               <p>TITUS WELLS. I am the patrole who apprehended the prisoner, and the other man; but the other man got away. I took this bag of glue from the prisoner, which he said was bones.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character from some witnesses.</p>

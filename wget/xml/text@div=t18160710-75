               <p>WILLIAM MOSS. I keep the George, at Stratford. On the Morning of Tuesday the 12th of March, at about ten o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, and ordered some brandy and water; in about half an hour, he was joined by another person, who had a canvass bag; I did not see that they joined company at first, but they did afterwards. They were in company the best part of the day, and went away in the evening, in a returned pest chaise, to the three Nuns, at Aldgate; I did not see which took the bundle.</p>

               <p>RICHARD MULLEY. I keep the three Nuns, at Aldgate. On the evening of Thesday the 12th of March, the prisoner came to our house, in one of our chaise; he had another person with him. they had some liquor, and the prisoner gave me a parcel, requesting me to take care of it. He then went out with the person in whose company he had come. I had a suspicion that all was not right, and I sent for Mr. 
               <persName id="t18160710-75-person554">Ray</persName>
             the officer; Mr. Ray came, and went into the back parlour, where the parcel was. The prisoner came in in a short time, and I asked him if he was going to take the parcel away he went towards the door of the room where it was, but turned back directly, and went out, and Mr. Ray followed him, and brought him back.</p>

            . I am an officer of Portsokenward. I was standing near the door in the room, where these goods were; the prisoner came towrads the parcel, and then turned quickly round, and went out of the house; I suppose it was by knowing of me, I had not spoken to him. The moment he clapped eyes on me, he went out; I immediately followed him, and brought him back.</p>

               <p>(Property produced, and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>MR. ARABIN, as counsel for the prisoner, entered into an ingenious address to the jury, in his defence; and commened a good deal upon the prisoner's conduct, as neither being extraordinary, or remarkable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Baker-street. On the night of the 19th of June I was coming from Limehouse, and saw the prisoner as I came by Grosvenor-street, Commercial-road, at twelve o'clock—it was a dark night—I am certain of him—I saw him first in the road—he stopped a widow lady about two yards from me—there was a gas-light at the corner, which enabled me to see his face—lie left the widow lady, and I passed her; and as I went to run past him, he caught me by the gown, then caught bold of my boa, twisted it tight round my throat, and said he would shake my head from my shoulders—he kept twisting it tight round my neck—it was fastened with a small gold brooch—the boa broke in two—I retained one part of it, and he ran off with the other—I called out—he laughed at me, and told me I might call as long as I liked—I do not know what became of the brooch, but at the station-house he told the Inspector he need not look for it, for he would not find it—when I called out Mr. Seager came to my assistance—he pursued the prisoner—I showed him as well as I could which way he went—I suppose the prisoner was holding me about five minutes—I was quite close to him, and am certain it was him.</p>

                  </hi>. I came up to the assistance of the prosecutrix—it was about a quarter or half-past twelve o'clock—in consequence of what she told me, I went after the person, and caught sight of the prisoner in Edward-street, Stepney—he was at the further end of Mary-street, <hi rend="italic">dodging</hi> backwards and forwards, as if to see who was coming—he saw me, and ran off, and I after him, calling, "Stop him"—a young man seized him by the collar—he said, "Oh, let me go; it is all right"—the young man let him go, but 1 seized him, and saw part of the boa drop from under his jacket—he said to me, "Let me go; a man has stolen my silk handkerchief out of my pocket"—a policeman took up the part of the boa—I am certain the prisoner is the man that dropped it—I kept him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at the workhouse of the East London Union. On the evening of 4th Nov., about seven o'clock, the prisoner and another man knocked at the workhouse door, and asked for a night's lodging and relief—I told them I had got no relief for able-bodied paupers—I then shut the door—they knocked again within five minutes, and asked if I meant to give them a night's lodging—they then asked me to give them some bread—I told them I could give them no bread, unless I gave it out of my own pocket—they said, "Then keep it and be b——d,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250052"></xptr>
               <p>and if you don't let us in we will break your windows"—I desired them to go away—they refused—I shut the door—in about two minutes some one came and told me they were attempting to break the windows—I went out and told them to quit the yard—they refused—I said I must remove them by force unless they went quietly—they still refused—I then laid hold of the prisoner, and attempted to eject him, and put him down the yard—he resisted—I got him into the passage—he then struck me several times, as I thought with his fist on my side—after I got lower down the passage I found the blood trickling down my drawers—I called out for help, and Dawson, the other porter, came up, and I then fainted—I was confined to my bed for several days—I am sure it was the prisoner that stabbed me—I was not struggling at all with his companion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Aldersgate-street. I was called to see Clift on the Monday evening—he was bleeding from three wounds; two under the left arm, and a third in the left hand—they were stab-wounds, about half an inch deep, and an inch and a half broad—this knife would produce such wounds—if the knife had been sharp, no doubt he would have been killed—it is very blunt, and could not hurt him very much.</p>

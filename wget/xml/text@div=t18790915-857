                  </hi>. I shall be 13 in September; I went to the home with my sister Kate in August, it was 1878 I think; she was younger than me—we did not go to the Board school—we had sop in the morning and sometimes gruel or bread and treacle, then went out collecting and did not return till night—when I got home I had bread and treacle, and sometimes Miss Addiscott asked us whether we would have a drop of tea and we said, "Yes"—when we were out collecting the ladies gave us something at times—we only had meat on Sundays; when it was wet we did not go out collecting; we had nothing for dinner and sometimes we had rice for tea—the children had dinner; my sister had been to the Board school; she was ill and on Shrove Tuesday she took to her bed—I slept in the same room very near her, hot not with her; that was the back parlour; she was very thin—when I took her out of bed she complained of her bones and asked me to be gentle with her; I saw that her bones were coming through her skin—she slept at the top of the house before Shrove Tuesday—I slept in the back parlour then; she was taken bad in the afternoon and Miss Addiscott made her a bed in the back parlour, and told us to put a mattress for her; she slept on a palliasse, and had a sheet, blanket, and pillow—I went up to call her when she was upstairs—she had one sheet to cover her and her clothes, and no blanket—we only had one blanket, but when Mr. Phillips came she got two new dark blankets, black-like—Dr. Ayres attended her—before she was ill she had the same food as the others; we all had the same—there was no tire in the back parlour till after she was dead, and that was to burn the vermin—Miss Addiscott sometimes went out at 6 in the evening, and she did not return till 1 or 2 in the morning—she slept on a flock bed on the floor in the front parlour, there were folding doors between the two rooms; she told me to shut them, because she could not bear to hear my sister's groans.' she used to groan because she could not bear the pain in her back—when I was out Florence Edgar attended her—there were only two of us at home, and four went out collecting—I don't remember how long after Shrove Tuesday Dr Ayres was called in; he used to call in several times, and once when passing the door he came in—no one nursed her but Florence Edgar and me; she died on the 6th April—I saw Miss Addiscott after on the Sunday morning at 9, she told me to take my sister's breakfast to her and I said, "Kate, here is your breakfast"—she gave me no answer and I called Miss Addiscott, who said she was dead, and told me to get a pail and flannel to wash her—I say she died at 1 in the morning, because she called me for drink every night, and she did not call me that night—she kissed me and said "Good night." I said, "Kate, you will try and be a good girl, won't you?"—she said, "Yes," and when I saw her at 9 her head was down and her knees were up, and vermin</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I held at this time an appointment at the Evalina Hospital, which is devoted to the reception of children—I lived in the wards over four years—on 13th February I examined Eleanor Mobbs on her admission—my report at the time says, "She was extremely emaciated: she had a languid exhausted manner: she was covered from head to foot with inveterate itch of long standing, as she had a harsh dry skin: there was complete absence of fat under the skin producing the plump appearance which a child ought to have: there was no evidence of any mischief in the internal organs: she was slightly feverish on the evening of her admission: she complained of pains in various parts"—I did not see that the itch had. been treated at all; if it had, it was only for a few days previous to her admission—it had existed I should say three or four months—every portion of her hair had to be cut on, for it was literally swarming with vermin—over the upper part of her right thigh was a patch of red inflamed skin and over her right great toe there was a patch of inflamed skin with matter under it—over her right heel there was a small discharging wound, and over her left heel a large wound of the same description, which was discharging matter—she had considerable difficulty in taking food, she was sick after all the food she took—we had to be extremely careful in feeding her—she weighed on 17th February 3 stone 51b. 8oz.; and on 7th March she had gained over 31b.—on 21st March she weighed 3 stone 121b. 4oz—she was when admitted</p>

               <p>considerably below the nominal weight and height of a child of her age; indicating an utter want of proper food and a complete absence of all ordinary cleanliness and proper care—my reason for saying that, is that the whole course of her treatment consisted in feeding her properly, but the itch was treated medically—I failed to detect any disease by the most careful examination—her emaciated state was another reason, and as there was not disease I take it that there must have been want of food—vomit<lb></lb>ing after food is an indication of weakness—the lack of proper sustenance had been continued for some weeks—no child could be reduced in that way under a certain amount of time, but I cannot fix the date—if that treatment had been persisted in the consequence would have been consumption, or she would have died—I see 350 to 400 children in a year, and out patients also—the Evalina Hospital is resorted to by the poorer classes and a perfectly free—I have never seen a parallel case to Eleanor Mobbs'—I hare never seen a child without organic visceral disease reduced as she was—tabes mesenterial is a disease well understood in the profession, but it is not common—I mean the children who are brought to us in the hospital wasting from any cause, bad food or from bad hygenic condition, are popularly said to have consumption of the bowels, which being translated is tabes mesenterica—I might discover whether it was tabes mesenterial if I made a post-mortem examination, and without one if I could feel the enlarged glands—I cannot say whether tabes mesenterica is produced from a scrofulous condition, or whether consumption proceeds from the same cause—my opinion is that the diet was insufficient in many important particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cheapest diet that a working man with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and five children could give them would be bread and milk; that is a cheap and wholesome diet, it would sustain life—milk alone will sustain lift without bread—it is possible to give food in considerable quantities which does not go to nourish the body—a large quantity of rice will fill a child but it will not digest—ordinary broth has scarcely any nutritive qualities in it, and children persistently given it instead of getting fatter and making bone would go downwards, and if illness supervened, the child would naturally become very emaciated, but it would die upon such a diet without the illness—you might then find a child like Eleanor Mobbs, as far as emaciation is concerned, without organic disease—if a delicate child was improperly fed and had a tendency to sores or scrofula they would be aggravated, and if it had a cut on the head there would be a tendency to festering—when a person is in a weak state of health a wound often fasten—you can foment scrofula where you might stave it off by proper means—when scrofula proceeds from syphilis it is not uncommon I believe for it to be dormant in the second generation and to break out in the grandson, but many people say that it is not so, you have a popular idea of scrofula and I have a medical one; I do not know what disease you would describe a scrofula; we are fighting upon ground on which we cannot go in common—Eleanor Mobbs is not a badly made or a puny child—she has a cleft palate, but that has nothing to do with scrofula—she was in an extremely emaciated condition—you can feel all persons' ribs—I have not seen children so thin that the chest bones are almost coming through the skin—itch does not spread very rapidly—you see crusts on various parte of the body with water exhuding from them, what is called a pustular rash—the sore on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and lecturer on forensic medicine at Westmister Hospital—I have been many years in practice—while'the case was before the Magistrate I was instructed by the Treasury—I heard the evidence last Session and have been sitting here yesterday and to-day while the children were examined—tabes mesenterica is a scrofulous enlargement of the glands of the intestines—it is very often spoken of as a common disease, but on the post-mortem table it is an uncommon disease—assuming the absence of meat and of milk altogether, and the general food being treacle and bread, the children would gradually deteriorate in strength and spirits; I should expect them to become emaciated, I should expect eruptive diseases of the skin, a voracious appetite and groat thirst; I should expect he prevalence of parasitic diseases such as lice and itch, and complete inability to get about; I should expect them to be confined to their beds, and if persisted in long enough I should expect the bones to come through be skin and the limbs to be drawn up in death, and before death, from the flexor muscles being stronger than the extensors—nitrogen is a necessary ingrcdient in the nourishment of children; such things as I speak of supply nitrogen, but not in sufficient quantity—I consider a sack filled with straw sleep upon and no blanket a very insufficient protection from cold, and calculatcd to lower the vital powers—a child badly fed would feel cold more tan a child better fed; the more cold the more diet is required—a mere bodice without stays is not proper clothing for cold weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Everything I have been saying is simply upon what I heard last Session and now; I have seen nothing of the children—I read the depositions and made a report upon them—I had not then heard any the evidence for the defence—my evidence to-day is upon the diet given I heard the evidence for the defence last Session, and assuming it to be true it would alter my opinion if I believed that the children told lies—I I most positively that children cannot live on potatoes alone—I never was in Ireland, but I know that children in London would die—I have I plenty of experience of children living on a starch diet, and they always die if they go on long enough—potatoes and bread do not contain elements of proper diet, but it depends upon whether the bread is made of oatmeal or potato starch—oatmeal contains more nitrogen and phosphates—I have lived in agricultural districts, Somersetshire and Dorsetshire, and I know that the children of a labourer getting 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or Us. a week get bread and dripping and bacon rind for breakfast—they get dripping from the farm houses—a Dorsetshire labourer would have dripping instead of butter very often—they would get vegetables and potatoes at midday—I don't think they would get much milk, but they buy butter-milk sometimes—they would get dry bread for tea, or bread and sugar, and they get good broth with cabbages in it—I have had some experience in low neighbourhoods: for nine years I was surgeon to a workhouse in Petty France, Westminster—an ordinary working man with a family of four or five ought to have provided a flock mattress for his children last winter—two in a bed would not be objectionable, nor half a dozen—they ought also to have had a sheet, a counterpane, and a blanket, and I should say that if a labouring man did not provide those things for his children last winter he was neglecting them—I have been in heaps of</p>

               <p>houses, and they have plenty of blankets, though there are several in one bed, and they are very dirty and very ragged, but I cannot call to mind anywhere where I have gone and seen them suffering from cold through want of covering—I have heard that these were all the children of person in poor ciroumstances or destitute—if a child had <hi rend="italic">tabes mesenterial</hi> its appearance after death would be what is described in the case of Kate Smith, the legs drawn up, &amp;c., and it would waste away in the same war as in starvation—the legs being drawn up would be common to both, and the child would usually arrive at the stage of the bones almost protruding through the skin—scrofulous disease does not always produce <hi rend="italic">tabes mesenterica</hi>—you might starve a scrofulous child as well as a healthy one.</p>

On 1st April I got directions to give attention to this case, and on April 5th I saw two of the children, Goodland and Smith, in the street—they were wearing little brown alpaca frocks and some covering over their shoulders, I forget what it was; and a straw hat with a piece of red ribbon round it—they looked fairly well in the face—they were out collecting—I went to the home that day and saw the prisoner—she was partly dressed—it was 11 a.m.—I said, "I am an Inspector of Police; I have come to see the children in your home"—she said, "It is not convenient for me to speak to you now, will you call again?"—this was in the passage, the front door was always open—I called again on Tuesday morning, the 8th, and sat down in the room with her—she informed me that one of the children had died that week, referring to Kate Smith, and I understood her had been buried that day—I said, "There is one other child here looks very ill," referring to Annie Crabbe, the youngest of the lot—she said, "Yes, she is not well, the is suffering from dropsy"—she was very much swollen in the stomach at that time, and very remarkable—I saw about six children in the front room, including all those you have seen—that also includes the two who were out collecting on 1st April, and I supposed I had seen them all—there was a fire in the room, and they were sitting round it!—they look better in flesh now in every way—I went again on Thursday the 9th, but only had some conversation about the terms for taking children in—some children were absent on the 10th, and she said that they were upstairs in bed—I asked her if I could see the sleeping apart<lb></lb>months—she said, no, it would be inconvenient at that time—that was between 7 and 8 o'clock—I went again on the next Monday, Easter Mon<lb></lb>day, April 14th, to see the children, but she refused unless her medical adviser was there—I asked her where she slept—she said, "You are a Tory indecent man to ask such a question of a single lady"—I asked her who took care of the children at night—she said, "The same as takes care of you, the great God of heaven"—I wanted to go over the house, but the father threatened me with law proceedings—he said that he should stand up for his daughter; he did not see why three men should come in like that and take her by force—I did not go upstairs till 21st April, when the children were removed—the dark coloured blankets were there, but I do not recollect them being on the bed—I did not turn the sheets down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse at the Greenwich Union—I remem<lb></lb>ber the two Crabbes, they went from Sutton school to the home and were apparently in very good health, clean, and properly clothed—they were brought from Sutton school to the Union for their mothers to come and take them out—what they had not got I supplied them with, which was a thing</p>

               <p>of every sort—they had flannel petticoats—I also clothed Ellen and Kats Smith before they went to the home—I cannot say whether they went there direct, their mothers came and took them out—they were free from I disease and clean—Kate Smith did not appear to have anything the matter with her—I did not know that she was afflicted with consumption of the bowels—I received the six children at the Union on 22nd April and, with the exception of Alice Rixon, they were in a dreadfully dirty state, and they had the itch—they ate heartily—their clothing was not so dirty as their skin—they very soon improved when they got into the Union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had 10 years' experience with children—I said before the Magistrate "They had not the appearance of having been starved, and I say so now: I have had considerable experience of children: I formed that judgment from their appearance—I also said thai they appeared to have been fairly fed, and that their clothes were not particularly dirty: I have had a great many children in the Union who when first admitted suffered from vermin in the head—it is a very poor neighbourhood round Deptford and Greenwich: it is not uncommon for children of the poorer classes to be suffering from vermin in the head: it is not a very difficult thing to eradicate them: I very soon get rid of them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I also said that as to their being properly nourished—I paid very little attention, because the medical gentlemen examined them—still I did not think they looked starved—they improved very much after they were there—I never saw worse itch than they had—Annis Crabbe was six years old—she was the youngest.</p>

Can you tell the Court why when you were down at Stoke Damerel at the time of the birth of Laura Julia Addiscott you described yourself as Julia Addiscott without saying any<lb></lb>thing about Kendal? A. That is my Christian name; I was born in Devonport—I do not know whether that is in the parish of Stake Damerel—the prisoner was born on 31st March, 1855, at Stoke Damerel—Q, Did you personally attend on May 10, 1855, before the Registrar and mark with your mark your signature at the back of the paper, and describe yourself as Elizabeth Addiscott, formerly Kendal? A. Her father usually went—I could not go before John Earth that day, but I believe her father done it—I cannot swear that I myself did net put the mark of an illiterate person in the register—I can write my name (<hi rend="italic">doing so</hi>)—I spell Bowen "Bornen"—I did not register either of the deaths at the home—I say to-day that Bowen is a Christian name like Elizabeth—I did not swear last time that it was the name of my father; I mean to say that I was christened Elizabeth Bowen—when I spoke of Bowen as my maiden name twice at the last trial, I only meant to convey that it was one of my Christian names—I know that "maiden "means the name I bore before I married—if I swore twice that Bowen was my maided name it was a mistake; I did not mean it—I will not deny saying it, but I did not mean it; I meant to say that it was my Christian name—I do not know whether I swore it twice—I said, "There is no pretence for saying that I ever had any occasion to interfere between Laura sad any child she was beating," and I say it now—the children's meals were not sent down to them in the kitchen where there was no fire by Sidney, the boy—I was at my own house sometimes attending to my family—I had nothing to do with the money matters of the home—when I laid out little Smith her body was warm; they fetched me directly she died—Groodland and Nelly Smith did not take lice off the dead body; Groodland was not in the room at all—the two persons who went to the house first were the Pearsons—they were not taken to the work-house—I was there when the Pearson children were taken away; I do not know whether they were taken away in waterproofs; their father brought some clothing—there was no violence by my daughter on Mrs. Pearson, or smashing of her fingers in the door; nothing of that kind</p>

"nor did I hear my daughter say "It is a make-up tale; it is only a plea to rob"—my daughter told her if she would call next day she would give the children up—the children were not kept stark naked before the waterproofs were put round them; I put on a few things—they did not leave stark naked except what was brought to wrap them in—the Pearsons did not com<lb></lb>ain of the state their children were in—I know Mrs. Harris, but I do not know much of her—her child went away—I knew little Toohey, the man who was taken before the Magistrate for assaulting my daughter fined 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I heard Mrs. Tooley call my daughter, names—I did not go to the police-station—the child burnt her hand at the lamp; one the children had some apples on the table, and the little girl put her hand out for an apple and put it against the chimney of the lamp, and that burnt it—Harris was clean when she left the home, but she was not well; she was a delicate girl, and she was suffering from a complaint—I have seen Heather, the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> driver. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not forget his coming down to your house in February to ask whether his niece had been there, a very wet morning?

               <p>I had of seeing them"—I will not swear that I did not say so; they did not bring a card more than once, because I mislaid the card, but they came afterwards not collecting but with various messages—I was in the habit of going to the home for my friends as well as for myself to see if the; had got servants—the children I saw were not thin—when a child eaters your own room and is thin you naturally notice it—my children are fat, but I have lost two with consumption, and therefore I should notice it—I saw them with their clothes on—I think I saw six or eight children besides Eliza Crabbe—I said that I had seen three or four others at my house, that is true—I do not think I could tell you their names, but Edgar was one—the little things would come to us and give in their message and we would talk to them a few minutes—I did not ask their names, but I should know them if I saw them; I do not know that I ever saw Kate Smith, but I have seen Ellen Smith at my house. (<hi rend="italic">The nine children were here brought into Court, and the witness pointed out Eliza Crabbe and Elizabeth Goodland.</hi>) Those are the only two I recognise—I do not recognise Ellen Smith; I was told that she came; I think it was Crabbe said so, but I cannot tell which she is—I think I said at the last trial, "I do not recollect ever seeing Ellen Smith" because I did not know their names; I only knew the name of one—a person named Toohey came to me for a cook's situation for a lady friend of mine; she only called once; that is how I got mixed up with this home; I thought it was a registry for servants.</p>

I began to work for Miss Addiscott at the home 12 months ago—I went there once a week—I saw the children every week—I have had 11 children and I never saw anything to make me think these children were ill-treated, but more the reverse—they did not look as if they were starved to death, some looked very well, but one or two looked sickly—I worked for them every week and I washed frocks, petticoats, and stays—I have washed flannel petticoats for these little girls—they wore in winter petticoats, skirts, and jackets—I should say that that was enough—I do not say that they were clothed like <hi rend="italic">gentry</hi>, but enough to keep them in health I should think—I did not see the meals given, but I saw some<lb></lb>times the meals that were prepared for them—I have seen stews prepared</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I practise at Deptford, and have had considerable experience in that neighbourhood, which is a very poor one—I have been in the habit of going a good deal into labourers' houses—I was called in professionally in September, 1878, to the home by Miss Addiscott; up to that time I had not the slightest knowledge of her—I then attended some of the children—the whole number of visits paid by me and my assistants must have been 50 or more—I am a general practitioner—children were brought to me several times by Miss Addiscott—I generally in the winter saw the children in the front parlour; there was a fire there—I attended Kate Smith—when I fist saw her her disease was scrofula; tabes mesenterial, otherwise consumption of the bowels—she was wasted—I have no recollection of the form of the head, but it was very apparent in the case of a baby named Verch—Kate Smith died on a Sunday—I saw her immediately before death and afterwards—she was in the back room the last time I saw her—she was thoroughly wasted—I thought the surround<lb></lb>ings of the room had an air of neglect—I mean that it did not look quite so clean as it might have done, perhaps I may not say neglect; but there was carelessness and dirtiness about it—the room did not look clean—probably it would be better if you obliterate the word "neglect"—I have been in a good many houses which do not look clean—I saw the body after death—it was laid out properly and there was proper decency in every way—I saw no insects whatever—the hair was cut short—when I saw her before her death I saw no lice or vermin—I gave this certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), "Tabes mesenterica, 3 months"—I mean that the disease had been in existence that time—the children's hair was moderately short; not long by any means—</p>

               <p>the door was always open on account of the post office—the children did not present the appearance of being starved to death—I think they looked excessively well: I am taking the lot collectively—I have frequently been there in winter and seen them sitting in the room where the fire was; and I think they looked better than they do in Court this morning—I have seen considerably inferior accommodation in working men's houses to what I saw there—I attended the other two children who died, and gave these other two certificates (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no interest in this matter; rather the other way—I have lost about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week in Deptford alone—I said that if Miss Addiscott had the means, then I considered that the death of the children were accelerated by the mode of living—I said "I think if Miss Addiscott had the means of properly keeping the children who died, their deaths were accelerated by what took place at the home;" but I meant with regard to nourishment and warmth, I did not mean by any act of cruelty—I gave a certificate which caused the removal of all these children to the workhouse—I said last Session that these three children were scrofulous before they were born, and would eventually have died from scrofula—I cannot say at what period—they might go on for three or four years, and they might go seven—where the scrofula is in the glands by great attention and proper diet and warmth such a case would last out longer than it would do otherwise—if they had been children of an ordinary constitution without scrofula they might have endured the want of warmth and nourishment at the home; but, given those conditions they were not equal to it—if they had been the children of parents well-to do they might have lived some time longer—I have seen cases where children die at an earlier date in the houses of the people themselves, in consequence of the want of warmth and nourishment; and supposing they came from such a home they were better treated at Miss Addiscott's—I ordered cod liver oil, and subsequently saw it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never entered the home before the middle of August, 1878—I said September last time—it may have been the last day of August—there is no reason for my altering it—up to September all that went on was a sealed book to me—I attended Mrs. Peareon, but I know nothing of her stepchildren, nor did I know Harris or Toohey—I think I may have seen Mobbs; I fancy I know the name—I have been in East Greenwich five years, and since September I have set up a dispensary in Deptford, where I have two assistants; that is where I first knew of Miss Addiscott's existence—I was never upstairs up to the time Kate Smith died, and never saw the sleeping rooms, but I saw her in the back parlour—I have been upstairs since with Mr. Wontner—I never saw the children sitting in the downstairs front kitchen without a fire; I never was downstairs; I never was anywhere except in the two rooms on the ground floor—I dare say I swore at the last trial "I think I was only in the back parlour"—I think this is correct "Though no name of any girl that I attended in the home appears on the books, I think the dispensary has received for the whole of the medical attendance a sum of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I feel morally certain that that is true, and I am not certain we received that; I acted purely as a matter of charity, the same as with Mrs. Fry or Miss Stride, but the attendance became excessive and then I thought I had better have no more to do with it; I did not like the appearance of it, one child had the itch, and they were constantly coming to the surgery for ointment—I did not</p>

               <p>like the general style, we got nothing by it but unkindness—I do not knot which child had the itch—I said that I could not attend to any more; they brought it round to the surgery—it was probably Miss Addiscott or one of her sisters—I won't bind myself to which it was because I was just passing through the surgery—that was about April, 1879—I paid six or eight visits to Kate Smith; I did not attend her in bed—I am not sure whether I attended her personally at all till six days before her death—I swore "I think it was about seven or eight days before her death that they called my attention to that particular case," Kate Smith—that is true—that was the first time my attention was called to the state the child was in—I took no means to ascertain what the accommodation was for the offices of nature, it was not my duty; I was attending 150 people every day, and have had six or eight deaths occur in a house—I think Inspector Phillips came to me after he had been to the Coroner and Mr. Long, and said that they wanted my assistance to get the children away from the home, and most probably I said "I don't see what I have got to do with the home"—I cannot bind myself as to what Phillips said—I swore a month ago that when Inspector Phillips came they said "They had been there with the Coroner and Dr. Long, and they believed the children were all starved: "I said "If that is your belief the best thing will be for you to get them away, and rather than allow any suffering I will give you a certificate with pleasure"—this is the certificate I wrote. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Park Terrace, Greenwich. This to certify that from my medical knowledge of the Girls' Home, managed by Miss Addiscott, at Deptford, I have come to the conclusion that from want of funds and other reasons the children in the home, to a large extent, suffer from want of nourishment, considering that nearly all the children are poor, disposed to scrofula and tubercle, and in such cases efficient nourishment and warmth are most desirable elements in the treatment of such diseases.") I came to the conclusion that I had been duped and that the children had boen starved; I said so at the last trial—I wrote this letter to Mr. Bond from Brighton "Gloucester Hotel, Brighton. Dear Sir,—If I can assist you in any way (in the case of Miss Addiscott), or either of my assistants, let me hear from you and we will do so; if the evidence be correct we have been most considerably duped. I am, Sir, yours truly, Jas. W. Ayres. July 10, 1879"—my impression of being duped lasted till then, but it does not continue till now because my opinion was that the woman was receiving sufficient money—it is not my opinion now that the children were starved, because death from starvation is different from death from scrofula—if those children had had more nourishment and more warmth it would not have accelerated their death—by "duprd" I meant because I charged them nothing and was rather inclined to get donations for them—I telegraphed to the Home Secretary, saying that I considered a public investigation was necessary, and an answer came back to say that they would communicate with the Board of Guardians or that they had done so—that was im<lb></lb>mediately before the case of assault at the police-court—the solicitor who had been my solicitor for six months appeared for Miss Addiscott at the police-court—I sat by his side once—I was a litigant in the police-court, Brighton, two years ago, and gave evidence—there was no Jury—I am very excited at times, and the Judge said that he did not believe a word I had said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That was about a gentleman who went to Brighton and I went with him to take care of him and sued him for my bill, and I was</p>

               <p>very excited and the Judge made a remark—I said last Session "I came to the conclusion that the children had not been starved"—that was so—there was very groat excitement in Greenwich when the matter was first started; a great deal had been made of the money that was collected—I received anonymous letters from people which I considered very unjust, and I considered Mr. Besley was at the bottom of it—assuming the evidence given by the children to be true, and assuming the amounts said to be collected to be true, that led me to believe that I had been duped, assuming everything to be true about the nourishment that was given and the money there was to give it with—I never saw at the home any child that was starved to death, leaving out the three that died—they did not present the appearance of semi-starvation, they presented the appearance I should have expected—I never saw that their bones was coming through their skins—I have walked in and touched a little girl under the chin and asked if Miss Addiscott was at home, and I thought they looked very nice—I did not always see Miss Addiscott when I went there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The three children who died were predisposed to scrofula and so are some of the others—I say so from their general appear<lb></lb>ance—I have been in a room with them, and talked to them—I am able to swear that some of the children who were removed are predisposed to scrofula, but I do not know them by name—I think to an inexperienced eye a child subjected to a diet insufficient in quality and quantity would show the same symptoms as a child not subjected to that diet would who was scrofulous, but a medical man seeing the children in a room could see whether the scrofulous-like appearance proceeded from impure diet or from a scrofulous tendency I think—I now come to the conclusion that these children were not starved—I have heard Mr. Long's evidence, assuming that the children removed on 22nd April had their bones half coming through their skin, I should not be prepared to say that they had not been starved—if I had seen that I should have said that they had been starved—supposing some of them to have been covered with vermin from head to foot I should certainly not think they had had proper care taken of them—if they were covered with itch I should not think they had been properly cared for—the last time I saw any child in the home was I think in April, 1879—I cannot say how many times I was there between Christmas and April, I generally called in when I was that way—I came to the conclusion that the children had been starved before the last trial—I had that opinion from the very first day up to a fortnight before the last trial—after reading the evidence I have changed my opinion in consequence of noticing the amount that has been collected on the contribution cards—I have merely changed my opinion because the contributions were very small—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assume the contributions to be small as you say, why does that change your opinion as to their being starved?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because a case of scrofula may be starved, or a person in full health may be starved, that is what I mean to infer; they were cases of scrofula—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are assuming that the other children who you never examined were all scrofulous?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly all the London children taken from the streets are scrofulous or syphilitio—there is always some taint about them—that is hospital experience.</p>

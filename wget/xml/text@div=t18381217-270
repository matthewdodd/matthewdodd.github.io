On Thursday, the 29th of November, in conse<lb></lb>quence of information I went to his house with Kirkbright—the prisoner was on duty at the time—his wife let me in—I went into the back yard and found the goose, which has been identified—Kirkbright said, before I found it, that there was a particular brown feather under its wing, which I found to be the case—the prisoner came to me about an hour after I had been there—I told him I had taken the goose from his house, and be must remain at the station-house till I went to the superintendent—he said, "Very well," he could very easily clear himself—I said I hoped he could—he said he bought it of a man at Stratford, named Osborne, for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and wished he might be sent for—I went to Stratford next morning, and saw the man—he is not here—the prisoner was acting sergeant at the time—he lives a quarter of a mile from where the goose was taken—his duty would take him to the place—he has been in the force nearly four years—Osborne is his wife's brother—I do not know whether he was in the habit of going there to see his sister.</p>

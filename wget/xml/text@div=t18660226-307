                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Ashlan-street, Limehouse—on 26th January, about half-past 11 in the morning, I was in Fenchurch-street—I had a pocket in my dress, containing a purse and a pocket-handkerchief—</p>

               <p>the purse contained a sixpence and some halfpence—Brown got in front of me, and Richardson put his hand in my pocket—some gentleman struck him, and I then saw him take his hand out of my pocket—Brown was in front, and prevented me passing—both prisoners ran away—a constable came up.</p>

                  </hi> My husband keeps a bootmaker's shop, at Lewisham. On 20th Sept., the prisoner came there about half past 8 o'clock—I can swear the prisoner is the man—I believe him to be the man, that is as far as I can say—a man like him came to the shop, and asked to look at a pair of boots, I showed him a pair—he asked for more, but I refused to bring any more—he waited about, and I asked him to let me see the size of his foot, bat instead of that he took up a pair of boots in his hands, and in about two minutes he ran away with them—I have seen the boots since, and they are here now, these are them—I can swear to them, by the private mark on them—I have no doubt about them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 289). On the evening of 20th Sept. I received information of this robbery, and of the person of the man—I went and found the prisoner, and he answered the description which had been given me—I asked him if he was going home—he had a cap on, which was drawn partly over the right side of his face, and I noticed he had one of these boots on his right foot, and no lace in it; on his other foot was a Wellington boot; and I saw something in his pocket—I asked him where he got these boots—he said he bought them—I said I should take him, and he tried to throw me, and to make his escape, but I kept him, and got him to the station—while I was taking him this new boot fell off his foot by his kicking me, and it having no lace in it—this other boot was in his pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence</hi>. I bought the boots at the Fox and Hound, at Syden-ham; I gave a man 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and a pot of ale; the man had a corduroy jacket on, the same as I had; I stopped in the taproom about half an hour; I came out, and the policeman laid hold of me, and tried to throttle me, and took me to the station, charged with stealing the boots.</p>

               <p>"You are the very man I want to remove some goods, but I must not be seen in it, as I have just come from Whitecross-street prison;" that he removed his goods to Princes-street, and the next day to Titchfield-street, and he said</p>
               <p>"I will give you the old rubbish that is left in Princes-street, if you wont tell my old landlord where I have removed, as I have saved seven guineas for rent;" that he and his wife had then fetched the basket and the chair. Some days after Cuthbert called on him and said,</p>
               <p>"Your wife has informed of me, and I will have my things back again; he offered to return the chair, but said the basket was lost, and the shelves were burned. The next day Cuthbert brought an officer, and took him and his wife to Bow-street. The Magistrate had directed him to try to find the goods, and attend again. He had attended, when the Magistrate said he could see no felony in the case.</p>

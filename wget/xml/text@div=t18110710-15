            . Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your house on Saturday the 8th of June - A. Perfectly well, about seven o'clock in the evening; the prisoner Blott came in first, the old lady followed her, and then King followed the next: they came in company together. Blott called for a pint of ale, they drank the best part of the ale down. Blott asked leave to sit down in the bar till such times that Mrs. Lloyd came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Lloyd - A. Yes. I knew him some time; I permitted them all three to sit down in the bar, they sat two or three minutes, then Blott, and her mother Walton said they would go and see where Mr. Lloyd was, as he stopped longer than they expected; they went out, leaving King behind; they returned in about three or four minutes; in the course of that time I was called into the parlour to receive some reckoning; I let the bar, and left King in the bar only. They returned with Mr. Lloyd, and then the prisoner King immediately left the bar and went out into the tap-room, into the street. The prisoner, Mrs. Blott, and her mother, Mrs. Walton, informed Mr. Lloyd that they had a pint of ale; he said he would pay for it; they said they could not wait, they were both in a hurry; they both immediately quitted the bar. Mr. Lloyd paid for the ale; he followed them. I did not see any thing more of them till the next morning I sent for Mr. Lloyd.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss your money - A. The same night, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How much property did you miss - A. Thirty-six guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it - A. In my coat pocket hanging over a chair in the bar, it was in two bags, the inside bag was a silk bag, and the outside a brown canvas. On the Sunday morning I sent for Mr. Lloyd, I told him I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Lloyd - A. He is clerk to a coal merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money again - A. No, I have not found it again.</p>
               <p>Q. While Blott and Walton were there you were in the room - A. No, not the whole time; they were in the room, because I served some customers in this parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. They went out leaving King alone - A. They did.</p>
               <p>- DICKENS. I am an officer. I apprehended King in Red Lion street on Sunday the 9th of June, I took her to Covent Garden watchhouse. She had nothing about her but a few halfpence. She told me she threw the two purses away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promises - A. No. I asked her where the guineas were, she said thirty guineas were at the Blue Last public house, Ludgate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100012"></xptr>Hill, she had got notes for them, and the notes were given to one Mr. Slyfield, that keeps a wine vaults in Brook's Market there I went I found two tens, eight one's, three guineas, and three half crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she had done with the other six - A. She said she had bought a bonnet out of the other and spent it; I went to Mr. Barker the publican, he told me he had changed, the guineas, Mr. Slyfield has got the notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Did not Blott desire you to come - A. No. Mr. Harding sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. That was at the instigation of Blott - A. I believe it was, because Blott went down with me to Mr. Coombes.</p>

            . I produce the money and notes thirty-one pounds ten shillings and sixpence. The two ten pound notes are marked by Barker and eight one pound notes, three guineas, and three half crowns that were delivered by King.</p>
               <p>MR. BARKER. Q. You live at the Blue Last - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner King coming to your house - A. I do not; she was a total stranger to me, I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them bank notes - A. Here is my name upon two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them notes to the person that brought you some money change - A. I can swear to them notes in particular, I always put my name on the notes I receive.</p>
               <p>King's Defence. On Saturday as I was taken on the Sunday I met this lady, I had not seen her some time before; she invited me to dine with her, she said she was going to meet her husband on the Saturday evening we went into Mr. Coombe's house, which I never saw before, we went into the tap-room, Mrs. Blott objected to sitting in the tap-room, and we went into the bar, and when Mrs. Blott and Walton went out of the bar I was left in; I never took it out of the bar, it was laying on the floor, by the bar door; when they returned Mrs. Blott said, as I did not wish to see Mr.

             I had better go, I picked it up on the threshold, when I went away I went to look at them, thinking they were halfpence, but they proved to be guineas. I at first thought they were counterfeits. As for stealing them I never did in my life. The old lady has no concern in it, she is perfectly innocent, and so is the other.</p>

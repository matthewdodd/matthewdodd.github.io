             was also charged with the like felony and murder on the Coroner's inquisition.</p>
               <p>The witnesses on both sides ordered out of court.</p>
               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Knowlys, and the case by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship, Gentlemen of the jury; gentlemen, you are now in possession of the charge against the prisoner at the bar; the indictment which my learned friend Mr. Knowlys has stated briefly to you, imputes to him the crime of wilful murder. It becomes my duty, gentlemen, as engaged in support of this prosecution, to state to you the circumstances which gave rise to it, and to accompany those circumstances with such observations as naturally, reasonably, and necessarily belong to it; more than this I certainly shall not do.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100029"></xptr>The task I have to perform in supporting a prosecution against a man who stands at the hazard of his life, cannot be exempt from painful sensations; the duty you have to discharge, cannot be exempt from the same sensations. I am sure, when you are called upon in a case like the present, you, without any exhortation from me, will be ready to exercise all those qualities which will form the best guard and give the best protection to the accused; at the same time they will be satisfactory to the public and yourselves. In the discharge of your duty, I am sure so far as you are called upon to exercise patience and deliberation, that those qualities will be manifest; and certain I am, that all that can be expected from the exertion of your humanity, will be likewise exercised. I shall take the liberty, first, of suggesting under the correction of his lordship, the kind of crime with which the prisoner is charged; and so far as the law will evidently constitute that crime, that is what will form your principal attention; because, as I conceive, the case in point of law, comes clearly within that description which I am about to give. Gentlemen, you very well know, and you have often seen that, in every indictment for murder, it is essential to express that the crime had been committed with malice aforethought. Now the term malice, as it is commonly received in the world, differs a little from the legal acceptation of it; and indeed this description is given so satisfactorily by a learned judge, who has turned his attention particularly to the crime of homicide, that I cannot do better than merely to repeat his words.</p>
               <p>"When a man is killed, that fact of killing</p>
               <p>"being proved, it becomes the defendant</p>
               <p>"himself to offer to the court</p>
               <p>"every circumstance that can lower it</p>
               <p>"from the crime of murder, or bring it</p>
               <p>"within the bounds of exculpation. The</p>
               <p>"malice which is necessary to constitute</p>
               <p>"the crime, is not that sort of resentment</p>
               <p>"which one is to suppose has been harboured</p>
               <p>"in the bosom for any duration of</p>
               <p>"time; but if the fact be committed, attended</p>
               <p>"by these circumstances which are</p>
               <p>"the ordinary symptoms of a wicked, depraved,</p>
               <p>"and malignant spirit, those</p>
               <p>"symptoms will constitute what the law</p>
               <p>"denominates malice." Gentlemen, therefore, as falling under this description, I am to point your attention to the circumstances of the case. I do not at present conceive that there can be much doubt on the present occasion, whether the crime itself is to be lowered, as it may in many cases, to that criminality which is called manslaughter, or whether it can come within a more justifiable state of criminality. Gentlemen, on the 4th of August last, at the close of the election for Westminster, when indeed all that was passed, (for the election was over) I believe the successful candidate at that time was gone out of the Garden, there happened to be some boys collected at Wood's hotel, which is under a part of the piazza, adjoining to another house kept by a man of the name of Hudson, I believe it was about five or six, most likely near six, some boys had been troublesome to Mr. Wood, in order to which the waiter had been dispatched to procure a strength sufficient to dispel such mob as would be collected there happened to be standing there several indifferent and peaceable spectators; certainly among that number was the unfortunate deceased, he was certainly not active in any degree; he had about him at that time a little bundle, for he came on an errand to the leather sellers, he himself being a shoe-maker, and living in Shoe-Lane; with this little bundle under his arm, or perhaps in his pocket, accompanied by his wife, he was standing there an indifferent spectator. About six the prisoner, in company with a dozen or more people, came to the place; they were all provided with weapons called bludgeons; there was an uproar among them; they came on in a menacing situation; they took a situation which continued the menace, and then it was, or soon afterwards, that one of the parties whose name we are not apprized of, came to the companion of Henry Newell,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100030"></xptr>and gave a severe blow; the consequence of this blow was, that he was struck to the ground; then the unfortunate man, Henry Newell, in the friendly act of assisting him, endeavouring to raise him from the ground, received a blow on the head from one of the party; as he was reeling, in consequence of this blow, he received another on the left side of the head from the prisoner; this blow of course brought him to the ground. I shall not only prove to you that the blow so given came from the prisoner, but that the unaccountable words made use of on that occasion, and which came from his mouth; damn him, or damn us, or words to that effect, let us kill him; they were in that state of intemperance, the mind which was carried beyond its proper bounds, at the same time not into any situation where the least apology can arise in a court of justice; but from a situation of mind like that alone could precede the words I have described. After he had given him this blow on the left side of the head, and the man was brought to the ground in consequence of that, he repeated a blow on his loins. Now it happened, gentlemen, what I am happy to record, that though the very people who came up with him, and who came most likely with some degree of mischief in their minds, when they saw it was likely that death should follow from this blow, they endeavoured to recede, the humanity of an English populace immediately took place, the poor unhappy being had as much assistance as could be given him on that occasion, and very nearly at the same instant several people secured the prisoner. Now, clear it is, if I am correct in the statement, that whoever struck the blow on the head, if the death is occasioned by that blow, there cannot be a doubt but that the perpetrator of that crime is guilty of the murder; your consideration therefore is, whether this be or not the man, and whether he be properly charged with the crime. I have described the man of the name of Dawson who saw this, who had an opportunity of taking an ample view of the transaction; he went immediately to Sir Sampson Wright's, thinking there was a possibility of getting more ample assistance there for the apprehension of the offender; while he was gone another man who was there, and whom I will call, desiring to interfere with the apprehension of the man, the mob saved him the trouble, he was taken into custody and carried before Sir Sampson; when before Sir Sampson, Sir Sampson, of course, examined the witnesses that appeared there, among those witnesses was Dawson; the account Dawson gave there, it is fit I should now state to you, differs, that is, it is not so full as the account he gave afterwards before the Coroner and the account he means to give to-day. - Now gentlemen, it is fit I should observe to you on this, that in a scene of that sort there must be much confusion, any further than pointing your attention to that circumstance I shall not go; I shall not make use of any strained inference which may attempt to give fuller weight to the evidence, than it may seem to deserve; the confusion of that situation at the justices you will consequently observe, you will therefore see whether it be likely or not, or whether the unliklihood of the circumstance is of that nature so as to make you hesitate at all as to the degree of full credit which you would otherwise give to the witness; if you think it likely that the man there gave his testimoney in the hurry and confusion, or that the Justice did not interrogate the man as much as he might, you perhaps would expect a more full account from that man when he came to the full state of the business; on so solemn an occasion as the present, you will attend not only to him but to every witness, with all that presumption, I was about to say of humanity, which may ultimately turn to the favour of the prisoner; you will weigh his testimony deliberately; you will observe his manner, and sure I am, that nothing more than the proper degree of credit will be given to any witness that may be called, either on one side or the other; after this, you will have the testimony of another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100031"></xptr>man who saw the transaction; if they are right in their deposition if, they are right in their evidence that they mean to give today; then there is no doubt; there will be no doubt, but that the blow of which this poor being died, was given by the man at the bar; there will be as little doubt of the application of the law to it, but what he is guilty of the crime of murder. - Gentlemen, concerned as I was, and concerned as a friend in my eye was in the election for Westminster, I take it for granted, that both he and myself are most happy that this is not a case that happened during the continuance of the Election; it was a matter that happened subsequent, therefore there can be no view of party in the business, and whatever view there might be of party, if it had been a murder during the continuance of the poll, when we resort here we have an opportunity of satisfying our minds; for here it is where we can contemplate the most stedfast part of this constitution, party spirit has never, even by the most calumnious, been supposed to have pervaded the reverend bench of judgment; the administration of justice in this country is not only our pride, but the envy of the world; therefore, whatever view there might have been in promoting a prosecution of any sort, when it comes here, party spirit must lose its operation; the judge directing and the jury trying now, and for an age past, have always met in every instance with the approbation of the country; - therefore, gentlemen, I say that my friend and myself who were engaged on different sides indeed, during the continuance of the Westminster election, I am sure are happy both of us that this is not a matter which may seem to involve any party spirit; the fact I have related to you calls loud on some one to promote an enquiry into the fact, that is the only wish that any person can have who is at the bottom of this prosecution; fit it is, on the death of a man that the death should be enquired into; if it be, as it is my duty to suggest it is, a death occasioned by the blow from the prisoner, then it is a most foul murder, and if you should be satisfied that the facts are such, you cannot hesitate in pronouncing him guilty of murder, for where murder is committed, the punishment that must follow by the law of the land, is certainly sanctioned by the law of God, and therefore, gentlemen, certain I am that with that patient deliberation, without your minds being inflamed in any degree whatever turning to the prisoner, if you please, and supposing him innocent till he is proved guilty, you, I am sure, will attend to the witnesses with all those qualities that are about you, and your verdict will give satisfaction to every body that is in this Court, and will, I am sure, be equally satisfactory to every person that promotes this prosecution. Gentleman, I have not troubled you with a statement of the evidence, which will come from the professional men, because I think it better they should deliver their opinions without any anticipation of mine.</p>

               <p>Did you see him there that evening? - Yes, about half an hour or better before he received the blow.</p>
               <p>In what situation was the deceased, and how was he conducting himself? - This mob with their bludgeons, were standing a little on the side of Wood's hotel, coming in a terrible rage from the street that is the side of Wood's hotel.</p>

               <p>You came up, you say, from the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What did you observe then? - These people coming in a terrible rage, with their sticks and bludgeons in their hands.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of those persons? - Yes, those people coming in a terrible rage, worked themselves in a kind of circle, and when they had worked themselves in a circle, some people that were in the crowd, called out Hood! the people with their bludgeons in their hands, saying, Lord Hood! they said, the first that offered to molest them, they would clear the way before them; which they did not give any body time to molest them; which the people with the bludgeons had got hold of a man by the coat, and went to pull the man into the circle they had worked themselves in; which man the people of the crowd got away from them; they then instantly struck at any one they could come nigh; which they struck one man over the arm, who defended the blow, and fell back at the people's feet; which said

               <p>Court. Did you go with them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you examined that day? - Yes, the prisoner was committed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How was the office at that time? - There were a good many people in it.</p>
               <p>Now at the time that Newell received that blow how was he behaving himself? -</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100033"></xptr>He did not say a word to any one, nor molest any body.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He was dressed in a brown coat, dark coloured hair, I believe it to be tied in a pig tail; I then departed and went home; this was on Monday night, and Sir Sampson told me to be at his office the next day, which I did.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the deceased again? - Not till the night I saw him when the coroner's jury sat upon him in park-lane.</p>
               <p>What day was that? - That was last Monday was a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did you know him then? - Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Who was there? - The doctor that dressed him, Mr. Gibbs, and the two surgeons.</p>
               <p>Do you know their names? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you positive as to the person of the prisoner? - Yes I am.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the stick? - I did not take very particular notice of his stick, but I believe it to be a piece of a broom stick.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of that stick? - It was thrown away, but I do not know what became of it.</p>
               <p>Who threw it away? - The prisoner threw it away into the circle which they had worked, immediately, as soon as the blow was struck.</p>
               <p>(Cross examined by Mr. Silvester.)</p>
               <p>What are you, Dawson? - A porter.</p>
               <p>Not bred to any business? - No.</p>
               <p>A housekeeper? - No, I live with my father and mother.</p>
               <p>What business is your father? - He is houseman at Whitechapel watch-house.</p>
               <p>Are you a porter to any body? - I am a porter to the brokers, or any body that wants portering work done.</p>
               <p>You are not a porter of the city of London? - No.</p>
               <p>Not do not ply at any particular place? - No.</p>
               <p>But if he comes into Whitechapel you will go of an errand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore your business is merely casual? - No, they come to my house.</p>
               <p>It is not your house? - It is where I am to be found; my father rents a house in Whitechapel parish.</p>
               <p>Upon this day you was employed by what you call your watchmen, your officers; what makes you call them so? - By the officers of Whitechapel parish, to carry their staves; I belong to the watch-house myself.</p>
               <p>You had been from eight in the morning till nine at night in Covent-garden? - No, Sir, I had not; I had been from nine in the morning till nine at night; I was kept two hours at Sir Sampson Wright's.</p>
               <p>In the Garden, doing no one single thing? - I was with the constables, holding their staves while they went to dinner or any other place.</p>
               <p>Then you was present when these boys were making a disturbance at Wood's hotel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were then but a few boys picking up cabbage-stalks? - Yes, Sir; any thing they could find.</p>
               <p>Then they might be brick-bats? - I was under the piazza.</p>
               <p>How came you not to go for your officers then? - Because I thought the officers were there.</p>
               <p>No, that could not be; because you had their sticks, and you knew they were at the Brown-bear? - Not at that time; I had none of their sticks in custody.</p>
               <p>How came you to say that the constables were there? - The constables were there all the morning.</p>
               <p>Yes, but this was all over in the afternoon; there were no cockades, nor any party-people there then? - No.</p>
               <p>The constables were at the ale-house, drinking? - They might be eating or drinking; I had not their staves all day in my hands.</p>
               <p>Were not the shutters put up at Woods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100034"></xptr>And at the other houses? - I did not ask about other houses.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Don't be so pert. - I am not pert; I only answer your question.</p>
               <p>Did not they break the windows and shutters? - They broke the windows; I do not know for the shutters.</p>

               <p>Did none of your constables interfere? - Sir, they were at other places.</p>
               <p>Where were they then? - Why, Sir, they sent for them? - they expected the corner house, the Unicorn, to be pulled down.</p>
               <p>Where is the Unicorn? - The corner of Henrietta-street.</p>
               <p>Did you go to them there? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know they were there? - Yes I do.</p>
               <p>Did you send for them? - No.</p>
               <p>This man you did not know before? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Never saw him in your life before? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor the deceased before? - No; only I saw him about half an hour before, but not before that evening.</p>
               <p>Now the deceased was standing there perfectly quiet for half an hour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was the deceased with? - I do not know who he was with; he was in the crowd when I first saw him; he was standing at the corner of the piazza; but when he received the blow, he was in the crowd; I do not know how he came to be in the crowd, I was three or four just aside of him.</p>
               <p>Court. What number of people do you suppose there might be there? - There might be two or three hundred.</p>
               <p>And out of this two or three hundred there were twelve, fourteen, or eighteen with sticks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were no party cockades at all? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Therefore there was no distinction on which side the man was? - No.</p>

               <p>Was you on that side which was in the procession? - I should not have gone on neither side; I was there attending the constables four days during the election.</p>
               <p>You had no cockade yourself, I suppose? - No.</p>
               <p>Now, when you came back, you found the prisoner in the custody of some man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who is that man? - That I do not know; the prisoner and I were down several times I suppose; when he was pushed about in the manner he was, he was afraid of getting his brains knocked out; these men with bludgeons, when they came back from Sir Sampson's, I saw some running one way, and some another.</p>
               <p>The man who had hold of him did not go with him to the constable at Bow-street? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>That man had no bludgeon in his hand? - No, Sir, he had not; for instantly as he struck the man, he threw his bludgeon away.</p>
               <p>What! threw it over the crowd? - Over the people's heads, into the further part of the ring.</p>
               <p>So as to get rid of it? - Yes, so as to get rid of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This was so notorious a fact, it must be seen by every body? - Every body was not there.</p>
               <p>How came you just now to tell us, that he threw it into the circle? - Because when he threw it out of his hand, it went to the further part of the circle; they worked themselves into a circle.</p>
               <p>Now this circumstance was so remarkable that you immediately mentioned it, I take it for granted? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>You mentioned it immediately at Bow-street? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>How came you not to mention it? - Because there was such a noise and disturbance I did not mention it; besides I was not asked the question.</p>
               <p>Now a month after that, you was examined before the coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it then? - No, I did not; because I was not asked.</p>
               <p>There was no noise and confusion there, you know? - There was more noise and confusion than what ought to have been.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100035"></xptr>Now, when you was examined the 2d of September, did you mention it then? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then this is the first time you ever mentioned that circumstance? - It is the first time, because it is the first time the question was ever put to me.</p>
               <p>Now you say that the prisoner struck him on the head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you mention that before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The first time? - I did.</p>
               <p>And you mean to say that you gave exactly the same account the first time, you did the second, third, and now? - Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. When you came before the justice the first time, did you mention that the prisoner struck the deceased on the head? - Yes, Sir, I did; I mentioned it to the clerk who took down the examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Now you have said today that the blows he gave him on the loins brought him to the ground? - It brought him all along to the ground; he was on his hands and knees before.</p>
               <p>Therefore he was not down on the ground till he received that blow on his loins? - He was not; he was on his side.</p>
               <p>You mentioned that? - Yes; I mentioned that.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear that? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>You mentioned that Wilkins first of all struck him on the head, and when he was on his hands and knees, he was brought all along to the ground, now, as you have told us, did you give the same account; do you mean to say that, on the first time of examination you ever accused the man of striking him on the head at all; now, Sir, upon your oath, if you have any regard for that? - Before Sir Sampson Wright, before the clerk at Sir Sampson's, I said the man was struck on the head the first blow, by a person or persons unknown; the second blow was struck by

               <p>The question repeated. - To the best of my knowledge, I told the clerk at Sir Sampson's that the man received a blow on the head before he received a blow on the loins.</p>
               <p>Did you ever charge Wilkins, that man whom you now chuse to accuse, did you ever charge him with striking the deceased a blow on the head, till you heard the man died of a blow on the head? - Yes, I did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that examination (looks at it.) This is the examination of Dawson.</p>
               <p>Did you take that examination? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you read over to this man after you had taken it? - I did.</p>
               <p>I should be glad to know of you, whether he at that time, on the 4th of August in the evening, mentioned any thing of the prisoner Wilkins having struck the deceased on the head? - From my recollection I have not read this; I think he said nothing of Wilkins's striking him on the head but on the loins.</p>
               <p>That is very correct, now read it over, (reads it over).</p>
               <p>Court. I now observe the words knock him down, are over some words, what were those words? - The original words were and fell said man to the ground instead of that you have substituted knock him down? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now the question is, did this man say that Wilkins, the prisoner, struck him a blow on the head? - I do not recollect that he said any such thing; I perfectly recollect that he said he struck him on the loins.</p>
               <p>Do you think if he had made use of such an expression you should have omitted it? - I think not, because I was very attentive at the time; I thought he had been the man that was hurt at the time, and not the person to make the accusation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Hill. At the time when Wilkins came there, was there any great crowd at the office? - Not at the time he was brought in; there were only three or four in the office, but a great many people came in with him, the office was entirely full; Mr. Addington examined him, Mr. Addington put the questions to him.</p>
               <p>Then what was taken down, was given as answers to questions that Mr. Addington put? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Addington having put the questions, and the man's giving an answer, you took that answer down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As to some part of it, he told his tale merely as it is there, the magistrates put the questions to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He gave answers to those questions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you note down the answers? - Not directly; as to all the answers, Mr. Addington went more fully than it is there as to the number of people, and many other things.</p>
               <p>Then you of course did not take down all the answers he gave to the questions? Not all the answers, but as to the blow the man received I did.</p>
               <p>But, however, the fact is, that much more passed between Mr. Addington and the witness than you took down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you, however, insert any fact that you did not collect from the mouth of the witness? - No I certainly did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You have a minute book at the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you take down the answers of this man in the book or on the paper? - On that paper and not in the book; there is an entry of the charge made against it as a minute, that he was charged on such a day, on suspicion of beating that man in a dangerous manner.</p>
               <p>Is it not the custom with you at the office to take down the examination in a book which you preserve at the office? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>How came you to vary from it at this time? - It is not particularly at this time,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100037"></xptr>for now Mr. Addington will not know on account of the books being brought here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. That is the first and original information of Dawson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. And there was a good deal more passed between Mr. Addington and Dawson, more than what you have taken down? - Yes, but it was not material.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any one question that Mr. Addington asked that you did not take down? - If he knew the people that stood about at the time of this beating; his answer was that he did not.</p>
               <p>Any other question? - I do not recollect any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Does your memory serve you to speak with accuracy, and upon oath, as to the circumstances that did pass or did not? -</p>
               <p>As to that, it was I conceive the reason of Mr. Addington's asking the question was, whether there were any other witnesses that could come in aid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Addington or Sir Sampson, as the fact is, correctly heard this witness's tale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he wanted any explanation of that story, he asked questions, and the witness gave answers? - Yes, if they appeared to be material, they were committed to writing; I did that under the superintendance of the magistrate, it was afterwards read to the witness.</p>
               <p>Did you in that examination insert any fact that was not collected from the witness? - Certainly not; those words fell to the ground, were rather uncouth words.</p>
               <p>When it was read over to him, did he suggest to you, that you had omitted that material part, that the prisoner had struck the man over the head? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Dawson. I only wish that the jury should have a full view of this business; you attended before the coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know Gwilt? - Yes, I saw him in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him examined before the coroner? - No, I was out when he went in to be examined?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cockayne, the solicitor, attended with his witnesses? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is the same man that stands indicted now, is not it, do you recollect that because that gentleman read the name of Gwilt just now? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard his name? - I do not know that I have heard his name.</p>

               <p>I believe the coroner knew a little of you, did not he? - The coroner know a little of me!</p>
               <p>The coroner's jury did, why they did not believe you, did they? - Believe me!</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Gwilt was a public waiter at Wood's hotel? - I do not know that he was, nor I do not know that he was not.</p>
               <p>Why you saw him before the coroner? - I was not in the room.</p>
               <p>Was he accused by any body? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not he visible on the Monday? - I cannot tell; he might or he might not.</p>
               <p>Was in on Tuesday? - I cannot say when it was; he went into the room to be examined.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at all at Covent-garden? - Yes, I did, that was the first time I did see him.</p>
               <p>How came you not to mention his name before the justice? - So I did; Sir Sampson sent the constable of Kensington division with me to take that Gwilt.</p>
               <p>Then how came you not to accuse him before the coroner? I did not know I had any right to do it.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell Mr. Cockayne the solicitor, that he was a murderer? - Gwilt did not strike the man, but he was at the head of the mob.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not you know that Gwilt who was examined as a witness before the coroner; and where evidence would have exculpated this man; was indicted that he might not be a witness for Wilkins? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Has nobody ever told you so? - No.</p>
               <p>You never had any conversation of that sort with any body? - No, I had not;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100038"></xptr>I never had, but I have witnesses here to prove.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What, is it your prosecution? how much have you for coming here? - My labour for my pains.</p>
               <p>And you have not been paid at all? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>You was not paid for your attendance before the coroner? - I was paid for my day's work; I was paid nothing since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much was you paid on the whole for this job of journey-work that you was to do for the parties.</p>
               <p>Court to Hill. I think you said, you took down every thing relative to the blows? - Yes, every thing relative to the blows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My lord, you know I know nothing of this witness, therefore it is impossible I can anticipate what they say, I can only go through the witnesses and see what they will prove.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Fielding.)</p>
               <p>What are you, Mr. Stallman? - A taylor.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At No. 23, in Kirby-street.</p>
               <p>Tell my lord and the gentlemen of the jury, whether you were in Covent-garden on the 4th of August? - The 4th of August I was there, the last day of the poll.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening? - I believe it was between five and six when I went, or pretty near thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Did you go near to the piazza that joins Hudson's hotel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There you were between five and six? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you was there, did you see the deceased, Newell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what situation was he at that time? - The first time I saw him, he was reeling with his head towards the kennel.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was in company with the prisoner at the bar? - There was some more in company, but I did not notice any one in particular.</p>
               <p>About how many were in company with him? - A good many, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Had he any stick in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had the rest who were with him any sticks? - Some of them had.</p>
               <p>He had a stick in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of his person, my man? - Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>You are positive of it? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Do you know what made the deceased reel? - I cannot tell, I did not see what made him reel.</p>
               <p>Now what passed between the prisoner at the bar and the deceased when he was reeling, if any thing did pass? - He hit him a knock on the head.</p>
               <p>With what? - With a stick he had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Now are you positive that the prisoner at the bar struck the deceased a blow on the head? - Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>That you are positive of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he had given him that blow on the head what followed? - The mob pressed forward, and I saw he had a stick an end, but what passed I do not know.</p>
               <p>You lost sight of the deceased, did you? - I did not lose sight of him, he was lame, I could see him if I chose to move.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner? - He pressed a little forwards, then somebody attempted to lay hold of him, and they jostled all along the piazza into James-street.</p>
               <p>Did you follow them? - Yes, I went before them.</p>
               <p>What became of you? - I stood at the end of the other piazza.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner then? - They got fast hold of him, there was a bit of a scuffle, and he threw his stick away.</p>
               <p>Where were they at that time? - In James-street.</p>
               <p>What did they do with him afterwards? - They led him all along to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him? - I went along with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100039"></xptr>Did you go into the office? - No, sir, I stood at the door.</p>
               <p>What because of the deceased? - I do not know, I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>When you first saw the deceased, was he reeling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then you say you are positive that this man struck him a blow on the head with a stick that he had? - Yes, there was a scuffle, and they jostled him on to the end of the piazza, and afterwards carried him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Do you know on which side of the head the blow was struck by Wilkins? - I believe it was on the left side of the head, because his face was next King-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How came they to know that you could give any evidence on this occasion? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>To whom was it that you first told your story? - I had mentioned it, that I had seen such a thing to several people.</p>
               <p>When were you applied to? - It was one day this week, I do not know, it was either Monday or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Where was the application made to you? - The first application.</p>
               <p>Where did they find you out? - Why, a gentleman took me to the solicitor's chambers.</p>
               <p>What solicitor's chambers? - Mr. Cockayne's.</p>
               <p>Was you examined before the coroner? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was the person that took you to the solicitor's? - Mr. Hughson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He was the surgeon that dressed the wound? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he lives in James-street; I only ask you this, and for God's sake do not go beyond the truth; do not go beyond your knowledge; are first of all you sure of the person of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I remember his face.</p>
               <p>Was he the person that gave the blow you described? - Yes, he gave one blow.</p>
               <p>He gave one blow on the head, and that as you think was on the left side of the head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I'll trouble you to raise your voice a little; you are a taylor? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Hughson? - Not above a fortnight, I believe.</p>
               <p>How long ago may it be since you mentioned it to Hughson that you had seen such a thing? - I did not mention it at all; there was one of Mr. Townshend's letters of thanks lying on the counter, and I happened to read it.</p>
               <p>Not a letter of thanks to Mr. Hughson; why that is the gentleman that signs all the lists of the killed and wounded, that never were killed or wounded? - I do not know what he signs.</p>
               <p>He carried you to the chambers of Mr. Cockayne, of Lyons Inn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The gentleman who stands here, the solicitor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that before or after the coroner sat on this poor man, that he took you to Mr. Cockayne's? - Why, I knew nothing about it whether the man was living or dead, or whether the coroner had sat upon him; what did you say, sir, Did you mean to ask me whether I knew that the man was living or dead at that time?</p>
               <p>I ask you whether when you went to Mr. Cockayne's, the man was dead or not? - Oh, he was dead.</p>
               <p>How dared you then to tell me just now, that you knew nothing about it whether he was living or dead? - They told me so.</p>
               <p>Why you did not know the deceased? - No, I never saw him but that time.</p>
               <p>Now as he was dead, had the coroner sat upon his body? - It is a question that I never asked him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, sir, did not Hughson tell you the day you went before the coroner, that the man was dead of a blow on his head on the left side? - I do not know who told me.</p>
               <p>Hughson did not carry you to the coroner? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it Mr. Hughson or Mr. Cockayne, told you the man was dead of a blow on his head? - I do not know who told me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100040"></xptr>Which of the two was it? - I knew the man hit him on the left side of his head.</p>
               <p>Which of the two, Hughson the surgeon, or Cockayne the attorney, told you the man died of a blow on the left side of the head, because we all saw you looking at the gentleman? - I really do not know who told me.</p>
               <p>How long ago is it since you learned it? - I did not know that he did die of a blow on the left side of the head.</p>
               <p>When for the first time did you hear it? - I believe it was at Hick's-hall.</p>
               <p>That was before you went before the grand jury? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I warn you, I know just as well as you; was it not as you were going into the grand jury that you were told? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Was not you told at that time by Cockayne, that he died of a blow on the left side of the head? - No, sir, I heard the other surgeon say, that he died of a blow on the left side of the head, it was not Mr. Hughson.</p>
               <p>Was Hughson present? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Cockayne present? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Which of the surgeons was it, for they are not so numerous? - It was the young man.</p>
               <p>Who, Mr. Kibble, his assistant? - No it was a young man from the hospital.</p>
               <p>He told you just before you went in? -</p>
               <p>It was some time before I went in; he was not directing his discourse to me.</p>
               <p>Who were present, tell us that, and we will soon find a chairman? - I cannot say who was present besides himself, there was somebody else present.</p>
               <p>Was he in company with you in soliloquy; was that the sort of thing? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Repeat the conversation? - He had a piece of a skull in his pocket.</p>
               <p>That is as all lecturers should have; then he was explaining to you the operation of the trapan? - No he did not say that was the means, but he was shewing what a thickness a scull was.</p>
               <p>How did that lead to any conversation about this man's dying with a blow on the left side of his scull? - He did not tell me that this man died of a blow on the left side of his scull, he did not tell me that it was that blow that I saw the man give.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you it was a blow on the left side of the scull that occasioned the death? - Yes he did.</p>
               <p>A surgeon does not usually throw away his science on a taylor? - I cannot say, he was talking about one thing or another, and he said promiscuously that he died of a blow on the left side of the scull.</p>
               <p>This happened as long ago as the 4th of August? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew they had nobody but that solitary watch-house man, Mr. Dawson, why not help them out at a dead lift? - I knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish you would ask him another question, that is, why he did not go into Sir Sampson Wright's at the time of the accident.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long did you stay at the door of Sir Sampson Wright's? - I believe it was half an hour.</p>
               <p>Had you any friend with you? - No, the gentleman that was my friend was gone in.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - Mr. Swift.</p>

               <p>Did you wait till Mr. Swift came out? - Yes.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Was Swift examined before Sir Sampson Wright? - No, he said the justice was not come.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that you went away before the justice came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How happened it, that you did not go into Sir Sampson's? - the office was very full of people; and we went home directly.</p>
               <p>So you kept this snug, till you became acquainted with Mr. Hughson? - He is no acquaintance of mine; I went in to buy some medicines.</p>
               <p>And so promiscuously you got acquainted with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to go there, was it the nearest shop? - No, I went in promiscuously.</p>
               <p>Give these honest men the reason? - The reason was, I had been in Shug-lane, about some business; and I saw this shop; and called in to buy some medicines.</p>
               <p>How many shops had you passed? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>None of the others were so tempting as this deadly apothecary! this Mr. Hughson! the man who deals in the lists of killed and wounded! - I did not know any thing of it.</p>

               <p>What medicine was it to buy? - Two pennyworth of salts.</p>
               <p>Was Swift near you during the time that this accident happened? - Yes, Sir, he was.</p>
               <p>How near was he to you? - I cannot say; four or five yards.</p>
               <p>How much nearer was Swift to the man that was knocked down, than you was? -</p>

               <p>I cannot say; I do not know whether he was nearer me or not; he was wide of me.</p>

               <p>Which had the best opportunity of seeing things? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he had? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100043"></xptr>This man, after he had struck the deceased, raised his stick an end? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people might he strike with it after the deceased? - None that I know of.</p>

               <p>How did he get old of his stick; did the people take it from him in the scuffle? - he threw it away.</p>
               <p>How many minutes might he be going to James-street? - I suppose, it might be five, or seven, or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Now attend to this, which shall be the only question I shall put to you; are you sure Swift was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Swift was at the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They carried Swift to Mr. Cockayne? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Swift is not in the list of witnesses, delivered in by the solicitor of the prosecution to day, though he is on the back of the bill.</p>
               <p>Was not Swift with you before the grand jury? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Swift was examined by Cockayne the attorney? - No.</p>
               <p>Has he never told you, that as an honest man, he must swear that was not the person that struck the blow? - No, he never told me so.</p>
               <p>Did not he say, that if he was examined upon oath, he must say, that was not the man, but that it was another man; which is the reason he is not here to day? - No, he never did; he said that there was another man struck him.</p>
               <p>When did you see this man since the 4th of August? - Never till such time as they sent me here to see him.</p>
               <p>Who sent you to see him? - Mr. - I forget the gentleman's name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cockayne; he sent you to Newgate to see him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him in the course of your life before the 4th of August? - No, I cannot say I ever had.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any other witnesses to the fact, Mr. Fielding.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. We have the evidence of the surgeon, that he died of the blow.</p>
               <p>Court. But you must first of all prove that the prisoner killed him.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury; I profess to you very plainly, that what I am about to say, is not with the least view to save myself from any fatigue; I certainly, if I saw any just occasion, would sit here till to-morrow morning to have this affair solemnly discussed; but people's lives are not to be taken away by such sort of evidence, which I own, does not convey much satisfaction to my mind; but it is in the hands of the jury; and if they will say, that they are satisfied, that they can convict this prisoner, why then the surgeon must be called for; this is the whole evidence as to the fact; if you should say, that you cannot satisfy yourselves to convict the prisoner on this evidence, it will be mis-spending the time of the court to go on; if you think here is a case laid before you to go further into the trial, very well; but you have the complete evidence of the fact before you, be so good to give the court an information, gentlemen, of your opinion upon that.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are fully satisfied my lord, that the evidence does not amount to certain proof of murder, or any thing relating to it.</p>

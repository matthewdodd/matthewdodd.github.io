               <p>I live at Canterbury. Upon Wednesday the 22d of August, I went to the races. I had a pocket-book, in which was a draught of Mr. Whitebread's on Messrs. Carey and Co. for. 20. In the afternoon I was upon the stand in the race-ground, and put my hand to my pocket and missed my book: I sent an express to the banker's to stop payment of the draught. I came up to London, after the prisoner had been taken up, and I was present when he was examined before the Lord Mayor on the Tuesday following. Upon that examination, he acknowledged having the draught in his possession, but said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120007"></xptr> he had received it of a person who had found it, and had given it to him to bring to London to receive the money: being asked, if he knew who the person was that he had it of; he said, he knew the person, but did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I say I knew the name, but did not know where he was? - He said, he did not know the man's name: the Lord-Mayor said, it was a strange thing for a man to trust him with a note, that he did not know. When I went back to the Compter, I understood a pocket-book had been found on a dunghill; I saw that book; in that, among other things, there were several memorandums that had been in my pocket-book, and in particular, a lottery-ticket with my indorsement upon it.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. Carey and Co. On the 23d of August, between one and two in the afternoon, the prisoner brought a .20 draught for payment: he said his name was Hyatt, and he would write that name on the draught. I did not require him to write the name upon it, because that morning we had received an express to stop the payment of it: I went backwards with the draught to one of the partners, who came forwards, and had him secured and sent to the Compter.</p>

He said, he had a freightage to come to the water-side, and I should have a share in it, if I would go to London to get the cash, I said, I would not, without he indorsed it to me: he indorsed it to me, and I came to London with it. I did not think of being tried here; I thought I was to be tried in Kent.</p>

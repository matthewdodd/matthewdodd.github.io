                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in St. Pancras. The pri<lb></lb>soner was a journeyman in my employ—I keep a lad beside—on the 31st of July I got up to watch—the prisoner was in the shop, and about half-past six o'clock he was cutting up the meat—about seven I went out to Seymour-street, and came back about eight o'clock—I then looked at the prisoner's coat, which was hanging up in the kitchen, and found in it two pieces of mut<lb></lb>ton and one piece of beef—it was my meat, and was wrapped up in paper—I called a constable, and directed his attention to it—the prisoner was sent to Seymour-street on an errand—he changed the meat from his great coat to the coat he has on now, and his great coat was taken up stairs to the bed-room—he went to Seymour-street—I went and apprehended him there—the po<lb></lb>liceman said he wanted him—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For robbing me"—he pulled me on one side, and said he wanted to speak to me—I said I had nothing to do with him—the meat was found on him—he said he had paid for it.</p>

Sunday—I returned to Liverpool some time in the nest week, but I can't say on what day—my wife could tell you—I am not aware that I said that I would rather lose 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than appear against the soldiers—Miss Allen was not with me when I lost my watch, that I am aware of—I became acquainted with her on the Monday at the Old Bailey—I am not aware that I introduced her to everybody as ray cousin—she wanted to take my arm from this Court to Fleet Street, but I prevented her by taking my arm away—you did not tell me that it would be derogatory to the Court for me to retire without its permission—you did not give me the address of three solicitors, and represent that I had better see one of them—I do not recollect the name of Mr. Reader, except in a letter, or Mr. Newhurst, or Mr. Froggart—I swear that I gave you no instructions to employ counsel on my behalf—I got a letter from you after my return to Liverpool, after the trial was over—it could not have affected the trial—I did not charge either of the men with stealing ray watch, but the police did—you told me that the older soldier had been in the regiment seventeen years—I did not pay attention to the character which Sergeant Hollis gave them—you did not tell me that my attendance here was of the highest importance to the soldiers; nothing of the sort—during the time I was in London, I forget where I was—I had no companion, lady or gentleman, day or night, that I am aware of.</p>

Talley, you will get yourself into a mess, old fellow; never do such a foolish thing again; however, you go and see about getting some money from the prose<lb></lb>cutor, and get his retainer and authority, and come back to me"—he left the brief with me, and as soon as he had gone I gave it to my clerk with certain instructions—I would have nothing to do with it, and I did not see Talley again until I met him when he was out on bail.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 798). I was in charge of the indictment against Nichols and Hawkinson—on 16th August, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I heard Talley ask Lancaster, to go down and take lunch—they were in the passage leading to the Grand Jury room—Lancaster said "No"—Talley than asked him to go down and have a glass of champagne; he said "No," and then Talley asked him to have a glass of ale, and cigars—I then told Lancaster in Talley's presence that he must not go away as the indictment was in before the Grand Jury, and he would be called upon—Lancaster said "Will you excuse me, I want to go the urinal," he went down stairs and the prisoner followed him—I followed, and saw Lancaster come out of the urinal—Talley then spoke to him outside the Court door, and Holloway joined them—I saw Talley with a paper in his hand, offering it to Lancaster, who refused to take it—they stood there five minutes talking, but I could not hear—I then went to Lancaster, and told him he was to come upstairs at once—Talley followed him upstairs, and tried to draw him away again, but I told him he must not go away—Talley said to me "Have you got Mr. Lancaster in custody?"—I said "No, it is my duty to keep the witnesses and the prosecutor together till after they have passed the Grand Jury"—he still stopped about the different passages and followed us all the afternoon—the bill was found between 4 and 5 o'clock, on the Monday afternoon, not on the Tuesday—the Court adjourned at about 5 o'clock, and I then walked a little way with Lancaster, and left him just this side of the Holborn Viaduct—I then saw Talley, Holloway, Mrs. Nichols, and Miss Allen, join him—I left them talking to him; he said that he was going straight home, and I wished them good-night—he was lodging somewhere in Fleet Street—I saw Hutt, just as we left the Court—I saw them again next day, but we had no conversation—although the soldiers were acquitted, the Common Serjeant ordered the money found on them to be given up to the prosecutor, and I did so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On 16th August I was at this Court, and after the Court adjourned I was outside, and saw Lancaster with Heavens (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 798)—they walked towards the Holborn Viaduct—Heavens left Lancaster, who came back and was talking to a man named Holloway, when Talley brought Miss Allen up on his arm and said "This is the old friend I was speaking about"—he then took Lancaster and Holloway a few yards on, leaving Miss Allen with me, and in about a minute she was called—not liking the look of them, I called Lancaster to me and asked him who these people were (Talley was only 2 or 3 yards from us, and most likely he could hear what was said)—Lancaster said "They are the friends of Nichols"—I said "Whatever you do, don't go into a public-house with them nor sign any paper"—he said "I will just hear what they have got to say, and then I shall go to my hotel"—I left for two or three minutes, and when I walked up the Old Bailey again I saw Miss Allen holding Lancaster's arm, trying to get him into a public-house, Talley and Holloway being close behind—Lancaster would not go into a public-house, and Talley then looked at Miss Allen and nodded his head in the direction of Holborn Viaduct, and they all walked that way, Allen and Lancaster first, and Talley and Holloway 2 or 3 yards behind, who both looked round to see whether 1 was following them—they went over the Viaduct to the corner of St. Andrew's Street and into the new street, where they all stopped and surrounded Lancaster for about ten minutes—he apparently tried to get away, but Allen took hold of his arm again and took him about half-way down the new street, where they stopped again and surrounded him for about half an hour—I saw Talley take some paper from his pocket and appear to be reading to Lancaster, who tried to get away again—he threw down his umbrella and got away for a few yards, but Miss Allen followed him and caught hold of his arm, Holloway and Talley following him—they went on into Farringdon Street, where they stopped again for a few minutes, and Lancaster took his umbrella up and threw it down in a very excited state, and walked away and Holloway, Talley, and Miss Allen had a little conversation—Miss Allen and Holloway then followed and Talley followed a few yards behind them—Holloway spoke to him first—Lancaster crossed over to St. Bride's Avenue to get out of the way, followed by Miss Allen, who caught hold of his arm, and Holloway—I saw detective Hawkins in Fleet Street and asked him to go with me—Miss Allen and Lancaster stopped with Holloway close to them in the court—Holloway turned and saw me and walked into Salisbury Court where he met Talley—when they got close together I took hold of them one by each arm and said "I have a great mind to lock you up for endeavouring to defeat the ends of justice by tampering with the witness"—Talley said "I have done nothing of the kind"—I said "You vagabond, I have been watching you over an hour"—I regretted that as soon as I had said it—we all walked together into St. Bride's Avenue—I had let go of their arms—I touched Miss Allen on the shoulder and said "If I see any more of this I shall lock you up"—Lan<lb></lb>caster</p>

               <p>saw his opportunity and went away—Talley walked up Fleet Street by my side and said "I am a solicitor and why do you call me a vagabond?" I said "Perhaps struck off the rolls," he not being dressed very well, he had a straw hat, a dust coat, and a coloured waistcoat—I turned into the Temple and he asked my name and I told him to meet me at the Court next morning and I should be prepared to meet any complaint he had got to make—he said "No, I want your name"—he followed me out of the Temple and we met Goodman 445 <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, to whom he said "I want this man's name"—Goodman said "Give the gentleman your name"—I said "You know me, Hutt, and took out my warrant card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing my Christian and surname, which Talley could see if he liked—he said to Goodman "He and others are following me for the purpose of in<lb></lb>timidating roe for a pecuniary purpose"—I said "That shows I did not call you out of your name to make that imputation against me"—I then walked away followed by Holloway—I had Lancaster with me all the next day and at the adjournment of the Court I took him opposite to give him some lunch—Talley came in and said "I have the opinion of eminent counsel, if I choose to dine with you I can do it and dare any one to interfere"—I took no notice of him but brought Lancaster over to the Court again—on the Wednesday when the case was called on, Talley came into the Court where Lancaster and I were and gave him a card in an envelope, he looked at it and then gave it to me—Talley asked what he thought of it—Lancaster said "Nothing, what does it mean?"—Talley said "Oh, there is a meaning in it"—after Nichols and Hawkinson were discharged I made an application to Sir Thomas Chambers about the money and he desired me to give it to Lancaster and not to Talley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No one gave me instructions to follow you—I am paid so much a week as a detective—I am not paid by the case—I became acquainted with Lancaster by seeing him in the witness box the day after he was robbed—I have been a detective two years—I had no idea that you were an attorney—you did not produce your card—I had no private meeting with the chief clerk previous to 16th August—he did not give me instructions, nor did Sir Robert Carden—I went to Miss Allen after the case was before the Bench to ascertain whether she had given a correct account of herself—I am the nominal prosecutor—I went to an address where she said she did not live at 12, Dukes Row—I became acquainted with her on the 16th of last month, when you introduced her to Lancaster as the friend you had been talking about—she had hold of your arm, and after you left her I said to her, "Mrs. Lancaster, I presume," knowing that Mrs. Lancaster was in London, and she said "No"—I went to Anderton's Hotel with Lancaster and had a cup of tea. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner persisted in asking questions which the Court informed him had nothing to do with the case.</hi>) I was not aware that Lancaster borrowed money of Holloway—Miss Allen told me that she first met Lancaster in the street, by the Mansion House on the Friday—I laid an information against you at the Mansion House, upon which a summons was granted—I did not wait till the Court was cleared, there may have been four or five persons present—I was called into the witness-box here by Sir Thomas Chambers to state what I had seen you do, and you were ordered to be at the Court next morning, when Sir Thomas said that he would wait until the Commissioners had enquired into your complaint against me, and 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>has not sent for me, and I have had no subsequent conversation with him—I heard on the Tuesday evening of your complaint against me—the Commissioners wanted to see me at the office—I did not arrest you when I saw you with Lancaster because I had a doubt whether it was a charge which we could lock up for ourselves, or whether we required the instructions of a judge, and you had the benefit of it—I did not think I had settled it when I called you a vagabond, but you gave me a direct falsehood, and I spoke hastily—I said that <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> you had been struck off the rolls—I was a little hot, and so were you—I saw Mrs. Lancaster in the evening, and she asked me to look after her husband the next day—Lancaster did not ask me to lend him any money—during the two days we were together he sometimes paid, and sometimes I did—you and Holloway were working together. (<hi rend="italic">The</hi> Jury <hi rend="italic">here interposed, and the Court informed the prisoner that he was injuring his own case</hi>). There was. music on the card which you gave to Lancaster, and I took it away because I saw that there was some offensive meaning in it reflecting on Lancaster's character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence addressed the Jury at great length upon several subjects, which the Court informed him were utterly irrelevant to the issue, such as Law Reform, the University boat, race, Epsom Races, and the necessity of appointing a Public Prosecutor, he declared that a conspiracy to oppress him had been got up by the police, he contended that he had done no more than his duty towards the two soldiers who were his clients, and stated that Lancaster had expressed a wish to retire from the prosecution.</hi>

Carden of that circumstance, but do not remember what he said—no consent was given—I wrote this letter (D), and saw Mr. Lancaster sign it—I attested his signature—he was neither drunk nor sober—he had no money about him; he made several applications for some—there is no pretence for saying that you introduced me to Lancaster—when he asked you for money you told him distinctly that you would not give it to him, as it would injure the case; he wanted it very much—after leaving the refreshment-house we took the train to Westminster, and went to Mrs. Nichols' house—you came there also—I don't know whether you came with us but you were there—Lancaster was sober enough to walk through the streets—there is no pre<lb></lb>tence for saying that he could not understand what was said to him—it was promised that Mrs. Nichols should give him some money—he got 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and signed this receipt for it, which is in my writing, "July 30, 1875, Received of Mr. George Holloway 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account. T. B. Lancaster. Witness, Amelia Allen" the letter was signed at the refreshment-house; nothing was done clandestinely or secretly—I may have said "Well, he really wants the money to get home with"—I knew he wanted to return to Liverpool—Holloway also came to Nichols' house—we went there again on the 31st for more money which was promised—he could not get to Liverpool for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he urged that as one object for procuring money—he went there two or throe times, but could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get the money, as Mrs. Nichols was out—he was in about the same state the following day, neither drunk nor sober—this other receipt is in Lancaster's writing, but I did not see him write it.

It was arranged on the Tuesday night that Mrs. Nichols and Mr. Holloway between them should make up this amount of money, and Lancaster was to call for it on Saturday afternoon at 4 o'clock, and we did so—I heard that the money was to be repaid to Mr. Holloway from the money in Court—Hutt called on me to see where I resided—he may have been with me twenty minutes—I cannot tell you exactly what passed—he has not called on me about this case, but I spoke to him—I went to your office one evening when the soldiers' trial was on, and wrote a letter to you at your desk, and one to Lancaster—you offered me your arm on leaving this Court, as there were a great many vehicles passing, and I walked up the street with you a little way—we spoke to Lancaster and to Hutt, and then returned and chatted for a few minutes—I don't think I ever saw you give drink to Lancaster—you did not annoy or importune him in any way—I have not seen Lancaster since that Monday night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Lancaster said that he would do anything he could to save the prisoners—he asked you to whom he should address the letter; I do not remember what answer you gave him—I heard you make an application to Sir Robert Carden, but cannot tell now what you said—Lan<lb></lb>caster appeared an educated man, he writes a very good hand—there is no pretence for saying that there were any importunities on your part to induce him to do anything that I am aware of—he gave the letter as a guarantee to Holloway for the money he was going to receive—I took the letter from him because he was making such a bungle of it—Holloway said that the letter was useless to him for the purpose of</p>

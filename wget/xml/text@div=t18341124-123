                  </hi>. I live in Paternoster-row, Spitalfields. On the 18th of September, about half-past one o'clock, I was in Bishopsgate-street—I had two hats in my hand—the prisoners came to me—Davey asked me the price of a hat—I told him, "Half a crown"—he took one hat out of my hand, and gave his own hat to Goode—they both ran off, and Davey went into a pawnbroker's with my hat on his head—I wanted to go in to prevent his pawning it, but Goode pulled me back—I said, "It will be worse for you if you hinder me"—he pulled me back again—I called out, and the young man came out to see what was the matter—Davey then came out with the duplicate in his hand—I ran after them—they ran into a court, and the officer took them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Thompson, a pawnbroker, in Crown-street. Davey came in with the hat—he asked 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it—I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw a crowd round the door—I went out, and saw Davey take a hat from Goode—Davey went out of our house without a hat—that did not excite my suspicion—I had often seen such things done.</p>

I followed the prisoners into a court, and took them—I saw Davey had one of his fists clenched—I said, "What have you there?"—he said, "Nothing at all"—I took his hand, and found the duplicate and the shilling—he said he had done wrong, and he would give himself up—they might have been drinking, but were capable of knowing what they were about.</p>

               <p>in Brownlow-street, and I have a shop in Holborn—the prisoner was in my employ—he was to solicit orders, and to take money, and pay it to Mr. Longman or to me. when he received it—he had no right to do business on his own account—I stipulated with him that he should not do it—our firm is Longman and Co.—it consists of myself only—I knew of this work being done at Mr. Slater's—my workmen did it, with my materials and at my estimate—the prisoner never paid me the amount for that work—after being asked repeatedly about it, he stated he had received the money and paid it to Mr. Longman—I knew of the goods being supplied to Mr. Parman—I have not received that money.</p>

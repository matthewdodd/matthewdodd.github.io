                  </hi>. I am deputy warehouse keeper at the "B" jetty in the Victoria Docks—Lowrie was quay foreman there—I believe he has been in the service of the company—on Saturday, the 30th of June, at eleven o'clock, I was at the "B" jetty—I saw some one push off the barge <hi rend="italic">Lion</hi>, but could not say that it was Gulliver—Lowrie was there—I went to speak to him, but before I had time to put a question he said he was preparing sweepings for forty-two pockets of linseed, an order for which he held in his hands—the order was not signed—I then com-municated with the constable Grigg—a short time afterwards I saw the barge <hi rend="italic">Lion</hi> alongside—Gulliver was then in charge—I saw taken out of that barge thirty-three bushels of linseed sweepings from the centre—that was worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lowrie ought not to have delivered without having an order properly signed at the office—this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not properly signed—it ought to be signed by Messrs. Lang and Merridew, the merchants, and at our office—when a delivery is made to a barge it is Lowrie's duty to see that an entry of it is made in a book—no such entry was made—I have not the book here—the quantity of sweep<lb></lb>ings usually given with forty pockets of linseed is two bushels—that would be a fair quantity—these forty-two pockets of linseed were after<lb></lb>wards delivered for a proper order, and I have the order with me—that was a portion of the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Bengallon</hi>—these sweepings were taken from a pile off the quay where Lowrie was—I saw that pile on Friday—on Saturday, when I spoke to Lowrie, that pile was gone—I should say there would be about thirty-three bushels in that pile—on Saturday I found some loose bags on a pile of saltpetre—Lowrie ought not to have delivered any pockets or any sweepings on this order.</p>

I am head constable in the service of the Dock Com<lb></lb>pany, and live at the Victoria Dock—about half-past eleven o'clock on the Saturday morning, the 30th June, I received some information about the barge <hi rend="italic">Lion</hi>—Gulliver had the charge of it then—I went on board the barge and told him I was a dock constable, and asked what he had on board the barge—he said, "Nothing more than what I brought into the dock gates"—I then said, "I must see what you have got"—he opened each cabin, fore and aft, and then opened the hatches—there was nothing in the cabins—I went into the hold of the barge, and there found a quantity of jute and several bags of linseed sweepings piled up at one end—I also found a quan<lb></lb>tity of linseed sweepings in bulk—I asked him how he accounted for those—he said, "I brought them into the dock yesterday"—I said, "They appear to have been recently placed here"—he said, "I took in the jute yesterday at the south side, and as they threw the jute into the barge it scattered the seed, and I have been shovelling it up—I then left Gulliver and went to the "B" jetty, where I saw a labourer named Jones—I had</p>

               <p>some conversation with him, and in consequence of that I went to Lowrie, who was in his box near the "B" jetty—I said, "Have you delivered any seed or seed sweepings lately?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Be careful what you say; have you delivered any seed or seed sweepings during the day, or authorised any to be delivered?"—he said, "No, I have neither delivered any seed nor authorised any to be delivered during the day"—I said, "There must be some mistake; come with me and see Jones"—we went to Jones—I said to him, "Jones, have you delivered any seed or seed sweepings from this jetty to-day?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "How much?"—he said, "I believe it is about three or four quarters"—I said, "By whose authority did you deliver those?"—he said, "By Mr. Lowrie's authority"—I then said to Lowrie, "You hear what Jones says, Mr. Lowrie?"—he said, "Yes, I was not aware that any had been delivered"—I then requested him to go to the superintendent's office—when there the superintendent asked him if any seed had been delivered, and he said, yes; he had delivered it to forward business—he said there had been an order from the lightermen, but it was not correct—Lowrie was then suspended—it is the practice in the docks that no orders are to be passed to a fore<lb></lb>man unless they are previously passed by the general office and properly signed—I then saw Gulliver on the "B" jetty, and said, "There is some<lb></lb>thing wrong about this, Gulliver; you had better come with me to the superintendent's office"—he said, in the superintendent's presence, that the seed was delivered to him by Lowrie according to the order that he had in his possession—he was allowed to go away, but was afterwards taken upon a warrant.</p>

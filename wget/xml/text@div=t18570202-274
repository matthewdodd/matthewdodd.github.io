                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in New-street, Dorset-square. On 7th Jan. the prisoner Ward came into my shop, about half past 6 o'clock in the evening—she asked for a penny bun—I had not one; I gave her two halfpenny ones—she paid me a sixpence—I gave her a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece and a penny—I put the sixpence in the till, where there were two half crowns and a shilling or two, but no other sixpence—Ward left the shop, and in about three minutes Clark came in—she asked for a penny bun—I had not one—I gave her a captain's biscuit—she threw down a sixpence—I noticed it almost before I took it up—it was bad—I told her so, and asked where she came from—she said, "From Tottenham-court-road"—I then looked at the other sixpence—I found only that one in the till—I found that was bad likewise—I then said to Clark," Have you a sister? has your sister been here?"—she said she had no sister—I said, "Some one belonging to you has, and I shall detain you till a policeman comes"—the policeman came and took her, and I said, "I will go and see if I can find the other one"—I went to the next street, and found Ward, who was eating a tart—I took her back, and they were both taken into custody—I gave the police<lb></lb>man both the sixpences.</p>

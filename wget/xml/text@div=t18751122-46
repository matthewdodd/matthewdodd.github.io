                  </hi>. I am a baker at Mr. Drew's, Shad well, and live at 11 Has well Street, Bermondsey—on Saturday night, 6th November, I was in George Street, Shad well, at about 1.30. when I was tripped up by the prisoner and other person not in custody—the prisoner put his hand in my pocket—I sung out "Police!"and a policeman captured him and brought him back—I missed my money and my tobacco box—I am sure he is one of the two persons.</p>

I saw the prisoner with another man not in custody, loitering under the Dock Wall—about tea minutes afterwards I saw the prosecutor, and the prisoner and another man took hold of him and threw him—the prosecutor shouted "Police," and ran away—I followed, and when he got to the corner of Glasshouse Street he threw something down—I caught him in Glasshouse Street—then he dropped something else down—I asked him what it was—he said "Nothing"—I looked down and found this tobacco box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then took him back and looked and found a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and prosecutor then came up and identi<lb></lb>fied him as one of those who had robbed him—when the charge was read over to him he said he and his mate had been to work and received their money, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—when he was searched a penny was found on him.</p>

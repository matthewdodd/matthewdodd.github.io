             was at my house; the prisoner was dancing before the window - he then went into the parlour, and was dancing there - he then went into the tap-room, and while there, the deceased came to the bar, and paid me for a pot of beer; and in five or ten minutes, the prisoner came out, and sat himself on the bench outside the door. Whales had a pint of beer, and went up and said something to the prisoner, which I did not understand - he, (Whales) at last said,</p>
               <p>"I will make him drink" - he was there five or ten minutes; the prisoner then went away; Whales followed him, and was abusing him very much for going away: I heard Nairey say,</p>
               <p>"I cannot fight, and do not want to fight" - they turned the corner, and got out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner was perfectly quiet at your house - A. Quite so. Whales seemed provoking him to fight, and he wanted to get out of his way.</p>

            . I am collector to the East London water works. On the 10th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and Whales beginning to fight - each struck but one blow; the blow the prisoner struck knocked Whales down, as if he was struck by a cannon ball, he laid as if dead: but previous to the fight, I saw them on the Regent's canal-bridge; and the prisoner seemed reluctant to fight; he said,</p>

               <p>"If I must fight, I will" - and when he knocked Whales down, he made an effort to get away, but was taken. I understand that Whales had previously struck him.</p>

            . I live in Globe-street, Mile-end. I was at my master's door by the bridge, and saw Nairey and Whales standing together; and saw Whales strike him several times - the prisoner came away, and asked master to see him righted; master said, as he was in liquor, he had better go home. They both stripped and went to fight on the bridge; both were in liquor; the prisoner hit the deceased under the right ear and knocked him down; he got up, and the prisoner struck him again in the same place, and knocked him down; he then put his clothes on and went away. He did not want to fight, but was aggravated to it. I did not see Whales strike at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner walk away and the deceased follow him - A. Yes; and then they fought. When he came to master, he walked on the bridge, and the deceased followed him; it is not two steps from master's house; the deceased stripped first, and had somebody as a second; the prisoner had no friend.</p>
               <p>JAMES STONE. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody; and took him to the deceased, who laid on the bridge. Nairey asked him if he had done him any harm, and put his hand out - Whales shook hands with him, and said, he had done him no harm, that it was a fair stand up fight, and it was his own fault - he appeared in a languid state. I took him to the Globe public-house; the prisoner was liberated, and surrendered to the Coroner's Jury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know when he died - A. Seventeen days after; the prisoner appeared exceedingly sorry for it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS. I am a student at the London Hospital. The deceased was brought there on the 10th of July. One of the small bones of his leg was fractured, which was the only injury I could find. I attended him till the 23d or 24th, when he died. Symptoms of violent inflammation of the brain appeared about the second or third day, which continued till his death. I opened his body, and found marks of violent inflammation of the brain; he never complained of having received a blow on the head. I believe his death arose from the inflammation, whether that arose from a blow or a fall I cannot say; it might probably arise from a concussion of the brain, from a fall, which might be aggravated by his intoxication, or the the blow might produce it. I think the fracture of the leg with his intoxication might produce it, as it is always accompanied by fever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not most probable that the inflammation arose from fever, created by the fractured leg, aided by intoxication - A. I think it most probable.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The cause of his death was inflammation of the brain - A. Yes, my Lord; it might arise from the fever, caused by breaking the leg, the fall, or other causes.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160022"></xptr>I think the irritation of the broken bone, aggravated by intoxication, the most probable cause.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and live in High-street, Greenwich. On the night of 25th of January, I was in the Cooper's Arms public-house—I went towards the fire-place and passed the prisoner, who was sitting on the left-hand side—he did not get up, but he ran something very sharp into the thick part of my thigh—I had not spoken to him that evening—I knew him before, but not to speak in any <hi rend="italic">civility</hi> to him—I bled a great deal—I went to the station, and was examined by Mr. Stewart, the sur<lb></lb>geon—the prisoner had one night before pushed me against the bars of the fire, at the Duke on Horseback public-house, and one night he pushed a pin into me at the same house—I had not given him any offence that I know of—he is a smith—the wound is not healed now—I have suffered a good deal with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Coleman-street, Woolwich. I examined the prosecutrix's person, and found a punctured wound on the left buttock—I did not probe it—it may have been probably half an inch deep, from the extent of the bleeding—under ordinary circumstances it was not likely to be attended with any serious consequences—it would not occasion any grievous bodily harm—it must have been done by a pointed instrument—this nail would produce such a wound.</p>

            . I live at the Cross Keys, Gracechurch-street. On the 19th of January the prisoner called at our house; he called for a glass of grog; it was near nine o'clock; he asked me if captain Armstrong or captain Selby had called there; I told him, no; he said, if they had not they would call that night, or early the next morning. He ordered two beds, two rooms, and two fires, and asked me to procure him a porter to go and fetch the luggage from Billingsgate; he then ordered some supper, and another glass of grog before he went out, that was eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay for his grog - A. No, nor for his supper; he ate his supper, and went out with the porter and a gentleman. He turned back in a great hurry, said, can you give me change of a ten pound note, I have no change with me, or can you lend me any; I lent him a dollar and four shillings; he did not say the amount; he said he wanted some money to pay for the luggage. He went away to Billingsgate; the porter that went with him brought him back by force.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. No.</p>

            . I am a navy agent. I happened to be in the coffee-room, I saw the prisoner, he was having beef steaks for his supper, a gentleman came in and had some turtle-soup; he said, I am very fond of turtle soup, let me have some. After supper he said he thought he knew me, he had lately come from Portsmouth, have you been on board the Royal William? I said, yes; he said, I have got a great many goods coming up from Gravesend, I am concerned that I have not got them; I am servant to captain Armstrong. I told him I knew there was such a captain in the navy; he said, he should take it as a particular favour for me to go along with him to get the things, he should be uneasy if he did not get them in his own room, where he was to sleep. I told him I would, and gave him a card of my address. We went out, he called me of one side, he said, it is very hard I cannot get change of a ten pound note; he asked me to lend him five or six shillings; I lent him a dollar. He took a coach in Cornhill; the prisoner Stubbs and me went to Billingsgate; we could find no goods in Darkhouse-lane belonging to captain Armstrong. He said to me, you had better give the coachman something to drink; I did. I said you had better discharge the coachman, he will charge for staying; he said, you had better discharge the coachman yourself, he will charge me more than you. I went to the coachman, I asked him what his fare was, he said, three shillings; I told the coachman he had two glasses of brandy, I thought two shillings would do very well; I paid him. The prisoner said, I want to pay the porter. I lent him half a crowns and then left him.</p>

            . I am a porter; I was at the Cross Keys Inn on Saturday evening the 19th of January, I saw a shabby kind of a man come in; I said to the landlord, what does this shabby man do here; he said, hold your tongue, Stubbs, he has brought a good order here. The first thing he called for a glass of ale, he ordered mutton chops and potatoes for supper, a gentleman came in and asked for a plate of mock turtle; the prisoner order a plate of mock turtle, and a glass of grog; he said he wanted a ticket porter to bring up five or six trunks, and two hat boxes; one of the trunks were so large it could not be got into a coach; he would wish to engage three or four ticket porters. I told him there were no ticket porters, if he would be ruled by me I would call a hackney coach, and I would bring as much as was in my power, which he agreed to. He wished to have the indulgence to smoke his pipe. After twelve o'clock he said, now I am ready to go. We took a coach at Cornhill, and drove to Darkhouse-lane for the goods in question. When we came to the Queen's Head there were no such goods, there we made every enquiry about the goods while he drank the grog; he could have escaped if he had been so disposed; he came to me; he said, porter, lend me five shillings; I lent him five shillings; he went out directly after I lent him the dollar; he took the last witness into a bye room and borrowed a dollar of him. Now my man said I pay the coachman; he said, no, I will ride home; Mr. Johnson paid the coachman. We had some grog; the prisoner and I walked arm in arm to the Cross Keys. We had a glass of grog, and while we were drinking it, he said, you must go with me to a musick shop in Cornhill, I must get the musick for captain Armstrong in the morning. We went to the musick shop in Cornhill, the watchman lighted us; he said as the musick shop is shut up Mr. Stubbs, this man has been very kind, what small change have you. I gave the watchman sixpence. The prisoner led led me down to the

            . I had suspicion but not strong enough to think him a vagabond. This was about half after one; he dragged me to St. Mary Axe by force. I got him into Gracechurch-street again, and coming by the passage that leads into Leadenhall-street he said, I wish you would stop, I want to make water. That moment he sprang from me into Leadenhall-market, not knowing the way of the market he stumbled against the butchers shambles; I took him; he gave me a crown, and said, do not call the watchman. I took it and said, I thought you were a rogue, I am sure of it now. I took him home, and from there to Bishopgate-street watchhouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller of Northampton Square, Clerkenwell—on 5th August, 1875, the prisoner came to me and asked me to get him a gold watch, value about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for someone in France—I afterwards got three for him and showed them to him—it was to be a cash transac<lb></lb>tion—he afterwards sent me this letter, enclosing a cheque, and believing it to be worth the money I parted with the watch and chain—I also re<lb></lb>ceived these other letters from him, dated September 2nd, October 1st, and November 3rd, but saw nothing of him—it was not till after he was in custody on another charge that I discovered that the watch and chain had been pledged—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My brother John is a sleeping partner with me—he is not always there transacting business, but is often there—the prisoner has never bought any goods of us before—these six cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bear my brother's endorsement, but they have nothing to do with the firm—my brother is here—I did not take proceedings between August and January owing to the false letters the prisoner sent—I sent an invoice with the watch and another by post, and I gave a receipt to the messenger who brought the cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the prisoner selected the watch he said nothing about having credit nor did he refer to my brother at all—I did not believe the letters were true, because they contradicted each other.</p>

"Aug. 5, 1875. To Messrs. Waple Brothers.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living at No. 12, Crown Court, Cripplegate—I knew the deceased; he was also a tailor, and lived at No. 3, Nettleton Court, Nicol Square, Aldgate. On Saturday night, 2d Jan., I was with the deceased in Nicol Square; the prisoner's wife and the deceased's wife were there also—we had been to the theatre together—the deceased asked the prisoner to get him some beer, and gave him the money—the prisoner said, "I do not think I can get any beer; I have got a drop of rum in my pocket"—the prisoner was a little in liquor—after a time, we all went to the prisoner's house—there was some little quarrelling there about the rum, and after a word or two that O'Neal said, there was a proposal to fight—whenwe first got into the house, the prisoner put the rum on the table—Richardsonthrew down a penny, and said, as there was a quartern of rum, that would pay for it; with that the prisoner took up the rum, and put it into his pocket, and said he would take it away with him—the deceased said, "Don't take it away, as you have brought it here; let us drink it"—the prisoner put it into his pocket, and said he would—the deceased said, if he did, he would break it in his pocket—the prisoner said he would bet him a sovereign he would not break it, and if he attempted it, he would put such a man as him up the chimney; he said there was some little animosity between them—Richardson said, "I did not know it; if there is, let us come out and settle it"—with that he took off his coat, and went out into the square—the prisoner ran to the fireplace, and caught hold of the tongs; they were taken from him by Mrs. Richardson—Richardson said, "Come out, if you are a man"—the prisoner then caught hold of the fire shovel, and that was taken away from him; then the wives of both men advised the prisoner to go up stairs, which he did, into Mrs. Mann's room—the deceased called two or three times to him to come down like a man, if there was any animosity between them—the deceased then went up stairs; he found all in darkness, and he called for a light—they would not take him one, and he came down for one—he got a light, and went up stairs with it; I went with him, and directly he opened the door, he was struck; I did not exactly see what with, but I saw fire irons of some sort—nothing was said by the deceased at that time, that I heard—I saw him afterwards; he was bleeding very much—he was helped down stairs by three women, and was afterwards taken to Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The deceased was brought there about a quarter to 1 o'clock in the morning of 3d Jan.—he had a scalp wound about two inches and a half long, by an inch broad, a little to the left of the middle line of the head—upon introduc<lb></lb>ing my finger, I found that the bone of the skull had been depressed and was exposed—those portions of bone which were depressed and fractured were afterwards removed; symptoms of inflammation of the membranes of the brain set in, and a constant discharge of brain from the wound took place, and he died of convulsions on the 24th—I afterwards inspected the head; it simply corroborated what I have stated; I have no doubt of the cause of death—a blow from such an instrument as this produced would be very likely to pro<lb></lb>duce such a wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the blow caused the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He died in consequence of the injury he received—he had no symptoms of inflamma<lb></lb>tion of the membranes of the brain until Monday morning; the injury took place on Saturday night or Sunday morning—at first we had hopes of his recovery, because we had no idea the injury was so serious; but the depressed portions of bone were driven into the brain, and in consequence of that inflam<lb></lb>mation took place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Must it have been a violent blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very violent, as vio<lb></lb>lent as a man could give with such an instrument; it had driven both tables of the skull completely into the brain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Matthew Hesses, a shoe<lb></lb>maker, in Ratcliffe-highway. On the 29th of November the prisoners came to his shop, in company, about six o'clock in the evening—Davis asked if a pair of shoes that she had ordered about a fortnight previously were ready—(Nowlan was with her when she came before)—I said they were—I asked her to sit down, and gave her the shoes to try if they would fit her—she declined trying them on, and said she thought they would suit, and gave me a sovereign to pay for them—she then asked me to give her a pair of strings—I said I had not got any, unless I took them from another pair—while I was doing that I missed a pair of boots, which had been down right before me, hanging against the door-Nowlan was nearest to them—(I had missed two pairs the time before, when they came to order the shoes)—I called Barker to mind the shop, while I got a policeman—the prisoners remained in the shop—I got a policeman, and asked him to search them—he turned round, and found secreted in a corner the very pair of boots I had missed—I cannot say what had occurred while I was at the door—these are my master's boots—I had given them change for a sovereign.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the further end of the shop—I saw Nowlan stoop down in the corner where the boots were afterwards found—I did not see the boots in her possession—I did not know they were lost till I saw the policeman take them up—there were other boots where these were.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 206.) I was sent for—I looked round, and saw where the boots had been hanging, and the string they hung by had been cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Scottish Brewery, Old-street. The prisoner was my out-door clerk—he was paid by commission, and also received at starting 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to go against the commission—this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was entered into between us on 4th May—it was his duty to account for cash received within two days of the receipt—I have my books here—he has not accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received on 17th Sept., from Mr. Jenkins, who appears in my books as a customer—he has not accounted for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or two sums of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, received on 26th Oct., from Mr. Trow—he used sometimes to account to me, and sometimes to Mr. Brookes, my principal clerk, or Mr. Punt—on 17th Sept. I happened to meet him in London, and he gave me a check for about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the entries in the scrawl cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are not in my writing, but I examine it occasionally, and very likely the same day that the entries are made—they are generally made in my presence—there is an entry here, in Mr. Rogers' writing, of a check of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 16th Sept.—on the prisoner's accounting with any of the clerks for money received from customers, it would be his duty to see it entered in this book, or enter it himself—there is no entry here of the sums mentioned.</p>

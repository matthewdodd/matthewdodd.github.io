            . The child was at play, and was taken from the door by the prisoner at the bar, on the 10th of May. He told her, he'd give it a cake; he kept her from home till 9 o'clock at night; he was much in liquor, and the child bruised very much when he brought her back, her nose was bruised, her shift, coat and apron were very bloody. We thought it came from the mouth of the child. The mother after this found the child very ill. I persuaded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110012"></xptr> her to go to Dr. Morton; he advised her to go to the Infirmary for the cure of the child; the child had got the foul distemper. The prisoner said he was clean ; but he was examined, and found to be foul. The prisoner owned he had the child with him. The child will be 4 years old next Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is its mother?</p>
               <p>C. Higgins. The mother went distracted upon this account, and died.</p>
               <p>Dr. Morton. I examined the child and the prisoner, they were both foul. The child said, the prisoner hurt her very much with his cock. The child has a buboe now on each groin.</p>
               <p>The infant not being capable of giving evidence, the prisoner was <rs id="t17500711-25-verdict116" type="verdictDescription">

               acquitted
            </rs>; and by order of the court there was another indictment preferred against him at Hicks's-hall, for an intent to commit a rape, and giving the child the foul disease. The prisoner was there cast to be confined in the prison of Newgate three years, twice to stand in the pillory in one month, and once more at the three years end; and find such security for his good behaviour as the court approves on for four years more.</p>

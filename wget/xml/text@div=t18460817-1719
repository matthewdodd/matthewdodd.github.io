                  </hi>. I am a fruit-seller, and live in New-court, White-street, Southwark. On Friday evening, the 10th of July, between nine and ten o'clock, I was selling fruit in the Dover-road, and saw the prisoner Wilson and another man, who I believe to be Lloyd—Wilson wore a cap, and the other a hat-Wilson said, "What have you got there, old lady?"—I said, "Gooseberries"—he said, "Will you give me a pennyworth?" which I did, and he gave me a shilling—I said, "Is that a good shilling?"—he said, "Oh yes, it is"—I said, "If it is not, why do youk'give it to an old woman like me?"—Lloyd wu standing by the stall near him at the time—I gave them lie?, and they went away—I put the shilling between my teeth, took it out, and had it in my hand when West, the policeman, came up—I gave it him, and he took it away.</p>

On the 10th July, about nine o'clock into evening, I was in company with Whitlam, at Newington Causeway, andsif the three prisoners walking and talking together—we followed them—we saw them near St. George's Church—I lost sight of them for a minute, and thea saw Lloyd and Jones standing at the corner of the Church, about ten yards from Leary's stall, in view of it, and Wilson at the stall—I crossed over on the same side of the way, and saw Lloyd pass and repass, and stand about two yards from the stall—when Wilson left the stall he followed him—I went up to the stall, and Leary gave me a shilling, which I produce—I then went to<lb></lb>wards wards</p>

               <p>the Town-hall, in the Borough, and saw the three prisoners walking in company—this was about four minutes after I left the stall—I saw them James and Lloyd came back again, and Wilson was waiting ten or fifteen yards from a stall in High-street, but the cabs came in my way, and I lost sight of him—I saw Jones and Lloyd go towards the stall—I did not see them arrive at it—I kept my eye on Wilson—I did not take the prisoners in charge till next night.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a fruit-stall, and live in Maypole-alley, Southwark. On the evening of 10th July, the prisoner Jones cametomeandasked for a halfpennyworth of gooseberries, which I gave her—shegave me a shilling, and I gave her elevenpence halfpenny change—Lloyd, I believe, came up while that was going on, and asked me if I had any gooseberries—I told him no, the woman had bought the last I had—Jones said to him, "I will sell you my lot for one penny"—Lloyd said, "you want to gain profit"—Jones went away immediately, and Lloyd stopped and asked me the question still, if I had any gooseberries, after I had said I had none—I told him no, I showed him the shilling, and asked him if it was a good one—he rung it on the stone, and said it was a good one, and he wished me or him had a good many like it—he gave it me back—I never lost sight of it—he went away—I don't know whether he went in the same direction as Jones, because she crossed the road—I did not see Wilson at all—Whitlam came up and asked me what had passed—I went into a public-house with him and gave the shilling to a bar<lb></lb>man, who bit a piece out of it in my presence, and gave it to Whitlam.</p>

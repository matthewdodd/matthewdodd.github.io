             sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for on the 5th of November at night, between six and seven o'clock, by Mr. Payne; I searched the prisoner, and found a guinea's worth of silver upon him, a five-shilling paper of halfpence, and eight pennyworth; the prisoner said, he had taken none, and knew nothing at all about it. (Produces the money.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. (Looks at the money.) Here are the four shillings that I marked; two of them are marked P on the head side, one is marked C on the head side, and the other P on the tail side.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the key of your desk? - A. Yes.(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell whether it was done with a picklock or false key; - A. I am apt to think it was done by a false key, for I found a key afterwards about two feet from my desk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My wife gave me money to go to market on Saturday morning; the prosecutor took me up on Saturday night; I could not buy things to my satisfaction; I had this money to give to the prosecutor: I used to give him all the silver I could get; I had been out all day; I had been up to Mary-le-bonne, and from there to Mile-end, to Bishopsgate-street, and Queenhithe, and had not been at home a quarter of an hour all day; I used to save all the silver I could for the prosecutor on a Saturday; I have witnesses in Court.</p>

             sworn. - I have known the prisoner five years; I always knew him to be a hard-working, industrious man; he worked for Mr. Payne, and had the privilege of going at ten o'clock; he used to get up at three in the morning, and take a knot and go down to Billingsgate to do something for his family; I went to Mr. Payne's house on Saturday morning, between twelve and one o'clock; he was just going out; he desired me to stop a little; I waited till he came in, and then I told him I had brought him four guineas; I pulled the four guineas out, and gave to Mr. Payne, and he said he would be favourable to him for a little money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to offer him the four guineas? - A. Because he signified to the prisoner's wife, that he had better have a little of the money back, and she came and told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you receive the four guineas from? - A. Mr. Gad, to give to Mr. Payne to be favourable to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Payne say to you? - A. He took the money, and said he would be very favourable to him; that he did it on account of the poor woman and her children.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300039"></xptr>Q. Did he take the money on account of the poor woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Payne. The man says he gave me four guineas, and asked me to shew him favour; I said it was too late, he had used me very ill, and was committed; he left the four guineas.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you think you lost four guineas by this man? - A. I have lost many pounds out of my desk within a few months.</p>

               <p>Court. I should be glad if you will fix with as much precision as you can, the time that you was robbed? - When I came out of the play-house.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to look at your watch at that time? - In the play-house to the best of my recollection I did.</p>
               <p>Can you say with certainty, upon your oath, that you did look at your watch while you was in the play-house? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>What were the play and the entertainment? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>I wish to ascertain the time by that, did you come out at the time when other people came out? - The play was over, and I came away with the rest of the company, I was crouded and jostled by a number of people, I came away to the end of the Piazza, which goes to <placeName id="t17850223-122-crimeloc570">Russel-street</placeName>

               <p>Describe in what manner a croud came round you, you know pretty well coming out of the house, there are a vast number of all sorts of people, girls of the town, and all sorts, what sort of a croud was this? - Such as generally are assembled at the coming out of the house; I can say no more than that I lost my watch and pocket handkerchief; I felt the watch taken out of my pocket, I caught hold of an arm, but the croud forced my hand from that arm.</p>
               <p>At the time that you felt your watch go, and caught hold of an arm, you did not perceive any thing more done to you, and the person slipped away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your watch afterwards? - It has been produced to me.</p>
               <p>Who produced it to you? - One Mr. Jones, a pawnbroker, in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Describe the watch you lost at that time? - It was a metal watch, with a moco tortoiseshell outside case, and inside case made of base metal.</p>
               <p>In that croud you can swear with certainty, that you felt your watch fall from you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Can you tell when last you had your watch in your hand that day? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had you had it about you that day? - That I am confident of.</p>
               <p>When did you last see your handkerchief? - Occasionally at the play-house.</p>
               <p>When you saw your watch again, did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230184"></xptr> you see it with the key and trinkets mentioned in the indictment? - No, my Lord, the seal and hook are gone, and the key was there then.</p>
               <p>Can you identify the watch? - Only by the wearing it now and then, when I went to dangerous places, I kept it for that purpose just to see the hour.</p>
               <p>How long might you have had it? - I fancy about a year, or a year and a half, or two years, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Was there any paper on the inside, that you can swear to? - I can swear to the watch by sight.</p>
               <p>I understand you did not distinguish any person at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see the face of the person whose arm you took hold of? - No, if I did, I cannot recollect who he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Had you your glasses on, Sir, at that time? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>I think I observe by the make of your glasses, that your sight is very short? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was in the usual croud that comes out of the play-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You felt your watch go, and immediately seized an arm, which you concluded was the arm that took your watch? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>You have no reason to believe that you saw the prisoner at the bar at all in that crowd? - No.</p>
               <p>Now, as to the watch itself, my Lord has asked you, whether either by the maker's name, or the number, or any lady's work, or any thing else, you can identify it? - No; I have the name and the number.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you describe the hair string? - There is a swivel and top made of gold, I know the string, I can swear to the string.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There are many hundred such strings as these in London? - Possibly there may.</p>
               <p>You have, I have no doubt, a very firm persuasion that that is your watch? - I have.</p>
               <p>But there are no particular marks by which you can distinguish that from another tortoiseshell watch, and that string from another hair string? - No, there are not.</p>
               <p>Do you think it was nearer ten than eleven, or eleven than ten? - I should rather guess it was nearer eleven.</p>
               <p>What house was it at? - Covent-Garden.</p>
               <p>You cannot recollect the performance? - No.</p>
               <p>There was no personal violence addressed to you, only the shoving of the crowd, as I understand it? - No.</p>
               <p>You felt your watch go? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Jones, pawnbroker, in Fleet-street; that watch was brought to our shop to pledge, I have had it ever since it was brought; I speak with certainty to the watch; it was brought and put into the witness Walker's hands, but I cannot swear by whom it was brought; I believe the other witness will swear to him.</p>
               <p>Was you present when it was brought? - I was present, the other witness took it from the hands of the person that brought it.</p>
               <p>Was you attending to other people at the time? - I was.</p>
               <p>Have you any notion of the person at all? - I did not take any notice, the witness Walker took the watch out of his hand that brought it, and asked him how much he wanted upon it; the answer was a guinea and a half; the other witness first looked at the watch, and then put it into my hand, to know if a guinea and a half would be lent upon it; I examined it, and thinking the mounting of the string to be gold, I went and asked the person whether the mounting was gold; his answer was yes; then I ordered the witness to lend the person a guinea and an half; the money was given, and the person went away.</p>
               <p>Court. What may the value of this watch be? - The first cost might be about three guineas and an half.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - On Monday the 10th of January, in the afternoon, the hour I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230185"></xptr>Can you at all say what time in the afternoon? - I looked at it by the light of a candle, it was rather a dark day, the candle might have been lighted since three o'clock, but as far as I can say, it was from three to six.</p>
               <p>Look at the watch, will you swear that was the watch? - Yes, this is the watch.</p>
               <p>When it was brought to you, was it in the condition it is now? - It was, excepting the glass, which is broke by accident, waiting here on Monday last.</p>
               <p>There is a hair string to it? - Yes, there is a common metal watch key upon the string.</p>
               <p>Is it one of those keys that hang down loose, or is it a strait stiff key? - It is a stiff key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where is your shop? - The corner of Wine-office-court, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Have you no windows but the windows in Fleet-street? - No.</p>
               <p>That is not a large window? - Not very large.</p>
               <p>And pretty full of goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you ascertain the time this happened? - From three to six.</p>
               <p>That is taking a large scope? - It was between dinner time and that time, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Is your shop divided into little boxes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The purpose of which is, that persons who are distressed may not be exposed, but may come into rather a darker place than ordinary; in the box it is dark, so that a person standing in the box is not very conspicuous; my observation is that the object who is in the dark, is not so visible to persons in the shop, as the person in the shop is to them in the boxes? - He was well dressed, I had not the least suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before this? - I do not know that ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>The person that did bring it took a duplicate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now is not it the constant course of the trade, for persons pledging things to take duplicates? - No, it is the common rule, he was asked if he would have a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Why they commonly ask them, whether they chuse to have a duplicate? - Some people do not wish to have the care of a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Those who decline having a duplicate, come under very suspicious circumstances, for they do not chuse to have a duplicate found upon them? - I do not see that, because a person might take a duplicate, and tear it at the door going out, some that know the shop never do take duplicates, but strangers usually do.</p>
               <p>Was you one of th e persons that went to the prisoner's lodgings? - I was not.</p>

               <p>Will you swear it was after dinner? - I will swear that.</p>
               <p>What time do you usually dine? - About three; the prisoner asked me a guinea and an half upon his watch.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the person of the prisoner before? - I cannot say, I may have seen him.</p>
               <p>Then he was a stranger to you at that time? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Upon what did you lend him a guinea and an half? - Upon that watch with the gold hair string; he told me the string was gold; I carried the watch to my partner

            , and asked him if that would do for a guinea and an half, I told him the string was gold mounted; my partner took the watch, and examined it, and took it opposite to the box where the prisoner was, and he asked him if the string was gold mounted; and he told him yes; and my partner bid me give him a guinea and an half; which I did, and he bid me give him a duplicate; I gave him one, and I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230186"></xptr> him where he lived; he told me No. 20; Jewin-street.</p>
               <p>What part of the town is that in? - I really do not know, I gave him the duplicate, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Court. How many boxes may there be in your shop? - Three.</p>
               <p>Can a person at any part of the shop, see into all the three boxes at one time? - No, not without they go nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>How many candles had you in the shop? - I do not know, I believe there was but one, night was not come on, candles had not been lighted.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me from your recollection, whether that candle was near the box where the man stood, or the other part of the shop? - It was near the box.</p>
               <p>Was it opposite the box? - It was not exactly opposite, it was opposite the next box to it.</p>
               <p>How long might the man be in the shop altogether? - Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you any suspicion of that man? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Then you made I suppose the common observations upon him, just as usual? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now will you venture to swear from the sight you had of him, that the prisoner at the bar was the man? - I have sworn it, he was the man.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there a counter between you and him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How broad? - About a yard broad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And what is the depth of the stall, from the edge of the counter to the door where they come in? - About the same width, or a little more, it is sufficient just to take one person, it has a slide to come over one of the counters, but that is drawn up when we please.</p>
               <p>Was that slide drawn up? - But very little.</p>
               <p>Look at the watch? - This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Court. How was the man dressed? - In a lightish coloured coat and a red waistcoat, with a round hat.</p>
               <p>Was his hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Walker, now raise your voice, and attend to me, is yours a shop of considerable business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Watches are as common pledges as anything? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many watches do you think you might have taken in pledge, in the course of the ten days preceding the day you have been speaking of? - I cannot tell how many, sometimes one or two in a day, sometimes seven or eight.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the name of the man, that pledged a watch at six the day before? - I do not recollect that I took in one.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the one the day after? - It is impossible.</p>
               <p>If you took in one, do you recollect the person of that man? - It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the name of the person that brought in the last pledge before this watch? - I cannot recollect any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>But you know upon this, there is something depends, for a highway robbery there is a reward? - I did not know that at the time.</p>
               <p>No! Mr. Walker? - As to that, I did not go to swear for that.</p>
               <p>Oh! God forbid that I should suspect you of that! you had no suspicion of the man that brought you this? - No, but we look at every person that pledges any thing for a high sum.</p>
               <p>Yes, and you look at them so well, that you forget every one but this man, and this is a high sum? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>You had one candle, you had not lighted up the decoys at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>The slide was pulled over upon the counter? - Yes, but I went opposite to him.</p>
               <p>Had the man a round hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That did not assist you to recollect him much? - No.</p>
               <p>Cannot you swear that he had a bald head? - No.</p>
               <p>(N. B. The Prisoner had a bald head.)</p>
               <p>I thought you might have seen that through his hat; cannot you recollect now<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230187"></xptr> what time a little more particularly? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>I believe you was the young gentleman that went to the prisoner's lodgings? - Yes, Sir, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of Mr. Arrhenius's seals there? - I was not searching, I staid in the passage.</p>
               <p>Did not you go in before the search warrant was executed, and hold some conversation with the prisoner? - Jealous went in.</p>
               <p>How long were you and Jealous consulting in the passage? - We were not consulting.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, that after Jealous and you had been into this room, that you did not go out together before you came in, and ask for the keys of the box. Do you mean to swear that you immediately knew this man, and that you told Jealous so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you want to change his clothes? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that in your presence he was not ordered to put on his other clothes? - He was not, nor I did not see him change his clothes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Jealous that that man was not in the clothes, that the man was in that pawned the watch? - He was in the same dress when I went in, he had a light coloured coat, and a red waistcoat on; that I did not tell Jealous that was not the man nor the dress.</p>
               <p>For what purpose was he to change his clothes? - I did not know he did change his clothes.</p>
               <p>Did Jealous carry you to the prisoner's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who directed you to the house? - Jealous, by the description that me and my partner gave at Bow-street, he said he had suspicion who the person was, and I should go with him.</p>
               <p>The first person that you saw you plumped upon? - There was nobody in the room but himself.</p>
               <p>That will not do, did he shew you any body else, before he shewed you the prisoner? - He did not.</p>
               <p>And the moment he shewed him to you, you plumped upon him? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Where is his house? - No. 4, in New-street, Gough Square.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you take in a pledge you register it? - Certainly, the name and place of abode.</p>
               <p>Court. About what time did you see him there at his house? - About ten in the morning, the Thursday after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who first discovered this watch at your shop? - My partner and I looked over the hand bill that came in on the Wednesday, and in particular we observed this watch.</p>
               <p>Have not you a hue and cry every Monday? - Yes, but it did not come on the Monday, it came on the Wednesday, we have a paper from Bow-street every week.</p>
               <p>That paper ought to come on Monday? - Yes, but it did not come till Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Jury. Does it usually come regularly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear that that paper did not come in till the Wednesday? - I will.</p>
               <p>Do you ever recollect this paper, which is stated to come out of a Monday, coming out of a Tuesday or Wednesday? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you sure it was Thursday, and not Friday, that this man was apprehended? - It was Thursday, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>You know it would have been very gross conduct in you, to have taken in a watch that was in the hue and cry paper? - Certainly it would.</p>
               <p>But of course, if the paper came in on the Wednesday, you took it in very harmlessly on the Monday? - We were both reading it on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Jury to Littler. What time did the paper come in, do you recollect? - It came in on the Wednesday.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230188"></xptr>What time in the morning? - At twelve within a few minutes as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Whose duty is it to deliver it? - One of the officers of Bow-street, his name is Maynard.</p>
               <p>Did you read it together? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did you do in consequence of that reading? - I went to Bow-street, and described a tall thin man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would only observe one or two things; the witness declares I was taken on the Thursday, I was taken on the Friday; he solemnly declares my coat was not changed, the coat I had on was a pea green coat; the officer searched my drawers particularly over, I asked him several times with what view he searched, he said you will know presently; he then said have you any other place where you put your property, I said I have a chest up stairs, he went up there and looked about, he then immediately came into the parlour with me, and said take off that coat you have on, and put on this drab coloured coat, which I did.</p>

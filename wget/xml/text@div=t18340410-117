               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Had you any address of yours on the outside of this portmanteau? A. I believe only my name.</p>

            , a pawnbroker, in Oxford-street. On the 10th of February, the prisoner Hampton came to our shop - he brought a coat, three pair of trowsers, and three waistcoats to pawn - he asked 1l. 12s. on them (we should have advanced 4l. or 5l. on them) - I inquired who they belonged to - he said part of them were made for him at Windsor, when he was better off, and the others he bought of a gentleman's servant in Buckinghamshire - I then observed Dancey by the side of a waggon, on the opposite side of the way: and Hampton said that the man over the way knew all about it - I told him to call him, and he did - I then asked him about them - he said, "We have found them" - Hampton then said, "I have told the gentleman that part of them were made for me" - I told them I would look over our bills, and see if we had an account of any thing lost, and not finding any, I sent for the officer.</p>

             (police-constable D 74). I was sent for to the shop, and took the prisoner - I received these articles - Hampton said the great coat, one pair of trowsers, and one waistcoat, were made for him when he was better off - when we got to the station I asked him which pair of trowsers were made for him - he said he did not know - he said he bought the rest of them of a gentleman's butler in Buckinghamshire - in going to the office Dancey said to Hampton, "You have got me into this trouble by telling these lies" - I had heard something, and I asked Dancey for the direction where the portmanteau was, and I received from them a direction on a paper - the prisoners were both together at the time, and I do not think any one else was with them - the direction on the paper was, "

            , Tom and Jerry shop, Gerrard's Cross" - I went there and found this portmanteau - the lock is broken open- I found in it a dirk, five waistcoats, and a number of other things - there were a number of letters in it, which have been returned to the prosecutor - some of them were directed to Mr. Burton's mother at Hastings, and some to his attorney - I went to Gerrard's Cross again, and found in a flat basket three coats, five pair of trowsers, and three pairs of drawers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You asked Dancey for his place of residence, and some person gave you a paper with writing on it? A. Yes; Dancey is a waggoner and an illiterate man, I believe; the writing was very bad - I believe there were no letters in the portmanteau addressed to the prosecutor himself.</p>

I keep a beer-shop at Gerrard's Cross - Dancey lodged with me about half a year - he was there before the 10th of November - he drove a waggon from Circencester to London - this portmanteau was found in his room, but I did not see him bring it there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100061"></xptr>nor hear him say any thing about it - when the officer came, I took it from under Dancey's bed, and gave it to him - in an hour's time another waggoner who was going down brought in this basket, and said he did not know what to do with it - I said, "Leave it here, I will take charge of it."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

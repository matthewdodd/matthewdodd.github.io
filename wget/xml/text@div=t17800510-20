               <p>I am wife to the last witness. On the 12th of April I lost a cloth cardinal and a gown. I went to the dispensary in Houndsditch, about ten o'clock; I left no one at home; I locked the door. I live in the lower part of the house, there are no other lodgers in the house but ourselves; the landlady lives in the one pair of stairs; some people work in her shop; she keeps a weaver's shop. I came back between eleven and twelve and found my door broke open; the lock was broke in two. I missed my gown and cloak out of the chest; my husband's clothes and the child's were in the chest, but I missed nothing else. I went and fetched my husband. I had no suspicion of any body. Eight or nine days after the landlady of the prisoner came to me and asked me if I had no suspicion of her; that she had money, and wanted to leave the lodging; she had lived servant at a publick-house just by, but was out of place.</p>
               <p>Where did she lodge? - Two doors from me. I spoke to her on the Sunday. She said, she would come to me, but did not. About a fortnight after she left her lodging. I went to Bishopsgate work-house; I saw her in the work-house yard. She said, she supposed I only wanted my things; she confessed she had taken them and pawned them for eighteen shillings, at Mr. Davison's in Bishopsgate-street. I went there and saw the gown hang up in the shop. I was surprised at that, as it was pawned; he then told me he had bought it out right; and he told me he had the cloak.</p>
               <p>What did you say to her to induce her to confess? - She said, she hoped I would not hurt her if I got my things. I said, I should be glad to get my things, and would be as tender as I could.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>EDWARD CLARKE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Davison, a pawnbroker, I know nothing of the prisoner; the things were brought to our shop by a Mrs. Busy, who is here as a witness; they were first pawned and afterwards sold out; she told me a long story that they belonged to a young woman, whose husband was pressed.</p>

             came to me and brought this gown and cloak in her lap. I cannot recollect the day of the month, nor the day of the week; she desired me to pawn them for her; that the young man was on board the tender. I have known her, on and off, some years; I never heard any harm of her; it was about the middle of April, to the best of my remembrance; I thought she came honestly by them; she said, the man was pressed where she was; and that his wife was in great distress, and asked me to pawn them for her. I asked her what the woman's demand was? She said sixteen shillings. I brought her sixteen shillings and a duplicate. She came to me again and said, the poor woman was in distress and must sell them out right; she had the duplicate and went with me and got two shillings more for them, and sold them out right.</p>
               <p>To Clarke. Did a woman come with her the second time? - Yes; I believe, it was the prisoner, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>What might they be worth? - Not more than I gave for them to purchase; they might sell for twenty-two or twenty-three shillings.</p>

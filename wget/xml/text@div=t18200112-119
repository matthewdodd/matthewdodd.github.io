In consequence of what I observed, I called him into the parlour, charged him with the robbery, and took him to Worship-street. He said the goods were at Sinclair's - I had missed a calf butt that day. The week before we missed two calf skins, and fourteen calf butts, which are inferior parts of leather. I had also missed calf legs and shoulders.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 21st of December, about four o'clock, I went down stairs to fetch candles, brought them up, and put them on the table to work. I missed an apron, went into the waxing room, and saw Hepworth standing up about a foot from the table - there was nothing on the table then; about an hour before there were six calf butts laying before him - he had a large bulk under his apron. I asked him if my apron was there? He said No, and as I drew nearer, he kept shuffling round to keep his front from me. I returned to my work, was not satisfied, went back to the waxing room again, and saw his apron turned aside - his waistcoat was unbuttoned, and he was buttoning up his breeches - he went out. I recollected the calf butts that I had put there to see if any one would take them, and immediately communicated it to my master - Hepworth was apprehended next morning.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of December, in consequence of information, I went to Sinclair's to search for stolen leather - he is a shoemaker, and lives in Whitecross-street. I said I had a warrant to search his house, and he asked me what for? I said for stolen leather, and asked him if he had bought any the day before of a man? - he said he had. I asked him to produce it? He was cutting up some, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the skin I bought last night about six o'clock;" he said he had a knowledge of the man although he did not know his name, but that he should know it if he heard it. I mentioned no name, for I did not know it. He said the man lived in Leonard-square or Paul-street, about two years ago. Mr. Roberts, Jun. was with me, and claimed the leather. I asked him what he gave for the skin? - he said 14 s. Mr. Roberts looked for some private marks which he said were on it, but he could not find them. Sinclair said he believed there was a mark on it, but he had cut it off for a binding, and had sent it out. He sent out to a journeyman to send him back some work that he had sent out that morning; some was brought, but the mark was not found on it. On searching farther there was part of another skin which Roberts claimed. He took us into the parlour to shew us what skins he had there, and shewed us a number which Roberts could not speak to. He then took some boot legs from the top of a press, which Roberts claimed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He shewed you every thing - A. He did. Perhaps we should not have found them if he had not produced them. He said he bought the boot legs of the same man at 5 s. or 5 s. 6 d. a pair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. He answered every question without the least hesitation - A. He did, and produced the leather.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. My Lord, after this evidence, I will not for one moment longer hold this case over Sinclair's head.</p>

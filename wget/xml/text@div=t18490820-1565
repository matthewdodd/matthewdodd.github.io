                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On 11th July, about ten o'clock at night, I was in the Green-park, near Piccadilly, and saw a man among the sheep, ten or twelve yards from me—his back was towards me—I went near to him, and saw him jump at a lamb and struggle with it—he appeared working his arms about—I went towards him—he got up and went away—I saw him take off his hat and wipe his hands—I afterwards saw the lamb he had been struggling with, lying down bleeding from the throat—I do not believe it was alive—I followed him to the corner of the Park, near Burton-street, where he got over the gate—I climbed over also, and followed him into Bond-street, where I saw a policeman, and gave him into custody—I had not lost sight of him.</p>

About half-past ten o'clock Jennings came and pointed out the prisoner—I took him, and asked him why he killed the lamb—he denied knowing any<lb></lb>thing about it—I asked him if he had a knife—he said he had not—I took him to the station, and went with Jennings to the Park—he pointed out the place where the lamb was—the head was very near cut off—it was quite dead—I searched the prisoner, and found this knife in his hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there it blood upon it.</p>

On the evening of 11th July I was in the Park—there were then five lambs and twenty sheep safe—they were under my charge—the next morning I went to the station and found the carcass of a lamb with the throat cut—it was one of those that were safe the night before, and belonged to John Mason, of Chelsea.</p>

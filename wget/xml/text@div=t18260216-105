On the 28th of January he said he left six loaves and a quartern of flour there (the amount of which was 5s. 11d.) which was not paid for - Mr. Harris being a ready money customer I asked him particularly about it, and he said they had not paid. On Tuesday following he went to Mr. Harris's again, and when he returned he said they had paid for the bread and flour left that day, and said he had forgotten to mention the previous account. I went to Mr. Harris's, and found that they had paid at the time of delivery - I then got a warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you never in arrears with him respecting wages? A. Never, and never gave him permission to stop any money on account of wages due.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Harris. I remember taking six loaves of flour and a quartern of flour, on the 28th of January, of the prisoner; I paid him two half-crowns and a shilling, and he gave me a penny out - I am sure there was one shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure it was two half-crowns and a shilling? A. Yes; I remember perfectly well - I am almost positive that I am correct.</p>
               <p>Q. COURT. Why do you say you paid two half-crowns and a shilling? A. I am almost certain I did - I have no doubt of it.</p>

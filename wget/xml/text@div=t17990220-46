I went to Mr. Leary's, and there were one hundred and thirty-five waistcoats produced to me, they are now in the possession of the City-Marshal; there were ten others which we are not certain of.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any doubt about those hundred and twenty-five being your's? - A.None in the world, they had all of them our marks; we then got a warrant, and took up the prisoner and another woman, of the name of Evans, who is the prisoner's sister, from the description I had from Mr. Leary's young man, (produces three waistcoats found at Jones's); they have our marks upon them.</p>

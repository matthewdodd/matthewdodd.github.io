                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of No. 8, Little Distaff Lane—these nine rolls of crape are the property of Messrs. Kay and Rich<lb></lb>ardson, of Manchester, for whom I am agent—they were in my possession on Friday morning, the 21st September—I can recognise them by prirate marks—the prisoners had no authority from me to have the goods—I never saw them before—I missed ten rolls, but there are only nine here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller, at 13, Milk Street—on Saturday, the 22nd of September, about aquarter past ten, as I was crossing Westbourne Grove to Paddington Green, I saw the prisoners with these nine rolls of crape in their possession, and, knowing that to be a very large stock for any one in that neighbourhood, it attracted my attention—one was carrying five pieces, and the other four—I followed them, they went into a wardrobe</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 203 D). On Saturday morning, the 23rd September, I met the last witness, and we followed the prisoners—I asked them how they could account for the possession of this crape, William Moore said he had receded it from a Mr. Williams, in Praed Street, and he was going to take it to 73, Cannon Street, City—I asked him if he worked for Mr. Williams, he said he did not, but that he was passing through Praed Street, and Mr. Williams had asked him to take it to 73, Cannon Street—I told them I was not satisfied with that account, and I took them into custody.</p>

It is just the reverse to what the constable has stated, for, instead of my saying I had it from Praed Street, I told him I was going to take it to Mr. Williams, of Praed Street I had been to see Mr. Morgan, a man who executes commissions on horses, in Farringdon Street I met him in Cannon Street, and he asked me take the parcels to Mr. Williams. I met my brother at the corner of Tottenham Court Road, where he gets his living by selling newspapers, and he went with me; he knows nothing of it, and I had no knowledge whatever of its having been stolen.<hi rend="smallCaps">

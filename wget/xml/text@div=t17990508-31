            : On Friday night, the 5th of April, about ten minutes after nine, I locked my shop up; the next morning about nine o'clock, I came to the shop and found it was broke open; I missed four legs of mutton, two shoulders, one neck, a saw, and a saucepan; in consequence of some information that I received I went to Bow-street, on the 6th of April, and two officers went and searched a house, the Marquis of Granby, in the Almonry-yard, about half past nine o'clock; we found two legs and a shoulder of mutton, and a saw, they were produced by the landlady; and then we took them to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the Marquis of Granby at all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with stealing the mutton and the saw? - A. He asked the landlady for the saw that he gave her in the morning; I took the saw in my hand, and looked at it, I swore that was my saw have the mutton who would; then the officer asked the landlady whether there was any thing else that that man had left there; and she said, no; then the officer looked round in two or three rooms, and, in the inner room, he saw two legs of mutton and a shoulder, covered over with two or three cloths.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You do not believe that the prisoner stole this saw? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- BARTON sworn. - I am a carpenter and joiner, in the Almonry Coach-yard, Broad-way, Westminster: The prisoner brought a saw to sell, which I knew was this person's saw, and I told him it did not suit me; I knew the saw, Erscott bought it of a carpenter to saw his meat with, I had seen it about a week before; after that, he offered me a leg or a shoulder of mutton at my own price; I told him I had killed a hog, and it would not suit me to buy any; I told him of a person coming to work with me that might buy the saw, perhaps, if he liked it; he went away with the saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let him go? - A. Because I knew where to find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know the prosecutor before? - A. I do not know that he knew me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not chuse to buy the saw for a shilling? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to ask the price of it? - A. That I might be sure it was the same saw, till I could go to let the butcher know.</p>
               <p>Q. As you can swear to the saw so easily, I take it mutton is just as easy to swear to? - A. I cannot swear to mutton. On the 5th of April, I saw him filing a key against a post, opening the wards; I went to him, and told him I was sure he was at no good.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on Friday was it? - A. In the afternoon, about one o'clock; says I, you are going to break open some place, St. Paul's, or something or other; I supposed so by his making that key, it was a master-key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did not you prefer a bill of indictment, and afterwards go back to the clerk of the indictment and prefer another for a capital offence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know there is a forty pound reward for a burglary? - A. I do not understand the law.</p>
               <p>Q. But the fact we want; do not you know there is a forty pound reward? - A. I never heard any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear there was forty pounds reward upon conviction of a person for breaking into a house by night? - A. Yes, when they are found guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do understand, that if a man was found guilty, and you were to be a witness, you would be entitled to a share of forty pounds? - A. No, I did not want it; I would not have it if it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say, that if the forty pounds reward was to be divided among the witnesses, your virtue would not suffer you to take it? - A. I do not understand these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go before the clerk of the indictments, with the prosecutor, to give instructions for the indictment? - A. Yes; I told what I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. And you then went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went back again? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state, just now, that you had been twice to the clerk of the indictments? - A. No, I did not go but once.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you went a second time, to indict the man capitally? - A. We went up the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in a Court of Justice before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor before a Magistrate? - A. Yes; I went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. No where else? - A. Yes; I was once had to Queen-square for what I know nothing about; we had no bread to eat, and my wife went and pawned a sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were charged with stealing it? - A. No; we paid for the fetching it back again.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were it you or Erscott that recommended that he should be charged with a capital charge? - A. It was both, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. He was first charged with stealing the mutton? - A. He was charged with taking the meat and the saw.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was afterwards charged with breaking the house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go back a second time to prefer the indictment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell the officer? - A. I told him that I had had my shop broke open such a night? - A. Did you give any instructions about a charge to affect the prisoner's life? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave it with the officer? - A. I did.</p>

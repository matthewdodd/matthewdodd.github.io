             sworn. I was a constable of the night, I produce seven farthings, eight penny-pieces, and eight shillings, and seven-pence halfpenny in halfpence, they were taken from the prisoner Taylor's pocket, I saw them taken by the watchmen; here is the pig's jaw, it was taken from Taylor's leather apron.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Look at that pig's jaw, is there any thing that you know it from any other pig's jaw. - A. I went to the salesman at Covent Garden, and bought thirteen pig's jaws; I took notice of one of the tongues having a piece cut off, I told the constable before the leather apron was opened, that there was one of that description, the top of the tongue cut off, that was the only one that was so, and I told him that there was some of the hair on it before it was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. That is so. - A. Yes, here is two old halfpence, one is hammered something hollow, the other is marked with a chisel; a poor woman came into me for a halfpenny worth of bread, she gave me one of them, I refused it, she then gave me the other, and said, keep them both, and when I come round again. I will give you a good halfpenny; the woman never came near me; at the time I was counting the money to send them to the tallow-chandler, I threw them off the shelf, and counted them in; these are the same two halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say they were among your halfpence when your house was robbed. - A. Yes, they remained in a large drawer under the counter in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long before had you counted them. - A. From eight to nine o'clock that very evening; between the hours of eight and nine o'clock I counted them over.</p>

            , in a stable, the door had been broken down, and the stable had been open for several weeks, in the stable under the dung I pulled out two cheeses. Jones and Leary took up the tea, the cheeses are here (producing them).</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Are these cheeses yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the cheese and tea were either in your shop window or so near the shop window, that any body having broke the window, could get them out without getting into the shop. - A. By no means, that cheese is marked I for James and P for Purcell.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. As I was going home on Wednesday evening, I stopped to make water, and I kicked this pig's-head before me; I picked this pig's-head up, I opened the parcel, and in it there was some halfpence; I went to make the best of my way home, this watchman stopped me.</p>
               <p>Britten left his defence to his counsel; called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Taylor called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

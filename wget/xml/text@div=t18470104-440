I was on duty at half-past six o'clock in the morning on the 24th of Dec., and saw Clarke come out of his master's house, the Bull public-house—he had this hamper with him—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him to his own house, in York-street, Old Kent-road—I knew where be lived, and he went to that place—I watched him—he returned to his mas<lb></lb>ter's, and I went directly to his house—I found the hamper there, and brought it with me to Mr. Palmer's—I went into the shop, and found Challenger and Clarke there—I asked challenger who the hamper belonged to—he said it belonged to him, and it was all right—I said I should call Mr. Palmer, to to see whether it was all right, and asked the way in which I could see him—Challenger said I could go outside to the private door, and ring the bell—I left Clarke and Challenger in the bar, and I went out and rang the bell—I got no answer—I went into the bar again, and wished to be shown the way through the house up to Mr. Palmer's bedroom—Challenger said I could not go through the bar—I said, "I must, and go I shall"—I worked my way up to the bedroom—I rapped at the door, and alarmed Mr. Palmer—I came down first—Mr. Palmer came down some minutes after—I then opened the hamper in the presence of the prisoners and Mr. Palmer—I found in it the wine, brandy, gin, and rum, and a goose—I found a letter on Challenger," which I sent to his father, to whom it was directed—the direction that was on the hamper is here—it is "Mr. Samuel Challenger, Prospect-buildings, Tiverton, near Bath, Somersetshire"—when I told Challenger I must see his master he said it was quite immaterial whether I saw his master or not, because it was all right—I said in what manner was it all right—he said, "I care nothing about it; the worst of it is I lose my situation through it."</p>

I said, "Mine;" he said, "I shall shew it to Mr. Palmer;" I said, "You can do as you like, there is the money on the shelf;" I should have had it entered the same morning, as soon as the barman came down to do it; as to my saying I was afraid I should get discharged, it is false; nothing of the kind occurred; I said I had paid for it; there was the money on the shelf.</p>

            . I keep the Red Cow in Whitechapel. I seeing the advertisement, took the Advertiser in my hand; having a mare in my stable, I went there, and found she exactly answered the descriptions. I sent the prosecutor a letter the same day, being the 10th of November; but I cannot say who brought her. Then I ordered my servant Leycock not to let her go out of the stable. He told me he had bought her. Then I ordered him to look for the man he had bought the mare of, and on the Sunday, about three or four o'clock, he sent me word he had found him, and that he was in custody of the constable in Spital Fields. I went there, and saw him; it was the prisoner at the bar, who fell a crying.</p>

My wife and I have trusted him with every thing in our house when we have gone out, and never missed a farthing; he always came in at good time on evenings.</p>

            . I am foreman of the wharf. -Whitefoot told me of this, and I overtook the prisoner at the end of Lower Thames-street, carrying the cask of butter; he said he was going to Gravel-lane, and a man employed him, but he could not tell who it was - I asked him to bring it back; he turned back about fourteen yards, and then said he would not carry it back; I got a lad to take it - it was to be shipped for Sheerness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This witness' evidence differs from what he said before the Magistrate. I was employed by a man in the public-street; as I was walking between St. Katharine's Dock-bridge and Irongate, he asked if I wanted a job; I said Yes; he said, "I want this tub of butter carried to Gravel-lane".</p>

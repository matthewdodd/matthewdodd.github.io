                  </hi>. I am a waiter out of employ—my last place was at the Crown and Anchor booth, at Greenwich fair. On the 7th of April I lost two half-sovereigns, two half-crowns, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a comb, and a handkerchief—I left work at four o'clock in the morning, and went to a house to get some refreshment—I had occasion to go to the privy, and through the fatigue of the last three or four days, I fell asleep—when I awoke, the prisoner Ramsden was standing before me, and he appeared agitated—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I asked him if he knew any thing about it—he said he saw it last on a sofa in the parlour of the house where I had taken my refreshment—I went to the sofa—my handkerchief was not there—I then missed my money—I asked the landlord who had been there—he said, no one but the prisoner—I went out, and got a policeman, but the prisoner had left the house, and gone half through the fair—he was there taken, and brought back to the house—I had bitten one of my half-sovereigns the night before, so as to know it again by two slight marks, upon it—when Ramsden was brought back to the house to be searched, he threw or passed one half-sovereign to the prisoner Calder—I did not see the money, but I saw something pass from Ramsden to Calder, as he was standing by him before the fire—Calder was afterwards searched, and the half-sovereign found on him—when the policeman saw something pass, he went to Calder, and asked what had passed—he said, "Nothing"—he said he must take him into a private room to search him, and he then handed over the half-sovereign—I found no more of my money—it was about four o'clock in the morning when I went to the house—I had been perhaps two hours in the house before I went to the other place—it was about eight o'clock in the morning when I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ramsden</hi>. When I went to the house, he was sitting with two young women—he got up, and asked me to drink—he went out with one young woman, and was away some time—I sat with the rest of the young men—I went to the water-closet, and found him asleep—I awoke him, and made him come out—the half-sovereign which I handed to Calder I had received in part of my wages. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I was sitting with one young woman—I did not ask him to drink—I might have drank out of his pot—he did not shake me to awake me—he was standing before me agitated when I awoke—previous to this he had no money, for he borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of one of his fellow-workmen—he said he was gone to the booth while I went for the police<lb></lb>man, and he would come and pay for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Calder</hi>. There was nothing said about a private room, the policeman taxed me with it, and I said I did not know—I unbuttoned my waistcoat, and the half-sovereign fell out—it had been put in my bosom—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 126.) The prisoner Ramsden was given into my custody—I saw him coming out of a house in the street where the fair is held—we went back to the house, and I saw him pass something to Calder—I asked him what he had received from Ramsden—he said, "Nothing"—I took him across the room, and he held out this half-sovereign to me, which the prosecutor claimed—I am able to say that Calder had it in his hand, as he had no opportunity of putting his hand into his pocket till he produced it—the moment Ramsden went into the house, he went up to Calder, who stood near the fire, and some words passed be<lb></lb>tween them, but I could not hear what.</p>

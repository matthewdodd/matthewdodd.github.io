               <p>Q. Is the house surrounded by a wall - A. Three sides of it has a wall, and at the front a high paling. The washhouse is built up against the wall, and is a little distance from the house; the door of the wash-house opens into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How late in the evening of the 10th of January did you go into the washhouse - A. Between eight and nine, I saw the copper there, it was affixed; when I came out I shut the door and latched it; on the next morning, between seven and eight, I went into the washhouse again, I found the bricks all down and the copper was gone; it was then day light.</p>

            . I am a constable of Brentford. I went to the Fox and Hounds, I saw the prisoner there, I took him out of the tap-room to where the copper was; I asked him whose property that was, he said, mine, he had bought it of a stranger on the road, he gave twenty five shillings for it; I took him in custody. I have had the copper ever since.</p>

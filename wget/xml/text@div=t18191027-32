On the 27th of September, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop in company with another person, to change a pair of ladies' shoes which that person had bought; while I was changing them I missed a pair of ladies' shoes. The other person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270017"></xptr>was a customer. I put a pair in paper for the person. After that the person bought a pair of boots for 6 s., which I also put in paper - they were both together. I then said I missed a pair of shoes, and must send for an officer, as they went out of the shop the officer stopped them both, and found the shoes on King. They were not wrapped in paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner asked for any shoes - A. No, my Lord, he only came in with the other person; they were found in his inside pocket. He said he did not know how they came there.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I was sent for, and took charge of the men. I searched them both. I found nothing on the other but what he had bought, which was wrapped in paper. I found the shoes in the prisoner's inside coat-pocket, not in paper. I asked him how he came by them? He said he did not know.</p>

               <p>"Have the goodness to put this in your pocket, for mine is full." I did so, and thought he had paid for them.</p>

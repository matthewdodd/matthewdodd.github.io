            . I keep a broker's shop in Upper court, Union street, Hatton Wall. On the 6th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner brought the tub to me; she asked me half a crown for it; I told her my husband was not at home, if she would call in an hour's time I would pay her for it; in the mean time I put the tub in the window for sale; a woman asked me the price of it; I asked her four shillings for it; she said I had just bought it, it was just stolen; I told her I had not paid for it, I did mean to buy it; they brought Mr. Ladkoe and the nurse that belonged to the tub; Mr. Ladkoe was the landlord of the house; the nurse took the tub away, and Mr. Ladkoe; they told me when the woman came for the money to bring her up to him; the woman came for the money in about half an hour, I told her that she had stolen the tub, and that the owner had got it, and she must go along with me to the people that owned the tub; the prisoner went with me; I took her to Mr. Ladkoe's.</p>

            . I am nurse to Mr. Hutson; when I came down stairs I missed the tub from the bench in the washhouse, it was between nine and ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the washhouse - backwards or forwards - A. Forwards, right facing the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. So that any body going by might see the washing tub - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed it between nine and ten - when had you seen it before - A. About half after eight; I went down with Mr. Ladkoe to Mrs. Lomax and there I saw the tub and owned it; it was exposed to sale out of doors; I can swear to the tub being Mr. Hutson's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I go out charing; I was going across Clerkenwell Green to clean an empty house down, a genteel woman in the street, asked me to go and sell this tub: she would give me sixpence if I would go to that shop, and she stopped on the opposite side of the way; I went, and when I returned to her, I told her the broker's husband was not at home; she asked me to go into the public house and have part of a pint of beer; I did, and went out again for some bread and cheese; when I came back she was gone; I asked the servant, where the woman was; I could not learn; I came out again and went down to the broker's to see whether the broker's husband was come back or not; the woman told me the tub was stolen; I told her I was innocent of stealing the tub; I know no more than what I have told you. My husband is on board a man of war; I made all the enquiry I could about that woman, I could not find her.</p>

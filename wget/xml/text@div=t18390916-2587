                  </persName>. I lived in New-street, Shadwell Market, when this happened. The prisoner is a coal-whipper—I knew the deceased Cathe<lb></lb>rine Kerley, his wife—my room was next to theirs, it was only separated by a lath and plaster partition—I could hear what passed in their room when I was in mine—they did not live on good terms exactly—they had a child, about six years old, living with them—on Monday night I came home from work about eleven o'clock—I was sober—I afterwards saw the prisoner's child crying at the street-door—I afterwards went into the pri<lb></lb>soner's room, and found the deceased in the room, lying on her right side on the floor, with her feet towards the door, and her child by the side of her—the prisoner was sitting on a chair by the window—I had heard her quarrelling with her husband before I went in—she made no complaint to me—I said to the prisoner, "What are you after?"—he said, "I came home this afternoon, and gave my wife some money to go to market, and get things for herself and when I came tome there was not a bit of sup<lb></lb>per for me"—he was not sober at the time—he did not say how she came on the ground, or what had happened to her—she said, "He has been Kicking up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with me, I have been to market, and could get nothing that would suit my money"—I said, "You had better be quiet"—I went</p>

               <p>away, and left them together—I went to bed afterwards—about one o'clock in the morning I was awoke, and heard the prisoner come into the house and go into his room—I heard him push back his door, and, not finding him wife in bed, he said, "D—, and set a light to your soul, ain't you gone to bed yet?"—she said, "Kerley, I feel very ill"—he went and sat in his chair, and I laid myself down, but could not rest—I sat up again, and heard a rush from the chair he was sitting in, to the bedside, and a fall—I did not hear any blow, but a few minutes after I heard the deceased say, "Kerley you have done it, you know you have, for that blow has finished me"—I had heard no blow—(<hi rend="italic">looking at her deposition</hi>)—this is my mark, which I made before the Coroner—what is written down there is what I then said—I thought I heard the sound of a blow, but I did not see it given—I heard a blow and a fall—I heard nothing done to her, but I heard Kerley pick her up, and lay her on the bed—I did not go into the room after this till three o'clock in the morning—I then thought she was dying—she said she was very thirsty, and very ill indeed, and very bad—her husband laid on the boards all night—he went out, I cannot exactly say for what—I was there when he came back, between six and seven o'clock in the morning—I do not know what he said—his wife said she was dying, and wanted a clergyman—when the prisoner came in in the morning she threw herself on one side, turned on her back, and, putting her hand on her stomach, she said, "Kerley, you know you have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> me there"—a doctor was sent for but did not come till she was dead—she died about ten o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I told the prisoner, when I went into the room, it was a great shame to see this poor woman knocked about in this way, and said, "Have you not got some money to get her some tea?"—he said he had no money but what he gave her last night, which was half-a-crown, and it was impossible she could lay all that out—she said she had laid all out but h., which she lent to a person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house, underneath the prisoner and his wife. On Monday night I was at home, when she came home about eleven o'clock—she had been home two or three times before, and went out again to look after him—he came in two or three times while she was out—the last time he came home was about a quarter before eleven o'clock—she came in about the same time—I was in my room—they passed my door to go up to their room—their little boy afterwards came down to my room crying, and I went up stairs—I found the deceased lying on the landing-place by the door of her own room, half sitting and half lying—the prisoner was in his own room—I lifted her up, and took her into the room—I said, "Kerley, ayn't you ashamed of yourself, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> be kicking up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at this hour of the night?"—I had heard a quarrel and scuffling, I said, "Why</p>

               <p>don't you let her alone?"—he said, "Well, Mrs. Bulgar, what can I do with her? she has not a bit of fire, nor any victuals for me, and she won't put the child to bed"—I said the child was big enough to go to bed of it-self—she was very much in liquor—when I took her up she made a rush at him to tear his face—I, and a woman in the room with me, both held her to prevent it, and he went out—he came in about. two hours after—I heard him going up stairs—I heard him ask what o'clock it was, and the watchman told him half an hour to four—I did not see him then—I did not see the deceased fell on the landing—she was lying there when I went up—when I brought her into the room she fell from the effects of liquor—she fell with great force in her passion and scuffle to get at him—she did not complain of having hurt herself—I saw nothing more till six o'clock in the morning—she was then in a dying state, and complained of thirst—I gave her some water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Shad well. I was called in to the deceased—she was dead before I saw her—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found no external marks of violence—on opening the abdomen, I found an effusion of blood and serum to the ex<lb></lb>tent of two quarts—I found a large coagulation of blood round the spleen, on removing which I found rupture, or laceration of the spleen, about two inches long—the effusion of blood had come from the spleen—that lacera<lb></lb>tion would be caused either by a blow or fall—I should say it most likely arose from blows—a blow with the fist in the abdomen might cause the laceration without leaving any mark of external violence, as the abdomen would give way, there being nothing to resist it—there was a small four-post bedstead in the room, and had she fallen on the edge of that it might have produced that effect—I do not think her own weight would do it—falling from the bedstead would not do it, but if she was standing up and fell against it it might—if she received the injury when on the bed I should say it must have been a blow—there was a violent bruise on the coat of the stomach—the stomach was distended with fluid, which would increase the injury—it was not full—it would give way—I cannot conceive how one blow could accomplish it—I think it must have been two blows—the injury on the stomach was extensive—it must have been the result of considerable violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever known rupture of the spleen pro<lb></lb>duced by any other cause than external violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not—I be<lb></lb>lieve there are very few cases of the kind on record—I never knew it rup<lb></lb>tured from overflow of blood—a person struggling violently, and falling against something, might account for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the injury to have taken place two or three hours before death, would the party be in a condition to move about or scuffle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not—she would feel pain from loss of blood—a person receiving such an injury would live some hours probably.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183909160122"></xptr>
               <p>been lacerated in that way would immediately become unable to do any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not immediately—it depends on how long after effusion of blood takes place—I do not think that violent pressure by the arms of person round the waist, and her struggling to get free, could produce it—it must have been caused by violence—I never heard or read of a case of the kind—I believe it would require external violence—I cannot concern that pressure could cause it—I will not swear it might not have hap<lb></lb>pened by her attempting to rush from the grasp of a person, but I do not believe it—I never met with a rupture of the spleen before—I have opened an immense number of bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not import the application of considerable violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is what we call a spongy organ—it acts as a reservoir for the blood—I do not conceive it would require considerable violence—she was a very lean subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the bruise inside the stomach any connexion with the rupture of the spleen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it would require two blows to do both.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment could an injury of the sort be inflicted about eleven or twelve o'clock, and the party from that time to three o'clock, show no symptoms of distress about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—she must have complained of it—the party would feel a giving way of the system—I attribute the death to the laceration of the spleen—I think it right to state, that the prisoner is one of the persons who came to me for assistance—I believe she was not dead when he left home—it was between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>

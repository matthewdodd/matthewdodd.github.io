On the 28th of August, or early on the 29th, this bay gelding was stolen out of a stable of mine, about four hundred yards from my house; I had seen it at work about eleven o'clock the morning before - it went about in a cart. About five o'clock in the morning my servant informed me it was gone; I sent my son to London, but heard nothing of it till the 10th of September, when I found it in Mr. Hollis' stables, at Windsor.</p>

            . I live at Windsor. About the 3d of September this gelding was brought into my father's yard, by Hearn; I bought it for my father, for 24 l. - he brought it overnight; my father saw it: he was going to Brighton, and told me to bargain for it next morning; I had dealt with Hearn's father-in-law before - I do not know what he is.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at Upton, near Slough. I sold this gelding to Hollis - I do not know the day of the month; I bought it on the 29th of August, about five o'clock in the evening, at Uxbridge, which is six miles from my house, of Stransom, a horse-dealer, for 16 l., at his own stables, and sold it three or four days after, for 24 l.</p>

            . I am a horse-dealer, and live at Uxbridge. I sold a gelding to Hearn, for 16 l.; I bought it of the prisoner, about seven o'clock in the morning of the 29th of August. I knew him before, and knew he was Webb's servant; Webb lives about sixteen miles from me - he came to me on Sunday, the 28th, and said his master and him were coming through Uxbridge, to take some horses to town, for sale, and that I should have the first offer of them; he came again about five o'clock on Monday morning, and called me up; I said I was not well, and could not get up yet. I got up at seven, and dealt with him for this gelding; he had no others. I gave him 12 l., and 5 s. for himself. I sold it the same evening to Hearn.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WEBB. I am certain the gelding found at Hollis' is mine. The prisoner was in my employ for a year and a half; he left on the 20th of August: he was a <rs id="t18251027-3-deflabel15" type="occupation">jobbing odd man</rs>

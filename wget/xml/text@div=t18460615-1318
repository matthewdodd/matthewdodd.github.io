                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Midgley, and lodge in the house of James Ayling, in Park-street, Poplar—it is his dwelling-house. On the 21st of May, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was called up by George Ayling, and saw the prisoner in the passage—I was not present when she was taken—the parlour-door was wide open—the beartb-rug was in the policeman's hands—I had left it rolled up behind the parlour door the night before—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is my husband's—there is no mark on it—I have had it between two and three months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turner, and live in the house—my father is the landlord—he lives in it himself, and lets it out to lodgers—it is in the parish of Poplar. On the morning of the 21st, about six o'clock, I saw my brother go out of the house—I shut the door after him, and left it locked, but a person could get in by pulling a string outside—I went into the kitchen to breakfast—when I had been down stairs five minutes, a neighbour tapped at the kitchen window—I came up, and found the door wide open—I went out, and saw the prisoner run across the road, with the rug under her arm—she was about twenty or thirty yards from the door—she dropped the rug—I: picked it up, and called, "Stop thief!"—she was stopped by a constable.</p>

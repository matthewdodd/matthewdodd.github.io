            . I am a watchman in Mary-le-bone parish.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 13th of May, between two and three o'clock, you went your round in Durweston-street; Mr. Sitwell's house is No. 12 - A. Yes; it was exactly twenty minutes after two when I heard the crush.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in Durweston-street, you heard a crush - A. Yes; I thought the carriage steps were let down suddenly. When I was coming nigh the door, I saw the tall man, White; I was about eight or nine yards off; I saw him come from Mr. Sitwell's door, he was just off the door, getting on the foot path; I told him to stop, I said, my friend, I see what you have been about. As soon as I spoke, he ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is Clay-street - A. Opposite of Mr. Sitwell's house; he went into Clay-street,</p>
               <p>Q. Dorset-street is at the end of Clay-street - A. Exactly; it runs parallel with Durweston-street; he turned out of Clay-street, into Dorset-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into Baker-street from Dorset-street-A. He did; from Baker-street into Blandford-street; he went down Kendall-mews, and turned into George-street. I saw him apprehended by another watchman, at the end of George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from you during this period - A. About thirty yards; till he got to Kendall-mews, there I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him at all, from the time he left Mr. Sitwell's door, to Kendall-mews - A. I lost sight of him when he turned the corner, when he got into Kendall-mews.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was running down Baker-street, before he arrived at Blandford-street, did any thing occur - A. The street was silent; I saw nobody in the street but him and me; when he turned out of Clay-street into Dorset-street, I heard something fall; it had a hollow sound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear any thing else - A. No, that was the only noise that caused my attention, till he was taken into custody at the end of George-street, when he was apprehended. I took him back again to Mr. Sitwell's house; I went up to the very same door and took him in.</p>
               <p>Q. On your road to the prosecutor's house, did you find any thing - A. Not at that time; in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I went back the same way that I ran after him. I found a knife in Baker-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the line that you followed him - A. Yes, as near as I could judge. That is the knife, there is White upon it; I picked up the dark lanthorn, I opened it in his presence; there was a wax candle in it, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was White - A. I am positive of it; he had a long body coat on, I took him for a coachman when he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. At the instant when you came up to him, did you recognize him, or had you any doubt - A. I told them it was the same man that came out of No. 12 or 13, I could not say which.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was it a light or a dark night - A. Dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the lace of the person, I take it for granted - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turnings might there be before you saw him apprehended by another person - A. Five turnings.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you did see him, he had been apprehended before you came up to him - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you called to by the watchman to see him after he had taken him - A. Yes; he told me he had taken him.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came up, you said he was the person - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing particular about him then, excepting he had on a loose long coat, like a coachman - what sort of a coach was it - A. It was a long body coat.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see the colour of his coat - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have produced a knife - did you take any notice of the name on it - A. I did not look to see if there was any name.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the officer this knife in his possession - A. From the Tuesday till the Monday. I am positive it is the knife.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there the same appearance of writing upon it when you found it, as there was when Foy produced it - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say it was a dark night - A. Quite dark at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw him before you came up to the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance - A. About ten or twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the night so dark that you could but just see him - A. It was just break of day, but it was so dark I could not see the colour of his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could you see it was the same man - was it from the observation of his person or his face - A. His face I could not see, nor the colour of his coat I could not see.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of his running, could you distinguish him while he was running by the length of his coat - A. Nothing else.</p>

Yes, I did; I heard the rattle much about a quarter past two in the morning, and the word going about stop thief; on hearing the rattle, I came out of East-street, Manchester-square. I went into Kendall-mews, the man got into Kendall-mews, out of Blandford-street. I followed him through the mews, and when he got out of the mews, he turned into George-street, he turned to the left; I lost sight of him for the length of time he might have got across the street; I perceived him that instant I got out of the mews; another watchman who stood in the middle of the street, cried out, I have got him; I came and assisted him; his name is Jeffreys. I went along with them from there to No. 12, the house that was broken open.</p>

Yes; I was going up Baker-street, a little after two o'clock, I do not know to a quarter of an hour; the first thing that I took up were two silk handkerchiefs; I carried them in my hand a little way, there was another handkerchief with keys in it, I picked these up; it might be half a dozen doors from Dorset-street, nearer Portman-square.</p>

I asked him what his reasons were for running; he said he had been with a girl of the town in East-street; she called the watch and gave charge of him, and so he ran away from him.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the discovery having been made of this transaction did you go with that crow, and when, to Mr. Sitwell's house - A. I went on the same day that the people brought the crow to our office, about five or or six o'clock in the evening, I took the crow along with me, when I went I found a hole had been bored under the lock large enough to admit the arm of any man. it appeared to have been made with a center bit, so that any person putting his arm in could either unlock the door or turn a small chain off, and likewise unbolt the bottom bolt; it appeared by several marks that were made at the top bolt, that they had been trying to force that bolt back, to which marks I fitted this crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that crow perfect at the end - A. There is a piece out of the end of it, and it exactly fitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say it must be a large center bit - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No center bit is to be produced here by any one - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a forty pounds reward - A. I know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the fastenings of the door - A. I did; the top bolt had been forced back, and here is the thing that was forced off, all the other fastenings could be reached without: they were obliged to force that, or else they must have cut another hole.</p>
               <p>Q. to Waugh. Did you look at the door at all - A. I saw a place was cut out, and I saw the top bolt had been forced.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you fastened the door that night, was it locked, and the chain put up - A. Yes; and the top and the bottom bolts were bolted.</p>

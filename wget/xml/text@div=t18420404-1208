                  </hi>. I am a wine-porter, and live at Pitt's-place, Drury-lane. On the 3rd of April I was with a person named Ford, and Let the wife of the prisoner in Queen-street, at least his woman, not his wife—I am aware of that—if I say what I do not know to be true I am liable to be prosecuted for perjury—I will stand that—I met a person the pri<lb></lb>soner calls his wife in Queen-street, Seven Dials—she was crying—her bonnet was pressed in—Ford and I accompanied her home to No, 6, Upper Rathbone-place, where she and the prisoner lived—after we got into the room we had a glass of gin each—in about ten minutes the pri<lb></lb>soner rushed into the room—during that ten minutes I had said nothing to the woman to my recollection—there was some conversation about what bad occurred to her, but I do not recollect what it was—there was nothing immodest or improper passed between her and me—that could not be while the other man was in the room—when the prisoner came in he took a knife off the table or out of a drawer, I cannot say which—there was a light in the room—the prisoner ran at me, saying, "You rascal, I have heard you," plunging the knife into me—I grasped him by the arm, and held him pretty fast—Ford made his escape to the door, and looked on I while we were entangled with each other—I got the prisoner down upon the bed or floor, and made my escape to the door—the street-door was shut before me as I was trying to get out—when I got into the street he followed me with the knife, saying the words "B—d stop"—I ran for the moment, but finding him coming upon me I returned to him. again, and encountered with him—he bad the knife all this time—it was then I got this cut on the bridge of the nose—I was cut on the nose in the room previous to going into the street, but other wounds occurred in the street while I held his arm—there was nothing to prevent his stabbing me, but I believe he was not equal in strength to me—I came back because I might as well come back as to have him catch me in the back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Well-street, Drury-Jane. On the night of the 3rd of April I went home with Reardon—we knocked up against the prisoner's wife in Queen-street, Seven Dials—we went to the place where she lives with the prisoner as his wife—we had been there ten minutes, to the best of my knowledge, when the prisoner made his appear<lb></lb>ance—during that time nothing improper passed, more than inquiring when he was and what made him strike her—I will swear I did not see Reardon put his hand upon the prisoner's wife—I was not near them—it is not a very large room—I did not join in the conversation—there was no inde<lb></lb>cent conversation there—he was not speaking very improperly to the man's wife—I swear that—I remember her taking the prosecutor by the collar and scratching his face and kicking him—the prisoner bolted into the room, took the knife off the drawer or table, and just <hi rend="italic">took</hi> him on the bridge of the nose, and made it bleed—the cut was not very deep—it was not a good knife—it was deeper than the skin, and about half an inch long—I could distinguish the cut from the scratches of the woman's nails—the prisoner had the knife in his right hand all the time—they bad a fight inside and outside with fists—the prisoner followed us out of the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did my wife treat you and Reardon to a glass of gin each? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not state that it was a cup before the Magistrate—I said she had it in a cup and filled it into the glass—I will swear that I cannot prove that your wife said to Reardon, "I always thought you a blackguard and now you prove it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not hear it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—we had sat down is the room—she cut some bread and meat for him, and gave us a glass of gin—there was something passed about what made the prisoner strike her and run away from her in Seven Dials.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not see him kiss my wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, on my oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He was in the room at the same time, I was on the stairs and could see every thing that passed. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was close to her but did not kiss her—I did not see him place his knee between hers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear he did not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will swear I did not see him—he was sitting as close to her as he could, so that he could lay his hand upon her—Reardon received his cut in the room not in the street.</p>

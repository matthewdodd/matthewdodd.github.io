                  </hi>. I am captain of the <hi rend="italic">Anniversary</hi>, a ship lying in the West India Docks—on Thursday night, 11th August, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in a public-house in the Commercial Road—the prisoner was there when I went in—I had a glass of rum before I went there, and I had some ale there—when I came out I found myself the worse for liquor—I had a pocket-book in my pocket, and a purse containing 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and from 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my pocket-book and purse—I also had a silver watch, and a gold guard—when I came out, the prisoner took hold of me, and began to take these articles away—a young man called "Police!" and two men came to me—I carried my purse and pocket-book in my breast pocket—my watch was in my waistcoat, and the guard round my neck—I am quite sure I had them in my possession <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I was in the public-house.</p>

I live at 68, Heath Street, Stepney—on this Thurs<lb></lb>day night, about 9.45, I was standing at my door—I saw the prosecutor—I also saw the prisoner and another woman coming down the street, and they caught hold of him, and began pulling his coat about—he ran away into</p>

               <p>a little shop, and they ran after him, and the prisoner took his pocket-book out—the old man belonging to the shop took it out of her hand and put it on the counter, and they gave it to the gentleman back again, and a police-man came up—when they got into the street, I saw the prisoner doing something to her pocket—she then went away—the police came up, and I went with the gentleman and the policeman towards Arbour Square—the prosecutor saw the prisoner, and gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 288). About 10.5, on this Thursday night, I was called to a newspaper shop in Heath Street, Stepney—I found the prosecutor there—I brought him out—he was almost insensible, from drink—on the way to the police-station, Parkins pointed out the prisoner to me, at some 50 yards distance—she was running away—someone called out "There is the woman"—I followed her, and brought her back—I said "What is this about robbing this man?—I received no reply—I requested her to walk to the station with me—we walked together, and going into the station she stood against the prosecutor, and I saw something in her hand—I took hold of her hand, and she had this purse containing 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—she afterwards said "He gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go home with me"—when the prosecutor became more sensible, she said "I have taken nothing, or if I have, there it is for you again"—she said to the female searcher, "So help me God! I did not take his watch and chain."</p>

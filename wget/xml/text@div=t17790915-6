               <p>You discharged her in the month of June? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the other still with you? - Yes; I discharged him on the 20th of August; the 25th was the day they were apprehended. I do not know when I lost the goods. On the 25th of August Isabella Prosper came to me and informed me, that Robinson had an apartment in the house she lived in, and she believed she and Coleman had robbed me, and if I would go in the evening I might see them; I went in the evening, and found the things mentioned in the indictment; they had my private marks on them.</p>
               <p>Did both the prisoners lodge in that room? - No, only the woman; Coleman had a place in the Custom-house. Isabella Prosper informed me he visited this woman. Having secured the property, I went after Robinson; Coleman hearing of it, in the mean time had surrendered himself.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - That he was innocent.</p>
               <p>What did Robinson say when you found the things? - She said they were not my property; but before the justice she confessed they were.</p>
               <p>What magistrate was she carried before? - Alderman Plomer. She acknowledged she took them herself.</p>

                  </hi> My father keeps a public-house in High-street, Wap<lb></lb>ping. On Thursday, 10th Feb., the prisoner came for a pennyworth of gin—I served him—he gave me a sixpence, I put it into the till—there was no other sixpence there—I gave him change, and he went away—my sister came into the bar before any other customer was served, went to the till, took out the sixpence, showed it to me, and it was bad—she gave it to my father—on the Saturday morning the prisoner came again, and was taken into custody—I am sure he is the same man.</p>

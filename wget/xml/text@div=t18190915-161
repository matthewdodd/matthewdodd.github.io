On the morning of the 31st of July I missed these things, and found she was gone - she had given me no notice, and never returned. She had slept in our house three weeks - I had paid her 10 s. the night before; I have since seen them at the office. In consequence of information I applied to Mr. Wigley, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Chandos-street, and described the articles to him - he denied their being there. I applied again on the Monday morning, and left a written description of them - he still denied having any such articles. On the Tuesday the prisoner was taken, and the duplicates found on her. I applied a third time, without the duplicates - they were still denied. I went a fourth time to them with the constable, and produced the duplicates - the property was then produced. He appeared very much confused. I knew it to be mine.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Martin's. On Tuesday, the 3d of August, I apprehended the prisoner in May's-buildings. She gave me some duplicates of the property, which the prosecutor and prosecutrix claimed - they were pledged at Wigley's, in Chandos-street. I went there with M'Lennan on the Saturday, about an hour after the prisoner had left the house, in consequence of information. He described the property to Mr. Wigley, and also to his servant, Manser - I heard it. He also described the person of the prisoner - it answered exactly to the description of the prisoner. Wigley said he had no such property, and knew no such person. On Tuesday, the 3d of August, I went again with the duplicates, and produced them to him - he produced the articles stated in the indictment. One duplicate is dated the 13th, one the 16th, one the 23d, three the 26th, one the 27th, and two the 31st of July, and all pledged in the name of Holdsworth.</p>

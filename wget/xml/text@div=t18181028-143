On the 10th of October the prisoner came for a glass of gin, and gave me 1s. After he was gone, I suspected it, and tied it in a handkerchief. I kept it by itself. On the Wednesday after he came again, had a glass of rum, which came to 31/2d. and gave me another shilling. I told him it was bad, and that I took a bad one of him last Saturday. He appeared frightened. I sent for an officer. He said, "Do not be too hard with me. Here are two halfcrowns, which will compensate you for the money you think you have taken of me."</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, and found 15s. in good money on him, and one bad, and 1s. 41/2d. in copper on him. I asked him where he lived? He said at Kensington, but he did not know the house. That he came from Portsmouth, and sometimes lodged in one house and sometimes in another, and that was the first day he came to London. He said "It is of no use taking me anywhere; you will not get much by me. Drive to a house where we can have a good supper, and I will give you my watch and seals, and get you a 5l. note.</p>

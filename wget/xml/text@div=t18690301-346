                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Grove House, 140, Fulham Road, Brompton—in September, 1866, I was residing at 12, Sidney Place, Onslow Square, Brompton—on account of the illness of one of my children, Mrs. Godrich and the children went down to Ramsgate—I went down to Ramsgate on 29th September, joined my wife and children, slept there, and returned on Sunday, the 30th, by the last train in the evening, 7 or 8 o'clock, I believe—it was about 11.20 when I arrived at Victoria Terminus, London—before calling a cab I went into the refreshment room and had a sandwich and a glass of cold brandy and water—I then took a cab and proceeded home—I let myself in and found my cousin, Miss Hall, there, and a servant—my father has been in practice at Brompton nearly fifty years—Miss Hall keeps house for him—he brought her up—Miss Hall remained till nearly 1 o'clock in the morning—I let her out—while Miss Hall was there, the servant, Mary Fox, came into the sitting-room and asked if I would have anything for supper—I said, "No;" and, to the best of my belief, when I let Miss Hall out, Mary Fox went to bed—I did not see Cottee that night, nor any servant except Mary Fox—when I let Miss Hall out I went to bed—I slept in the top room front, that is, the highest floor—that is the room I always occupied for some years—my wife used to sleep in the front room, second floor—that room communicated with another, which is termed the children's room—I did not during that night, or any other night during my wife's absence,</p>

               <p>sleep in the room on the second floor, which used to be occupied by her—I never occupied it for a night—I did not see Mary Fox next morning in that room in her nightgown—I was not in bed that room when Cottee more than once came to the door and knocked—I was not in the second floor room at all, neither back nor front—I can't remember where I first saw Mary Fox on Monday morning, October 1st—I do not remember whether I saw her before I came down stairs, or whether anybody called me in the morning—it was my custom to be called, and also for someone to bring me a cup of tea—I do not know of my own knowledge whether Miss Hall came to the house that morning, but when my father was out of town I believe she came every morning—my father had gone down to his country seat for pheasant shoot<lb></lb>ing—he went down by the night train to be there on the 1st October, for the pheasant shooting, and I attended to his practice during his absence—Monday morning, from 9 till 10, is set apart for vaccination—I did not on the night of 30th September, or on the morning of 1st October, commit adultery with Mary Fox, nor at any time, or in any place—I discharged Cottee in consequence of this letter I received from Mrs. Godrich (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I read part of it to her—Mary Fox was not called upon the trial at the Divorce Court, and to the best of my belief she was in America, but I don't know.</p>

               <p>me with having caught me with my arm round Miss Fowler's waist, em<lb></lb>bracing her—she is my sister-in-law—Miss Fowler and I very often went out together, as we lived opposite—I used to take her out to drive some<lb></lb>times, by my wife's desire, with the children, and sometimes alone—I did not take her out to dinner at Putney—we did have some biscuits and a glass of sherry there—she was, I suppose, examined in the Divorce Court, but I was not there—I did not take her out to lunch very often—if I met her when I went to see my patients she would walk with me—the Star and Garter is at Putney—I have got costs against the two co-respondents, so I have not to pay the costs—we have lived very unhappily, and have not slept together since 1864, and she has made several charges of adultery against me—Mary Fox came to my house somewhere about August or September, but I can't say, because we had so many servants—she came first as a servant—she must have come in August, about a month or six weeks before this—I had not known her or seen her before—I have never taken her to casino's, or places of that sort—my father being surgeon to the police, I had some orders for Cremorne when it was the police <hi rend="italic">fete</hi> there, my cousin asked me if I would give the orders to her two servants, I said, "Yes," and she said, "Your servant can go, too, if you like," and the three servants went—that is all I know about getting her orders for Cremorne—it is not true that I took her to places of amusement—I have not walked out with her alone, but I met her once in Kensington, by appointment—I was with a friend—it was about 7 o'clock on the Tuesday evening—I was going to the Vestry—I met her to give her a sovereign, because she said that Mrs. Godrich had assaulted her, and her bonnet and dress were torn—I said that I would give her compensation, that I had not got any money then, but if she would meet me I would give her a sovereign—this was after she was discharged—I never walked out alone with her before 30th September, or took her to a place of amusement—I used to give her money to pay for what I wanted in the house, which she accounted for, but not as a present—she remained in my house after the 30th, till some time in December—she did not remain till my wife returned, but left about a week before, or it may be a fortnight—she left because she said she would not remain—she did not know Mrs. Godrioh was coming back, neither did I—I have not the slightest idea where she went after she left me, but when I made the appointment with her she had rushed to my father's, when she said she was assaulted—I was at my father's, she complained to me, and I told her to meet me that night at Kensington—I did not give her a sovereign then, because I had not got it in my pocket—I could have got it from my father if he had been at home—Mr. Pile is the friend who was with me when I met her at Kensing<lb></lb>ton—I never saw her after that—I swear that I never saw her after she left my house, except on those two occasions—I don't know whether she went into service—she never applied to me for a character, she may have to my wife—she told me she was going to America to be married, when she was in my service—it is impossible for me to say whether that was before 30th September—I had no conversation with her about marriage, and do not know how she came to tell me that—I heard from her father, just before the proceedings in the Divorce Court commenced, that she had gone to America—my petition was filed in October, 1867—I did not know when I filed it that she had gone to America—I fully believed she had gone—when I filed my petition, I knew that the first charge in Mrs. Godrich's petition was adultery with Fox—my solicitors inquired whether Fox was in this country,</p>

               <p>I suppose—they did not tell me so—I heard that she had gone, from her father, before the trial—he did not tell me where she had gone—I did not ask him anything about it—I had notice when Mrs. Godrich's petition was filed, in June 1867, that one of the charges related to Fox—I did not then make inquiries; I put it into the hands of my solicitors and left them to do as they liked—I am not aware whether I told them she was in America—I dare say I said I believed she was there—I believe Mary Fox went down to Ramsgate on Monday morning, 1st October—I most likely gave her money to go, but I don't remember it—I remember, from your calling my attention to the fact, that I did see her that morning—I can't tell what time—I think she stopped a week—I can't tell whether she returned on the following Friday—I can't say whether I discharged the prisoner on the day after Fox returned, but if the letter is handed to me and I can see the date I will tell you—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) there is no date to it, only "Saturday"—if it was directed on Saturday I should get it on Monday—Fox did not complain immediately after her return that Cottee had said that she would prove or charge her with some improprieties of conduct with me—nothing to that effect—she did not tell me that Cottee had threatened to write to Mrs. Godrich to let her know of Fox's goings on—she did not tell me that she answered Cottee and said that she would make her prove it—I have no recollection of her stating that she and Cottee had had any altercation at all—I have no recollection of her saying so—I know she never said anything about impropriety of conduct—she did not tell me that she had some quarrel and words with Cottee—I could not have discharged Cottee before the Monday after Fox returned, because this letter is dated Saturday—I do not know whether I said at the Police Court that this letter was destroyed, but I could not find it—I told Cottee why I discharged her, and read part of this letter to her—I do not know whether Mrs. Godrich sent for her shortly after her return from Ramsgate, but I think it is very likely—about the 3rd or 4th June, shortly before the filing of Mrs. Godrich's petition, the furniture was taken from my house—a dozen men did not by my orders come to the house on the morning of 4th June, and take the furnitnre away—I mean to say that the furniture was removed before my wife's petition—three men, I think, came with a van, and the proprietor of it, and removed the furniture—I do not know whether my wife was in bed, or where she was, I know she was in the house—they began early in the morning—they did not strip the house—I left a lot of fittings behind, not fixtures—I had slept there the night before, and my wife also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they actually take away her clothes, and some of her jewellery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what they took away; the only jewellery I had was some sham ornaments not worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the articles of wearing apparel were sent to her—her jewellery was not taken away, only to the value of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the bulk of her jewellery went I know not where—some of her clothes were taken away by accident to my father's house, and returned a day or two afterwards, Miss Hall will tell you when—it was before the filing of her petition, I believe, but I do not speak positively—I was there part of the time when the men were there, but I had to attend to my patients—I gave directions to the men to take everything away—I do not know whether they went into her bedroom—45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken away in her desk—the money was demanded of me afterwards, by her brother, Mr. Walter Fowler, but was not returned—her clothes were returned; I do not know whether it was by the advice of the solicitor; I remember now that the clothes were</p>

               <p>sent to her solicitor's office—I do not know when Fox came back from America—I never saw her till the day before yesterday, but I heard, a week or a fortnight ago, that she had come back—I did not hear it before the proceedings in the Police Court were concluded—Fox was not called before the Magistrate; I did not know that she was in England—two of the men who gave evidence against my wife have not been committed by the Magistrate on a charge of perjury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Two women? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not present—I was not there when the matter was inquired into—I heard one woman committed here for trial, but not the other—Miss Hall was present, but was not called; I have not the slightest idea why not—Miss Hall was in the habit of coming to call me of a morning, when my father was out of town—she lived six or seven minutes' walk off—she considered I did not get up early enough—I some<lb></lb>times went to bed late, and sometimes at 12 o'clock—the charges of cruelty were not inquired into at the Divorce Court; the issue was adultery on one side and on the other—I was not in Court one moment—Cottee used to bring letters up to me sometimes, while I was in bed, and put them through the door, or come into the room, either Cottee, or Fox, or any of them—Fox, most likely, came into my room—it was always my practice to have a cup of coffee in bed, and I have no doubt all the servants have been in—I should say most decidedly that Fox has come in with my coffee, and most likely while I was in bed—after Cottee was discharged, Fox and I were the only regular inmates of the house; but Miss Hall has slept there, and Mr. Woodward—when Miss Hall did not sleep there, or Woodward, I and Fox were alone in the house—there is a front and a back room on the third floor—Cottee used to occupy the back room, and I slept in the front—there is a communication between the front and back—the second floor front room was Mrs. Godrich's room, and there is a communication between that room and the nursery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you desired Fox to sleep in the nursery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had desired them to keep the beds aired, but who I said it to I do not know.</p>

               <p>insistod on it—the verdict of the jury could not alter the evidence that was given to me—I have, since the jury acquitted him of it, repeated my belief that he was guilty—two persons, named Williams and Legg, were witnesses examined at the Divorce Court against me, with reference to the adultery alleged to have been committed by me with Mr. Forder—I think I instituted proceedings against them for perjury simultaneously with the prosecution against the prisoner—Mr. Forder was corresponding with my solicitor, and my solicitor understood he was bringing proceedings, or else mine would have been taken directly; they were, in fact—I can't tell the date exactly when the summons was taken out—as regards the other co<lb></lb>respondent, Lara, they found that against me likewise, but they would not have done so if I had been allowed to call evidence—I believe only one witness was examined in reference to that issue—I was in Court—I think Mrs. T., who I did not recognize, was the only person that proved that—it was alleged to have taken place at Brighton, in the presence of my children and servant, by a person who was not with me.</p>

            , I was standing last Monday, the 27th of January, in the shop; I heard the breaking of the shop window; looking round I saw the prisoner at the bar with her hand and arm in the window, it was between one and two o'clock in middle of the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290053"></xptr>Q. Did you know the prisoner before that time? - I never saw her before. I jumped over the counter and ran out of doors, and catched hold of her arm; she had got then about a dozen yards from the window; as soon as I got up to her I found these two pair of buckles on her; I catched hold of her and brought her into the shop with these buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember where abouts these two pair of buckles were in the shop? - These two pair of buckles were in the window at the time she broke it; I took them from that hand which arm was all bloody, with the cut, which the force had given when she struck against the glass; I sent for an officer at Bow-street, and had her taken there, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got nothing to say in my defence, I leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>

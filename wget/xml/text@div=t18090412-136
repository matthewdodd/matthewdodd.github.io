               <p>JOHN DYER. I live at East-Ham in Essex, I live on my means. On the 2nd of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was walking up Fish-street-hill; I felt something against my thigh, presently afterwards I felt something pulling at my coat; I turned suddenly round and caught the prisoner's hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in your pocket - A. A silk handkerchief; it was dark; he slipped down, and snatched his hand away from me; I caught him by the collar and challenged him with attempting to pick my pocket; he said he had not, and he hit me on the bosom; I hit him, and he ran away from me; I ran after him and knocked him down three times; he then begged for mercy, and said he would never do the like again if I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming over London-bridge, coming into Gracechurch-street my foot slipped of the curb-stone; I fell against this gentleman, he struck me three or four times; I strove to get out of the way.</p>
               <p>GUILTY, aged 21.</p>

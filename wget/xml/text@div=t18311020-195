               <p>MARIA MANNERS. I am the wife of Charles Manners. I am a laundress, and live in <placeName id="t18311020-195-crimeloc1042">Wharf-road, Paddington</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She had got rather sober then? A. Yes, and was returning to her own house; she lives opposite me - she had had a great deal to drink; I have known her a good while - she is a very honest woman; she was in such a state that she might think these caps were her pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GROUNDWELL. I am a Police-officer. I stopped the prisoner in the Harrow-road - I asked how she came to take the property; she hesitated a minute, but when she found I was going to search her, she said she took the caps, and would give them up - she took them from her left-hand pocket - she appeared to have been drinking, but knew what she was doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was she not in the way to her own house? A. Yes; this was about a quarter-past eight o'clock.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went there, and she had some drink as well as I - I was very tipsy; I went to my daughter's, and then found these caps in my pocket; I was returning to deliver them back to her.</p>

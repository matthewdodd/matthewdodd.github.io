                  </hi>. I live at No. 28, High Street, Newington, and am a hosier. On 22nd April, a young man, named Cordier, called on me about 20 or 25 minutes before 10 o'clock, and at that time I saw a person outside looking in at my window; to the best of my belief Sullivan was the person—on that evening, previous to retiring to bed, I saw that the house was fastened—before 12 o'clock I went round to see that the gas was out, and all the doors fastened—the back window was then shut—the shutter was put up, and the screw put in the centre—that was perfectly secure, and the door between the shop and the hall was locked—on the morning of 23rd April, I was roused by the policeman—I went down and found the policeman in the hall, and the hall door was open—I went into the shop, and found the back window open—the shutter was put down, the screw taken out, and thrown into the garden—the blind was thrown into the garden, and the window was down—I found the place had been regularly ransacked, and a great amount of property taken away—I missed shawls, a coat, some plated chains and rings, neck ties, shirts, and a great many articles—I estimate the value of the whole at about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my cash box had been broken open with a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, or some instrument—some of the articles have been shown to me by the policeman—here is one handkerchief which has my mark on it.</p>

On 8th May, I went, about 5 o'clock in the evening, to the Alpha beer house, which is kept by William Scaines, in Alpha Place, Caledonian Road—there was a girl behind the bar—I went up stairs to the second floor back room—we knocked at the room door, which, after some hesitation, was opened by Taylor, who was in his shirt, and Sullivan was in bed—I told him to get up—I left the room, leaving the prisoners in charge of a constable; I went down stairs, and William Scaines came up—I told him I had apprehended two of his lodgers for a robbery, and we had every reason to believe that some of the stolen property was in his possession, and I should take him into custody, and search his premises—he said, "I know nothing about it, I know nothing of it"—we commenced searching the house—I think we first went into a room on the second floor—not the room we had gone into before, but I do not speak to the finding of any thing there—I was with the other officer when he found a small bundle containing some handkerchiefs, in a cupboard—there were some keys found in the second floor back room—on going down stairs, Henry Scaines was brought in by a constable whom I had instructed for the purpose—I told him I should apprehend him on suspicion of a robbery, and we should go and search his lodging—his lodging is at No. 7, Alpha Place—when woo got there we went into the first floor front room, and in a box we found twenty scarfs, nineteen neck ties, thirty cravats, seventy silk</p>

                  </hi> I live at 23, Leicester-square, and am cook to the Reform Club. I knew the prisoner for a short time, and then lost sight of him—I met him again one night at Drury-lane Theatre—he said, "Will you allow me to come and see you?"—I said, "It will do me great pleasure, call to morrow, or any day you like"—next day or the day after, he paid me a visit, and begged a book of mine, which he said he would give a review of in the <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Chronicle</hi>—I said I would send on to his house—in two or three days he called again, and said, "I have been writing an article for you, will you give me an advertisement for my paper?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "This I will put in for nothing, but the other will you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I was starting to a friend about an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which I was desiross to appear next day—the prisoner said he lived close to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office, and he would do it for me—he then proposed that his son should go instead, and I gave to his son a sovereign, to pay for the advertisement—next day the pri<lb></lb>soner came again—he said, "You have seen your advertisement all right?"—I said, "Yes, I am much obliged to you"—he then presented this medal to me, and said, "You gave my son a bad sovereign, and I gave a good one for it"—I objected to it, being confident I had given him a goods one—after a little conversation, I gave him a good one—seeing the advertisement in the paper I believed him—the prisoner then left, and I did not see him again.</p>

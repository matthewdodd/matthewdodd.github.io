I was present when the conversation took place, at Judges' Chambers, between Boys, and Wright, and Tanner—I went there, not with the intention of seeing Mr. Tanner—a summons had been made out at Bow Street, and I went to serve Mr. Tanner, and he did not know it—I found Boys, and Wright, and Francis Day, the brother of the plaintiff, there—Mr. Wright went up to Mr. Tanner, and said "Some of the witnesses whom you subpoenaed in the case of 'Day and Wife against the South-eastern Railway Company,' say they have not been paid"—I did not hear Mr. Tanner say anything in answer to that; but Mr. Boys went up at the same time, and said "Will you pay me my expenses in the case of Day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187110230040"></xptr>
               <p>and Wife, which they say you have received?"—Mr. Tanner turned away, and I understood him to say "I won't pay you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear him say "You must go to Mr. Day"—I did not hear him use Mr. Day's name—he said "I won't pay you," and turned away—I served him with the summons directly afterwards—that was a summons to attend at Bow Street for the perjury—I did not attend the taxation of costs, but I went to meet Mr. Stevens, and I was just in time to add up the bill—Mr. Stevens is the managing clerk in our office—a summons was taken out afterwards, to review the taxation—the costs were taxed on 24th July, and I suppose the summons was taken out about three days afterwards—that would be the 27th—I did not see the defendant when that summons to review was taken out—it was served by one of the clerks in the office, and he instructed Counsel to attend—I think there was only one summons to review, and that was with reference to the doctors' fees—I don't think there was any other—I don't think Mr. Day was in communi<lb></lb>cation with our office before the summons was taken out—I don't think I had spoken to Mr. Day—at the time of the summons to review the taxation, I don't think we had received any information that the witnesses, or some of them, had not been paid—I believe there were two summonses, now I come to think of it—there was a summons to review the master's taxation, I think, and the other to review the expenses of the witnesses who attended at Kingston, but they were settled at the same time—I don't think there was a summons taken out after that, and abandoned—I don't know the date of the second summons—I say they were both heard at the same time by Mr. Baron Cleasby—I paid the defendant the money on 4th August, the date of the receipt—I think I had seen Mr. Day at that time—I had not received information at that time that the witnesses had not been paid; if I had, I would not have paid the money—I don't know whether I had seen Day myself; I don't think I had any conversation with him—I did not have any conversation with any of the medical gentlemen—I attended to this matter under Mr. Stevens.—at the time the money was paid, on 4th August, I had not been informed by Day that the witnesses had not been paid—I had no reason to believe they had not; I believed they had been paid by Mr. Tanner, directly or indirectly, the medical gen<lb></lb>tlemen as well as the others—the action brought against the Company was resisted strongly throughout—they knew that we meant to fight the case—I think the claim was 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the husband, and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the wife; 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—we resisted on the ground that there was no cause for the action, and they were not injured certainly to the extent they claimed—to a certain extent it was a fraudulent claim, an exaggerated claim, and it was fought in that spirit throughout—the evidence was given on Saturday, 24th June; the taxation was 24th July—when the bill of costs was taxed, it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and it was impossible for us to pay the amount; and by 11 o'clock the next morning the Sheriffs were on London Bridge Station—the Judge ordered him to return us the expenses, about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he put the Sheriff in on 25th July—we received a notice from Mr. Day, on the 25th or 26th, to pay him the money, and not Mr. Tanner—there was a verdict for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Day, through his attorney, took out a summons to show cause why the amount had not been paid into Court—we attended that summons, and Mr. Baron Cleasby ordered that the damages should be paid into Court, subject to any rival claims—I believe Mr. Day had changed his attorney—I</p>

               <p>believe the money is lying there now, but I hare not been to search—I only paid Mr. Tanner 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the total amount for the costs of the medical witnesses is between 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bill of costs would be between party and party—I don't know that gentlemen of the emi<lb></lb>nence of Dr. Hancock do not attend trials without their expenses are guaranteed—the total amount here between seven and eight doctors, is 28 guineas; but there would be other large fees—I should be very much surprised if the costs out of the pocket of the solicitor amounted to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I should think it would be more like a quarter of that sum—I should think 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. With regard to the costs out of pocket, supposing he got 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages, he would charge the plaintiff a certain sum for the costs, except those he could recover upon this affidavit, and when I paid him that 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believed he had paid all that sum—the reviewing of the taxation was with reference to the medical fees, not the other fees, and I paid the defendant the 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the belief that that sum had been paid by him.</p>

                  </hi>. I have attended here to-day as a witness for the prosecution—I had no subpoena, but I received a letter from the South-Eastern Railway Company's solicitor—I had a communication with Dr. Tanner about my giving evidence in the action, and he made himself responsible to me for the amount, both verbally and by writing—before this matter was inquired into at Bow Street, the prisoner tendered me the amount of my medical expenses repeatedly—some question arose as to Mr. Day's solvency, and I asked Mr. Tanner, "Is that man Day all right?—he said "If you have any doubt, you had better call on Dr. Tanner, and he will pay your fees"—he told me several times that if I called on Dr. Tanner I should be paid my fees—I was perfectly satisfied to look to Dr. Tanner for them, until Mr. Stevens called on me some time before the 4th August—he met me in Finsbury Square the second or third week in July—I had known Mr. Stevens some years—he asked me what fees I had had in Day's case—I thought he was joking, and I said "You know very well the fees are all right"—he said "What have you had?—I said "Actually, I have not received my fees, but they are guaranteed to me by Dr. Tanner"—I was in a very great hurry, and left him—I have known the defendant since he was a little boy—he is now about twenty-two—since he was a little boy till this moment, he has borne the character, amongst those who knew him, as an honest and truthful man—his brother is a physician, now practising in Edinburgh, and an old pupil of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This letter is my writing—I sent it to Mr. Stevens on 1st August—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "My dear Mr. Stevens. I thought it right to let you know that Mr. Tanner has called here, and paid me the whole of my fees in the case of 'Day and Wife.'")—I have not expressed anxiety about getting my fees—after Mr. Stevens called on me, and the conversation took place I have told you of, the following morning Mr. Day called, and made some statements to me, that I have proved to be untrue, concerning Mr. Tanner—he said that Mr. Tanner was about to leave the country—Mr. Stevens gave me to understand that Mr. Tanner had been behaving dis<lb></lb>honourably, and I said "You will look after my fees, won't you? and he said he would, and I thanked him for what he had done, and I should do so again—Mr. Stevens said that he had an affidavit that I had been paid some guineas, and that created, at first, an unfavourable impression on my mind; but it is removed now, and I would trust Mr. Tanner with thousands at this moment—I did not call my wife down, and request her to go at once, and get the money from Mr. Tanner—I requested her to go and warn him of what was going on, and she did so—I have been paid by a bill of exchange—I don't recollect that I said to Mr. Stevens that I would take no further steps in the matter before I had been to Dr. Tanner—Dr. Tanner was 150 miles</p>

               <p>away in the country, at the time—I told Mr. Stevens that he had guaranteed my fees from the commencement—it caused me great anxiety, at first, that the medical men, having been introduced in more than one instance by myself, could not get their fees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. At that time I had not had a personal interview with Dr. Tanner about it—he was in the country, and there was no opportunity of getting an explanation—I saw him within two hours after he came back from the country, and then I was perfectly satisfied, and had not any fear for myself or any of the other medical men.</p>

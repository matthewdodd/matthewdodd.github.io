On the 12th of June, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I went into the Red Lion, public-house, Kilburn. The prisoner sat there. I staid there about half an hour; then went out, and he followed me towards Paddington. He overtook me, and hustled me off the footpath - he seized me by the right shoulder, dragged me across the turnpike road, threw me down, and swore he would be my bl - dy butcher - he got his right hand across my throat and his left hand in my pocket, where I had 2 s. - he took them out, and took two handkerchiefs off my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. He pushed you down - A. Yes, and knelt on me, and held me by the throat. A carriage came by, with a coachman and footman on it - he told them to take no notice of what I said, for I was a woman he had lived with. I never lived with him, nor ever saw him before that night. After the carriage was gone by, he said,</p>

               <p>"Now I will be your bl - dy butcher." Two gentlemen came by, on horseback, while he was kneeling on me - he told them not to mind what I said, for I was a wh - re, and had lived with him above ten years. They both came, and one of them almost rode on him before he would get off me. A poor man came by, took me up, and led me to Paddington. The prisoner ran off, towards Kilburn, with the money and handkerchiefs. I saw him next morning; I went to the public-house to look after him, and there he sat with thirty more men - he was in custody. I knew him to be the man - I am sure of him. He took a handkerchief out of his hat and said</p>

               <p>"Here is one of your handkerchiefs," and threw it at me. I have not found the other handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not go out of the public-house with you - A. I came out, and had not got four yards before he came after me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180022"></xptr>Q. Did not you give me leave to take liberties with you on the road - A. No; I am too old for that; I never consented to any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask me to go home with you - A. No; I had no home. I am fifty-eight years old next September. When I was in the house he drew my pot off the table twice, and I told him not to meddle with my beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a tall man go by in a cart,

I was sent for to Kilburn, and took the prisoner in custody, on Wednesday, the 13th of June, at half-past nine o'clock, he was setting in the tap-room at Mr. Batty's, the Red Lion, public-house, at Kilburn. Batty said he had robbed a poor woman the evening before - he said he was very sorry for what he had had done, and that he was a d - d fool. He was very drunk when I took him. One handkerchief dropped from him in the room.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He came in and took me. I said I had done nothing. I waited while they went to the prosecutrix, she said I was the man. I asked if he wanted me. If I am hung for it, I never had any thing of hers. She gave me leave to take liberties with her, and I wanted to take them.</p>
               <p>J. E. WILSON re-examined. He did ask if I wanted him; I said Yes, and should immediately handcuff him. He said, I am d - d if I have them on till you give me more beer. He was drunk.</p>

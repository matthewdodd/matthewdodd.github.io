            . I am the wife of Samuel Loader; I am a fancy trimming maker; I left my house between seven and eight o'clock; I locked the door after me. On returning home, near nine o'clock, my little boy came and told me the house had been broken open; I went home, and saw the staple bursted off the door; I missed a looking-glass, a silk handkerchief, a small quantity of my master's work; and three pair of shoes of my husband's.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRICE. I am a watchman. The two prisoners came to me, and asked me to purchase what they had got in the bag.</p>

I asked him to let me look at them; they shewed me a tea-pot, a milk-pot, a sugar-bason, and a looking-glass, they wanted twenty-five shillings for the whole; I offered sixteen shillings for them; they went away. Tisley came back, and said, I should have them; he said, he came from Penman. I am sure the two prisoners are the men.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 9th of January, I went in company with Gleed at a house in Turk-street, Bethnel Green, I knocked at the front room door; I was answered by a woman; I told her if she did not open the door, I would break it open; I found a trap door under the stairs; I got a light, and went down, there were no stairs, and in the third cellar, I found the prisoner Tisley, I asked him his name; he said, his name was James Thomas. I told him I took him in the name of John Tisley, on suspicion of robbing some people in Quaker-street, he then said, it was no use denying his name, it was Tisley. I then brought him to the office; I took a pair of shoes off his feet, which are here. I left him in the custody of my father. I found nothing but a pair of shoes on Tisley's feet.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and looking-glass frame maker. Last Monday week about half after four in the afternoon. I was in company with Penman at the Spotted Horse public-house, Shoreditch; John Tisley came into him, they went out together, and talked together. Penman came in, and asked me to take a walk with them; we went over Friars Mount; when Penman came to Loader's house, Penman burst the door open, with his arms, he had no crow with him; it was about half after six; when he went into the house Tisley followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you - A. I was at the corner, I was to look out, and to inform them if any body was coming. Penman brought out of the house a looking-glass, and three pair of shoes; nothing else as I saw. Tisley had one pair of shoes; they said I was to have one pair of shoes, but I had none; they gave me only four shillings and sixpence for my share.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Loader. Look at these shoes - A. They are my shoes, and the looking-glass is mine.</p>

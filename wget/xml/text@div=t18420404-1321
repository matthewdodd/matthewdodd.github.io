                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 14th of March I went with my brother officer to the Rum Puncheon public-house—when Sayer came in, Packer went up to her, laid hold of her hand, and said, "Rachael, my dear, don't fret," or something to that effect—nothing had been said to her at that time—I was in my police dress—Mr. Rutt, the inspector, was with me—we went up stairs to search the bed-room—Sayer led the way, and Packer followed—she took me to the back room first floor—I went in with both the prisoners, and searched the room—I found a chest of drawers there, and found this satin dress and cashmere shawl—I asked Sayer, in Packer's presence, whether the gown was hers—she said it was hers; that Packer had brought it up to her into the bed-room some few months ago, and said, "Will you purchase this gown?"—she said, "No, I don't want any thing of the kind;" it was too good for a woman in her circumstances; that he went down stairs again, and returned some short time afterwards, and said, "You had better have it, you will never have such a bargain again, you can buy it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that she said, "Certainly it is very cheap, if it is only to cut it up for bonnets," and she gave the money to Packer, and he took it down stairs to the party—to the best of my recollection, that was all she stated about the gown—I do not think I have omitted any thing—Packer did not say any thing—I asked Sayer whether the shawl was hers—she said it was, she had purchased it for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., of a woman, as I understood her, at her house—I think she said the woman's name was Clark—I think I asked who it was—I took them into custody—on the way to the sta<lb></lb>tion, a woman came up, and put her face under Sayer's bonnet—after she had done so, Sayer said, "That is the woman I purchased the shawl of"—the woman said, "No, I am sure you did not, you purchased it of my husband"—that was all that occurred, to the best of my recollection—</p>

               <p>Q. These parcels were all made up in fifty's - A. Yes, in even fifty's: this was one of the parcels wanting ten, all dated the 3d of January of the present year.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of the communications that Mr. Costan made to you when he gave you that note did you speak to the prisoner - A. I did. The prisoner was a clerk in our house; I accused him of the theft; he denied it. I insisted on knowing what other notes he had about him; he produced two others, one of them turned out to be one of the notes I had lost this 61,409, the same date; I then asked him how he came by these two; he said he got them of Thomas Hall in change of a dirty two pound note. The first note I received of Costan; he borrowed it for me, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is it known to all the clerks that it is not the practice of the house to take the number of the small notes - A. It is.</p>

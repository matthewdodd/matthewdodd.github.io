On Friday the night of 7th of December, between the hours of eleven and twelve; coming from the west-end of the town, something disguised in liquor, I was accosted by the prisoner, (to the best of my recollection) in Broad-street, St. Giles's, and solicited to accompany her to her lodgings, which, at that time, I did not know where they were. I went with her. - I was conducted up to a one pair of stairs room, where there was then a light, and a small fire. - I was there about a quarter of an hour. - I was then further solicited to take off my clothes, I did; and I went to bed with her. - How long I was I don't know; but I fell asleep very soon, from the effects of the liquor I had drank. I awoke; and reflection and recollection came a-cross me so strong, that it alarmed me a great deal. I enquired what o'clock it was. - My reason for asking this, was, I had hung my watch close by the bed-side, on the corner of the chimney-piece, which I then missed. The chimney-piece is not a yard from the bed, to the best of my remembrance. Missing my watch, I immediately got up, and was going to dress myself. I should observe to your lordship it was then dark; my clothes were removed all about the room, and when I wanted them I found sometimes one, and sometimes the other; finding my situation to be such, I called out and gave an alarm; the prisoner asked me what I wanted, why I made such a noise; I told her I thought there was sufficient reason, as I have been robbed, and as such I would wish to know what was become of my watch, she said she knew nothing about it; the alarm I had given brought some persons into the room; but whom I cannot tell, one was a woman, and the other was a man; the man enquired what was the matter, I told him accordingly, I had been robbed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150136"></xptr>I missed a shirt pin, a pair of silk stockings, a man's cloth great coat; my pocket I found had been rifled; the man that came into the room said I am sorry for it, I will go down and call my father, he went down and came up again, and said his father was coming; he came and brought his father, and we came down into the street and called the first watchman near; his name is

            , he called another watchman, who soon came, we all went together, and we found the door shut and the padlock on it; they opened the door and we went in, and nothing could be seen but a number of my papers laying about the floor; we came down stairs again, on that I was taken to the watch-house, at St. Giles's, I went there with the watchman; I then related to the constable of the night the circumstances, I had no money left, as such I intended to stay there, having to go home in the morning; about seven o'clock in the morning the watchman White, brought the prisoner in with another woman, the prisoner had on my great coat as stated in the indictment; the master of that watch-house, Mr. Rundly took the coat off from her back; I can swear it to be mine, the woman I believe had nothing on her.</p>
               <p>Q. You admit yourself to be so very drunk that you fell asleep as soon as you got to bed? - It was not from the quantity of liquor, but the badness, that made me drunk; I had not drank more than six-pennyworth of rum and water, I might have drank a little more of porter that day, I had called at a house in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober enough to know that you had your watch about you? - I am sure I had and the pin to the best of my recollection I slipped into my coat pocket where my pocket book was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any light in the room? - When I went into the room there was a light and a fire.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your watch? - A metal watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your silk stockings again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do for a pair of stockings? - I had two pair on, I had a pair of under ones, under my silk stockings, I found the one pair, but the silk ones I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of this watch be? - 15 s. or 20 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of your silk stockings? - 2 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of this pin? - 15 s. or 20 s.</p>

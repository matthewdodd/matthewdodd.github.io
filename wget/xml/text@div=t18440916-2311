                  </hi>. I am a broker—I am fifty-seven years of age. On the 24th of July the prisoner came to my shop—he asked me for the porter who removed a glass for him before—I told him he was below, and was a tenant of mine—(he had removed a glass for him eight days before)—the porter went with the prisoner, and came back to me in about twenty minutes, to ask me if I would assist him—I went with him to a house—I did not know that Mrs. Dyke lived at the house I went to—I did not make any inquiries—I went with the porter to the house, and the prisoner was there—I assisted the porter in removing one large chair and two small ones, a sofa, a fender, fire-irons, and two small pictures—we took them to Mr. Knapp's, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in the Edgware-road—the prisoner went with me, and carried the two small pictures himself—none of us went into the shop—I cannot say whether the pawnbroker's man came to the door or not, as I was on the other side of the pavement, where I had just put down the sofa to wipe myself—Mr. Knapp declined to take the sofa, but agreed to take the other things—I then went with the sofa and the prisoner to Mr. Hawkins', a broker, where he offered it for sale—he asked the prisoner whose it was, and he said his aunt's—I heard him say that, and I thought he was authorized by his aunt to sell those things—I do not know how much Mr. Hawkins gave him for the sofa—(the prisoner never paid me for this job, I did it all for nothing)—Mr. Hawkins asked him if there were any other things, and he said there was a chair or two; we went back, and got the large chair, and two small ones—he sold them to Mr. Hawkins, but I was outside—I did not go in—the prisoner then said, "Go and get a drop of beer at the corner of Steven-street, I shall want you again in a short time"—we went, but he did not come, and we went back to the aunt's house, but he was not there—I had left my hat and rope in the aunt's house, and there they are now, I suppose—when we first went to the aunt's house we went into the parlour—we heard a female voice up stairs, and thought it was the aunt; and when he was going to sell the things, he went back to her, as he said, to know if she would take the money—he came back, and said it was too little, but she supposed she must take it—we never received a farthing.</p>

I bought the sofa of the prisoner I believe, but I cannot swear to him—it was a lad about his age—it was brought by him and two men whom I have seen about—I should not have bought it unless those men had been with him—I gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the sofa, an easy chair, and two other chairs—I repaired the sofa, and sold that some time ago for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not recollect whether either of the men said anything—the prisoner appeared to be master in the case, and said he was selling the things for his aunt.</p>

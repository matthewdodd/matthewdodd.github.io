                  </hi>. I reside at 4, Devonshire-cottages, Fulham-road, and am the wife of William Hill. On 25th Feb., about ten minutes before 8 o'clock, I was in Leader-street, Chelsea, with my mother—she bad been into an oil shop, and I had remained outside the door—we were in the act of crossing the road, and had got about three yards across, I was a little in advance of my mother—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was coming along in a furious manner; the driver was very much intoxicated—I bad not time to get my mother out of the way; but I, being more <hi rend="italic">supple</hi> than her, stepped back, or I should have been knocked down—my mother was knocked down, and both wheels of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> passed over her—I left her lying on the ground, ran after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, and desired him to stop—he took no notice; he whipped his horse, and drove on faster—I followed him; he got into Caroline-place, where there is no thoroughfare, and he was obliged to stop—I returned to my mother; she had been picked up, and was insensible—I took her to Dr. Smith's, in Leader-street, and she was taken from there to the hospital in a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a groom, and work at Strachan-place, King's-road. On 25th Feb., about 10 minutes to 8 o'clock in the evening, I was in Leader-street, Chelsea, and saw Mrs. Higginson, and her daughter, Mrs. Hill—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming along, at a tremendous pace, about eleven miles an hour, I should say—the horse was galloping—it passed me about twenty yards, and I heard tremendous screaming; turned, and saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> going on and the deceased lying down in the street—I followed the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, and he was stopped in Caroline-place, which is about 200 yards from where the accident occurred—he got down from the box to let the passengers out—there were three or four females inside, and I then saw he was a little the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital. On the evening of 25th Feb the deceased was brought there—I examined her, and she appeared to be suffering from dislocation of the collar-bone and broken ribs, and was treated accordingly—she continued in the hospital till 2nd March, when she died—the immediate cause of death was bronchitis, inflam<lb></lb>mation of the bronchial tubes—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination; there was a fracture of the collar bone, and the third, fourth, and fifth ribs were broken in two places—I have no doubt that the accident was the cause of the inflam<lb></lb>mation of which she died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say she died of bronchitis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is a very common complaint, especially at this season of the year—a great many persons have died of bronchitis within the last month or so—I connect the inflammation with the accident, because it is a very likely sequence of frac<lb></lb>ture of the ribs and collar-bone—a very slight membrane separates the ribs and collar-bone from the bronchial tubes—bronchitis is frequently produced by some peculiar state of the atmosphere—the deceased bad been subject to bronchitis—she appeared in serious danger when I first saw her—she was very old, and very thin and emaciated, and asthmatical.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, would the bronchitis at that time have issued in death if it had not been for the injury received from the accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; I think her death was accelerated by the injuries.</p>

The prisoner was admitted on the 26th of July, and being sick was in the infirmary: on the 31st of August, we went up stairs to prayers at six o'clock, leaving her and one more person below - when we came down about eight, they were both gone; a closet had been broken open, and the property was gone - I went over a wall to the adjoining premises, where I found a petticoat and a pair of stays; none of the other property has been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know how soon afterwards the prisoner was taken up? A. I believe five or six weeks ago; the other person is not taken - I saw the prisoner's lodging searched, but nothing was found; the woman who was there said the prisoner only came there, having no other place to be in - I cannot say where she was living, but the woman said she had given her leave to be there.</p>

On the 31st of August, we went up to prayers, leaving the prisoner and one other person below; when we came down the closet was broken open, and four bundles gone, containing all the articles stated; they were the property of persons who came into the institution - the closet was locked up that Sunday, but I cannot say when I had seen the articles.</p>

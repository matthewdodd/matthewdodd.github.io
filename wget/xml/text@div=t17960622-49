               <p>I am a foreigner, I have been in this country eleven months; yesterday, about three minutes before one o'clock, I was robbed at the gate of the coffee-house, where the Free Masons come out, before they go into Shoreditch church; I was walking along the foot-path, there were a great many people, as thick as they could be, the prisoner was there, and he snatched at my watch chain, and broke it off close to the ring of the watch; I was going into the coffee-house, I took him by the shoulder, and said, my man, you robbed me; he said, what have I robbed you of, and he let it drop out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was snatched from you, did you see him snatch it? - A. I felt the snatch, and then I saw his hand go with the chain in it, he dropped it, and I picked it up.</p>


               <p>Q. Did he get away from you? - A. Yes; a little way, but I never lost sight of him, I gave the chain to an officer, and he is not come yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure it is the same chain that you have described? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you never lost fight of him? - A. Never.</p>

               <p>I am a Dane, I was in company with the last witness when he was robbed, I saw him seize the prisoner by the coat, and asked him if he wanted to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220067"></xptr>rob him; he said, no; what did you take my chain for then, says Sandestrom. I did not take it from him; I did not see the prisoner drop the chain; but I saw Sandestrom pick it up close by the prisoner; we let him go, and somebody said, we must not let him go, and then a constable had him; he went a little way, and then he was caught again; the chain was given to the constable.</p>

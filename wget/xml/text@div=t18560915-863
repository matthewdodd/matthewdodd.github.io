On 26th Aug., from a quarter to half past 11 o'clock at night, I saw the three prisoners together at the top of Frederick-street, and in Albany-street, at Mr. Catlin's shop window—Ranfield put his arm in at the window, took out the things, and gave them to Evans—John<lb></lb>son was on the opposite side of the way—they all three ran away together round by the church, or walked pretty fast, because they saw me watching them—I saw Mr. Catlin five or ten minutes afterwards.</p>

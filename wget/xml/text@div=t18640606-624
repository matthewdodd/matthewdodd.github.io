                  </hi>. I live at 4, Stewart's-buildings, High Holborn—last Saturday, 14th May, about a quarter-past 10 in the evening, I was at the corner of Crown-street, Oxford-street, with the prisoner and a young man named Donovan—I was not sober—we had been together all day—I and Donovan were fighting, and while doing so, the prisoner stabbed me with a knife twice in my neck, once at the side of the jaw, close by my ear, and once on the back, just under the left shoulder—I saw the knife when I turned round, and tried to catch hold of her, but I could not—I fell, and she got away—I was bleeding and became insensible—I can give no reason why she stabbed me, except that I was fighting with the other man—I don't know whether he was a friend of hers—I did not hear her say anything when the stabbed me—I told Donovan that I was stabbed, and he left off fighting—I saw no more of him till I came out of the hospital—I was in there three days—the stabbing took place in Arthur-street, facing St. Giles's Church—I have now got well of all my wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live at 3, Clark's-buildings, High-street, Bloomsbury, with my mother—on Saturday, 14th May, about 11 at night, I saw the prisoner run up Clark's-buildings, and try to throw a knife over the wall—I am sure it was a knife—she could not throw it high enough, so I picked it up and opened the blade—it was then stained with blood—the prisoner turned back the second time, and she heard the prosecutor coming up with two policemen, and she ran away somewhere towards St. Giles's Church—this is the knife I picked up (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took it to the inspector at the police-station—the blood was quite fresh and wet on it—I am sure the prisoner is the person I saw—she had a light dress on, and a cloak over her head.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the University Hospital—on Saturday, 14th May, between 11 and 12 at night, the prosecutor was brought to the hospital—I found two punctured wounds on the back of the neck; one nearly in the middle line of the neck, about half an inch deep, and one on the right side, and a small cut on the lobe of the ear—next morning, I found a small wound on the shoulder-blade—the wound on the right side at the back of the neck was about an inch or an inch and a-half in depth, extending in a direction downwards, forwards, and to the right—it was bleeding freely; it was of a dangerous nature, and severe—it extended in the direction of some arteries—the wounds might have been caused by such a weapon as this—they are all well now—he was kept in the hospital about three days.</p>

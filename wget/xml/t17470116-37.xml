            . The Prisoner lived with my Uncle; after his Confinement , he sent for me; and when I came to the Goal, he came to me in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160034"></xptr> Yard, crying most bitterly, saying he should never be able to look any Body in the Face: he said he was the Person that had done the Fact.</p>

               <p>Q. What Fact?</p>
               <p>Marymack . That he had taken these Goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else?</p>
               <p>Marymack. He came with an Intent to rob the House; he said he held up both his Hands and said, Good God! how can I do such a Thing? There was nothing forced back, Door nor Shutter; I asked him how it was he got in at the Door, he told me he was backward in the Yard when the Man went to draw some Beer, and he slipped in and went up into the Chamber where no-body lay; I said afterwards to him, I suppose you have sold these Things, or pawned them; he said, no, they should be produced in Court. He has desired I should say what I could of him; he is an active young Man, he is no Swearer nor Drunkard; I don't know that I ever heard him swear an Oath, nor I never heard any thing amiss of him. <rs id="t17470116-37-verdict157" type="verdictDescription">

            . I was in a barn at Bonner's-hall on a Friday morning - I heard something; I went out, and saw the prisoner with two coppers on his back - he threw them down when he saw me, and ran off; I have seen them fitted to two places in the kitchen at Bonner's-hall, and they fit exactly; he was twenty or thirty yards from the house when I saw him - there are gates in front of the house, and they were open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Do you know Kendall? A. I know he lived there - he is gone off; the door was open, but had not been broken.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on Twig Folly-bridge, about four hundred yards from the prosecutor's - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and took the prisoner, who was running; I took him to Bonner's-hall, where the coppers were afterwards fitted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did he not tell you he was engaged to carry the coppers? A. Yes, that some person had the coppers on the ground, and said they would give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070109"></xptr>him 6d. to carry them across the field - nothing in the least suspicious was found on him.</p>

            . I was in the yard at Mr. Ridge's- I heard the cry of Stop thief! I went about twenty yards in front of Mr. Ridge's, and saw two coppers laying in a ditch, about sixty or seventy yards from the place they were fitted to; I took them, and went and fitted them in the places - they fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman asked me to carry them across the field, and he was to give me 6d. for it - he ran away; I was frightened, and threw them down - the gentleman then called Stop thief! and I ran away; there was a man with the person who hired me, who called out Mr. Kendall - he was a tall man, with a blue coat and light breeches.</p>
               <p>MR. RIDGE re-examined. Q. How long had Kendall been away? A. Since about Christmas - I have not seen him since; he had the key in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before these coppers were missed had there been a sale? A.Shortly after Christmas - I do not know whether the house had been empty; the brokers might have gone into it - it was not in my possession; Kendall was a gentlemanly man - he had the use of the fixtures, which had been left by a former tenant.</p>

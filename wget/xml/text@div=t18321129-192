            , a labourer, who lives in Ratcliff-highway. On the 12th of November, between nine and ten o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18321129-192-crimeloc1087">Bluegate-fields</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you not consider the prisoner a friend? A. Yes; I have not been intimate with her husband - I have quarrelled with her about a little money; we did not quarrel in going to her house - my child fell out of my arms when she knocked me down; my husband has 1l. a week - I had been saving up the money to bury a child in the hospital.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY TUOMEY. I am the husband of this witness. The prisoner came and said her husband was kicking up a row with her; my wife went with her, and returned with her face black and bloody, and her gown torn and full of dirt - she said she had been robbed of 15s.; I saw her change a sovereign in the morning, and she paid some to the woman at the next door, who used to give her bread.</p>

             (Police-constable K 262). The witness came to me in a very bad state; I took the prisoner in her room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any confusion or quarrel? A. No; I found nothing on the prisoner, but in a cap on the mantel-piece I found a half-crown, two penny-pieces, and one halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She followed me, and attempted to strike me in my own house; I struck her, and we fought, but I never saw her money. <rs id="t18321129-192-verdict1088" type="verdictDescription">

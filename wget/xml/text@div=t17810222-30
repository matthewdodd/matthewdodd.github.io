While I was sitting in the kitchen I heard a whispering in the parlour; I went up and saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220038"></xptr> prisoner making his escape out of the parlour window. I got up to him before he got out of the window and laid hold of the heel of his shoe; he gave me a shove and said blast you let me go, and he got out at the window. I called out stop thief! and he was taken and brought back in two or three minutes with the hings mentioned in the indictment upon him (repeating them).</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person? - Yes; to the best of my knowledge he is. I had a candle in my hand and looked him full in the face.</p>

               <p>"knows what the thief has got." I looked round and saw the prisoner with a bag under his right arm, and a bonnet in his left hand. I pursued him and just as I was going to lay hold of him, he threw the bundle in my face and turned back and ran down King Edward-street again. I had a full view of his face; I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

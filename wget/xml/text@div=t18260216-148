On the morning of Wednesday, the 1st of February, I came home, and had a large key to open the door, which I did, but previously to that, I observed a light in the shop, through the holes in the window shutters - it looked like a candle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160072"></xptr>moving about; but as soon as I opened the door the light disappeared - I took no notice but went up stairs to bed.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. About half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 1st of February, I saw the prisoner near a pawnbroker's shop in Broad-court, Long-acre - he took something out of his pocket which appeared like silver spoons - he then went to several other pawnbrokers' shops, which were not open, and kept repeatedly looking at the things in his pocket. After I had watched him some time, he got to Mr. Townshend's, in Russell-street - I saw him go in, and, after a little time I followed, and questioned him as to whose property those two spoons were which he was offering to sell- he said his name was King, and they were his own property - he had had them some time; he offered a prayer-book to pawn, which he said was his own, and his name was in it - I searched it, but could find no name - he afterwards said the spoons belonged to his mother, who lived near Hyde-park-corner. I took him into the back room, and found on him two glass salt-cellars, a pair of spectacles, and two silver spoons in his watch-fob, and a pepper glass; I asked him how he came by them - he said he was a poor unfortunate fellow; I again asked where he got them; he said "You know;" I said I did not know; he then said they came from Mrs. Keen's, No. 5, Goldsmith's-street, Gough-square. After he had had a hearing I found the prosecutrix out - I likewise found a phosphorus bottle and some matches on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>COURT to SARAH KEEN. Q. Was the padlock quite gone? A. Yes, and I had left it quite locked I am certain.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How is your shop situated? A. It has a door in the passage - the lodgers have no occasion to go through the shop into the house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner pleaded distress.</p>

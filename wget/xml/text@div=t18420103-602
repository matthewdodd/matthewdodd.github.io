                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live at Hoddesden.

                  </hi>. I live at the Fisher and Eel public-house, opposite the mead at Hoddesdon. On Monday, the 29th of November, I saw the prisoner at the house—I bad not seen him before, but I am sure it was him—he was there between five and six o'clock in the evening—I cannot say what time he came—he asked my master who that mare belonged to with the white face and three white feet, which was over the bridge in the mead—my master said he did not know, except it was Beckwith's—the prisoner said King had sent him down after it, to get it up for him, while he was gone to Harlow fair—when he left our house he went over the bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there room for the dray to pass at the time? A. I consider that there was not sufficient, as it was between a coach-stand and a coal-waggon, which was next to the footpath, and there did not seem sufficient room for the dray to pass between them; the horse of the cab was not injured, but the shaft was broken, I suppose by the shaft of the dray - the dray was drawn by two horses; I thought the deceased was dead, when we were opposite the Bull and Mouth, but the surgeon at the hospital said he was not- I did not see the prisoner till before the inquest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You did not see the beginning of this? A. No, the cry first alarmed me; I only saw one dray - Bates and a butcher helped me to put the deceased into a cab - nobody else assisted; I did not see the prisoner, and do not think that he assisted; I do not swear there was not room to pass between the dray and the coach-stand - there did not appear so to me: I am not accustomed to driving - I did not see

            . I am a patrol, and live in Warwick-lane. I was on duty in Cheapside, on the pavement of the south side, going towards Bow church; I heard somebody scream, and saw the deceased under the wheel of a dray, which I think had four puncheons on it; it was loaded with beer, for I sounded one cask - the off wheel was pressing the deceased along the ground, dragging him along; I could not see the driver - my attention was directed to the man; some man pulled him from the wheel - I came up directly, and the wheel rested on the body, and went back again, not over him; I did not see who drew him from under the wheel - I lifted him up, and took him to the hospital, in his own cab - Hazlewood was so frightened I could scarcely get him to my assistance; I had repeatedly seen the man as a cab-driver; his cab was facing towards St. Paul's - I saw him again between eleven and twelve o'clock, at the hospital, dead; the shaft of the cab was broken on the side that the man had stood with his horse; I took the number of the dray after the deceased was extricated, and then saw a man, whom I believe to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you acquainted with the rules of driving? A. Yes; I was on the south side, the driver's proper place would be on the other side of his leading horse, there was another dray stood before - whe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080100"></xptr>ther that had passed between the waggon and coachstand, I did not see; but it must have passed between them, the cab stood still.</p>
               <p>Q. If the cab horse had jibbed towards the north side, might that not have drawn the shaft towards the dray wheel? A. It might - horses on the rank will shift sometimes, and the space of half an inch will bring them closer - the coal-waggon was going on at the time, and the farther it went on the narrower the road got - I cannot say it was not the prisoner who took the deceased from under the wheel; Hazlewood got there before me: my back was towards the dray - how the accident was caused I cannot say; Goodson the driver of the first dray came up, when I was taking the man up; two or three assisted, I cannot say whether the prisoner was one.</p>

The deceased was brought in between six and seven o'clock in the morning; he appeared to have received a very severe injury, and died almost immediately - several of the ribs of the right side were fractured and driven into the lungs, which were much lacerated; there is not a doubt the accident caused his death.</p>

            . I live in Mercer-alley, Bankside, and am carman to Mr. Elmer, a coal-merchant. I was driving his coal waggon towards the Mansion-house; my waggon was going on at the time of the alarm - it was on the Gutter-lane side; I was at my third horse's head on the foot path side, near the kennel - my wheels were in the kennel; I heard the alarm and stopped my horses immediately; the first thing I saw was their picking the man up - I did not notice whether any body was at the head of the horses of the dray; it had just past between my middle horse and the coach-stand - I did not observe the prisoner at all; when I first saw the cab-man, he was standing at the off side of his horse, on the side nearest to the dray; he and the cab were then quite safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cab the first in the rank, or the middle of it? A. It was first on the rank; my waggon and the dray were going in the same direction - the first dray cleared my waggon, except rubbing a little against the chain as it passed; I cannot say whether it went between the cab and my waggon, for I was on my near side, near the shaft horse's head - I saw the first drayman pass me, he had two horses; I did not see the leading horse of the second dray coming, for hearing the alarm I had just time to pull up my horses - I did not see the horse of the first dray till it was stopped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a good road on the other side of the way? A. Yes; there was nothing passing just at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Would that not have been his wrong side? A. Yes, unless there had been a great deal of room - whether the cab had moved after the first dray passed I cannot tell.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I was in Cheapside, in my cart, following behind the two drays; there was a coal-waggon going on in front; I saw the cab on the stand - one dray passed the coal-waggon, the second followed it, but there was not sufficient room to pass - I saw the cab-man just before the second dray came up, standing with his back towards the dray, with his elbow on the shaft - I did not see the driver of the second dray; he was some yards off, on the pavement; the horses were going by themselves - the waggon was between him and his horses I am certain; I saw the front piece of wood which held the first butt of beer strike the man, who could not recover himself, and he was driven on before the wheel about six yards - it was pressing him on; if the driver had been at his horse's head I think he might have stopped the dray before it got on the man's body; I am sure he was on the pavement at the time; I helped to put the man into the cab - the prisoner came up; I told him he had killed the man - he said he was very sorry for it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you live? A. In Dorset-street: I am a journeyman butcher - I was working for Mr. Wheel in Leadenhall-market, and keep a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080101"></xptr>horse and cart of my own; I saw Sims there - he had the same opportunity of seeing what passed as I; he was in the second or third cab - Bates was on the opposite side of the way, the right-hand from St. Paul's - Hazlewood was on that side, and they could not see; I will swear the prisoner was not at his horse's head till after the accident - I never saw the prisoner before; I was the first who got the deceased from under the wheel - the prisoner did not assist till after he was from under it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you observe there was not room for the second dray to pass?" A. As soon as I saw the man knocked down, and not before; I cannot say whether the wheel of the waggon or the cab were touched - my attention was directed to the man who was standing outside the shaft in front of the wheel; I saw the driver of the first dray- I was there before him; I was the first that laid hold of the man; I was much agitated and jumped from my cart - I did not lose sight of the man till he was under the wheel; it happened within twenty yards of Foster-lane; I did not look for the dray-man - I called out as soon as I saw the accident, and the next cab-man called the dray-man (the prisoner); he answered from the pavement, I believe, but I will not swear that, because I was so far away; I did not observe him till he was called - he was on the pavement, I will swear; for I saw him pass the coal-waggon.</p>

            . I am a cab-driver. My cab was on the stand, about eight feet from Hill's - I was behind Hill; I saw a coal-waggon, and two brewers' drays; the first dray passed without anything happening - I saw the second come up to the cab - I did not see the driver there, but he might have been there, as I was looking at the deceased, who was leaning on his shaft, and was struck by the dray; he went to lay hold of the iron part of the dray, missed it, and fell under the wheel; the dray went on, and the wheel kept pushing him on; a mob gathered, and I saw him taken up - I had spoken to him just before; he did not appear the worse for liquor; he might have had a glass; the dray-men did their best when they saw what was done, to stop their horses, and rescue him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the man leaning on the shaft and projecting out towards the road? A. He was leaning on it just at the step; the dray made a kind of slough towards the pavement, and hit him; a brick, or a hole, might have caused it to slough; the dray-man assisted to put the man into his cab, and in getting him from under the wheel; they stopped the moment they were called to.</p>
               <p>Q. If the man who drove the second dray was by his first horse, could he see the man who was behind that horse? A. I should think not, unless an alarm was given; there was no alarm till afterwards.</p>

I was looking out of the second floor window, down towards the cab, which stood nearly opposite our house - I noticed two drays and a coal-waggon coming along; the waggon was first; the first dray passed between the waggon and the cart very close; the waggon was in motion at the time; the second dray had less room to pass, in consequence of the progress of the coal-waggon - I was rather surprised on seeing the second dray come on, that the cab-man, who was leaning on his shaft, did not move, and as it got very near to the cab; the horse of the cab made a little move, which appeared to awaken the man to his danger; he moved from the dray, rather more towards the south side, which gave the drayman room to pass - I thought he had been asleep; he made a sudden start, turned round towards Bow church, and ran, as it appeared, before the wheel of the dray; after going four or five steps I saw his hands extended, and he fell, after which I saw no more - I could not see where the driver of the second dray was, for I was more intent on the deceased.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your house close to where the accident happened? A. Exactly, so that I had a bird's-eye view of it - I should have thought that the dray made noise enough to awake the man before it got to him; there was plenty of time to have moved; in my judgment, it was pure accident; the man ran into danger certainly.</p>

            . I live in Stacey-street, Seven-dials. I drove the first dray between the coal-waggon and the coach-stand, and passed without difficulty - I was at the head of my horses, and the prisoner was alongside his horses and never went on the pavement - I looked back before the accident, and saw him at his horse's head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As you drove your dray through, did you see his approach? A. Yes; drays follow each other as close as possible - I looked back, to guide my horses, saw the man under the wheel, and stopped; the prisoner got hold of his horse's head, and stopped as quick as possible; he went up and assisted the man.</p>

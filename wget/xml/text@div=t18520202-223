                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On 16th Dec. I was in the bar—the prisoner came in, and I, by my husband's desire, gave him change for a half-crown—my husband gave me a half-crown, I discovered it was bad—the prisoner had just got out at the door—the half-crown was then marked and locked up—I and my husband followed after the prisoner, but he was gone—I was not there on the 26th when he came—I was there when he came on the 30th—he asked for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of gin, and he put down a shilling—I recognised him as the same person who had been there before—he had his thumb over the shilling that he had put down—after I laid the change on the counter the prisoner then took his thumb up, and I took up the shilling—I said, "This is a bad one, and this is not the first time you have uttered bad money here; this night fortnight you was here with a bad half-crown"—he said, "Me?"—I said, "Yes, and you know it"—I am sure he is the man—my husband took the shilling, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

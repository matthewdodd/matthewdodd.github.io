                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Attenborough of the Strand—on 14th November, the prisoner and another man came into the shop—the prisoner said he had just arrived from America, and had been in England fourteen days, that the weather had been so extremely unfavourable, he had not been able to get out much; that he had a niece who was going to India, and he wished to make her a present before she left—I introduced a brilliant bird necklet, which he liked very much, but asked to look at a teapot—I brought from the window a beautiful little silver kettle, which he liked very much; his friend admired it also—they said they should not decide that day—the prisoner said that he should be taking a carriage drive, and most likely his niece would call with him—on Saturday, 16th November, about half-past 4, they both called again, and said they had come to decide about the necklet—in the mean time I had procured a few more to show him—he said that he wished to see no other than the one he had seen before—I took it from the window and placed it on the glass case—he took it up and said, "It is the prettiest thing I ever saw in my life"—he showed it to his friend, who nodded—he then said, "I will take it"—I said, "The price is 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "I am perfectly aware of the price; you have told me once, and I never forget these things; I will take it, and I will pay for it"—he put his hand in his pocket to pay for it—I closed the lid, and was going to pack it—he then said, "By the way, there is the teapot"—I said, "You mean the kettle"—I ordered the porter to go to the window and take it from the window, because I would not leave the necklet—the moment he saw the kettle he said, "That is not the one I saw before, the one I saw before was, a much larger kettle"—I assured him that it was the same, as we had no other so small—he said, "Well, I may be mistaken, I thought it was not the same; could you tell me how much it holds?"—I said, "It is what we should call a three pint kettle"—he said, "Do not you know what it contains; it is necessary I should know what it holds, because I am about to make it a present to a friend of mine, who intends using it for chemical purposes, and it will be perfectly useless unless I know what it contains; if not too much trouble perhaps you will fetch some water and try it"—I hesitated rather, but said to the porter, "Fetch the water, we will fill it—the water was brought, and in the act of pouring it in, the prisoner's friend moved round to his right—the prisoner said, "I thought it was not the size, I must think it over again, we had much better call again"—they both hurriedly went towards the door, and left the shop, which excited my suspicion—I lifted up the necklet case and the necklet was not there—I ran towards the door, turned to a side street, and saw the prisoner running as hard as he could—I shouted "Stop thief!"—he darted into Hungerford-market, turned into a cigar shop, and threw himself into a corner like a ball, so that I had gone in in a hurry I should not have seen him—I had the door closed and accused him immediately of stealing a brilliant bird necklet—he said, "Sir, you are mistaken"—the mob round the door fetched in the police, and I gave him in charge—there were no other customers in the shop, but Mr. and Mrs. Attenborough, and their nephew, passed through—I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

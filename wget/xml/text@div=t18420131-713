                  </hi>. I am a shipping butcher, and live at Wapping-wall—the prisoners have been in my service about eight months. On Monday morning, the 17th of January, between six and seven o'clock, I gave Hodsoll orders to convey several lots of meat and other things in my cart to St. Katherine'8 Dock—I sent him away about eight—he left my house for that purpose—I sent Streeter to the London Dock at the same time with a bag containing vegetables only, which he carried on his shoulder—they had to go the same road to both docks—they went away within a minute or two of each other, Streeter first—I had occasion to</p>

               <p>follow them immediately after, in the same direction, and at the end of the street in which I reside is New Gravel-lane—I had then to turn a corner in the direction they had gone, and immediately I did to I ob<lb></lb>served my horse and cart which Hodsoll had charge of, standing at the door of Streeter's house—Hodsoll was in the cart—it was their proper road—I said to Hodsoll, "Pray what are you waiting here for?" know<lb></lb>ing he had no business to stop there—he appeared very much confused, made no reply, but proceeded—at the same time I saw the bag of vege<lb></lb>tables, which was entrusted to the care of Streeter, standing at Streeter's door—I bad scarcely started Hodsoll away before Streeter came out of his house, and took his bag of vegetables again—he did not see me—I saw under his arm, wrapped in a table-cloth, a piece of my beef—I said, "Pray what have you got there?"—he hesitated to give me an answer—pressing him still further he said, "It is a piece of beef I have got"—I said, "Pray, where did you get it from?"—he said Hodsoll had given it to him, and that it belonged to Hodsoll—I then said, "Pray where did he get it from?"—he said be had purchased it—I said, "From whom?"—he could not tell me—I asked him to allow me to look at it, which he did, and I immediately pronounced it to be my property—it was cut in a very peculiar way, and was given into the charge of Hodsoll on the Saturday evening previous in my shop, for the express purpose of salting it on my premises—it was his particular duty to take charge of any meat intended for salting—he was my foreman—I took the meat from Streeter, and sent him on to his duty, and when he came back I gave them both in custody.</p>

               <p>Park Street—on Monday, 15th December, about 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner find Smith (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>) came in with a female—Smith asked for a pot of half-and-half, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he paid for—Amos treated a woman to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of shrub, which he paid for with two penny pieces—they all went out together—Smith had a white slop under a black coat—Smith and Amos afterwards came in together, and Smith called for a pint of mild and bitter, which was 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him with a measure and two glasses, and they both drank—Smith took a handful of money out of his pocket, and picked out a half-sovereign which he put on the counter—I asked my father for change, and he gave me two florins, four shillings, and four sixpences—I changed one sixpence, and gave Smith the change minus 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I heard Smith say he was going outside—my father said to Amos "Where is your friend? "and he said he had gone outside—my father went out, and Amos followed—my father afterwards came in again with Amos—he was detained—I went for a constable, and he was given into custody—Smith was taken about 11.45.</p>

I am landlord of the Smith's Arms—about 10 o'clock on Monday night 15th December, I saw Amos and Smith at the bar—my son served them, and I saw Smith tender a half-sovereign on the counter—my son brought me the half-sovereign, and I gave him change—as soon as I had the half-sovereign in my hand I went to the light and saw it was bad, and saw Smith going out at the door—I said to Amos "Where is your friend?"—he said "He has gone out to make water"—I went out and saw Smith in a door-way across the road—Amos followed me out, and he waved his hand twice and gave a shrill whistle—Smith then ran away, I ran after him, but could not catch him—I returned again and found Amos standing outside the door—I said "I shall want your name and address, likewise your friend's name and address"—he said he had no friend, he was no friend of his—I sent my son for a policeman and gave him into custody—he was very violent, and said he was no friend of his, and he knew nothing at all about it—he was taken to the station—I marked the half-sovereign, and gave it to the constable—the same night I was with my son near the Blue Pump; we saw Smith there and gave him into custody.</p>

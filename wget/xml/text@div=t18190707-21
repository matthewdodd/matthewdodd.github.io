On the 8th of June, about twelve o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop; Lyon bought a pair of stockings, which came to 1 s. 4 d.; Levy looked at the things but bought nothing - they were together in the shop for about a quarter of an hour; the handkerchiefs were on the counter near to where they stood; when they had bought the stockings they went out. In a few minutes I missed a handkerchief, went into the street, and saw Mrs. Barrett; I went next door to Mr. Whiley's, and he and Barret went after them - I staid in the shop. In a short time they brought them back; Lyon had the eleven handkerchiefs in her lap; she said,</p>
               <p>"There is all I have got of your's." Levy said,</p>
               <p>"I hope you will not prosecute, for I dare say you have got a family of your own." I said if I had I should think it would do them good to have you taken up. The handkerchiefs were the same that were on the counter - I had taken them down to show to the prisoners; they are worth 13 s. 8 d. cost price. I did not miss them while they were in the shop.</p>

            . In consequence of information I went in pursuit, and overtook the prisoners about a quarter of a mile off. I told them to come back with me as some property had been taken from the shop. Lyon said what she had got she had bought - I took them both back; several handkerchiefs and a pair of stockings were found in Lyon's apron; Martin claimed them - they both begged for mercy.</p>

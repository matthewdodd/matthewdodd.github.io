                  </hi>, Jun. The prisoner was in my employ for several months—I gave him into custody on the 4th of Nov., and had him searched—a pencil-case was found on him, a pair of razors and a case, and a plough-iron—they were mine—he said he had had the pencil-case a long time, and afterwards said it was given him by Mrs. Ellis, his former master's wife—the razors he said he bought at Mr. Hawes's, a pawnbroker, next door to the coffee-shop, and the plough-iron he put into his pocket—he had been cleaning it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker's assistant. I sold a dressing-case to the prisoner about the 15th of Oct.—it had a pair of razors in it—these razors produced have writing on the blades, which those in the case had not, and these are too large to go in the case.</p>

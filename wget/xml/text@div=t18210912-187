On the 7th of August, about one o'clock the prisoner came to the shop, and looked at some Irish linen for shirts; he asked how much would make two shirts; I cut him off seven yards and three-quarters of yard of cord for a waistcoat, he then said he had not money enough in his pocket, and if I could send our lad with him, he was going to Covent-garden to meet his father, and would return the money by the lad. I sent the boy with him, and the goods, with orders to bring back the money. I never intended to part with them without it.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. I was sent with the prisoner, I carried the parcel and was not to part with it without the money, he took me the Coach-maker's Arms, public-house, at the corner of Hanover-street, Long-acre. He said his father belonged to the letter carrier, and he expected to meet him there. After waiting three-quarters of an hour, he said he supposed his father had stoped at a public-house in Drury-lane, we went and waited there about an hour; he said as his father was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120098"></xptr>come he would go to his sister's, and get the money, and told me to be sure and be particular in taking care of these parcels of his, particularly the small one, as there was something very valuable in it, and he would take my parcel with him as it would save him the trouble of going back again; he went with the parcel, and after waiting a considerable time I came home with the parcels, and on opening them found they were filled with grass. I never saw him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he say how long you were to wait - A. No. He had ale and porter and pressed me to drink. He asked me for the bundle and I gave it him, as he said something valuable was in his. I expected him to return. I did not ask where his sister lived.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Amelia-road, Spa-road, Bermondsey—I am an extra fireman, employed by different insurance offices—on 16th January, about 2 o'clock in the morning, a fire took place at Rotherithe—in the dis<lb></lb>charge of my duty, I went there to put it out—it was at Levi's bag factory, which is 100 or 200 yards from the fire in question—as I turned from that fire, I had got into Church-street, Rotherhithe, and heard three men talking at the bottom of the street—they were standing in the road—it was about 5 o'clock in the morning—it was dark—there is a wooden fence there about six feet high, with a kind of shed five or six feet from it—I asked the men to give me a lift up, which they did, and when I was on the top of the fence, I saw a small flame in the shed, and some sparks, and a great deal of smoke—I took it for a stable at first, having passed it many mornings from the tunnel, and I thought it was some straw on fire, and called out, "Is there any one there?" or "Who is there?" thinking somebody might be getting a pony out—I had no answer, and jumped down, told the men it was a job, and ran back to the other fire for assistance—I called the atten<lb></lb>tion of the Fire Brigade to it—I returned to the shed with an officer of the Fire Brigade, and more men—the officer went up to the gate, and I heard Crossly call out, "We have got him"—MR. Metcalfe, the engineer of the firemen, wrenched off the lock of the gate with an axe, and admitted us—I then found the prisoner in custody—the dock man called my attention to a piece of tarpauling which he said he pulled on one side, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner through—MR. Metcalfe and the two men went in first, I followed them—the dock man and the prisoner were in there—there was a small portion of fire at the feet of Crossly and the prisoner—there was one fire, but there had been a fire in two places, about six feet apart—the fire which was out, appeared to be recent.</p>

I am dock gateman at the Surrey Docks, and live in Allen-street, Rotherhithe—on the morning of 16th January I was coming from the fire at Rotherithe—in going down Church-street we passed a boat-builder's shed, where I noticed a great smoke—one of my mates, a dock gateman, was with me, and another came up—James Smith then came up—I heard him shout, but heard no answer to it—I was lifted up by one of my mates, and sang out, "Any one alive there"—I waited for a second, and there was no answer—I said, "I can hear some one," and jumped over on top of some casks—I then heard some one say, "Don't make a d—d noise, I will have it out directly"—I felt along till I came to an opening in two tarpaulings—I lifted them up and said, "What, are you going to burn us out altogether?" the prisoner answered, "I suppose it is the sparks from the other fire"—I said, "It is impossible, in the way the wind is, for the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, R</hi>). I am stationed at Botherhithe—on 16th January, at 5 in the morning, Smith called my attention to a fire in Church-street, Rotherhithe—I was then in the neighbourhood of the other fire—I have measured the distance between the two fires, it is 200 yards—the building is a shed, one side composed entirely of wood, and the other of brickwork—it is wood half-way round, length ways—it has a tile roof, and is in the occupation of Messrs. Shattell and Ward, boat-builders—I found the prisoner in Crossly's custody—the building is attached to a stable—there is a stable at one end, and a house at the other—it is about 150 yards from the river—the adjoining house was inhabited—I said, "What right have you here at this hour in the morning?"—he said, "I was just returning from the fire, and the premises where I stand belong to my uncle, Mr. Shattell; I saw smoke issuing from the shed, and came over the fence to put the fire out"—I said, "Are you and your uncle on friendly terms?"—he said, "I believe so"—I said, "Do not you and your uncle have some angry words some time since, and were you not discharged from his employment in consequence?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "In Adam-street, Rotherhithe"—I said, "This is not your way home, you might have gone home in a quarter of the time"—he said, "I sometimes go one way, and sometimes another"—it is very nearly 500 yards out of his way—there was a form about six feet from the side of the shed—the fire was half-way between the form and the wood—the form was immediately over the two fires—a gas-metre is attached to the brick wall, seven or eight feet from the form or more—I asked the prisoner if he had any matches—he produced one match from his pocket, and I found a pipe on him—he did not say that he had used it—I measured the distance between the two fires, it was six feet five inches—I examined the shed to see if there were any apertures, and there was no place through which sparks could have come.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boat-builder in partnership with William Shattell, at 1, Bedford-place, Tower-road, Rotherhithe—he is the prisoner's uncle—the shed is inclosed with pailing half round it, seven feet three inches high; it is our property—there are places where it would not be difficult for a person knowing them to get over—I was the last person in the shed on the Saturday morning at 9 o'clock—the 16th was the Tuesday following—there was nearly three days interval—I looked it up when I left it, and it was quite safe—from information I received, I went to the premises and found two places where there had been fires—it was then 1 o'clock in the day—the roof is tiled—if the wind was that way, it might move the tarpauling which is put against the door to keep the wind out, but if the tarpauling was there sparks from the other fire could not get beyond it—the prisoner worked in the establishment for three years—he was discharged by my brother George six months ago, and he has not worked there since—I have seen him twice since and have spoken to him, once when he came in to take his tools—it was on the Monday after he was discharged on the Satur-day—that is six months ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you had anything done to the tiles since the late fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—that is nearly a twelvemonth ago—it had nothing to do with the fire which took place on 16th—no sparks could drop through the tiles to my knowledge—if the wind blows from the house, nothing can go through—I do not know whether on the former occasion sparks actually got into the shed—my brother is not here—I cannot say whether you told him that you had to throw the fire out as fast as it came through the tiles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On the night in question, about half-past five, I was leaving off work and the foreman asked me if I would mind turning out to take a barge out and bring another barge in. I had my tea, and me and my mate went to another mate's house, we sat there till a quarter-past eleven; the bridge was open, which delayed me a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. I went and did the work; I will not say whether it had gone two at the time I had done it. I saw the reflection of a fire at Lewis's place. After that, as it was close on five o'clock, I would not go to bed or I should not have been up at six. I thought I would take a gentle walk and get a cup of coffee. I saw smoke coming over the prosecutor's pailings, looked through a crack, and walked round to the gate to see if anybody was there. I got over and there was only one fire burning; I got a bit of stick to beat it out, and was doing so when this man came. I said, "Do not trouble me, it will be out presently, "or, "Do not make a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, I shall soon have it out. "I kept on raking the fire by rubbing it over with sawdust, and sent some to the other place, but I ran up and put it out; he said, "Look out, round the fence!" I said, "I do not want to escape. "They asked me what business I had there; I told them it was my uncle's premises. I jumped over to put the fire out; I had no bad intention. What that woman says is false, but it is true we had the ale together.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, 17th Oct., the prisoner and a woman came to my shop and wished to see some low priced boy's cord trowsers—I showed them some, and they selected one pair at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one pair at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which came to 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner gave me eight single shillings, from his pocket, and they went away—they came back in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and brought back the pair at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., keeping the pair at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I returned the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—they bought a cotton handkerchief for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which the woman paid for, and they went away—they came back again in about the same time, and purchased a boy's shirt, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the prisoner gave me half a crown, I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—they came back again in about the same time, and bought a pair of boy's stockings, which came to 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner gave me half a crown, which I put into the till with the other—there was no other half crown there—there was only about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in consequence of something that passed in my own mind I went to the till, examined the two half crowns, and found them bad—I wrapped them in a piece of paper, and put them in my desk—I had never seen the prisoner before, but he came four times—about three weeks afterwards I saw him go past with another man and two women, but I had several customers in the shop—on 12th Dec. I saw him again, and made the charge against him.</p>

I kept the half crowns locked in my desk, wrapped up separate, and kept the key in my pocket—I marked them, and gave them to the policeman—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps a tobacconist's shop, in New Cross Road, Deptford. On Friday, 12th Dec., about half past 8 o'clock, the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco—I served him—he gave me a shilling—I took it to the light, and saw that it was counterfeit—I bent it twice, and told him I wished there was a policeman there, and I would give him in charge—he said, "Do you suppose I would give you a bad shilling when I am in the habit of coming to your shop almost every night?"—he had a good shilling ready in his hand, which he gave me, and I gave him the bad one back—I had never seen him in the shop before.</p>

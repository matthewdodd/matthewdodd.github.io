                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 48, Church-street, in the parish of Stoke Newington—I am superintendent of the Home for the Reception of Fallen Women—the house is ruled by the committee, one of whom is Richard Beynon Williams—the prisoner was an inmate there twelve days—she left on 3d January—on the evening of the 4th the house was shut up and closed, and on the morning of the 5th, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I found the back part of the house open, which had been barred up—I think it had been entered by the kitchen-window, which does not fasten, but which was closed the night previous—I saw a foot-print which, I think, was a woman's, on a table under the window, and the same through a pas<lb></lb>sage,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300071"></xptr>
               <p>and through two rooms into the laundry; from there I found it the whole length of the garden, and across the next garden—the prisoner wears a peculiar-shaped shoe, a short shoe with a high heel, trodden down on one side, so that wherever she trod she left the impression of a misshaped foot—the print was precisely the same—I missed 7 shifts, 7 sheets, 2 bed-gowns, 4 pair of stockings, 3 sheets, 3 shirts, a jacket, and a knitted petticoat—they were worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are six of the chemises.</p>

I am a servant in Holborn—on 5th January the prisoner came to live at our place—she came between 5 and 6 o'clock, and said that she had no money, and left these five chemises with me to pledge—I pledged them in my own name, as she would not tell me hers—I gave her the ticket when I came back—I bought this shirt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of her.</p>

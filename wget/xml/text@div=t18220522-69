            , a milkman in Brazier's-buildings, Sea Coal-lane. The prisoner came on the 22d of April for a penny-worth of milk, she gave me a sixpence - I gave her five pence, and put the sixpence on the shelf; there was no other there. When Joshua came in he took it up, and said it was a bad one. I saw her at Guildhall about a fortnight afterwards. I received no more silver.</p>

            . The last witness is my brother. I took the sixpence off the dairy shelf, and put it in a separate drawer in my desk by itself; as I thought it bad I gave it my wife to take to Mrs. Pithouse. I am sure there was no other money in the drawer. I locked it up.</p>

            . I have seen the prisoner twice, once at our house, and once at Mrs. Pithouse's, About a week before she was apprehended she came to our house for a penny worth of milk and gave me a bad sixpence; I returned it and she put the milk back, and went away directly. My brother came in just after. My husband afterwards gave me a sixpence to take to Mrs. Pithouse; I brought the same sixpence back, and he put it in the drawer, and when she was apprehended I gave it to the constable.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old. I know the prisoner, she came to my mother's shop in Sea Coal-lane several times for different articles - she always paid me sixpences, and I rubbed them on the stone; they always looked like copper; I returned them to her, and she went away - this has happened many times. On the 7th of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, she came for a penny roll, gave me sixpence, and asked for the change, for shew as in a hurry - I took it to my mother who sent for Worrall, who took her. She came twice in one day and offered a sixpence - I wanted to shew it to a young man; she said it was a very good one, and I should shew it to nobody.</p>

            . We live in Sea Coal-lane. I have seen the prisoner several times within the last eight months - she always brought bad money; she at first began with half-crowns, then shillings, and then sixpences - I always tried the money on a stone, and refused it; she went away always without buying. One morning she offered a sixpence for a penny roll, my child refused it. On the 7th of May she came, and my child brought me a had sixpence.</p>

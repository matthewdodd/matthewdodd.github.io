The prisoner came into my house on the 25th of January; she asked me to buy a bunch of turnips; I refused to buy them; she went out and sold them to my next door neighbour. In about half an hour afterwards I met this same woman with a washing tub, a pair of stockings, and a waistcoat under her arm; she came up to me and asked me if I would buy the washing tub; I rather refused buying it at first, knowing I had one of the same size at home; she said if I would buy it, it should be worth my money. She asked me three shillings; thinking she would not take my money, I bid her two shillings for the tub. I brought it home. When I came in door I saw some splashes of whiting, the same as mine had; I looked and missed my tub. Seeing this woman with the stockings and waistcoat under her arm, I went down stairs, and missed the stockings and the waistcoat; I went out and overtook her by Smithfield bars talking to two women. I took hold of her, I told her it was my property that she had on her arm. She gave them up directly; I brought her home with me.</p>
               <p>HENRY BLIGH. I was sent for on the 25th of January. Mrs. Burke gave me charge of the prisoner; the prisoner said she had not taken the stockings and waistcoat.</p>

I was going along St. John street, a woman met me, she gave me the tub, stockings, and waistcoat; I met the prosecutrix, I asked her to buy the tub; she gave me two shillings for it; she came after me, and said they were her stockings and waistcoat; I gave them to her.</p>

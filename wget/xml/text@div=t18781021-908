                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 29th August, about 11 a.m, I was in Upper Thames Street—this plan shows the position of Brooks's Wharf—the gatekeeper stands here, and there is no getting out without passing him again—this is the office on the ground-floor, and the show<lb></lb>room is on the same level; the sampling room is upstairs—I was watching for a man coming there, and saw Sims in Upper Thames Street walking very fast towards the wharf, with this blue bag on his back—I could see that it was not full; I followed behind him, touched it, and it yielded, and I could see from his mode of carrying it that it was very light—it was not distended, it was not wrinkled; a newspaper similar to this could have been put into it—he did not know that I touched it; he went down the wharf, pulled out a paper from his pocket, and went into the office—I waited, and at 11.45 he came out with this' large bag on his shoulder, going as fast as he could up Honey Lane, through Bromley Buildings, into a lane which abuts on Queen Victoria Street and Upper Thames Street—he there put it on a post, and then put it on his shoulder—I followed him to Cornhill, where he hailed an omnibus which would stop at Jubilee Street—I stopped him and said, "What have you got there? where have you brought this from? "—he said, "From my place in Jubilee Street"—I said, "I shall take you in custody for stealing this tea; I am a police-officer"—I took him to the Old Jewry, and found this newspaper in the big bag—this little black bag contained a sample of tea, which would no doubt be at the bottom of the bag and the newspaper at the top, and he had a newspaper in his possession—they were both <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraphs</hi> of 29th August—I left him in charge of Sergeant Green while I went to make inquiries, and then took him to Bow Lane and charged him—I showed him this paper, which I obtained from the wharf, and said, "This is a <hi rend="italic">forgery</hi>"—he said, "I filled it up"—I said, "Did you sign it?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Per procreation"—he said, "Yes, we are allowed to do so in the trade"—he pretended that it was all regular—he gave his address, 11, Jubilee Street—I went there with another officer—there is no shop-front or any indication of the tea trade being carried on, but I found a few invoices,</p>

               <p>which I have here, and this large bag of tea with the sample at the top (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the rooms are two back kitchens, and the tea was in the front one—I found a very large quantity of tea in drawers and cases—when I first saw him he gave his name Frederick Sims, 31, Salmon Lane, Limehouse; that is a mile or more from Jubilee Street—I went there; it is a private house—I found there these two papers in the name of Frederick Sims and Company, and this card—I have never seen the boy Thomas in his company—I received a communication, and saw the boy a week or more afterwards, when Sims had been in custody nine or ten days—I did not suggest to the boy anything that he was to say—he gave evidence against Sims and after<lb></lb>wards against Roberts.</p>

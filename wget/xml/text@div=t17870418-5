               <p>Where do you live? - Just out of Smithfield; on the 15th, the drover went to fetch them from the field, and returned with fifty-two; it is the close or paddock fronting the Small Pox Hospital; I sent my servants to gain every information, and advertised them the next morning, and by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180009"></xptr>hand-bills, as being lost only, offering two guineas if any information should be given, this produced nothing; I then advertised them as stolen, with a reward of twenty pounds on conviction; this brought forward one Jones, who is not here, and on whose information I took the prisoners, in Spitalfields, the 18th or 19th, I am not positive to the day; I saw them afterwards at the Magistrate's.</p>

               <p>Who purchased these sheep? - My brother.</p>
               <p>Where were they purchased? - In Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Your brother delivered them over to the drover? - No, I delivered them to the drover; my brother made the bargain, and bought them.</p>
               <p>How is it you divide the profits of your business? - If my brother buys a hundred sheep, we divide them into two parts; my mother has one fifty, and my brother and me has other fifty; there is no other person concerned in partnership besides my mother and brother.</p>

               <p>Had any thing been said to him to induce him to make this confession? - No, there had not; he told us of eight or nine sheep; I told him if he had any hopes, or thoughts that he could get through without making a confession, for God's sake not to make it; but the man seemed to have a great deal of contrition about him, and I believe that was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If I had said so, would not you necessarily have inferred that if you did make the confession, you would have got through? - No, certainly not; we found skins; I traced the skins to be sold at a skin salesman, in Whitechapel-market.</p>

               <p>What time did you receive them? - About six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Is that a usual time? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon did you kill them? - About half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Is that a proper time? - According as people chuse.</p>
               <p>Should you like now as a butcher to kill them so soon before they were cool? - No, I should not; I was to give two shillings and ten-pence a stone.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is pretty near the mark, within a farthing a pound.</p>
               <p>(Spurgeon deposed to the skins marked with blue chalk and red oker.)</p>
               <p>Where is the mark? - On the rump, the red is on the right cheek; the red chalk mark was on when they came to me; I put on the blue mark when they brought them in, for I did not see any mark upon them.</p>
               <p>If these sheep were to be killed instantly, what was the use of marking them? - We generally do mark them in case of the skins being lost; the others were marked; this is the country mark; there was no particular mark of mine.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the same I saw at the drover's, this is the same mark.</p>
               <p>Court to Spurgeon. Did you see Smith about this shop? - Yes, the day before.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and Smith the day before? - They came and helped to get the place ready to kill them; Smith and Webster were with me before the sheep came.</p>
               <p>Were any of the sheep delivered to Smith? - Seven of them on the Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Were any of these seven delivered to Smith? - None of them.</p>
               <p>Lavender. Smith acknowledged that he assisted in killing the sheep, and that he bought seven, that was before the Magistrate, I heard him; it was not reduced to writing; when he was charged with receiving these sheep, knowing them to be stolen, he said he did not, he bought them fairly, and gave a fair price for them; we went to Smith's lodgings at Westminster, and we found in a necessary part of a skin of one of the five sheep.</p>

               <p>When I first got acquainted with Mr. Spurgeon, he told me if I would bring him any sheep, or calves, or hogs, or dog horses, he would make away with them; then I brought him five, and afterwards nine or ten; says he, send whatever you will, I will get them killed, and I will destroy them the same as if you was here; on the Thursday morning I came there, and found Spurgeon, and this Webster, and Smith, and I was surprized to see Smith, for I knew he did not know any thing of the matter; I went out with Webster, and Spurgeon said he should have the fat for himself; they came to two pound fifteen shillings and three-pence the time before; he paid me only twelve shillings and sixpence; I certainly had the sheep out of the field, which is Mr. Horwood's; I cannot deny it. I have no witnesses.</p>

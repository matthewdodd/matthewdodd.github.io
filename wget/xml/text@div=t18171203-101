I am the unfortunate father of the prisoner. Nothing but the greatest necessity could induce me to come forward to prosecute him. On the 11th of November a stranger came to my house to inquire for a person; he went out, leaving the street - door open-it was about eight o'clock-my daughter went up stairs to fetch something, and found the street - door open; she came down, and said that she suspected that a person was hid in the room behind the bed, as she had seen the curtains move. Two young men, who were in the house, went up, but could find nothing, and concluded that it must have been the wind, as the windows were open. I went all over the house, but could find no person - We were all satisfied, and went to bed. Next morning, about ten o'clock, my daughter went up to the same room for two pieces of poplin and a piece of cotton, and missed them, and two rings from the table. I went up with my wife, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. I suspected my son, and got an officer to look for him, but could not find him. We got information, and went to a room between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and found him in bed with another young man in a room - We charged him with the robbery, and desired him to get up. Hackham, the officer, found two duplicates in the room, one of which related to the pearl necklace, and the other to the eight yards of poplin.</p>

On the 12th of November, the prisoner came to our house, and brought a pearl necklace, a pair of bracelets, a pair of ear-rings, and three broaches, which he pledged for 3l. I asked him if they were his own? he said, they belonged to a person whom he knew very well - He said they belonged to Mr. George Lyons, of Cutler-street. I asked him why he did not bring the case with them? he said it was broken, and they would not be left above a day or two with us, and would not hurt. Next morning a person came and claimed them. I am quite certain the prisoner is the person.</p>

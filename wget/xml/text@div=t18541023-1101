               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230030"></xptr>
               <p>I went with their foreman to the wharf, on 20th May, and saw Maltby, but did not obtain the goods—I reported to Mr. Laing the reasons that Maltby stated for not giving up the goods—on that occasion I demanded to be shown the goods—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) correctly represents the premises; the part coloured red are warehouses or sheds, in the occupation of Mr. Maltby, and the dwelling house adjoins it—there are two ranges of ware-houses on each side of the wharf, which are coloured yellow; the goods were in one of these warehouses, painted yellow, of Messrs. Grove and Sons—I took in a list of goods of which we had warrants; I inquired for the goods which came by the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi>, and Maltby showed me into Grove's warehouse, and showed me some goods—I did not know at that time that it was Grove's warehouse, and not Maltby's; Maltby told me that all the goods in that warehouse were under his charge—I offered to pay the rent, and offered him Bank notes, which he refused to take—I made repeated appli<lb></lb>cations, unsuccessfully, for the delivery of those goods.</p>

Groves had warehouses on each side of Hagan's wharf—Maltby had the control over the goods in the lower floor of that warehouse where he showed me the goods; there was spelter there, and tin also—the spelter was not subsequently parted with; we have it now—I am quite sure that the spelter pointed out is not what we have our<lb></lb>selves sold since—there was 1,000 tons of spelter on the lower floor, but none on the wharf.</p>

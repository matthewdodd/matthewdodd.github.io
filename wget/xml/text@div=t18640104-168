                  </hi>. I manage the Red Lion, St. George's-in-the-East—Mary Blinkhorn is the landlady—on the 14th December, about 9 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and asked for half a pint of beer, which is a penny, and gave me a sixpence—I put it in my mouth, but could not discover it was bad at first—it had been worn so—I afterwards found, by rubbing it on a stone, that it was brass—I gave the prisoner fivepence change before I found it was bad—I did not pass it out of my hand—he ran away, and I followed him, but could not find him—I kept the sixpence by itself—two days afterwards I was sent for to the bar, and saw the prisoner again—the landlady gave me another bad sixpence, and told me that the prisoner had given it to her for half a pint of beer—he said, "Yes, I did; I am out of work; I knew it was bad."</p>

                  </hi> I am landlady of the Red Lion—I remember the prisoner coming to my house on 16th December, between 1 and 2 o'clock—he called for half a pint of beer, and threw sixpence on the counter—I took it in my hand, and said, "This is the same kind of sixpence you passed on Monday evening"—it was a bad one—he said he was never in the house before—I told him he was—I could swear to him—I took particular notice of him from where I sat at the bar—I then sent for the last witness, and gave the sixpence to him—he compared it with the other; they were both alike—I asked the prisoner if he had any more coin about him—he said he had not; he had been out of work, and he said he did not know that it was bad—he afterwards said that he knew one was bad; the one he gave me—he said he had been out of work, and he knew that was bad—I had seen him on the 14th—I am quite sure he is the same man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Mint—these coins are both bad, and from the same die—they are common medals which are sold about the streets for whist-markers—the reverse side is rubbed off, and then both sides silvered over—they grind off what is unsuitable—these resemble, or are apparently intended to resemble, the current silver coin of the realm called sixpences.</p>

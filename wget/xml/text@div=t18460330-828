                  </hi>, I am the wife of Sir William Coles Medlycott, Bart., and reside at Venn-house, Milbourn Port. On the 21st of Feb. last Sir William was in London—I addressed a letter to him, and enclosed in it three advertisements, two invoices, an elastic strap and buckle, and two bills—the strap was enclosed in the cover—I sealed the envelope,</p>

               <p>and addressed it to Sir William Medlycott, or Sir W. C. Medlycott, Cox's Hotel, Jermyn-street, St. James's, London—I put the letter myself into a letter-box, in my own hall, on the evening of that day—this is the envelope of the letter I so addressed (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—these are two of the advertisements—one is gone—these are the bills, and this is the elastic strap, and this is the cover in which it was enclosed separately—my letter to Sir William is also here—with the exception of one advertisement, all is here that I enclosed on that day.</p>

In Feb. last I was in the service of Sir William Med<lb></lb>lycott, as footman—on Sunday afternoon, the 22nd of Feb., I took the key of the letter-box to the pantry, unlocked the letter-box, and took out five letters—among others, one in the handwriting of her ladyship, addressed to Sir William—this is the one (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I put them into the letter-bag, locked the letter-box, and took the key to the pantry, and then went with them to the post-office at Milbourn Port.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer, stationed at the General Post-office—on Monday, the 23rd of Feb., I was directed to take my place near where the water-closets are, in the Post-office—there is a row of these water-closets against a wall, without any doors, separated from each other by a small partition, but the front is open—facing the water-closets there is a wall—in that wall there is a circular of, I should say, a foot and a half wide, covered with a small wire—that would enable a person on the other side of that wall to have a view of the water-closets—there is a gas-light in front of the water-closets, throwing a light into the whole of the water-closets, so that any one can see—they are open at the top as well as in front, so that the light is thrown on them—I was stationed behind the gratings—I observed the prisoner come there about seven o'clock in the morning—he remained there a short time, and then left—he returned again about half-past nine o'clock, and went into the farther water-closet—I had a view of that—he undid his dress, and sat on the seat—after he had done that, I saw him take a letter, with his right hand, from his left hand inside coat-pocket, and bring it in front of him—there were footsteps approaching, and the prisoner replaced it again—all was silent, and he brought it out again a second time—he then took his right</p>

               <p>hand, with the letter, and brought it to his left side, and from the motion of his arm and hand, I was induced to suppose he was breaking the letter open—his hands were working about—he then brought the cover of a letter behind him, and dropped it down the seat—on observing that, I left mf posi<lb></lb>tion, and went round to where he was sitting—I was perhaps a minute, or not so long, in doing that—the moment I entered, he put his right hand to his left hand pocket—I seized his arm, and asked what he had got there—he said, "I don't know; money, I think—I have just picked it up, and intend taking it to the inspector"—I then put my hand into his left hand pocket, and took out this packet—at the same time I placed my knee on the seat, to pre<lb></lb>vent it from rising—on the seat rising, the water will flow, and carry every<lb></lb>thing away—I also prevented the prisoner from rising—I took these two bills and the elastic strap out of the same pocket, and then sent for the plumber—I detained him there till the plumber came, and then told the plumber to search the seat, and took the paper and cover he found there—I saw him take this cover from the pan—I told him to take all papers, mark them, and bring them to me—he marked this cover and these three parts of letters, which he gave to me—I saw this cover taken from the seat.</p>

             sworn. Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar. - A. Yes, I remember them coming into my brother's shop; after they had been there I missed a piece of silk handkerchiefs, that had been shewed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they leave the shop. - A. Yes, Eastmead went out first, the prisoner Holmes stopped a few minutes afterwards; I missed it when Holmes was going out, we pursued Holmes and brought him back; Eastmead was not taken till the following morning.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Thomas Coates.) Did you search him. - A. No, I did not suppose that he had the goods, as the other went out first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you question the prisoners about it. - A. They both denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of handkerchiefs were they. - A. Belcher handkerchiefs; I am positive they must have taken them, we examined the wrapper at the moment we missed them; Eastmead's lodgings was searched, but nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Holmes's Defence. I went into the shop with my comrade, he wanted to buy a handkerchief or two, he asked me to pass my opinion upon them, and the only piece of handkerchiefs that I touched was a chocolate colour; I told him it was the best colour I thought; I did not see any Belcher handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Eastmead's Defence. I went along with my comrade for a handkerchief, there was some handkerchiefs shewn us, but none of them were Belcher's, they were chocolate ones, I did not approve of them, I went out; I did not know but he was coming after me.</p>
               <p>Holmes called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

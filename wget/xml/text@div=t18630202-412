                  </hi>. I reside at Warwick-terrace, Pimlico, and am solicitor to the Conservative Land Society, Norfolk-street, Strand—at about half-past 5 o'clock, on the 19th of January, I was walking up Holborn, on my way home—I bad my watch at the time—I wore it with an Albert chain, and fastened with a swivel inside my waistcoat pocket hole when I reached Weston's music-hall, some six or eight men intercepted me in my way, and one of them, the prisoner Reilley, seized my watch—he was not successful in getting it on the first attempt—another party called out to him, "Poll it; pull it," at which time I was confined by the arms at the back—I could not say whether by more than one—at the second attempt, Reilley got the watch—he did not make a second snatch—he never loosened his hold until he got the watch—he obtained it by wrenching the ring and straining the swivel, which was attached to my waistcoat pocket—the watch was given me afterwards without the ring—he ran away, and I ran after him—my arms were loosened as soon as he got the watch—he did not call out, but ran away at once—I ran after him, calling out as loudly as I could, "Stop thief! stop thief!" and I saw him until he was given into custody—I never lost sight of him—I did not see the other man doing anything, at that time—there was a scuffle among a crowd of 200 or 300 people—Pigott had stopped Reilley when I got up—that was a quarter of an hour or twenty</p>

               <p>minutes before the policeman name up, and all the time the crowd was increasing—after a few minutes I saw Jenkins assaulting Pigott—we went to the station with Reilley, he being the only one in custody—a little boy of about ten or eleven years of age, came up to me with my watch—I gave a description of Jenkins to the police—I saw him a few days after—I at once recognised him as being the man who was assaulting Pigott when he had Reilley in custody—I swear positively that Reilley took the watch—he was some little time before me in making the attempt—the watch is worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without the ring.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Nutford-place, Edgeware-road, and am a carpenter—at about half-past 5, on the evening of Monday, the 19th of January, I was walking op Hoi born—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner Reilley run away—I directly turned off the pavement to run after him—I saw a young man put his foot out and throw Reilley over on the ground—I directly caught hold of him by the collar, while he was in a stooping position attempting to get up—Jenkins came up to him and stooped down—Reilley attempted to hand the watch, and Jenkins got the watch—I could not say where he ran up; he was there—directly he handed the watch, I took hold of Jenkins—I took him with my left arm—I allowed him to get up, and got his head under my arm—I then took hold of him by the collar, and handed him to some one that came up, saying, "This man has got the watch"—he said, "Let me go, I have done nothing"—I walked on a few paces, thinking I might see a policeman, and shortly after Jenkins name up and took hold of Reilley by the collar, and said, "Let him go, and I will take him to the station-house"—I said, "Oh, you are one of the same party"—he began directly to hustle me, and both the prisoners set to kicking me; then Jenkins hit me on the head—I told him I should not let him go, but would hold him until a policeman came—he said, "I will smash your head, if you do not let me go," at the same time he took hold of me, putting his knuckles in this way, (describing it) and had not the button given way he certainly would have strangled me—I tried to get the prisoners into a shop, thinking I could manage with them better then, but there were so many round they pulled me, and I could not succeed in getting the prisoners there at all—shortly afterwards the constable came up—Jenkins got away somehow—I did not again see him until some days afterwards—I am quite sure he is the man—I am equally sure that Reilley was the other, and that I saw him parsing the watch to Jenkins.</p>

               <p>position—the watch was banded to Jenkins—during that time I had got Reilley by the collar—there was no attempt made to escape at that time; he was attempting to get up from the ground—I was kicked by Reilley—I am quite sure of that—he kicked me on the knee and the leg, and so did the other one as well—I had marks there where they kicked me, but they are healed up now.</p>

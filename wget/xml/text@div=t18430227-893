                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square. The prisoner was in my service upwards of two years—on the Ist of March I spoke to him, in consequence of suspicion, and taxed him with having a watch—his mother was present—(I did not say he had better tell the truth)—he said, "Yes, sir, I have the watch"—I said, "Where is it?"—he said, "I gave it my brother to pledge for me"—I asked where—he said he did not know—I said, "Richard, where did you get that watch from?"—in a few moments he said, "I have been doing very wrong, sir, I took it from your window"—I then gave him into custody—his brother brought the watch to me next morning—this now produced is it.</p>

On the 9th of October, about one o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by the noise or footsteps of some man; I immediately got out of bed and went to the window, and I saw the prisoner trying to look in the window where I lay; I immediately opened the door and went and caught him by the collar; I asked him what he wanted, and how he came there, and how he could think of getting over a wall of that heigth; he said he wanted a place to lay down. I asked him how long he had been on the premises, he said, about twenty minutes or half an hour, My fellow-servant got up, and we took him into the lodge. We looked about the premises, there are a great many things deposited in the area of the kitchen; we found a copper saucepan, and an iron pot taken from there and put into the gravel walk; a shovel was brought from the piggery and set against the front gates; he had opened the straw-house, and left the doors wide open, and the hogs got in; and the windows of the lower part of the house had been throwed up, but being so strongly barred no person could make any entrance. We then took him to the watchhouse. The pots not being taken off the premises we did not think it would be wanted.</p>

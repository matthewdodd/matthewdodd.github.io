                  </hi>. I live at 28, Port pool-lane—on 26th December, I was at the Golden Anchor, Great Saffron-hill—when I went in, I saw a man wounded, and took him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I then returned to the Golden Anchor, and stayed there a few minutes—I was called outside as there was a bit of a disturbance—I saw the prisoner running away—I ran after him and laid hold of him—he turned round and stabbed me on the head—I was just falling, but a young chap caught me in his arms—I bled very much—the cut was a little over an inch long, and was such a wound as knife would make—he struck at me two or three times, and struck me once—I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brass-finisher, of 29, Portpool-lane—on 26th December, I was in the Golden Anchor—I heard a disturbance, went out, and saw the prisoner and Davis running towards the corner of Kirby-street, where I saw the prisoner raise his hand with something in it, I could not perceive what, and struck Davis on the head—Davis said, I am stabbed," and fell Lack into my arms—I took him to the hospital—I looked at the place; it was a clean cut, such as this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would do—it could not be done by a file.</p>

On the night of 26th December, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was on Great Saffron-hill in plain clothes—I saw four men run out of the Golden Anchor in the direction of Cross-street—I saw Davis stop the prisoner, who made three blows at him—Davis said, "Stop him; he has stabbed me"—the prisoner ran up Cross-street—I ran after him and took him, brought him to the station, searched him, and found this knife in his trousers'-pocket with three hairs, which look like hair from a man's head, sticking on it, and three red spots apparently of blood on the blade.</p>

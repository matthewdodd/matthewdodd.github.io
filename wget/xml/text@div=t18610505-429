                  </hi>. I am a miller and baker, residing at Three Coltlane, Bishopsgate—the prisoner carries on the same sort of trade—he is my wife's sister's husband—I had, for some two months before, joint dealings with him in business—we were together three weeks—the amount of profits were not sufficient and he left me—he did not tell me he was going to leave—on 22d April, about 8 in the evening, he came to my house—he said he had come there to obtain satisfaction from me—I asked him for what, and he said he could settle with me outside—we were then standing at the street-door—I asked him inside, and he came in—he then began to abuse me in a most shameful manner; said I had taken his trade away, and swore at me a great deal—I said it was false, and whatever he might have heard it was untrue, I did no such thing, and if he could bring any one forward, to do so—he continued to abuse me—I told him it was no use going on in that way before the children, if he had no more to say the interview was at an end—with that I got up and walked to the street-door—he followed me, and began to abuse me again outside—while he was doing so a friend went by, and I</p>

               <p>ran to him to speak to him about selling a horse—I returned, and the wind had blown the street-door to—the prisoner was still standing at the door—I was in the act of putting up my hand to knock at the door and he said, "Take that," and put a pistol to my ear—I caught sight of it and dropped my hand from the knocker and knocked it down—I jumped from the step (there is one step at the street-door), and made a grab at the pistol—he raised it again and knocked my hat off—I was so flurried that I ran away—I made no further effort to get possession of the pistol—when he raised the pistol at me again I ran behind two men, and my daughter came out at the time—he raised the pistol in the direction of me, and I ran behind the two men and asked them to protect me as the man was trying to shoot me—in raising it he pointed in the direction I ran—he was, perhaps, as far as I am from you at the time—I saw my daughter lay hold of him, and I ran round the next street—I did not see him again till he was in custody of the police, about three or four minutes afterwards—I did not see the state of the pistol or hear anything connected with it till I got to the station.</p>

I am the daughter of the last witness—on the evening of 22d April I was standing at the door of the house when my father and the prisoner were there—I saw the prisoner put the pistol up to my father's head, and my father knocked it down—the prisoner put it up a second time and knocked his hat off—I did not hear the prisoner say anything—when he put up the pistol the second time my father ran away, and the prisoner crossed over to his barrow (he had a barrow there)—I did not see what he did with the pistol—he took up his barrow and walked round two or three streets—I followed him till we came to a policeman and then gave him in charge.</p>

April, the last witness gave me some information and pointed out the prisoner to me, in consequence of which I took him into custody, searched him, and found the pistol in his left hand trousers-pocket—I took him to the station and there examined the pistol—the charge was drawn in my presence—I saw that it was loaded with powder and shot, and a cap on it—there was rather a full charge of powder and about twenty shot—I found some more shot and caps on him—those caps and shot will fit the pistol—it was cocked when I gave it to the inspector at the station—he took the cap off it—it was un cocked when I found it on the prisoner—he denied doing the deed—he said he wished it had proved fatal.</p>

When I came to my brother-in-law's we had a few words about taking my connexion away, which, I believe, some shopkeepers here can prove.

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Ashley Place, Stepney, and am fore<lb></lb>man to a builder—on Saturday, the 12th of January, between eleven and twelve in the morning, I was lighting my pipe near the Tower Hamlets Cemetery, Bow; West and Waterhouse asked me for some money—I am quite sure they are the two—I said, "I have not got a farthing in my pocket now, but I shall have some when I receive my money, about half-past two or three, and I shall be back by this road, and will give you some"—Stokes was there—after that I went away—about half-past three I received my money, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in gold and silver, and put it into my left<lb></lb>hand trousers pocket—I went the same road back, and when I came to the place where the women first accosted me I found them there again with the three male prisoners—I am positive they are the men—I could see them as I was walking up to them—they were close together, stooping down round a fire made on the ground under one of the arches—Waterhouse came out of the arch, held out her hand, and asked me if I would give her some halfpence—I put my hand in my left-hand trousers pocket, pulled out a shilling, and gave it to her—I turned to walk away, and was struck from behind on the left side of the head with something hard, which cut my head open, and caused me to stagger and reel against the cemetery wall—three men then appeared in front of me, and rifled my pockets—Butcher and Bowdey are two of them—Stokes did not put his hand into my pockets, or do anything—they were all there at the time—I had my back to the wall—they all ran away, and when I recovered myself I tried to pursue them, but could not discover them—I returned back and saw West, who I im<lb></lb>mediately seized, and said, "You have been the instigation of me being knocked down and robbed of all my money"—she made no reply—I con<lb></lb>veyed her to the station, and gave her in custody—I gave information at the station, and me and Howlett went in search of the other prisoners—we found Stokes at his house, and he was there given in charge—we found the others in the artillery barracks at Woolwich—they were placid in a</p>

            . The prisoner came up to me, and said he was to meet a gentleman there at eleven o'clock, to examine the pipes in the kitchen, as he was going to have tin pipes put instead of leaden ones. He stopped a few minutes, and then went down. I followed him to light him out, but he turned back at the bottom of the stairs, and pulling a piece of cord out, said he would take the dimensions of the pipes, and give the gentleman an answer when he called; I let him go into the kitchen alone. Franklin called to me in about five minutes, to know if I had let the man out; I said No. I went down to the kitchen and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170022"></xptr>found he had pulled the leaden pipe out of the sink, and laid it on the window, and had a small piece of it in his hand; he said</p>
               <p>"This is what I want, for I must have something to make the tin pipe the same size, and must take it and the brass top to fit it." He went away with the pipe. He had pulled it away from the sink. I thought it not right to let him go without orders, and I asked him who authorized him to come and take it away. He said</p>
               <p>"The gentleman who has taken the house." I said</p>
               <p>"No gentleman has taken the house." He said</p>
               <p>"If you don't want me to have it, here it is for you." I said</p>
               <p>"I think we will have you along with it," and seized him. He threw himself on his knees, and begged for mercy, and said he was distressed, and had not eaten for two or three days. I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed - A. A quarter past twelve. On the 19th of October, I made the doors and windows fast. I was alarmed at a quarter before one, by the wrenching a small folding door under my shop window, these folding doors lead into the shop. I got out of bed and went to the shop door, in the mean while they took the second wrench, which made a great noise, they then staid five or ten minutes, in the mean while I unfastened the shop door, they returned again, one said to the other put your crow in here; I went to open the door at the time, I found that I had got a wire fixed to the shop door, which led to two bells, I could not open the door to get out, nor I could not shut the door without making a noise, in the mean while they broke the door open; one said to the other, there is somebody coming this side of the way; they went away for about five minutes, in the mean while I shifted the wire at the door, they came again, they immediately put their hands inside of the door, which they had broken open; they moved something in the inside which rang a bell, one said to the other, d - n it, there is a bell! They immediately went away, they were gone for fifteen or twenty minutes, they came again and walked several times past the door, they found no noise nor light, nor any thing stirring; they came and pushed against the private door of the house, the contrary side to which they had broken open, at last, they gave the door which they had broken open, a pat with the hand; one of them stepped back again, and began at the door again. I immediately went out, and he was bent down to the door with his hands on the door, and his back towards me, I had a watchman's rattle in one hand and an iron bar in the other; I sprang the rattle; I could have knocked him down, I did not like to do it. When I sprang the rattle he run away, I ran after him and kept very near him; he ran over the way to Whitecross-street, and ran round a man who was standing there, several times; he said to this man, whom he dogged round several times, give that man a d - nd good thump of the head, that was me; he dogged round the man once or twice afterwards, and I kept on springing my rattle; presently a watchman came up and catched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lost sight of him - A. No. I could have hit him several times with the iron that I had in my hand, and I could have catched him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done to your shop - A. They broke it open but took nothing away.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was stooping in the way that you have described, what was he doing - A. He had got his hand on the top of the doors, the door opens on the outside, he must have removed something to have rung the bell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I would wish to know whether at the examination, he did not state there were two bolts - A. I stated at the examination, that the bolt must have been broken open, and the other bolt must have been pulled up, there were no holes in the shutters, nor in the doors; the lamp lighter came by at the time, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310050"></xptr>could see the door stand open five or six inches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You stated at the examination, that the bottom bolt was down, the top part of the door was open - A. The bottom bolt was forced up, there were six places in the door where a crow had been put in; and an iron crow had been put in near the bottom bolt; they first of all put a crow in to the top bolt, and broke the top bolt off.</p>

I saw he had an iron bar in his hand, I immediately ran away; I saw a man in White-cross-street, and when he attempted to hit me, I said, see, he wants to hit me.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house in Field-lane. On the 12th of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came there to go to bed—she brought a man with her, who, she said, was her husband—after some time, she wanted to go—I said she could go if she took her husband with her—she said, "Never mind"—she staid down stairs for some time, and then went up again—between seven and eight o'clock the next morning, I heard a noise, I got up, and missed two shirts from my shop—I went up stairs, and the prisoner was gone, and the man was left—he looked about, and missed his smock-frock—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner at her lodging in Shire-lane—I have unfortunately been twice in Newgate—once I was in with my father, but I was acquitted.</p>

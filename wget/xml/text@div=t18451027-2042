I went on board a little after seven o'clock on the morning of the 8th of June—the door of the companion had been fastened with lashing and bolts—the lashing had been cut, and the bolts wrenched—the captain's berth was open, and the door-post had been cut with some instrument—the Venetian blinds had been partly cut, sufficient to admit a man, and the clothes were all lying about—I missed my coat and jacket—I found a bottle with brandy in it on the table, a tumbler, and wine-glass—this is my coat and jacket that I lost that night—I know this jacket by this patch put on it, and this is my pilot-coat—they were on the pillow in my berth on the night of the 7th, and were gone on the 8th.</p>

Leake, because we should let him have short lengths—I thought that would suit him better in a small shop—I knew he was with Bergero before he began business, but I do not know how long—Bergers has been in the same line of business for 50 years, and is highly respectable, and go is Kirby, so far as I know up to this time—I know he dealt with Outram's, a highly respectable City warehouse, and referred them to us as a reference—I had not told him to refer them to us, but I suggested that he should give us as a reference to any one he went to buy goods of, as he had told us his capital and explained his affairs, and they seemed satisfactory, and we were the parties to refer to—he told us he gave 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the business and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the leape of the premises at 626, Mile End Road, and had given notice to withdraw 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from an insurance office—he did not say he had insured in an office in King William Street, and hoped if the securities were satisfac<lb></lb>factory to get an advance of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from them—I have it written down—he did not tell me the name of the office, and I did not ask him.</p>

On 13th August I saw Mr. Briton at my place—he was in conversation with Mr. Poole when I arrived—Briton produced this document and said "I have called to save you from further trouble and expense in Kirby's matter; I am the holder of the bill of sale which is executed to me for moneys I have advanced to him"—I said "Were the moneys recently advanced, or when was the consideration given?"—he said "A portion of it is recent and a portion of an anterior date"—I said "Are you a relative of Kirby's?"—he said "I am"—I said "What relative?"—he said "Uncle by marriage"—I said "Well, we shall have to inquire into this matter, and I do not think you will find it will end here"—I had no personal knowledge except from my manager, Mr. Poole, as to the sale of the goods and the amount due—I instructed my solicitors to bring an action against Kirby for the recovery of the amount due to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Poole was present I believe during the whole of the conversation with Briton—I do not recollect asking Briton to secure my debt, but I may have done so—he said if we would grant Kirby further time he would come to the rescue, and no doubt matters would be all right—I had never seen Briton before—he looked a respectable man—I will not swear I did not then say "Well, will you secure this debt?"—I do not think he mentioned any particular sum—I cannot speak positively, or whether he said he had advanced him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as early as 1874—I do not think it was mentioned—I only asked him a question to see whether there had been a moving consideration for the bill of sale—I think Mrs. Brierley's name was mentioned, but not the amount she had advanced—I did not say, "Now we must have our money, 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it was barred by the bill of sale—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200071"></xptr>
               <p>he said "If you will give Kirby a little time I have no doubt matters will be all right"—I said "Well, there has been too much shuttling already; we cannot consent to farther delay"—I did not know the amount alto<lb></lb>gether of the goods he had had—I did not say "If he does not pay I will prosecute him for getting goods under false pretences"—I did not know I had the power to prosecute him—I do not remember Poole saying that, and I gave him no instructions, because I did not know the interview was going to take place—I was dtiled down from another part of the ware-house—I approve of the prosecution, or I would not have instituted it, and did not expect to get the money quicker by taking these steps, and did not in consultation with Mr. Poole beforehand suggest putting the screw on—if Mr. Briton had discharged the debt, and our judgment had been satisfied, I should have been satisfied—I only wanted to be paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My principal has been paid under an interpleader summons—Mr. Briton was going to contend his bill of sale was good as against us, but has since withdrawn, and offered to pay costs of summons and attendance of witnesses—I have not received anything out of it from Mr. Briton—I told him Kirby had promised me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. transaction from Bryan and Co. 12 months ago—Kirby did not say he was very anxious not to be made a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I levied execution on behalf of my principal—Briton made a claim under a bill of sale, and the Sheriff issued an interpleader summons—Mr. Briton came to us on the Monday before the summons was returnable, and said he should withdraw, and gave notice immediately to the Court.</p>

               <p>Brierley and a Mr. Hayward for their debts—I said in Mrs. Brierley's presence that I was not satisfied with that, and unless I got some security for my demand I should make Kirby a bankrupt—it was afterwards proposed that Mrs. Brierley should join in the bill of sale, and that I should act for her as her trustee—I had advanced to him at various times for the purchase of pictures, and various matters on account 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was settled by his giving me a bill of exchange for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is drawn by me. and accepted by Kirby, and dated 28th October, 1874—I advanced the 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because he said he had an opportunity of buying some pictures, one of them by an old master—he bought that picture, and said he expected to sell it for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and would then pay me back my money—that acceptance is in his handwriting—I advanced the money in various sums of from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the bill of sale was given in settlement—on 12th February, 1878, I advanced him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) payable to bearer, and it was paid on 15th February—he endorsed it at my request as an acknowledgment that he had received the money—the cheque passed through my bank, and is credited in my banker's pats-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the next item is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., March 9th, 1878 (<hi rend="italic">cheque produced</hi>)—that also appears in the banker's pass-book, and is endorsed by Kirby—the cheque of 25th March, 1878, J.

               <p>"Then I will give you till next Saturday," which would be the 16th—this was Wednesday the 13th—Mr. May came in while I was talking to Police-court—I know nohting of their proceedings at judge chambers—I since ascertained there was another action, Adams v Kirby—the Sheriff went in at the suit of a creditor, and I gave notice of my claim under the bill of sale—the Sheriff then interpleaded, and I was summoned, and attended on the interpleader, and was required to find security for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to try an interpleader at the next term—I found it impossible to find security by reason of the proceedings taken by Venables, and Moseley's evidence that the cheques were given by Kirby in my favour—the Magistrate committed the case for trial on the ground that if Moseley's testimony were correct there was strong evidence of intention to defraud—there is no truth in Moseley's statement that the cheques were Kirby's, or that these were fictitious transactions—I produced these cheques in Court, and I never had cheques of Kirby—I swear all this money was advanced, and is now unpaid.</p>

               <p>bankrupt; I thought I would do it myself, and I said, "As I am the largest creditor, I shall certainly do so"—it was then proposed jointly that Mrs. Brierley should join with me in the bill of sale, and that I should act as her trustee—I did not know of any pressure by other creditors, and immediately I heard about Venables I called upon him—I heard about Venables the day after the bill of sale was registered—I had not been requested to call, but I did so to give them notice that I held the bill of sale, and to save the annoyance of having an execution on the premises, and of my having to contest the bill of sale, and also to save them the expense of going on uselessly with the proceedings—they put in an execution, and I claimed the goods under the bill of sale—the Sheriff issued an interpleader summons, and I paid the money under protest, but abandoned it afterwards as it was a small amount, because I knew if I contested it the execution creditor would try to upset the bill of sale—Lyndhurst's was the first execution—on Messrs. Adams's claim an order was made to try issue on my finding security for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I could not do in consequence of Moseley's evidence before the Magistrates, as it reflected upon my character—the money was to be paid into Court as security, and I did not feel disposed to pay it myself, as I thought I had lost enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The goods were sold for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Moseley said these cheques were drawn by Kirby in my favour, and that he owed me nothing—when we were talking about the partnership it oozed out that Kirby owed me money, and Moseley said to me, "Why, Mr. Kirby said he did not owe you a farthing"—I said, "I will show you that one day," and a day or two after, while Kirby was out, I had the cheques and pass-book with me, and showed these cheques to Moseley—he looked at them and said, "Well, of all the liars that ever God sent upon the earth, I have never heard a greater liar than Kirby."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Chichester Rents, Chancery Lane, and am a kiln man—on the 18th March I was in George Street, St. Giles'—at the corner of Church Street I received a blow across the temple with an iron bar—I looked at the prisoner and said "You villain, what did you do that for?"—and I no sooner said the words than I received a blow with a knife—the prisoner is the man—I swear to him—I had only the time I mentioned to look at him—the blow with the knife cut me through the lip—I lost my senses and was taken to the Gray's Inn Hospital—I attended there five days—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my right hand trowsers pocket, and in the other pocket a tobacco-box, a knife, and pocket<lb></lb>hankerchief—when I came to my senses I found I was in the hospital, and all my things gone—I saw the prisoner seven or eight days afterwards, at the bottom of George Street, with five others—I looked at him—he turned his back to the wall, and looked another way—I went across the road to a constable, and said "There is the man I want"—he said "You must be careful; it is a very serious charge"—I said I was positive he was the man, and I went and touched him on the shoulder, and said "I give this man in charge for assaulting me and cutting my forehead'—he said "You must be dreaming"—there were some other men with the prisoner at the time I was robbed—and one of the men</p>

               <p>who went away then, I believe was the man that was with him at the time—there was a lamp near where I was robbed—that is how I identify the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I work very late, occasionally—I had been working from Wednesday morning at 8 o'clock up to about 10.20 at night—I was very tired—I had had something to drink—I had never seen the prisoner before, to my knowledge—I was walking quietly along when I received a violent blow on my forehead, and immediately I was down I received the stab in the mouth; and then my senses left me—it was about 11 o'clock at night—I was taken home before being taken to the hospital—I was not kept in the hospital for five days—after my wound was dressed I was taken home, and I attended at the hospital for five days afterwards—I believe I men<lb></lb>tioned at the hospital about being robbed, but I don't know what I did say—I have since heard that the prisoner is a costermonger, and works in the neighbourhood where this took place.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a police constable of the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> division—on Sun<lb></lb>day evening, 19th April, I saw the prosecutor between Chancery Lane and Great Turnstile—he was almost insensible from loss of blood, and was bleeding very much from a wound on the left temple—I took him to the hospital in a cab, and afterwards took him home—he fainted four times going home.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not say anything to me in the cab as to what had been done to him—at the hospital he said he went into a public-house, the "Blue Posts," in Tottenham Court Road, and that he was struck there because he refused to pay for a quartern of rum; by two prostitutes—I made a report of that fact—he did not say anything about having been robbed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He did not say that he was struck with anything—I noticed the Wound—it was a very severe one—it seemed like a bruise, and there was a hole right through his lip—he was not sensible at the time he made this statement—he was raving.</p>

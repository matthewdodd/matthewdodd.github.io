               <p>Q. On what day before the robbery did you come there. - A. I think the Thursday week prior to that. I was in the habit of coming there once or twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on there on Sunday the 13th of December. - A. I did, on the 13th, Mr. Cox, and me both, went in the room; we found the room had been robbed; we imagined they came in the room by what we discovered by the window, there seemed a pane of glass broken sufficient for a person to have introduced a hand by which means they might have opened the shutters; we saw the drawers had been broken open we observed the Pier Glass was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that glass. - A. about six pounds. There were several articles taken from the drawers, they were all found in the house; there was a violin, two coats, and a waistcoat, some towels, a table cloth or two, and a few linen things. I cannot speak to exactly, they were my wife's, she was in the country; I was in the habit of going to my room once or twice a week. I left the key with Mrs. Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in the same house. - A. Yes. On the next day we searched his room, the officer found the glass under the bed clothes, we found a small bit of India Ink, which I was well satisfied was mine, and we found a hammer in his room. I went with the officer to the fleet prison, he was apprehended there, and was taken to Bow street and examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing upon his examination. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. STAFFORD Mr. Gurney, You are the principal Clerk in Bow Street office, were you present at the examination of the prisoner. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. was it taken down - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Court, How came you not to take it down. - A. We do not in general take it down unless the prisoner makes a formal confession. I rather think it was a conversation of the parties</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, Did you make any promises or threats, or did any person say any thing to induce him to make the acknowledgement. - A. No. He acknowledged to Mr. Read that he had taken the pier glass from the window, the glass that was stolen; he acknowledged he had taken it.</p>

             Mr. Gurney, I believe you are one of the Bow Street Patrols. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 14th of December, did you make search in the prisoners room for the discovery of Mr. Basket's property. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. did you find a glass concealed in the manner he has related. - A. I did in the back garrett. I found a piece of India Ink and a small brush; I found a hammer which corresponded with the marks on the drawers, I found two picklock keys in the back garrett, on the floor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130048"></xptr>I afterwards apprehended the Prisoner and took him to Bow-Street. (The Property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had that hammer out of the closet on the sunday morning following to which the robbery was done. I know nothing of the glass, nor did I know any thing about it 'till Friday morning. I went out on Thursday morning very early to an acquaintance in the Fleet prison and came home about half past eleven very tipsey with wine. The next morning I got up about eleven; I had not been down stairs above an hour before the landlady came in and said what had happened - I said I was very sorry for it. I went out and staid my usual time on Saturday, and on Sunday I was out all day. On Monday at the Fleet prison Mr. Basket come down to me with the officer. - They took me to a house in Fleet Street, and searched me. He asked me how I came to be so foolish as to take the glass. I said I did not take it; he said at Bow Street you say you found it, and that you took it in to take care of it, he said he would not appear against me, if sufficient was made up to him for his time and trouble. I told him I could not settle it, he must go to my grandmother; the Street door generally was left open all the day to a late hour at night. The parlour windows were left one night open the whole of the night, I have two witnesses to prove it.</p>

             once went up stairs to speak to his father, but the men never go up.</p>
               <p>Court, If you should be of opinion that the prisoner in the night time, between the 10th and the 11th of December, took the opportunity of getting in this room, by lifting up these sashes, and got into the room and stole the glass, he is guilty of the whole charge. If the sashes had been left open, and he took the opportunity of getting in and stealing the glass, then he will be guilty of stealing the glass, and not the burglary. In the first place you are to consider, whether he is guilty of stealing it at all. The evidence that effects him principally is, that the glass stole out of this room was found under his bed. How it got under his bed without his putting it there, I cannot say. You will judge what probability there is in the defence he has set up, that this glass was stolen by somebody or other, and carried up there; I do not find by the evidence that Mr. Coxs's men were found going to his room, you have the evidence of

If you see any reason to suppose that somebody else threw up the windows and he stole the glass you will find him guilty of stealing under 40 s. if you have no reason to suppose that any body throwed up the window than the person who stole the glass, you must find him guilty of the whole charge.</p>

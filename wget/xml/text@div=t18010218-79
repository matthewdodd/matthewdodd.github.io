               <p>Q. In consequence of your missing the articles contained in the indictment, did you give information? - A. I had strong suspicion of this man, and was advised to proceed, and I went to the officer, Cohan, and gave him information; I did not know exactly where the prisoner lived, but upon enquiry I found where he lodged, and about half after two o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, to the best of my recollection, we went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Farmer-street, Shadwell; I went into the front room, where Mr. Sedarhoon, the proprietor of the house, was, and enquired for this man; he was in a back room, and he was called into. Mr. Sedarhoon's apartment and there I saw the prisoner; I found on him part of the property now produced; I found the shirt upon him, and two neck handkerchiefs, and a pocket handkerchief; I found the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180046"></xptr>other articles in the apartment where he lodged; I have attested to all the property except two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing? - A. He made some defence, but I did not understand exactly what he said; I gave him in charge of the officer; and after the officer went up to the prisoner's apartments I was called up, and there I saw him in possession of two pair of nankeen breeches, which I recognized to be mine; he shewed me them in the presence of the landlord of the house; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.What day was it you discovered the prisoner? - A. On last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to understand any thing that the prisoner said at all? - A.Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand that the prisoner had been to church that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand that he had those cloaths of a man of the name of Chader, that he might appear decent? - A. I did not understand it from him; the interpreter said something of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted there were other people that lodged in the house besides the prisoner at the bar? - A. That I know nothing of, I only saw one person at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. My question to you is, do you not know there were other lodgers in the same room and same house? - A. I cannot pretend to say; I saw no more than the man who is now in Court and the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door locked up stairs or not? - A. I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not tell me where you kept your property, whether your box was broke open or not? - A. The lock of the box has been wrenched where I kept my cloaths; my box was kept on the half deck where I resided.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. That is a situation which is exposed to the sailors on board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE COHAN sworn. - I am one of the officers belonging to the Institution of the Thames Police: I was applied to by the prosecutor, John Marsh, to apprehend the prisoner at the bar; I apprehended him on the Sunday at Mr. Sedarhoon's, No. 47, Farmer-street, Shadwell; the prisoner had on his person three waistcoats, two neck handkerchiefs, a pair of breeches, and a shirt; all these things Mr. Marsh claimed as his own; they are all marked.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his claiming them, did you take them into your possession? - A. I kept them that night, and then I put them into the charge of my waterman, and he has had them ever since; I was then shewn up stairs into the prisoner's lodging-room; the prisoner was left in the charge of my waterman; I found two pair of nankeen breeches in a closet; Mr. Marsh was called up stairs, and he claimed them as his property; I put them into the same bundle; I took the prisoner into custody, and he was committed the next day.</p>



               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.When you went up stairs the prisoner was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had three waistcoats upon hiem? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.This was last Sunday, it was a hard frost I believe? - A. It was cold weather.</p>
               <p>ANDREW SEDARHOON sworn. - I live at No. 47, Farmer-street, Shadwell; I know the prisoner at the bar; he lodged with me on Sunday last; he occupied a one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the officer up stairs to his room on the day he came? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing found in the room he occupied? - A.Only these two pair of nankeen breeches, and the prosecutor claimed them as his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else lodge in that room? - A. Yes, there were three more; they were sailors: when the prisoner went out on the Friday night he had his own cloaths on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return the same night? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return with the same cloaths on? - A. No; he had the prosecutor's cloaths on; I believe he returned about eight or nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. The Friday night was the first time you had seen the prosecutor's cloaths? - A. Yes, the first time I had seen the prisoner wear them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the Friday before the Sunday that the officer came? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about those cloaths? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner? - A.When he came home I asked him where he got all those fine cloaths from; he told me that a shipmate had bought them at Portsmouth, and he had got them from that shipmate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you understand that he had bought them of a shipmate? - A. No; I cannot tell whether he said, lent them or bought them; but after that he said a shipmate had lent them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.How many men lodged in your house? - A. Six at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a man of the name of Chader? - A. Yes; that was the same man that he said he had borrowed the cloaths of.</p>
               <p>Q.Since this man has been taken into custody have you made any enquiry after Chader? - A. I have; but I have not been able to discover him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When he said he got those cloaths of a shipmate at Portsmouth, did you understand him to mean Chader? - A. Yes, the same man.</p>

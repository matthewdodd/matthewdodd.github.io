               <p>About two in the morning, on the 10th of this month, I was robbed on the middle of <placeName id="t17861213-67-crimeloc346">Great Tower-hill</placeName>

               <p>Was it the nearest way to come over Tower-hill? - No, it was not; but there was a poor man that was distressed in the spunging-house there, and he sent for me; I went to him in at the front door, and I came out at the side door, and I missed my turning; I came down to the bottom of the Minories; I have often came over Tower-hill of a night; when I came to the middle of the Great hill, I saw the prisoner coming towards me on the right; it was a high wind, and a good deal of rain; it was moon-light; he came pretty nigh me; and I said, I wish you would keep at a distance; and I think he said, what is that to you? there is room enough for us both; says I, that is the reason why I wish us to be separate; he still came towards me; and I at last said, are you determined to rob me? to the best of my knowledge he said, he did not know but he might, or some words to that purpose; when that was the case I did not know how to act, for the wind was so high I thought I could not run; and I believe I turned round and said, what, are you good at that; I had a stick in my hand; he struck at me with a stick or bludgeon, and I returned the blow, and we had several blows of one another; and at last I got one on my head which brought me to the ground; it stunned me; I had on a pair of black callimanco breeches, and he tore the pocket down to the knee; and I remember him raising me up, and he stripped off a blue coat, and a great coat that I had on; and I found myself very helpless; and I said, take what you please, spare my life for I have a family; immediately upon that he left me; I saw him run; I got home as well as I could; I lost a good deal of blood.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sober at that time? - I had been drinking; I had had a few glasses of wine at the spunging house which were not remarkably strong; but I was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Were you quite sober? - I will not declare myself quite sober.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this man before? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this is the man? - I am sorry, my Lord, I have not a doubt of it I lost my hat and my stick; my hat was not found.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This great coat I am quite sure about, because I can swear to my own hand writing, R. Black, on the inside; the blue coat I have not a doubt of its being mine; but there may be another like it; the great coat I am quite positive of.</p>

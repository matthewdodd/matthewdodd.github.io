                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at 7, Renfrew Road, Lower Kennington Lane—prior to the 10th March I was ill and unable to attend to my business—the prisoner called at my house on 10th March, but I did not see him—he called again on the 12th Or 13th, and spoke to me about the result of a matter he had in hand in the police-court, and said, "Now, with regard to my attending to the business for you, shall I account to you daily or in what way?" and he said: "All cases that can afford agency I should expect agency in; but the smaller cases I should be happy to do for nothing"—I said, "Certainly not, Mr. May, I shall do nothing of the kind"—I said first of all, "I cannot be troubled with any accounts; I cannot expect you to do my business except upon condition that you receive one-half of all the fees you take at the police-court, be good enough to keep an exact account of what you receive and pay away and then when I am well enough we can see what money there is coming to me'—the next day he sent up 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me—the conversation took place in my bedroom—on 3rd April I saw him again in my parlour with a client who had instructed me to prosecute a man named Lytton, and I advised him, in May's presence, and a day or so afterwards I asked May what counsel he intended having, as I should like Mr. Besley to lead—he said "I should like to give young Mr. Metcalfe a brief." I said "Certainly." I do not know Mr. Metcalfe, but I should like Mr. Besley to lead; do not mark Mr. Besley's brief, less than seven guineas and two guineas, and do not mark Mr. Metcalfe's brief, if you engage him, less than four and one," and I drew a cheque for Â£20 and handed it to May—I went out of town for a week, and saw May on 22nd April, on my return—I asked him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300201"></xptr>
               <p>how Lytton's matter was going on, and said, "Is there anything more you want to say to me?"—he said "Oh, yes, I shall want some more money in that case of Lytton's." I said "Have you spent all that £20?"—he said "Oh, yes, I had to have several conferences with Besley and Metcalfe, and had to pay them their consultations and the fees on their briefs, and the prosecutors are going on with the indictment in Davis's case; I therefore had to brief Besley and Metcalfe in that as well—I said, "Very well, Mr. May, if you have spent the money properly I bad better give you some more," and, belie ring his statement, I drew and handed him a cheque for £15—on the 22nd April a lady called at my office and from information received I made inquiries as to whether he had been in consultation with Messrs. Besley and Metcalfe, and afterwards saw May at the Middlesex Sessions—I said, "Where are the briefs and papers?"—he said, "I have got them, and I mean to keep them!"—I said, "You had better mind what you are doing. I shall give you until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning, and if you do not hand them over to me by that time you must take the consequences," and next morning I received this (<hi rend="italic">Letter "C"</hi>), which is in his handwriting. ("77, Chancery Lane, 23rd April, 1879, <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Lytton, and several prosecutions.</hi> I will be at your place with papers, &amp;c., and list of items of expenditure to<lb></lb>morrow at 10.30. You will no doubt, with your usual sense of propriety and professional honour, feel it just to make me some substantial remunera<lb></lb>tion, in lieu of agency, for the care and labour bestowed on this case in now bringing it to an issue: I shall be happy to afford you every informa<lb></lb>tion respecting any other matter I may have been concerned in. I shall, however, have to adopt the ordinary means of protecting myself against the results of your threats. Notwithstanding the effect of the statements of the plausible widow, whose claim (especially under the circumstances) would have been settled long ago, <hi rend="italic">if just</hi>, and whom you sent up by my discharged clerk simply to annoy me, I have the satisfaction of believing you will, on inquiry, credit me with having treated you and regarded your interests in a gentlemanly and conscientious way. As you referred to the subject, I may inform you, if it interests you, that, believing it to be the duty of a man (if it be possible) to have his wife under his own roof, arrangements are now being made to this end. How often does it happen in life that when one is in the act of retrieving the past, that past comes or ward in some shape or other, and prevents his accomplishing the ends desired. This portion of my letter is written aurente catarne, and I trust to your honour to let it remain private. Yours'truly, Alfred H. May.") The next day, the 24th, before I had received that letter, he came to my office and handed me Lytton's papers—I said "Now, where is the money?"—he said, "Oh, what money?"—I said "That 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you got. from me"—he said "Oh! that's a matter of account"—I had not then seen the briefs—I said "A matter of account! What do you mean? I handed you first 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that special purpose, I want to know what you have done with it"—he said "Oh! that is a matter of account"—I said "I do not understand what you mean by a matter of account; I want to know what you have done with that money which you obtained from me for that sole purpose"—I said "There is the money you have taken since you have been here, and I have not received that"—he said "That is a matter of arrangement"—I said "That is enough.

               <p>away"—he said "Will you let me make out a statement?"—I said "You can do what you like, so long as you go out of my office," and he made out a statement and brought it to me—I said "How dare you make out this, and call this a statement? I know nothing about this. Have you got the money? Are you going to hand me over the money?"—he said "No, I have not got it"—I subsequently gave him notice and took proceedings against him before Mr. Chance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I have seen you at the Thames Police Court once—I cannot say I have known you as a Criminal and County Court advocate, but I have heard you were—I have not heard that you have practised your profession with success in the advocacy department, but quite the contrary—that did not induce me to enter into an arrange<lb></lb>ment with you to conduct my criminal cases—I have gained the informa<lb></lb>tion since I had you—probably I said before the Magistrate, "On the 10th March, in consequence of my illness, I was obliged to get some one to superintend my business, and the prisoner called at my house and offered to give me some assistance. I spoke to him and told him I should be very happy to have his assistance, and said, 'I am afraid it will interfere too much with your business.' He said, 'No; my partner Lewis can attend to that'"—I am not pasitive whether it was the 10th or 12th—you first called on the 10th, but I believe I did not see you till the 12th; but I have the papers here, and can show you—I did not say it was on the 10th—you called on the 10th, and transacted the first business for me on the 10th, but I think it was the 12th I first saw you—on the 12th I sent to Sergeant 'n wood to say that Mr. May would attend to all my cases—you attended to some cases on the Monday before I saw you.</p>

Lytton, and Mr. Purver was there—he was the nominal prosecutor in the case—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my handwriting. (Copy. "To Mr. Purver. 5th April, 1879. Dear Sir. Reg. v. Lytton.

It is a very unfortunate affair. I gave a friend of mine, Mr. Lewis, a cheque twice to settle the matter, and I am afraid he has not done so; if you had not taken me, I was thinking of giving myself up.

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "32, Mark Lane, London, E.C., 24th July, 1878. Sir,—We are instructed by Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">Paper marked "C":</hi> "7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid on account.") I saw him subsequently in September at my place, and I asked him how the affair was going on, and he said it was put back for the Long Vacation—I did not see him again—he did not appear for me, and the end of it was, I found the brokers in the house on the 31st October for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I had to pay them out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Gloucester-terrace, Hoxton. On 17th May, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, in consequence of what I was told, I missed two pieces of mousseline-de-laine from my shop-lobby, which I bad seen safe three-quarters of an hour, or an hour before—the prisoners were pointed out to me—I went after them, and saw them go down a turning—I went another way, met them, and charged them with stealing the muslin, and gave them into custody—I have not seen the muslin since.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoners and another female opposite Mr. Longland's window—I heard Murray say to the one that is not here, "Now it the time, there is no one looking"—and she then took the muslin, and walked between these two, and they went down a turning—these two were about half a yard off her when she took it.</p>

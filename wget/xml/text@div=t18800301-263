                  </hi>. I am an estate agent of 24, Langham Place—I am the owner of 18, Nassau Street, and the prosecutrix, Mrs. Lambert, is my tenant—on 31st January I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated January</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1880, <hi rend="italic">and signed F. D'Huggelaire, inquiring the name of the lady who lived in the parlours of the witness's house, as he wished to take proceedings against her for having decoyed young girls there for immoral purposes and was turning the house into a brothel</hi>.) I immediately gave the prosecutrix notice to leave, and went to the house myself—she was a weekly tenant, and had been there four or five months—I had had no previous complaints.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner, through an Interpreter</hi>. I never asked you if you knew Madame Gabrielle—my clerk, Mr. Watts, did not tell me I should get into trouble by keeping such characters in my house—I only saw you once, and that was when you called at my house to substantiate your letter—I know nothing about her walking in Portland Place every night for immoral purposes—you never asked me to go with you to see her walking the streets, nor did I take the slightest trouble to go to Portland Place to see whether there was any truth in it—she is in the house now—I did not act on the notice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I afterwards saw the prisoner and said, "Is this your letter?"—he said, "Yes, I can prove every word that is in it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Watson's clerk—I went by his instruction to the prisoner, and saw him at his house in Mortimer Street—I showed him the bottom part of this letter, and he said, "That is me, step inside," and asked me into his room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not tell you that old Watson would get himselfi one day into trouble for keeping bad women in his houses—I said, "You on have made a very serious accusation; if what you say is true I am to order the people to leave the house instantly"—you asked mo to go with you to Regent</p>

I lost two odd boots and a pair of highlows on the 2nd of January, about five o'clock in the evening - I had seen them about half an hour before; my little boy called me into the shop, and I missed them - I sent my wife to the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner near your shop? A. No - he said they had been given to him by another person, whom he described; search was made for that person, but he has absconded - I had seen that other person about the town - he seemed younger than the prisoner, and is a bad character.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. These boots were brought to be pawned by the prisoner - I saw no one with him; it was between six and seven o'clock on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140036"></xptr>the night of the 2nd of January - the prosecutor's wife had given me notice to stop them about half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HUGHES. I am a constable. I was called to take the prisoner and the boots.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the other lad who has absconded? A. Yes, very well - I know him to be a bad character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What age is the other lad? A. Seventeen or eighteen; he has been about the barges, and has been in trouble - I had seen him about a week before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down the town, and met this young man, who gave me these boots to pawn.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HUGHES re-examined. The prisoner first mentioned about the other boy the next morning - I had been seeking for the other on another charge; he had slept on board a barge that night, and went away the next morning.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURFORD. My brother told me the other lad was waiting in the passage at the time the prisoner came in.</p>

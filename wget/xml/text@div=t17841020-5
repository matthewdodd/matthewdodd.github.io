               <p>I am chief mate of the Bellmont; I was commanding officer on board when this salt-petre was stolen on the 27th of September, I think it was about ten in the morning, I had loaded a craft with salt-petre belonging to the East-India Company, I went down in my cabin to discharge that craft, which was my duty; while there, a messenger came to me from one of the Company's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200015"></xptr> officers, Mr. Standfast, to inform me, there that was a man taken with a quantity of salt-petre on his person; I went up and saw

             standing with a quantity of salt-petre round him, I felt on both legs a large quantity of salt-petre; in consequence of which I sent to Mr. Preston, the husband of the ship, and I delivered the prisoner to the care of Mr. Crossley, the third mate; he afterwards informed me that the prisoner had let out one of his legs, I went immediately and saw the salt-petre under his feet, and I felt the other leg, and found the salt petre was still there, and the man was committed: the prisoner was a lumper on board.</p>

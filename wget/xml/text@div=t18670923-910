I am a coffee-house keeper, of 7, Greenwich Road—on 10th September I saw the prisoner in the coffee-room, sitting under the picture of a black and white spaniel dog which I had had many years—she had come there to breakfast regularly for two months every morning—I turned my back and she appeared fast asleep—I left the room for two minutes and noticed the picture at that particular time, because I was sit<lb></lb>ting opposite it—when I came back the prisoner was gone, and the picture too—I have not seen it since.</p>

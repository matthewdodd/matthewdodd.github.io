            . I am a pork-butcher and poulterer, and live at No. 62, Aldersgate-street. The prisoners came into my shop on the 14th of January, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening together - Castles asked the price of some chops; I served him and he gave me a bad crown-piece - they came to 8d.; I took the crown-piece off the counter and rung it - I said, "My good fellow this will not do, have you got another;" Bates then came in, and was at the further end of the counter - the prisoners stood close together; I said"My good fellow this is a bad one" - I gave it back; Castles rang it on a halfpenny, or penny-piece, and said it was as good a one as ever was made, and handed it to Bonner, who said, "You need not be afraid of it, it is as good a one as I ever saw;" Bates said, "Let me look at it - it is a bad one, and I know these men to be common smashers" - I directly gave them in charge; they both used such foul language I cannot name it - Bonner began; he said, "What do you detain me for?" I said "For aiding and assisting this man in trying to impose this crown-piece on me," and then he abused me; after the officer searched Castles, he put the crown-piece on the further side of the counter, out of their reach, and said it should be there till he had searched Bonner - Castles then made a struggle to get at it, and I prevented him; he said he would have it, and as he nearly overpowered me I called my man up - they were secured; I gave the crown to Bates in my shop after I had marked it - on Castles was found a good half-sovereign, a crown piece, and 2 1/2d.; and on Brown, 7s. 6d. or 9s. 6d., all good.</p>

            . I am a superintendent of the watch. On Monday night, the 14th of January, I saw the prisoners, between seven and eight o'clock together against the coach-rank in Aldersgate-street - I watched them and saw them go into Hounslow's shop; I looked through the window and saw them pay something - I watched till they came out; they then went four doors on into Forster's - I watched till the chops were weighed and then went in; I saw a pound of chops weighed - I knew them both very well - I saw Castles throw a crown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140088"></xptr>piece down which rang very well; I stepped into the shop instantly - I said I should want something; Forster had the till in his hand, ready to take the change out, and said, "I do not like the look of this" - Castles said, "It is as good as ever was coined;" he put it on his finger and rang it with a halfpenny, or a penny-piece, and Bonner said, "It is as good a one as ever was, master" - I said, "Allow me to see it, I am a good judge;" I looked and said it was exactly as I expected - I said, "It is a very bad one, you are two well known faces;" Forster gave them in charge directly - they wanted to get out of the shop, and used very bad language, both of them, Bonner in particular; Castles made a snatch across the counter to get the crown-piece - I found on Castles a good crown, a half-sovereign, and 2 1/2d., and an ounce of tobacco; on Bonner, a parcel of good shillings - I think 7s. or 8s. 6d.; I have had the crown ever since, and one which I got from Hounslow - it is dated 1819, and he had a good crown which he had taken from a woman; I returned to his shop in half an hour.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. I am inspector of counterfeit coin at the Mint, and have been so many years. This crown piece dated 1819 is counterfeit - this one is also counterfeit, and of the same date, and both impressed from the same mould, certainly; they are Britannia metal, and ring extremely well - the other crown produced by Hounslow, dated 1820, is a good one.</p>
               <p>Castles The one Hounslow says he took from the woman I could point out among one thousand; all the letters under the chin are nearly defaced - I had it in my possession seven or eight days, and there was a mark where I dropped it on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Bonner. We desired that crown to be taken care of, as we know all the marks on it, which we could not do if it had not been in our possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London and County Bank, at Tenterden; I have been so about five years.

Williams")—I noticed the endorsement at that time—it had the appearance of having been recently written; it looked fainter than the writing of the body of the cheque, and evidently a piece of blotting paper had been passed over it, directly it was written; it was fainter than it is now—the prisoner's hand trembled, as he gave me the cheque, and my suspicion was at once aroused—he spoke as he came into the bank; he said, "Good morning"—I told him, that I knew nothing of Mr. Smith; we had no account, in his name, in the bank—he appeared very much surprised, and said that he could not understand it—he said, "Is it not a funny thing for a man to draw a cheque on a bank, when he has no account?"—I told him that it was occasionally done—he asked me, if it would be any good to call again; I told him yes, as there was a second post at half past 2 o'clock—I forget whether I told him the time; but I know I told him that there was a second post—he then asked me to write my answer on the cheque, and I wrote, "No account"—he said, "I received it in Lincoln's Inn Fields yesterday," but did not mention any name—he appeared very reluctant to leave the office, and I suppose he remained there four or five minutes—he appeared to be thinking, and seemed con<lb></lb>fused; he looked on the ground—I saw him again, as I was crossing the road to communicate with the inspector; I had hardly opened the advices—he</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the notes were abstracted from the bank parcel, brought by you from the London and Westminster Bank, did you not endeavour to fix the stigma of the guilty act upon me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a few days after the notes were stolen, they were returned to the house of one of the partners, tied to the knocker of the door; I took no active steps to prove you guilty of it—we expressed our opinion that you were guilty of it—that is twelve or thirteen years since—you were retained in the London and County Bank for some few weeks afterward; I do not know for how long—nobody proceeded against you—you are half brother to my late wife.</p>

               <p>of the parties is to be found; I allude to Mr. Milsom—he is not also a partner of mine—I am on very intimate terms with him—I am aware that he is a returned convict; I was told that fact somewhere about three years back; I did not know it previously—I have no doubt there is such a person as Mr. Fletcher; I cannot give his address—I know Milsom's address—when I said I induced Fletcher and Co. to give you employment, I meant the partner—they carried on business as civil engineers and surveyors—I never knew Fletcher personally; my acquaintance was with Milsom—they gave you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as clerk—I do not know that you resigned your appointment with them in consequence of their fraudulent transactions—you did not resign, you were dismissed—it is not the fact that they absconded and went away; Mr. Milsom is there now—I believe some arrangement was made with you that you should have the offices, and I believe you had them for a week or two, but when you were arrested the partner went back again, and is there now—I cannot form any opinion whether his object is to get you out of the way—I know Mr. Milsom's private address—my own private address is at Burham Terrace, Camberwell—my partner, Mr. Reynold's is abroad, and has been for a month past or more; he is on pleasure—we are house and land surveyors; that is the only business I have—I have not had access to all your papers relating to your case while you were in the Asylum—I knew nothing of the case except what I was told—I did not tell the Lord Mayor that I had known you for fifteen years; that was a newspaper report; I said for years—I first became acquainted with you about four years ago—I have reason to be sure that you have an enmity against me, from what took place at the Mansion House—you were treated with every kindness and considera<lb></lb>tion by us, and you have made a very bad return for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Cranbrook branch of the London and County Bank, and live at Cranbrook. I know Mr. Ebenezer Beaman, and have done so fop fifteen years; he has kept an account at our bank for that period—I am acquainted with his signature—this cheque for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not in his writing, nor is the letter which accompanied the cheque in his son's writing—we have no cheques in use now of the form on which this 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is written; we have ceased to use that form for these ten years—I cannot say whether this 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque came from the same book as these three others; these are not numbered—in 1846, the prisoner had an account at our bank—he had a cheque book, as a customer, and he drew cheques on</p>

               <p>the bank; the form he used was similar to this—he ceased to be a customer in 1846—I recollect bis handwriting; I cannot say that the letter signed "Beaman" is the same, or the cheque for 457<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have an opinion about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

I keep the Railway Hotel, at Headcorn, which is nine miles from Tenterden; it is the nearest station to Tenterden, on the down line; in coming there from London, you pass Tumbridge.

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Eight Bells, at Tenterden. The prisoner came to that house, on Thursday night, 10th June—after breakfast, in the morning, he asked me for a pen and ink, and took it into the smoking room—I think it was a quill pen, I am not certain about it; it was black ink—I do not know what he did with the pen; he went in there alone—he was there for five or ten minutes—when he came out, he went in the direc<lb></lb>tion of the bank—he had no blotting paper, that I know of—he had a pocket book; when I went into the room once or twice, I saw the pocket book—I did not notice what he was doing when I went in; he was not writing—I never saw him writing—he returned in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—a gentleman named Collins came into the bar, and said "Good morning" to him, and the prisoner said "Good morning" to Mr. Collins—Mr. Collins said, "I think I know your face, Sir;" the prisoner said, "I do not know that I know you, Sir, but I come from Lincoln's Inn Fields"—the prisoner left the house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards; that was the last I saw of him—before leaving, he asked at what time the market commenced; I told him, and he said he should return by the after<lb></lb>noon market—his bag was left at our place until Russell had it.</p>

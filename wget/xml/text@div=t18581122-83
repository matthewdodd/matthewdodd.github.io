               <p>there—the prisoner said in my presence that she was pregnant—the doctor said, in the prisoner presence, that she was to be kept perfectly quiet—I remained with her on the Monday night—on the following day she was de<lb></lb>livered of a dead child in my presence—Mr. Masters delivered her, Mr. Stokoe's partner—Mr. Stokoe was not at home—he came in directly after the delivery—the delivery was somewhere about 1 o'clock—the prisoner was in the house at the time—I continued in attendance on the deceased until she died—on the Tuesday the prisoner went out about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—in the evening Miss Booker called in to see how the deceased was, and she begged her to stay, and she did, and remained that night—the deceased was very ill indeed that night—the prisoner returned about 1 o'clock at night—I was sitting up—Miss Booker and I were both up in the bed-room—when he returned he came into the bed-room—he asked the deceased how she was—she said she was better—he did not say anything else particular then—he appeared very comfortable and quiet; he pulled off his coat and hat, and sat down and had some gin-and-water—I believe he had two glasses—he smoked a cigar with it—he sat up until 4 o'clock—he was quiet all that time, and in conversation—at 4 o'clock he flew in a violent passion—I do not know for what cause—there was a cat in the room at this time, and the noise that he made caused the cat to leave the room and go down stairs—he got up from his chair—he was knocking and stamping about, and hallooing—when the cat left the room he ordered Eliza Little to get out of bed, calling her d—d wretch, saying that she had done something to the cat—he called her many other names, such as a villain and a hound—he then threatened that if she did not get out of bed and go and look for the cat he would murder her—he was then at the foot of the bed—he told her that if she did not get out of bed and go and look for the cat he would kill her—he had a stick in his hand at that time, which I took from him—it was a walking stick—when he ordered her out of bed, she said she would not go—he told her that he would make her—she then, through his violent threats, got out of bed—she put on two petticoats—when she was out of bed in the room he threatened her; he said he would kill her—that was before she put the petticoats on, and after he said that he would murder her—he said that without saying any thing else, at least we were so intimidated and frightened we hardly knew what he did say—I reasoned with him, and begged and entreated of him to be quiet and not to touch her—I tried all I could to keep him quiet—after she was out of bed and had put on her petticoats; he drove her down stairs to look for the cat—he drove her with his violent threats—I believe that he pushed her in the first instance—I was trying all I could to keep him back, I saw him lift his hand to push her—it is only a four-roomed house—this was the front bed-room on the first floor—Eliza Little went down stairs—the prisoner followed her—I went down stairs also—she got to the street-door and tried to get out—she screamed "Murder" in the passage down stairs—I did not see him do anything to her in the passage, no further than driving her through the passage—I do not think he touched her at all—he ordered her through the passage into the kitchen to look for this said cat, because he said she had done something with the cat, and she had not been out of her bed—she went into the kitchen—that is on the same floor as the passage—the prisoner followed her there—taking up a pair of tongs from the back parlour fireplace, he threatened to strike her with them and kill her—he called her a d—d wretch, a villain, a hound, and a dog—when he took up the tongs he said</p>

               <p>he would kill her with them—he had the tongs in his hand, and I took them from him—she tried to get out of the door—she had no shoes or stockings on, and I went and fetched her a pair of boots and put them on down stairs in the kitchen—the kitchen and passage are boarded—that was all that took place—she afterwards returned up-stairs—the prisoner followed her—I went up-stairs as well, and got her into bed—I should say she had been down stairs altogether about ten minutes as nearly as possible; it might have been a little more—when I got her to bed she was very much exhausted, very faint, and very cold—after I put her to bed I put some hot flannels to her—the prisoner still continued very violent in the bed-room—he continued violent for some few minutes at least—I prevailed on him to go down stairs with me to look for the cat—I knew the cat was not out of the house—he went down stairs, to look for the cat, and I went with him—we found the cat under the sofa in the front parlour—he did not say anything when we found it, only took the cat and petted it and took it up-stairs again—he remained quiet until 8 or 9 o'clock, at least he was swearing at her and making violent threats, stating that if she did not die that day he would kill her dead—that was to Eliza Little—about 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning he had a sword, and he drew it and flourished it over her head—the sword had heen by the bedside—he was going to take it before this, before Miss Booker left—it had been previously standing by the bed-side, but I had removed it between the drawers and the window, as he had threatened to take it before—it was drawn wheu he flourished it over the bed—he said he would strike the first person that interfered with him—I got the sword from him—I begged him to let me have it—on the Wednesday the deceased was very bad indeed—she died on the Saturday.</p>

               <p>to be quiet, nothing of the kind—it was about 4 o'clock when he made the noise and frightened the cat out of the room—he did not miss the cat before that—it was the noise that he made that frightened it out—the cat was sitting by the side of the fire-place, on a chair—it did not go out of the room till he commenced making the noise, but as soon as he commenced making the noise—as soon as he missed the cat he complained of it—I looked for it; he did not—I looked for it of my own accord bcause I wanted to quiet him—he did not assist in the search—he did not take the stick in his hand and poke about the room, searching for the cat—he did not, before he made use of the language I have alluded to, complain over and over again about the cat being missing—it is not the fact that he left the room first, and that Mrs. Turner got out of bed and followed him while he was raving about the cat—she did not follow him—she was the first that went down the stairs—he ordered her to get out of bed—he was on one side of the bed as she got out of the other—he positively ordered her to get out of bed—she said, "Don't take on so about the cat, it is somewhere about the house, you need not be afraid of that"—he still went on raving about it—he drove her down the stairs—I mean to adhere to that—he did not take her by the shoulder and push her down—he did not put his hand upon her at all—she went to the front door and tried to get out, and then she screamed "Murder," very loud—the neighbours in the next house heard it—she was then in the passage—she did not open the door because she was in such an exhausted state—I swear that she screamed out "Murder" over and over again—I cannot say how many times—I stated so before the coroner—I do not know that I have stated it to any one except at the inquest—I do not think I have stated it to any one who is here—I believe I stated before the coroner, that he said that if she did not die that day he would kill her dead—I have not named it to any one before to-day, it is not a pleasant thing to name—I told it to the coroner—what I stated was taken down in writing and read over to me, and I signed it—it was read over to me in order that I might see there was no error in it, and I took care that there was no error in it—I mean to pledge my oath that I gave that evidence before the coroner, and heard it read over to me—I stayed with the deceased until she died—after that morning the prisoner continued his attention and kindness to her as before—that conduct was not resumed until the middle of the Wednesday—from that time until her death he was kind and attentive, as kind as man could be to woman who was suffering.</p>

               <p>it was not a proper time for him to make any remarks to her; that she was dangerously ill, that she was under my care, and I oould not allow it—his violence coutinued, and he said he would not be bullied in his own house, and threatened to knock me down—I told him his conduct was such, that a policeman ought to interfere; I did not consider he was in a fit state to remain with her—I said I should speak to a policeman, and left the house—I called again the same evening, the deceased was still very ill—I continued to attend her until she died, on the Saturday morning—I understand that she died about half-an-hour after I left the house on Saturday—my partner afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination in my presence: the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi>, which is the covering of the bowel, was in a state of inflammation—there was a false membrane covering that peritoneal covering of the bowel, and <hi rend="italic">pus</hi>, or matter, in the cavity of the abdomen, the consequence of inflam<lb></lb>mation—the chest, lungs and heart were healthy—in my judgment, the cause of death was inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that she was labouring under this inflammation on the Monday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the same disease continued—compelling her to get up on Wednesday, about 4 o'clock, and going down-stairs into the passage and kitchen without shoes or stockings, then putting on a pair of boots, and returning to bed in five or six minutes, must tend to aggravate the disease—it would so aggravate it as to make it operate fatally more quickly than it otherwise would have done—it was a dangerous disease—I cannot say that it would tend to make a disease fatal, where it would not otherwise have been fatal; but if it was a fatal disease, it would make it fatal more quickly—one womb was not inflamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you say that the getting up, under the circum<lb></lb>stances that have been detailed, might have aggravated the disease, or do you say positively that it did so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would aggravate the disease; she was worse the next morning and the presumption was that it did so—she was very bad when I saw her on the Monday, and also on the Tuesday—the disease was going on; it was progressing to its climax without any arrest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the state in which you saw her on the Wednesday after this alleged going down-stairs might have existed if she had not got out of bed at all during the night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think that the getting out of bed increased it—if I had not heard anything about her getting out of bed, I should not have been surprised at the state in which I found her on the Wednesday—I was not told by Mrs. Horsley about her getting out of bed—I was not made aware of it until after the death—I attended her from day to day, twice a day—I found her worse on the Wednesday—I anticipated that—some inflammatory diseases are more rapid and some less; I presumed that her state on the Wednesday was consistent with the progress of the disease, although she had not got out of bed at all—she was worse than I expected to find her, from the state in which I left her on the previous night—I considered her in danger from the first—she died from inflammation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing it to be true that she was forced, during the Tuesday night, to go down-stairs in the cold in the manner described, would that in your judgment, have been sufficient to produce the additional state of illness in which you found her on the Wednesday morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is probable—I do not think that a person in her state could not have done so without aggravating the disease, by driving the blood from the external surface on to the diseased surface, and producing congestion—that would tend</p>

               <p>to aggravate the inflammation—the moving her in such a state would also tend to aggravate the inflammation.</p>

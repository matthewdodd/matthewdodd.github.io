On the 24th of October the prisoner, who was a stranger, came about nine o'clock, and engaged a bed; he went to bed in the top room, about eleven o'clock, and paid 1s. 6d. for the bed that night - he went away next morning, about seven o'clock; I went up to the room about ten, and missed a frock-coat, which was tied in brown paper, and put into the cupboard of the room he slept in; a gentleman had left it in my care - I missed from my box,in the opposite room to his, three gowns and the other things; I slept in that room, and am sure I closed the door when I left, but did not lock it - the things were taken after I got up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you the chambermaid? A. Yes - we had no other lodger that night; I never saw the prisoner before - he came to me in the morning, and asked if he could have a bed again that night; I said Yes - he said he would come back about two and let me know; I was the only female servant, and my room is on the second floor - it was fastened with a spring latch; I polled it too, but did not lock it - I have found nothing but a piece of my gown.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he come back, as he said he would? A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT EARRINGTON. I rent the house. I recollect the prisoner sleeping there on the 24th of October, and am quite certain of him; I got up at half-past seven o'clock, but did not go into the servant's room at all; I have not a doubt of the prisoner's person - we had no other lodger that night; I saw the prisoner at the Mansion-house about a month ago - he is the man, although he has trimmed his whiskers; he had whiskers down to his neckcloth when at my house - he has now very small ones; they were the same at the Mansion-house as when I saw him at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he a stranger to you? A. Perfectly so; I know nobody had been up stairs the morning he left, as they must pass my room.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you attend on him? A. I did - he had a pint or two of porter, and I waited on him.</p>

            . I am chambermaid at the hotel. On the 30th of January the prisoner slept there - I am certain of him; he slept at No. 12, on the same floor as Mr. Webb - he went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock; I took his candle up, and asked if I should take his carpet-bag: he would not let me - I saw him in the morning, coming out of his bed-room door, and have not a doubt of him; he had large whiskers then: I saw him again when he was brought to the house - his whiskers were not removed then; that has been done since; I was sweeping his room in the course of the day, and found a quantity of cabbage-leaves and young cabbages under the bed; they would fill his carpet-bag - if they had been there when I lighted him up, I must have seen them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Castles, a pawnbroker, of Old-street. I have two coats, a shaving-case, and waistcoat, which I took in pawn from a female, in the name of Ann Mitchell, Thomas-street, Hackney-road, for two guineas, on the 24th of February - I would sell them for 3l.</p>

            . That is the person who pawned them, I am certain.</p>
               <p>MR. WEBB. These articles are mine, I am certain; I left my portmanteau locked, and when I returned the lock appeared to have been hampered - the end of it was ripped up, and the things dragged out; it appeared prized open; this shaving-case is worth 1l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have had the great coat some time, perhaps? A. Yes, but not worn it much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the things at a public-sale in Rosemary-lane.</p>

               <p>MR. OLIVER. The goods being lost in my house I paid the prosecutor 10l. for them.</p>

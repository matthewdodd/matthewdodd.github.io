                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, and live in Nelson-street, Greenwich. The prisoner was my shopman—in consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I gave instructions for some American ovens to be made, in presence of the prisoner—I put the tin on the counter for the man to select it—I had information that the prisoner was robbing me, and I understood he wished American oven made unknown to me, to take it away—I gave the for the ovens to be made—they were for stock—I wanted a lot of ovens to be made—I placed the tin on the counter for Blake, one of my</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tin-plate worker in the employ of Mr. Stedall. Last Monday week I had an order to make up four American ovens, two of No.2, and two of No. 3—the prisoner was present when I received those directions—I selected the stuff, and took it down to the workshop—in ten or fifteen minutes the prisoner followed me, and said, now that I had the chance, I might make that one for him—he had applied to me for me to make one for about four months—he had been applying to me to make him one on different occasions—I told him I would make him one this time—accordingly I took five in hand instead of four—I had an order for four from Mr. Stedall, and one from the prisoner, but I took the tin for the five before Mr. Stedall—I did not go twice for the tin, I took it all at once—Mr. Stedall saw me take the tin, but I do not know whether he ob<lb></lb>served that I took the tin for five.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you not do it on purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was to do it—Mr. Stedall told me to make an oven for Mr. Jay if he wanted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you told him the prisoner wanted an oven? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Mr. Stedall had told me first—he said he had heard that Mr. Jay wanted, me to make him an oven unknown to him—he had heard that from another man, not me—the prisoner asked me before the other man to make one for him, and to make it unknown to Mr. Stedall, when Mr. Stedall would be out of the way—he asked me to make this oven for him, and I took the oven, and made it for him—Mr. Stedall went out somewhere the day after—I had the tin, and then the prisoner came down, and told me to push along with that oven, now the governor was out of the way—he said No. 2 would be quite large enough for him, and to push along with it—I went op stairs, and told him it was done, and he desired roe to give it to the boy who was in the habit of coming to take things to another shop—the boy came—I was in the shop—the prisoner desired him to go down stairs with Blake, and take an American oven—I went as far as the head of the stairs, but I did not give it to the boy—I thought I would go out for a few minutes—I went out for about seven minutes, and when I came back I saw the boy in the shop, and the oven by the side of him, in a basket—it was not covered—it was partly in and partly out—I did not put any thing over it.</p>

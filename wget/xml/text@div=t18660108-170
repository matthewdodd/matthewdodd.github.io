I am the prisoner's mother, and the wife of the deceased—I live at 1, Love-court, Ratcliffe—on the evening of 17th December, or the morning of the 18th, my husband came home, very much in drink—he came home so—the prisoner shortly afterwards came home, also in a state of intoxication—his father was sitting by the fire—he said, "You are drunk, father"—his father made use of very low words, and said, "Yes I am, so are you"—the prisoner told him to go to bed—his father said he should go when he thought proper—I said to the prisoner, "Go to bed, Thomas, never mind, he will go to bed when he gets sober"—the prisoner went up stairs, and his father flung a fire-shovel after him—then he flung a little dog which be<lb></lb>longs to the prisoner out—I was in bed—a short time afterwards I heard the prisoner come down stairs and go out—his father followed him, and said he should not come in—there was a disturbance, and I went and fetched a policeman to prevent any words between them—when I came back I found his father sitting at the end of the table—the prisoner was up stairs with his brother—I do not know anything about any blows being struck—my hus<lb></lb>band was lately given very much to drink.</p>

On Sunday, about 3 o'clock, the prisoner came in to dine, he saw me put 29 shillings into a cup in the buffet, then I went to my mistress in the shop, I left nobody in the parlour but the prisoner, on my returning he got up and went out, he dropped one shilling on the mat, and 5 shillings at the door; I immediately went to the cupboard and missed my money. He had his dinner and paid for it; I and my mistress followed him; my mistress collared him and brought him back, he turned the corner, and hid himself in a privy. I am sure he is the man, there was no one else in the room.</p>

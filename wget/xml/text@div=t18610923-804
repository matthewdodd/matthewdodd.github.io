On the morning of 2d September, about half-past 1, I was on duty close to Miss Gosling's house, and heard a disturbance among the dry leaves near the house—I stood for a moment and heard it again—I stepped on a little further and turned my light on—there was another constable with me—he said, "Look out, here is a case; the windows have been broken and the shutters cut"—I turned my light on to the shrubs and I saw the legs of a man standing against the wall—I immediately rushed through the shrubs and got hold of the prisoner—my</p>

               <p>brother constable was then at the window which was broken—I brought the prisoner out of the shrubs; he had no shoes on—I took him to the window—there were some shoes lying there, and he said, "Those are my shoes"—he said to me on the road to the station, "What a fool I was to watch that property all day, and stop till night to get in; had you staid away ten minutes longer I would have been in and had what there was, and then I should have got away, if it had not been for you"—I produce some tools which the other constable found—I produce some mud that was stuck on the glass to prevent its falling, and some of the wood of the shutters and glass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

I was on duty in Witton-park on the morning of 2d September, between 1 and 3 o'clock, and met my brother constable not a great way from Miss Gosling's house—I heard a rustling of the leaves, very near the house—I went in the direction of the house, and found a pair of shoes, and a handkerchief—at the time the prisoner was about to be taken to the station-house, he asked me to let him have his shoes as his feet were sore—I also found this chisel, and these compasses (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards examined the window, and noticed that the centre pane was broken, which would allow anyone's hand to go in to unfasten the window—you could not undo the shutters from the outside; they close inside—the window was thrown up, and the shutters had been cut away considerably—some of these pieces of wood were lying down, and some were hanging on the shutters—the shutters appeared to have been out by the chisel—I found they corresponded—on the way to the station the prisoner said he had intended to have some of the silver and gold which was in that room—I did not ask him to make any statement.</p>

I am butler at Miss Gosling's—I was away from the house on the Sunday morning at church—I laid the cloth for dinner, and after that I was out on the water, but was within sight of the house—I was not out of the house after half-past 6—there was some plate used at dinner—I fastened up the house, and the dining-room shutters—the window was fastened; it is never opened—it looks right out on to the shrubs—anyone can see through it right up the room, so I never undo it—the sash throws up—it would be necessary to break the glass first to open the window—I fastened up these shutters at half-past—they fold back into boxes, come to in the centre, and fasten with an iron bar—the policeman called me up, and I dressed myself and went down into the dining-room—I went to the window, and could just see where an entry had been made—there was a little opening—I undid the bar of the shutters, and found the window thrown up, and the pane of glass over the hasp of the window broken, and some mud and glass lying down inside between the window and the shutters—I was with Anderson, the gardener, on the Tuesday after, near the shrubs, and in some wire which is put to keep the rabbits off the flower beds, was this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it does not belong to any person on the premises—I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

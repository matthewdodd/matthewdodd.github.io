                  </hi>. I live in the Aldgate, and am a gun-smith. On the night of the 1st of May I was in the Horns public-house, in Whitechapel—I received a blow in the eye—I sat down, and the prisoner crossed from the other side of the room—she said I had got a bad eye, and she would wipe it—she wiped it with her right hand, and picked my pocket of my watch with her left hand—I had my watch safe when I sat down, and by the pri<lb></lb>soner running away from me I missed it—I am positive there was no one else there who could have taken it—there were other persons there, but no one came within three yards of me but her—I have not seen my watch since—I did not feel her take it, but I had it safe when I received the blow in my eye—that was from a strange man—I had not seen him with the prisoner.</p>

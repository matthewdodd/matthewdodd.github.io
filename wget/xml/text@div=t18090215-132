               <p>Q. Do you remember having two bushels of coals of him the beginning of January - A. I had two bushels of coals of him before the lad came for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the person that brought the coals - A. Yes, he brought them all; one bushel on one Saturday and another on the next Saturday. On the 21st of January, he came for the money for the two bushels, about nine o'clock at night; I paid him three shillings and ninepence, the whole demand; I went to Mr. Daviss to order in more coals, Mr. Daviss asked me whether I had paid for the two bushels; I told him I paid the lad, I said to the lad you know I paid you; he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent to the corner of Catherine Wheel alley, Petticoat-lane, I received the money there for the coals, it was all silver; I put it in my pockets; just before I got home I took the money out, it was a French half crown and a bad shilling; I did not like to give it mistress, I thought she would say I was stupid; I went and changed the shilling, the half crown she did change, she said she never gave it me; I had to pay for a sack of coals; I had not money enough to take home to my mother; I drawed it of Mrs. Rogers, intending to pay my master the next week; my master found it out before I could make it up.</p>

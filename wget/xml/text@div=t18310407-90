            . I live in Rochester-terrace - the prosecutor works with me. On the night of the 28th of March we went to the Jolly Millers public-house, in Millbank-street - we left at near eleven o'clock; he was rather tipsy; not very tipsy - we afterwards went to another public-house in Peter-street; we there had something more - we went to a friend of his in New Peter-street, but had nothing there; he was quite tipsy at the public-house in Peter-street - I saw the prisoner at the Jolly Millers, and she went with us to the public-house in Peter-street - the prosecutor said, in Rochester-row, that he had lost his watch; the prisoner was by, and she said, "The watch is all right;" I afterwards saw it in the constable's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What did she say in answer to his saying he had lost his watch? A. She said he had left it at the public-house for half a pint of gin, and it was all right - she did not offer to go away, but persuaded him to come on, and go home; I did not hear the prisoner advise him to leave his watch at the public-house till morning, as he was tipsy; but I will not swear it did not pass - I was a little elevated, but could take care of myself.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in Rochester-row between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, on the 29th of March; I saw the prisoner and three men there - the prosecutor was one, and Richard Darling was another; I saw the prosecutor fall down, and the prisoner and the other two men assisted in getting him up - the prosecutor said he had lost his watch; the prisoner said,"Never mind, come along, your watch is left at the public-house for half a pint of gin;" he said the half pint of gin was paid for; the prisoner said, "Come along, and see if the watch is there" - I crossed the road, and asked the prisoner if she knew the prosecutor; she said Yes, he was her husband; I then asked the prosecutor if he knew her; he said he never saw her till that afternoon -I searched the prisoner, and felt something in her bosom; she put her hand in, pulled out this watch, and said,"This is the watch, he gave it me;" I took her to the watch-house - the prosecutor said it was his watch, and he could swear to it.</p>

            . Q.Will you swear you did not give her the watch to take care of for you? A. Yes, I will - she did not tell me I had had quite enough to drink, and I had better leave my watch there; I went to Peter-street to see a friend, a distant relation; I had a job for him - Mr. Darling and his son were with me, and this woman would make herself bold to go in, and sit down, which I would not have done for 5s.; I did not go there to borrow 5s. on my watch - I was rather short, and I said, "I wish you would let me have 5s.; on my watch;" but that was only in a bit of a game; he did not let me have it, but if I had been sober, I might have had the money in a moment - I distinctly swear I did not give her the watch to hold; I had seen my watch about half an hour before I missed it - I did not stop as I went along - it was not a frosty night, but I fell down.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutor in Millbank-street: he and some other persons were having a glass of liquor, and they would make me have a glass - we then went to another public-house in Peter-street; he wanted 5s. on his watch, and the landlord would not let him have any more - he then went to a friend of his, and wanted the money on the watch; the woman would not let him have it; he then went out, fell down, and his friend took his watch, and gave it him - he fell down again, and asked me if I would take him home; I said,"You had better go to your wife;" he gave me his watch; I gave it to his friend, and he gave it to the Policeman - it was not taken from me.</p>

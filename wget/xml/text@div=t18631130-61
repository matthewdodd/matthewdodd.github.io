                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Thomas Wilkinson, wharfinger—he owns a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Express</hi>—the prisoner was employed on that ship as ship-worker, or labourer, but not by Mr. Wilkinson—the cargo was mostly India-rubber, and there were some Brazil-nuts—the prisoner was working on board, on Thursday, 12th November—in consequence of something I saw, I followed him—on three occasions I missed him, but on the fourth, I followed him to a marine-store dealer's, of the name of Mrs. Daley, at St. Mary-at-Hill—I watched him into the shop, and then ran to the top of the street, and fetched a constable—as we came back, I saw the prisoner coming out of the shop—he went across the road, and spoke to another man—I then went into the shop, and saw a woman with a piece of rubber in the scale, weighing it—it was similar rubber to that which I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186311300088"></xptr>
               <p>seen on the ship—I have brought one piece here from the ship, and these are the pieces that were found in the shop (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found these other pieces in a bag in the shop, on the top of a cask—there were about a dozen pieces in it—the woman ran upstairs directly I went in, saying, "I know nothing about it"—that was before I said anything to her—the prisoner was not in the shop then—the policeman came in with the prisoner, and he had to call her three or four times before she would come down—I after<lb></lb>wards saw a hole in the ceiling of the shop with a piece of glass over it—I afterwards examined one of the cases on board the ship, and found that a great many pieces, similar to these, had been taken out of it—when the woman came down, she said she had never seen the prisoner, and did not know how the rubber came into her shop—I should think this is worth four shillings a pound—I believe twenty-eight or twenty-nine pounds was found altogether—the officers weighed it at the station.</p>

WARTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the ship lying? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Alongside Botolph Wharf, Lower Thames-street—the third ship out—there were about four ships there at the time—India-rubber is very largely imported, and used in this country—this is as it grown on the tree—this is the ordinary way of bringing it over—the pieces are generally about the same size—I believe, about ninety-six pounds is the whole quantity missed—there are men called <hi rend="italic">lumpers</hi>, who employ labourers to unload vessels—there were five or six men working on that vessel on that day—I am acquainted with one of them who followed the prisoner up to the shop—he goes by the name of "O. G."—he went with the prisoner the fourth time, and waited outside the shop—I first learnt the prisoner's name at the station—I had never seen him before—I noticed him on this day by his coming ashore several times—I did not notice "O. G." come ashore—I believe Mrs. Daley is not here—she was called up at the Mansion House, but Mr. Goodman would not take her as a witness—I was not present at the time—I heard her give some evidence to clear herself—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it—he appeared to be bulky when I saw him, and that was one reason why I noticed him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 532). On Friday afternoon, 12th November, about 3 o'clock, I was on duty at the top of St. Mary-at-Hill, and Mr. Sharp called me—in consequence of what he said, I went towards the marine-store dealer's shop, and stopped the prisoner about a couple of yards from the door—he was going over to a man named. "O. G." when I took the prisoner back to Mrs. Daley's shop—"O. G." went off down St. Mary-at-Hill—as I entered the shop Mrs. Daley was going upstairs—I saw a piece of India-rubber of this description in the scale—I then called to Mrs. Daley four or five times, and she refused to come down—I looked round on the left-hand counter, and saw a bag containing a quantity of India-rubber—Mr. Sharp said, "These are the goods"—I then said, "Mrs. Daley, you must come down and inform me how you came in possession of this property"—I could see her looking through the glass which was let in underneath the table upstairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Ackhort, of 10, Great Earl Street, Seven Dials, a blacksmith—the deceased Mary Ann Ford was my sister, she was 33 years old—she lived with the prisoner as his wife at 13, Princes Road, Newport Market—she was of intemperate habits—she came to see me on Saturday, 19th September, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening and she left at 11 o'clock—she was then drunk, but in good health and in very good spirits—the next morning Sunday, about 7.30 or 7.45, the prisoner knocked at my door, he only lived a street or two off—I asked who was there; he said "It is me, open the door"—he came in and said "Get up quick, <hi rend="italic">Polly</hi> is dead"—I was in bed, I scrambled out and said "What is the matter, she was all right last night?"—he said "Yes, I have killed her and I am very sorry for it, dress yourself quickly and come with me"—I went with him to his room and my sister laid in the bed dead—I touched her and she was dreadfully cold—I said "John she has been dead for some hours"—he said "Dead is she, do you think she is <hi rend="italic">Fan</hi>?'—he said that he would not believe she was dead till a doctor came—he then went to the next room, to Mrs. Allen, and said "<hi rend="italic">Polly</hi> is dead," and he called Mrs. Allen's sister and said "Come in <hi rend="italic">Mog</hi> and look"—Mrs. Allen came in and fainted away, and was led out into her own room—he told me he had done it and he was very sorry, and I was to make the best of it for him—some one went for the police, and John Smith came—the prisoner was then having a cup of tea in his own room, and he asked the policeman and Mrs. Allen's sister and me to have a cup of tea, and we all had some—we had not spoken a dozen words when the doctor came in—I am sorry to say that the deceased she was a great drunkard, in the habit of pawning the prisoners things and of falling about in the street or anywhere when she was drunk—he was a very good man to her—silent her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when she left on Saturday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My sister had lived with Bishop two years, but not always in the same place—they lived about eighteen months in Princes Road, and before that in Year Street, Clare Market—he has been very good and indulgent to her—he was in regular employment with Mr. White, and he brought his wages home on Saturday nights—he has often found my sister in a state of intoxication in the streets, and has had to carry her home, and I have assisted him—she was terribly addicted to drink and used to fall about in a very strange way—she was in very good spirits on the night in question and sang a song in my room, and after that she bor<lb></lb>rowed the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. because she did not want to look mean—my husband and his daughter were in the room—she took the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. away, she did not spend it there—I did not leave with her, I never saw her again till she was dead—she wanted the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to spend—I have a step-sister named Catherine Williams, she is a cripple and goes about with a crutch; she lives in Clare Market, not a great distance off—I met her with the deceased between 6 and 7 o'clock that Saturday night at the top of our street on the Dials; she had been having a little drink—my sister came away with me, and my step-sister never touched her; my step-sister is not here—I do not know what took place, after 11 o'clock—the prisoner only had one room, it was on the second floor back—I went there on the Sunday morning about 8 o'clock and found my sister lying on the bed covered with the clothes, with her head up very high, as if she had just got into bed—something like an hour elapsed from the the time I went in with Bishop to the time the</p>

I live in the same house as the prisoner in the first floor front room—I recollect Bishop and Mary Ann Ford coming home on 19th September about 11.30—was waiting at the door for my son—no one else was with them—they were coming home together very comfortably, and I thought she was very much the worse for liquor—that is what I call com<lb></lb>fortable—I did not notice that she was bleeding—I saw them go up stairs—I did not notice whether the prisoner was sober or not—he kindly entreated her to go up stairs—he said "Come up stairs, come up stairs," and he was going up before her—she went up of herself—I saw nothing of Mrs. Lynch that night—I went up stairs in about half an hour, and heard nothing till I had been in bed some time—I live on the floor below in front—as near as I can guess, about 1 o'clock I heard the prisoner say to the deceased very loud "What have you done with my money?"—he also said "I have treated you kindly all day, and you have robbed me of my weeks' hard earnings"—I could not tell whether that was outside or inside the room—I afterwards heard the prisoner come down to Mrs. Park's room, which is the next room to mine at the back, and I heard her say to him "Don't make a noise, because my children would go into fits"—he said "Mind <hi rend="italic">your</hi> era business."</p>

I said "I don't know anything about it, here is the lot and here is the place, you can look for yourself"—I don't think he did look, I had but half-an-hour to my supper—I had to go off again—he went out of the room—T finished my supper as nearly as possible at 12.25—I had to be back at 12.30—when I got outside I saw the deceased lying across the landing with her head to the foot of the stairs—I did not turn my head, to look whether she was dressed—I called Bishop and said "I hope you will not make any disturbance after I have gone, to disturb my wife and children as my wife is very ill"—he said "I will not," and I was going down stairs when Mrs. Parsons said "For God's sake, Mr. Bishop, have not you got something that you could cover over her"—(when she came into my room she had her clothes on and a bonnet but no jacket or shawl)—he made some remark to Mrs. Parsons but what it was I do-not know and I did not turn my head round—I took no further notice of the deceased—soon after Mrs. Parsons left my <hi rend="italic">room to go upstairs Mrs. Lynch came in</hi>, and I <hi rend="italic">left</hi> her there.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I live at 33, Dean Street—on 20th September, about 8.30 I was called to 13, Princess Road, and found the body of a female lying on the bed—she had been dead three or four hours, and possibly longer—the body was rigid and quite cold—I found a wound an inch long on the right side of the top of the head, and there were marks of blows on the head, it appeared to me an indefinite number—hardly any blood had flowed from the wound—there was a bruise on the left side of the forehead, a bruise on the centre of the forehead, and a smaller bruise on the top of the right side of the forehead, a severe bruise on the left shoulder, several marks on the left upper and fore arm, and the hand was blackened to the ends of the fingers from effused blood—there were nine or ten bruises and abrasions on the back, as if the blow which made the bruise had been rough enough to rub the skin off—an abrasion breaks the scarf skin or cuticle—there was a severe bruise on the left hip, and over the right knee-cap were three or four scratches, and others just above the hip on the left side—there were marks of injuries, more or less developed, over the whole of the body—I received the Coroner's order, and on the Monday made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on the removal of the scalp there was considerable effusion of blood into the tissues over the skull, over the whole front, side and back, and left half of the skull, which was unusually thick,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260057"></xptr>
               <p>and it was not fractured—the membranes covering the brain were very much congested, the middle membrane or <hi rend="italic">arachnoids</hi> was milky, which proved that she had been of intemperate habits—the effusion of blood on the left half of the skull, was connected with the external bruise over that part—the brain generally was much congested, and the lateral ventricle contained about two ounces of fluid blood, which had gravitated to the base of the skull, I traced it up to the left lateral ventricle—on opening the chest the left pleural cavity contained about a pint of blood—it is called a cavity but it is filled by the lung—there, were old adhesions, showing that she had had pre-existing disease—I found the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh. ribs broken, and the eighth and eleventh were broken in two places—a splinter from the fractured sixth rib had penetrated the lungs, corresponding to which was an external bruise—that was the cause of the effusion of blood into the cavity—there was also an external injury immediately over the double fracture of the eighth and eleventh ribs, one of which had taken place close up to the spine—there was a circumscribed bruise on the front surface of the stomach', which was full of a dark substance composed of fluids and solids—the heart was degenerated from fatty infiltration, and the liver was much enlarged—the other organs were natural—the immediate cause of death was the effusion of blood into the brain, which arose from the blow on the head—I take it that the last blow was given a very short space of time before death, in consequence of there being no hemorrhage—bleeding ceases at death—I do not think that could have been caused by a kick, I think it took place when she was thrown on to the staircase; it is con<lb></lb>sistent with it—the blow which caused death must have been almost imme<lb></lb>diate I do not think it could have been given several hours before—the other bruises were caused by direct violence, and I think they must have been done before death; if a man has got a dead body before him he cannot produce bruises such as I saw, it must be done before death—the other injuries were done a very short time before death, because the injury to the lung would have let out a large quantity of blood, which would have filled the whole pleural cavity if life had not failed—the blood I saw on the lung was not sufficient to cause death; a person might survive for days, and even might recover, because a person can live with one lung.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no doubt that the immediate cause of death was the injury to the head—that injury might have been caused by anything—if the blow was struck between 7 and 8 o'clock it would not have been possible for her to have lived several hours—I am perfectly certain that she could not have walked and talked after the infusion of blood into the brain—that follows as a matter of course—the infusion does not follow immedi<lb></lb>ately upon the injury—it is possible that a considerable interval may have elapsed between the blow and the effusion taking place—almost all things are possible in medicine—I do not think the injury to the top of the head was the result of a kick—to my mind the cause I give preference to was the throwing on the stairs—there must have been a projecting point to cause a clean incised wound—if a man was violently pursuing a woman and she fell on the stairs, she would be more likely to have a severe wound than if she fell from her own weight only—the external evidence of the bruises, the discolouration, had almost disappeared at the time I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I do not know that the bruises I saw on Sunday morning were the result of recent blows—in a bruise you may identify the time it has existed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260058"></xptr>
               <p>by the change of colour at the circumference—nearly all the braises exhibited the same appearance—I said before the Magistrate "Nearly all the bruises were consistent with her falling about," and I say that now, with the exception of the fractured ribs—putting aside the fractured ribs, the appearances on her body were consistent with her falling about—the ribs were not all broken at one time, there were at least four or five different impacts—it is a most unusual thing to break the eighth and eleventh ribs in two places; it requires perfectly direct violence, and over the eighth and eleventh ribs there were external appearances—I did not identify the other fractures and abrasions in the same way as I did the case of the eighth and eleventh ribs, because they attracted my attention in a professional point of view—from the appearance of the liver, and the milky appearance of the brain, I am of opinion that she was given to drinking, and people are nearly always subject to outbursts of violent temper when they have that milky condition of the membranes of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The wound at the top of the head could have existed only a very few seconds without effusion of blood; it certainly could not have existed several hours—before the effusion of blood she might have become senseless from the concussion; the blow would cause insensibility, and then the effusion would take place—I believe the insensibility commenced directly after the blow—she would not bo able to walk and talk after the blow.</p>

I live at 7, Tower Street—on Saturday, 19th Sep<lb></lb>tember, between 5 and C o'clock, I was in Little Earl Street, and saw a woman there with a crutch, who deliberately hit another woman on the head with the mallet end of her crutch, saying "Take that you beast"—I knew her before, and her sister, but I do not know their names—they both fell together, and she sat on the ground without her crutch—they were not haying hold of one another when they fell; the one with the crutch fell by the force of the blow—the <hi rend="italic">drunkest</hi> fell uppermost; she was the one with out the crutch—they did nothing when they fell; they lay like a couple of logs for a minute or two—I really mean that—they did not struggle on the ground, because the post was between them—I left my barrow and picked up the one with the crutch—she said "Go away from me you b——y <hi rend="italic">so and so</hi>," mentioning the name I go by—a woman picked up the other one—I do not know whether she is here.'</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lloyd's Court, Crown Street, Soho—on Saturday 19th September, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I saw a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in Earl Street, and saw a woman with a crutch knock the deceased down with the big end of her crutch, it struck her on the right side of head or on her right shoulder, I don't know which, and she staggered and fell—I knew Ford, she was a very drunken woman and very excitable, often fighting with her own sister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The woman with the crutch walked away as soon as she struck the blow and then came back again—she did not tumble, nor did they squabble on the ground or anything of that sort—Ford fell on her back and got up again, but not directly—somebody helped her up and she walked to the corner of Earl Street and Dudley Street, and the one with the crutch followed her again, and she ran away and said that she would not fight any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Cock, Grafton Street, Soho—I have known the prisoner for 12 years—he has always borne the character of a humane and kindly disposed man—I saw him and Ford in ray house on Saturday, 19th September—I believe they both left at 10.15—I particularly noticed the prisoner because he was going to another house to a friendly meeting to get up subscriptions. for the benefit of a <hi rend="italic">friend</hi>

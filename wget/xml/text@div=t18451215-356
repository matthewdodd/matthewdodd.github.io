                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Lambeth-walk. On the evening of the 5th of Dec, at half-past five o'clock, I was at my window, which was open—I saw the prisoner come by, and two other boys with him—he took a piece of bacon—I hallooed to him, and he went off—I ran and took him—I asked for the bacon—he said he had not got it—I looked, and found it down by his feet.</p>

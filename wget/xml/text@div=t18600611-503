                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Harry Emanuel—I recollect two persons coming in to our shop—I recollect the male prisoner perfectly well, and the female to the best of my belief—it was at the com<lb></lb>mencement of January, I believe the 3d, near about 4 o'clock—there was a great deal of jewellery on the counter; amongst the jewellery there was a diamond locket—it was towards the end of the counter or table—the female prisoner moved about from one end to the other; at last she stopped at the left end of the counter—when they came in they asked to see some lockets—they were shown a great many; they were not expensive enough, and they were shown some more expensive—after a long time they ordered two diamond and turquoise lockets and earrings to match—they would amount to from 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they wished it to be done by a certain time as they were leaving for America—I mentioned the names of one or two Americans, and the male prisoner said he knew them perfectly well, in fact, he said, he had brought a watch of ours over from an American gentleman, a customer of ours—we asked him if we should send for it—he said, "Oh no, I will bring it the next time I come"—he gave his address as Portland-place—he wrote the name and address down in a book; I have not got the book here, I do not recollect the name—I think it was Pearce, he wrote it himself in the book—I can fetch the book—while he was writing, his hand trembled very much, he said, "You see my hand shakes very much, I was at the opera last night and a diamond was stolen out of my pin"—I noticed that he wearing a pin without a stone or anything in it—the female prisoner had a muff with her which she placed on the counter, she opened some cases and said, "Oh, these are empty"—she then moved her muff to another part of the counter, and finally placed it at one part opposite to where the locket was—no other customer came in after they left, except a relation of Mr. Emanuers—after the prisoners left, the boxes were closed and in due time taken down into the strong room and locked up for the night—the loss of the locket was discovered next morning—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a silk dress produced by the officer</hi>) this is the same material and the same pattern as the dress the female came in this pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is similar to that which the male prisoner had in his scarf without any stone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and diamond merchant, carrying on business in the Palais Royal, in Paris—in March last the two prisoners entered my shop—I can speak to the man, and I believe it was the woman—the man pointed out some opera glasses—he did not speak at all—I showed him some, and asked him if he spoke English—he said, "Yes," only—I showed him some others and asked if they were to his taste—he did not answer at all, he only pointed to some others—he bought an opera glass at last for 20 francs, and then he looked at the counter, where two ladies were—he paid the 20 francs—I told him I would give him a case to put it in, of the value of 5 francs, and he ran out of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I have examined the jewels produced by Whicher—some of the larger ones correspond with the diamonds that were on the locket that was lost—they are all City made; all made in Clerkenwell; what we call City goods—they are not so well done as at the west end; there is not the same care bestowed on them.</p>

My Girl used to go thither every Morning to fetch me a quarter of an Ounce of Tea; but I always sent Money for it. The Prisoner came to me one Night with some Fish in her Hand, and something wrapt up in three Papers. She seem'd to be a little in Drink, and said she had dropt one of her Papers; and therefore desired me to take care of the Fish and the other Papers, while she went back to see for it. I look'd into the Papers when she was gone, and found that there was little Sugar'd Kings in them. She came again and fetch'd them away; but whether she carry'd them to a Customer, or did any thing else with them, I cannot tell; tho' I never heard that Mrs. Coxeter had laid any thing to the Prisoner's Charge, till she had been to a Fortune-teller in the Old Baily, who described a little black Woman to her.</p>

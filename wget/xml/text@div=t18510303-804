                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Bull, at East Sheen. On 7th Feb. I put a pair of boots under a settle in one corner of the tap-room, where the prisoner sat, about five o'clock in the afternoon; and I saw him there at eleven that night, and at that time I saw my boots safe—I then went to put up the shutters—when I came back the prisoner was gone, but he came back again, and finished his beer—I missed my boots the next morning—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

               <p>I am certain these are my boots—I was not uncertain when I was before the Magistrate—the case was remanded that the shoemaker might be there—I saw my boots again on the Monday after I lost them, in the prisoner's room—he was in custody—the officer took them away—the shoemaker would not swear to the boots; he did not like to do it—I had worn them a little better than three months—I know them because the stiffeners of both were down inside, and the tips of the plates were off—I have no doubt these are mine—I inquired about them the next day.</p>

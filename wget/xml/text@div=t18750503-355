                  </hi>. I live at 18, Belvidere Road, Lambeth, and have known the prisoner for about three years—I am an unfortunate and she is too—we both frequent the neighbourhood of the Strand—I remember the 16th March—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner on that day or previously—as I went down the Waterloo Road the prisoner said I had taken away a gentleman friend from her and I begged her pardon—that was two nights before—on the 16 March I saw the prisoner about 9.30 in the evening in the Strand—I was told to get into a cab as she was going to stab me—I was just getting in when the man who was living with the prisoner pulled me out and knocked me down on my back in the road, close by the pavement—the prisoner bent over me with a white-handled knife, and I felt a sharp instrument in me, here and here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the head</hi>)—I was taken to the hospital—the surgeon dressed my head that night—I went again the day but one after wards, I remained for some time, till the '6th April.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been charged frequently at Bow Street with speaking to gentlemen—I have not been charged with* assaults that I know of—girls quarrel sometimes—I have been charged with loitering and speak<lb></lb>ing to gentlemen; nothing more—I had not repeated quarrels with the prisoner before this night—she accused me of taking a gentleman friend from her and said she would make me suffer for it—the man who pulled me out of the cab has gone to Ireland, because the warrant was against him and the woman too—I didn't say I was on the pavement—I fainted away—I saw a white-handled knife—she threw herself on the top of me—she struck me, and as she struck me I felt a sharp pain—no search was made for the knife at the time—I don't know how I got to the hospital—I was taken there—I never accused anyone else of stabbing me first of all, but Elizabeth Crawley—since giving the prisoner into custody I was met one night and used very badly—the policeman did not go with me and charge Elizabeth Crawley with stabbing me—he went to Annie Rowland—I was thought better after I was first taken to the hospital and let go away—I did not go to a policeman that night and tell him I thought the woman who stabbed</p>

                  </hi>. I met Clara Davis on the 16th March at 8.30—I was with her from half to three-quarters of an hour in the Strand—this woman's man came up and pulled Clara Davis out of the cab and said "Now, Annie, stab her," and she struck her, and she fell to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> ground—I did not see any knife—I saw her bleeding and I went to the hospital with her and saw her wounds bound up—she did not strike the prisoner first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was not a general row there—there-were about fifteen people" or twenty—there was no quarrelling whatever, no excitement—when the young woman fell to the ground a good many people ran up—and heard me say "I believe you are stabbed, Clara," and I received a black eye for saying so—I am quite sure there was a cab there, and I saw her pulled out of the cab—I gave the prosecutrix a shilling to go into the cab.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM TAYLOR</hi>. I am house surgeon at the Charing Cross Hospital—I attended Davis on the 18th March—I did not see her when she came on the 16th—there is no one here who did—there was only a day intervening—it. was late on the night of the 16th—she was brought in on the. morning of the 18th—she had an incised wound on the top. and left side of the head—she had also some super-ficial cuts on the ear and a punctured wound at the angle of the mouth, on the right side—the punctured wound was inflamed and swollen—he became very much worse after admission, and a large abscess formed on the cheek—after being in the hospital nearly three weeks she was discharged cured on the 6th April—I should say the injuries had been inflicted from 24 to 36 hours—that would be about the time-from 9.30 on the 16th March—I should say the wounds could not have been-caused by a blunt instrument—it must have been a sharp and a pointed knife most likely, not a blow or fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Falling on atones or a projection would not cause a punctured wound like that—I think a sharp piece: of flint or stone might have caused one of them—there was one punctured wound and two cuts on the ear—I think if the wound had been caused by falling on the stone pavement with any sharp projection that there would have been some con<lb></lb>tilsion—rthe other wound was an incised wound—it is hardly possible that the wounds could have been caused by sharp stones.</p>

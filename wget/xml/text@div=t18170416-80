On the 4th of March, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I went into my yard. I saw the prisoner there with Stanley, my hostler. He said the coachmen gave him leave to lay down there. The gates had been shut since seven o'clock-there is a porter there to let people in and out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Any person could get in in the day-time. The carriage belonged to Colonel Staples-it had not been used for sometime. I had seen it the same day, but do not know whether the glass was stolen, or not. He might have had leave to lay down there.</p>

            . I am hostler to Mr. Arlett. About half-past eleven o'clock at night, the dog barked very much, which induced me to look under the carriage; I found the prisoner there - He said the coachmen had given him leave to lay down there, the coachmen said, they had not. I found the glass was taken out of its proper place, and laid on the seat, in the carriage-the carriage had not been moved for months before; the holder appeared to be fresh cut.</p>

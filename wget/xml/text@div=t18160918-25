               <p>CATHERINE LUCAS. On the 27th of June last, I was going to <placeName id="t18160918-25-crimeloc145">Newington</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18160918-25-crimeloc145" type="placeName" value="Newington"></interp>

I met three men; I don't know whether the prisoner was one of them; one took the bundle from my arm; he went a few steps, and it fell; I went and tried to pick it up, and got my hand upon it, and one of them gave me a push, and I fell down. He got it up again, and ran away. I ran after him a little way; I did-not overtake him. One of the others asked me what I wanted, and I told him I wanted my bundle, and be made no answer. He did not binder me from running. Then the two other men ran after Copsey. I then went on towards Newington; they went Islington way. I next saw two of the men at about twenty minutes before two; they were then taken into custody; the prisoner was not either of those, they were tried and convicted here. When I got across the fields almost to Newington, I met a young man; he asked me if I was frightened at the cows, and I told him I was not; I told him I had been pushed down by three men, and he went after them. The things mentioned in the indictment were in the bundle; they belonged to Miss Parker; I was to take them to Dr. Gascoigne's; Miss Parker was going there on a visit; she is eight years old.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN CLARK. I am a cow-keeper. I saw the prosecutrix in our field on the day in the indictment; I was milking a cow at the time. She looked frightened, and I asked her if she was frightened at the cows, and she said she was not; but had been knocked down, and robbed of her bundle. I saw the prisoner pass me along with two more before; he was a stranger; I did not know his name; but I had seen his person before; I can speak with certainty as to him; I had seen him about ten minutes before; in that very field where the girl said she had been knocked down; I had seen him numbers of times before about London streets when I go with my milk. I am certain of his person. When she complained to me, this man and the other two were out of my sight. Shortly before she complained, they passed me, going in a direction, in which she soon afterwards came. I saw no other party of three go that way, about that time. I raised an alarm, after the men. There were other persons milking in our field. I, at last, got sight of them; when I saw the prisoner again, the two others were in company with him. I had got about a mile and a half from this field; I got sight of them up in lslington fields; I saw them under a tree, and they were tying the bundle up in an apron; they were standing; then they went on again, and we ran after them; I had got another young man with me; they walked on; they did not see us. When we came up near them, we hallooed out stop thief; they looked round then, and ran a little way, and then threw the bundle down; all three looked round; I stooped to pick the bundle up; but the other young man picked it up first. I pursued after the men; I then missed the prisoner; he got away for the time, and I did not see him again that day. I next saw him in two or three days after about Shoreditch; I did not cause him to be apprehended; I saw him several times after; I took no steps to cause him to be apprehended. I saw him in custody about eight weeks after. I gave information to Mr. Yardley, that I knew the man; he belongs to Worship-street, and I saw the prisoner in custody in about two months. I knew him then to be one of the men that I saw in the field where this girl was robbed. When the bundle was picked up, it had an apron round it then. I did not particularly notice that the prisoner or his companions had an apron with them when they first passed me. The person who picked up the bundle is not here.</p>

            . After Kennedy told the prisoner what he took him for, I searched him; but found nothing on him. He asked me what they would do with him since the other two had been tried; I told him I knew nothing about the other two, nor him neither; and I said, you must know best yourself whether you were amongst them; he said, he never should deny but what he was there, but he never touched the girl, nor never laid a hand upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going along, I met these two lads, but I never intended to have committed a robbery nor any thing of that kind.</p>

Hearing the prisoner had sold one, and knowing the prisoner had none of his own, (he lodged at my house) I mistrusted it must be he that took mine, so I went to the house in Wapping where he had sold the watch, and the woman inform'd me she had bought a watch of the prisoner, but that she had sold it again.</p>

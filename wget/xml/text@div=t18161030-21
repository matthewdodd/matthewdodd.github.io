I only know a preceding fact to the robbery, which is, that at the latter end of August, or beginning of September last, the prisoner came into my shop, and enquired for a person of the name of Brown. I told him I had no such person in my employ. That is all I know.</p>

            . I know the person of the man at the bar. On the 10th of September last he came into Mr. Vernell's warehouse, and asked me if Mr. Vernell was at home. I told him he was not. There was a piece of Mazarene sarsnet and a piece of drab lustring on the counter. They were within his reach. He told me to look into the back warehouse, and look for the name of Brown. I went into the back warehouse, and just turned over a leaf or two of the weaver's book, and came back again. I am sure it was the name of Brown he made use of. I then returned to the front warehouse again. The prisoner was still there. I told him I could find no such name. He said yes, he was sure there was, and I must go and look again. I went again, for I thought it was of consequence. He appeared respectably dressed. I was not gone the second time more than ten minutes at farthest. I could see no such name. I then returned, and the prisoner was gone. The lustring was there still, but the sarsnet gone. There were sixty-seven yards of it. I ran out of doors directly, but could not see the prisoner. I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

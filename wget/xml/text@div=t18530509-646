                  </hi>. I have been in the employ of Mr. George Hill; he is a, pork butcher, at Woolwich. The prisoner was a foreman—I remember his showing me a piece of bacon—it was in the smoke hole, in the back part of Mr. Hill's premises—there was from eight to twelve pounds; it was part of a tide—he said he bought it of Mr. Hill, and he was going to smoke it for himself, and asked me if I would keep it for him—he gave it to me the next morning—I took it home, locked it up in a box, and kept it till Sunday—I took it on Wednesday—on the Sunday following Sheppard called for it, and I gave it him—there was no pork given to me at any time, nor any rabbits, only to take down stairs, on Mr. Hill's premises, nothing to take home—when the prisoner gave me the pork to take down he told me be would have that for dinner to-morrow—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to take care of the bacon—when he told me he had bought it of my master I believed him, and that was the reason I took it home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pork butcher, at Woolwich. The prisoner has been in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> employ seven months; he first came on 1st Sept. last—he was foreman—I did not sell him a piece of bacon a month before he was taken into custody—I never sold him anything at any time—I never gave him permission to take bacon off the premises—I know the piece of bacon that has been found to be mine—I have tasted some off the same piece—it was cured on my premises by the prisoner—it corresponds with other pieces, it is cut in a peculiar way—I never sold it to the prisoner, or authorized him to take it away—the boy is a very honest lad—this piece weighs from five to six pounds—I expect it had weighed from ten to fourteen pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has this man been in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven months; he was the entire manager—he managed all my affairs, so far as the business went—I attended the shop—he never used to purchase his Sunday dinner from me—I have not sold him rabbits, nor a fowl—I never at any time sold him two Ostend rabbits, I am sure.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police constable</hi>). I took the prisoner into custody—I told him he was charged with stealing a piece of bacon from Mr. George Hill—he said it was all spite on the part of the boy—I had not said a word to him about the boy—I went to where he lived, at North Woolwich, and I found a piece of bacon and a part of knuckle of pork (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a driller, at Poplar. On Monday, 26th June, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I and my wife were in the Poplar-road, coming from Limehouse—I saw the deceased coming down the East India-road, which is between Poplar and Limehouse—he was coming towards me on the path—he was intoxicated—the prisoner Came from towards the Cape of Good Hope, which is close at hand, and knocked the deceased's hat off with his hand—the deceased had a bit of green in his hat—he did not attempt to pick up his hat, but made a kick at the prisoner—I cannot say whether he did kick him or not, but the prisoner seemed to fall on his hands—he got up, and struck the deceased with his fist—I cannot say exactly whether he hit him on the forehead, but the deceased fell right down at my feet, on the flags—he seemed to fall on his side—the prisoner ran away—I picked up the deceased, and saw a wound in the right side of his forehead</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184811270036"></xptr>
               <p>—he was insensible—the wound was on the same side as that on which he fell—his shoulder came in contact with the ground first, and the side of his head then came in contact with the ground; he then turned on his back, as if insensible—I helped to take him to the doctor's—he was taken to the hospital, as he was so intoxicated we could not find out who he belonged to—I recognized his dead body at the hospital, about three weeks afterwards.</p>

On Monday evening, 26th June, I was with him in the Poplar-road—I saw a man walking in the road, whom I did not know before, and I saw the prisoner towards the East India-road; I had seen him before, but did not know much of him—I saw him meet the deceased, and knock his hat off—the deceased turned round, and made a kick at him—I cannot say that he hit him—the prisoner fell, got up again, made a blow at the deceased, hit him in the face across the fore<lb></lb>head, and he fell directly on his right shoulder, on the flag pavement—my husband went to him, and lifted him up—he was lying on his shoulder and side—his forehead was bleeding very much, and he was insensible—I had not heard a word said before the prisoner knocked his hat off—the deceased was taken to the hospital—I saw him at the hospital, dead, three weeks after—I then recognized him as the same man.</p>

I will read the warrant to you"—I did so—ho then said, "I did not strike him, I merely pushed him with my open hand; he came <hi rend="italic">squaring</hi> up to me, and he fell; some people</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital. The deceased was brought there on the evening of 26th June—I attended him—he had a contused wound about an inch, above the left eyebrow—it had bled—it was about half an inch in length, and penetrated to the bone—it was a most common wound, such as we see every day, not serious at all—he remained in the hospital, and went on very well, until the 6th of July—erysi<lb></lb>pelas then extended from the wound, and he got worse; the brain became affected, and he died—erysipelas is a common consequeuce of a blow on the head—it certainly was in consequence of this wound, and of that he died—he was very drunk when he came in—I heard that he had been in the habit of drinking a great deal—I did not know him before—a fist would not have pro<lb></lb>duced such a wound; there would have been contusion all round, and a dif<lb></lb>ferent wound altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe that people who are of intemperate habits are much more liable to have erysipelas come on from a wound than others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear the witnesses describe the way in which the man came to the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—whether that fall could cause this wound, would depend on how much of the force of the fall was taken off by the shoulder coming to the ground first; if the whole weight of the body was received on the shoulder first, then the mere fact of the head coming to the ground would not have produced the wound, but if the fall was not much broken the corner of a flag-stone might have produced it.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

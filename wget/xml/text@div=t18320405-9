               <p>CHARLOTTE COLE.

            . I am a private watchman. On Sunday night, the 11th of December, about ten minutes past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner with Kite, Seth, and Bunce, coming up Bell-lane, towards Church-street; Kite said,"Good night,,' and I said, "Good night;" I saw nothing more till about half-past four o'clock in the morning, when I was going by the Queen's Head-yard, and heard footsteps - I went into the yard, and saw Kite and the prisoner standing at the stable door; I said, "Halloo, Kite, what are you up to here?" he said, "Is that you, Jem? why, to tell you the truth, I have been drinking a great deal of beer, and it has filled me with * * *;" I saw two metal tea-pots close to Kite's feet - Davis stood close to him; I asked if they were going to remain in the stable for the rest of the night - they said Yes, they were; I went away to my own yard, which is about fifteen yards off; Kite came and called me three times Jem, but I made no answer; I crept into the wash-house, and he came and looked into my yard, and went into the stable again - I then thought I would go back, and as I went I heard something fall; I instantly ran into the yard, sprang my rattle, and called Thieves! and Robbers! - four men directly ran out of the stable; I called Kite and Davis by name, as they passed me, and said I could swear to them, as I knew them before - I am sure of them; I then went into the stable, and found the property all strewed about; I had a bull's eye lantern - I could see the tea-pot and how it was marked; it appeared a metal tea-pot, but it was taken away; I found a barometer in the stable, also a pair of pictures, a teacaddy, and other things - I took possession of the property, and gave it to Neale: the Queen's Head is about a quarter of a mile from Cole's; the plate has never been found.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler, and live near the Queen's Head, at Twickenham. On the Monday morning, at a quarter-past four o'clock, I went to the Queen's Head stable, and observed a quantity of linen, a barometer, a pair of pictures, and a tea-caddy; Webb gave them into my care while he went for a constable - I had seen two men run by my window, but cannot say whether the prisoner was one.</p>

            . On the 11th of December I and Seth went to the Bell public-house; the prisoner came in and drank with us - he spoke to Seth, and then spoke to me; he told me Mrs. Cole was out, and asked if I and Seth would go with him, and break Mrs. Cole's house open; he proposed to meet in the evening, and we all met that evening at the Queen's Head, between five and six o'clock, staid there some time, then went to the Two Sawyers, and then to the Bells, where we stopped till about ten minutes past twelve o'clock - during that time Seth had spoken to Kite about going, and we all four came away - Davis and I went through the church-yard, and stopped for Kite and Seth; we then proceeded to Mrs. Cole's house - we sat in the summer-house till we heard the watchman call half-past twelve o'clock - Seth then went and attempted to break in at the back of the house, but not gaining an entrance he came to the front parlour window, and opened it; we all came up to him - he wrenched the bar of the shutter -Davis, Seth, and Kite went inside; I waited outside, and in about two hours they brought some parcels out to me; they then went into the house again, and had not been in long before their light went out - they came out, and got another light, went back, and came out with the barometer and other articles; the articles produced were brought out to me - I put them in the summer-house till we all came away together, and took them to the Queen's Head stable: Davis went with us; I saw Webb in about five minutes - the things were then about the stable; part of them stood outside the stable door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written,) I humbly throw myself on your mercy, and implore your humano consideration of these circumstances, which are the truth. On the Saturday night the robbery took place, I was at the Eight Bells, at Twickenham, till eleven o'clock - I drank more than I ought, and on getting home found the door fastened, and went to a barge belonging to Mr. Kerby; on going over a plank to the harge, I slipped into the water, and laid all night in the cabin in wet clothes - I went home in the morning, and about four o'clock was wiping my wet stockings when the watchman came up; I returned to the barge, finding it was so early - I then went into Hampshire to work at my sister's; I do not know why Bunce should accuse me of the robbery, except from a knowledge that I was not in my father's house that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to THOMAS BUNCE. Q. Did you not sell the plate? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man who bought it give you 5l. 10s. for it? A. I never had a farthing of the property.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

(The coat produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me take that coat? - No, I see you running with the coat.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was he from the waggon when you first saw him? - About half an hundred yards or it may be an hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else between you and him that could have taken it and dropped it? - No.</p>
               <p>- HONIBORNE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was standing at the John of Jerusalem the end of Aylesbury-street, and I saw Osland go by; about ten minutes afterwards I saw him return with a coat under his arm, and I heard the cry of stop thief! and I ran out, and he throwed the coat at the prosecutor, and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him throw the coat? - Yes, and I asked him how he came by it, he made me some very frivolous answers, I cannot say what he said, he was rather frightened at the time. I saw him throw the coat from his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up St. John-street, just as I got to Woodbridge-street, a man ran out before me, and just as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110027"></xptr>got up there, I saw that coat lay up by the side, and then one man laid hold of me and said you have got my coat, and I gave it him; the man ran right across the way, right over.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him an excellent character.</p>

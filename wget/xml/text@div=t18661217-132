               <p>Ludgate Hill—I live on the premises—Messrs Coode and Co, solicitors, have offices on the first and second floors—on the 20th November, about half-past nine at night, the bell rang, and I went down to the door—the prisoner put a parcel in my hand, and said there was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay—it was tied up in this paper, with a railway ticket twisted under the string—I took it to Mr. Cullis, Mr. Coode's clerk, on the second floor—I gave it to him and saw him open it—from something he said to me, I came down again and said to the prisoner, "Where is your book?"—he said that his mate had got the book, and was minding the horse and cart at the corner of Farringdon Street—I asked him to come in to see Mr. Cullis—he said that he would not come in, as he wanted to keep his eye on the horse and cart—Mr. Cullis then came down and entered into conversation with him—the prisoner said he would go and see whether his mate was coming home with the horse and cart—he walked away rather briskly in the direction of Fleet Street—I followed him as far as the Belle Sauvage Yard—he turned round and saw I was following him, and commenced running—I ran and caught him, and brought him back to 62, Ludgate Hillwhen Mr. Cullis gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs Coode and Co—on this night the last witness brought me up a parcel tied up very carefully with a piece of twine, and this railway ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) twisted round the twine, professing to come from Dublin—it was too heavy for a soli<lb></lb>citor to receive, and I thought it was not papers or deeds, opened it, and found a lot of waste paper and butter paper wrapped round this brick—I told Jobbins to go down and detain the messenger till I went down—I went down and said to him, "Did you bring this parcel?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What is the charge?"—he said, "Half a crown, Sir,"—I said, "I suppose you will want the book signed"—he said, "Yes, Sir, but my mate has got it round the corner in a cart; he will be up in a minute or two"—I asked him if he was in the company's employ—he said, "Yes, Sir"—he then began to rub his hands and dance about, and remarked that it was a very cold night—he then said that he would go and see for his mate, and walked down Ludgate Hill towards Farringdon Street—I said to Jobbins, "He means to be off; you had better follow him"—Jobbins walked slowly after him, and he was brought back.</p>

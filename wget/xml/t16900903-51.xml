               Writing, Printing and publishing a most pernicious, scandalous, Seditious and Notorious Libel (on the th of July last, and at divers other times as well before as after) against the King and Government, Entituled a Letter to the Lord Bishop of Satum in answer to his Lordship's Pastoral Letter. In which scandalous Libel there are many Treasonable Sentences. There were many other very reflecting Sentences said against him, that he made use of to support his Designs, which was purely and indeed to Raise Rebellion and Discord between the King and People, on purpose to set the Nation into a Flame, and to cause them to cut each others Throats
            </rs>; which was more fully laid open against him by the King's Counsel, and the whole Court, telling him, That he ought to have been Indicted of High Treason, and that his Message to the World (as he was a Clergyman) was to preach the glad Tidings of Peace and Salvation, but instead of that he had done all he could to perswade Men, That unless they repent, and bring in King James again, they were all damned. All this was fully proved against him, as also the Writing, Printing and Publishing of the Book or Letter, which in all contained 5 Sheets and a half of Paper, about 400 of which were found in his Custody. Now for the Vindication of himself he had little to say, only urged, That he writ to the Bishop, to beg his Advice and fatherly Instruction; and that if he had offended by it and mistook his measures, he was heatrily sorry for it,(on the like): so after a Fair Hearing the Jury found him <rs id="t16900903-51-verdict223" type="verdictDescription">

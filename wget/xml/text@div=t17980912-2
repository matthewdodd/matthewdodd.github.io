The prisoners came to my shop on the 14th of February last, about four o'clock in the afternoon, in a hackney coach; there were two ladies in the shop looking at some black veils, there was nobody to attend the shop but myself, I served the two ladies, and they went away; I had taken the veils out of a trunk where I keep my goods, the goods at that time were all smooth and right; the short one, Williams, sat down on a stool by the end of the trunk, which was shut; the other prisoner stood between me and her that I could not see what she was about; I heard the lid of the trunk open, and they seemed to be in a hurry to get away; I came round and sold them a little bit of lace, they then went away in the coach; I went to put the veils to rights, and return them into the trunk, and then I saw the goods all scattered about, and rumpled, and then I missed eight British veils made of silk, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120004"></xptr>cost me eight pounds, and a great many crownings that are used for children's caps; there were forty or fifty of them gone, they were worth about six pounds. I saw no more of them till they came to my shop again on the 19th of July, there was another with them then; they walked in, and asked to look at some lace hanging in the window. I knew them directly; they bought nothing, and went away; as soon as they were gone, Mr. Rivett the officer came in, and I went with him and took them up, but we could not find any thing, because they gave a wrong direction.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you counted the veils over? - A. Not for some time; but I am sure they were all right when they came in.</p>

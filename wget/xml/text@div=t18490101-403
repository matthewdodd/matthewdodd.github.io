                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, at 22, King-street, Long-acre. About half-past eleven o'clock on the night of 9th Dec, the prisoner came for four eggs; I served him, and he gave me a good half-crown—I gave him four halfpence, two sixpences, and one shilling, change—he took up the change, and said, "What eggs have you there?"—I said, "Penny ones"—he said, "they are not the eggs I want, I want four for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "These are the best I have got"—he said, "they will not do for me then"—I was going to give him the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he objected, saying, he would have his half-crown back—he put back the change I gave him, and on taking it up, I said, "I will swear this is not the shilling I gave you"—it was a bad one—he said it was the shilling, for he had not another about him—I picked up the money, and was going to send for a policeman, when he snatched the money again out of my hand, and put down the good shilling I had first given him, and then he said, "So help me God, I have not got another shilling about me"—Bashford, the policeman, then came in, and he was given into custody—I saw him searched in the shop, and three good shillings found upon him—he was afterward discharged by the Magistrate, because the bad shilling was not found.</p>

             (Police-constable N 149). I went to Mr. Wade's on Sunday morning, the 23rd of December; I found a pair of boots and a pair of shoes there, which I have had ever since - I have since tried the shoes on Taylor; they fitted him exactly, and he said he had no doubt they would fit - we wanted to try the boots on Game - he said if we wanted them tried we might try them ourselves; there is no doubt but they would have fitted him, but he kept moving his leg about, and would not let us try them.</p>
               <p>MR. WADE. These boots and shoes were left in my house - they are not mine, nor never were.</p>

            . They did not belong to any person in Mr. Wade's house; I never saw them till the morning after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Game's Defence. When they wanted to put the boots on me, I told them to put them on - they tried ten minutes, and grazed my skin - they then said it was my obstinacy, and that I would not put them on; I made no resistance - I held my leg still.</p>
               <p>Rogers' Defence. The boots they took from me I bought in Sheffield, before I came into this country; all the tools they found at my place were there when I went there.</p>

               <p>Taylor. I should like to ask Mr. Wade if he could swear to these shoes, if a dozen pairs were produced bound in the same way, and worn as they are.</p>
               <p>MR. WADE. I can swear to these shoes by the binding and mending.</p>
               <p>Taylor. A shoemaker mends them all in the same man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030010"></xptr>ner; if you go to Monmouth-street you might buy a dozen pairs like them.</p>
               <p>Jackson's Defence. I bought the women's boots of a man who came to a lodger.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. Martin's lane. At half-past six o'clock, on the 5th of December, I was waiting opposite Exeter Hall, to get admission, with my wife and daughter—I turned round to speak to my wife on the left-hand, and my coat was opened on the right—I turned, and the prisoner was close to my side—he had hold of my guard-chain and watch—I said, "You rascal, you have robbed me of my watch"—he said, "You are mistaken," and ran round a coach—I followed and took him, without losing sight of him, and took him into a shop—he was searched, but the watch was not found—he had not taken my guard-chain off.</p>

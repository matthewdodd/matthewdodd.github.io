On Monday, 11th May, about 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked me to show him a case of watches which was in the window—it was a small wooden case—I took it from the window, and put it on the counter; he took the case up, which being rather an unusual thing; my suspicions were excited, and I went to the side of the counter, which does not go to the window, took the case from his hand, and put it on the glass case on the counter—he took up a watch, and asked the price—I said, "Eight guineas"—there were three gold watches and three silver ones in the case—he replaced the watch, and took up another, inquired the price, and put it back again, and took up the case again, but I held it—he had been about ten minutes in the shop, when the shop door was opened by some person outside, who called out, "What, ho!" upon which the prisoner snatched the case out of my hand—I opened the little door, and struck his wrist to make him drop the case, and two watches sprang out of it, and were left on the floor—the prisoner rushed out of the shop, the door being open, taking the case and four watches, worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

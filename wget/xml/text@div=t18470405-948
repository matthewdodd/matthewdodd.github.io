                  </hi> I am an outfitter, and live in High-street, Shadwell. On the 13th of March the prisoner brought an advance note for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi> to me, and desired to have it cashed—I looked at it, and said, "How is it, that you being a carpenter of a ship, only have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>?"—he said he had had a month's advance, and Mr. Stocker had cashed it for him on account of the ship being delayed and her voyage altered—the captain had agreed to give him another half-month's advance—I asked if he had joined the ship—he said, "Yes, several days ago"—that his tools were on board, and that he wanted it partly in money and partly in goods—I was a long while before I acceded to it, it not being payable till after the ship left Ireland—he offered to allow me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi> if I would cash it, and after consideration I agreed—I desired him to put his name on the back of it, which he did—I let him have a monkey jacket and a sovereign.</p>

                  </hi> I am a licensed shipping-agent. I know Captain Chambers of the <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi>—George Tegg is the owner—I know the ship—she has gone to Ireland—I shipped the prisoner on board as carpenter on the</p>

               <p>13th of March, and gave him this advance note, which he was to take to the captain to get his signature to it—he knew where the captain lived—he did not return to the ship after—the signature, "James Chambers," to this note is not the captain's writing—the prisoner had had a month's advance before this—I went to the station the night the prisoner was taken—he said he took the note into the Old Rose in the Highway, that there was a man writing there, and he got him to put the captain's name to it.</p>

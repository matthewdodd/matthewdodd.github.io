                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Childs, and live in Earl's-court, Kensington. The prisoner lived with me as maid of all work for nine weeks—she quitted my service on the 18th of June—I dis<lb></lb>charged her—she sent a man for her box next morning—I suspected some<lb></lb>thing, and would not let him have it—I told him to go back, and fetch her —she came—I told her I suspected she had some of my things—she re<lb></lb>fused to openjt for some time—she forced it open at last, and said she had not got the key—I found these articles in it—I had not given them to her.</p>

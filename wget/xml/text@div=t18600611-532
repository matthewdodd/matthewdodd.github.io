                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks at the General Post-Office—in consequence of complaints from the North Eastern district office, Bethnal-green-road, I directed a test letter to be made up on 28th May, addressed to Mr. J. Easton, 35, Forest-place, Leyton, Essex—it was directed in my presence by Mr. Clare—I enclosed in that letter a half-sovereigu aud an American two and a half dollar piece—I secured the envelope with adhesive matter, and then gave it to Mr. Clare, one of the inspectors of letter carriers, with instructions to post it the following morning—I had also given previous instructions to Mr. Reeves, the inspector of the North Eastern district office—if the letter was posted according to my directions to Mr. Clare, it would reach the North Eastern office at about twenty minutes past 5 in the morning—in consequence of some information, I went to the post<lb></lb>office receiving house of the North Eastern district in Bethnal-green-road at about twenty minutes past 8 in the morning—the prisoner was brought to me there in a private room, I asked him if he was on duty at the North Eastern district office this morning, he said he was; I asked him what time he arrived there, he said, "About twenty minutes past 5"—I asked him if he knew anythiug of a money letter addressed to Leyton—he said he did not—I then directed the police officer Bingham, who was present, to search the prisoner, and from his left hand coat pocket inside, Bingham took the letter addressed to Mr. J. Easton—I said to the prisoner, "Why here is the letter I have been inquiring about, the officer has just taken it out of your pocket," and, I asked him how he accounted for its being there—he replied, "I do not know how it got there"—I then said, "You can't very</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110033"></xptr>
               <p>well have a letter in your pocket without knowing how it got there"—he said, "I put it there myself"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he made no reply—when he was brought into the private room he had some other letters in his hand, which he had not delivered—I asked him why he had not delivered each letter as I looked them out separately; that applied to all but the letter addressed to Woodford; that was not in his district, it was addressed to Master James Carter, Grove House, Woodford-green, Essex; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said to him, "Here is a letter addressed to Woodford-green, how do you account for its possession?"—he said, "I found it amongst my letters, I found both letters amongst my letters, and intended to have written upon them and sent or taken them back to the office"—I said, "But when you set your letters in, you must have seen these letters amongst them"—the prisoner replied that he did not set his letters in—setting them in means arranging them in order for delivery—I asked him, "Who did set the letters in?"—he replied, "Cheatham"—he is a letter carrier employed in the North Eastern office; the prisoner's walk was the Abbey-street walk, Bethnal-green, he had, nothing whatever to do with the Essex letters; if a letter was mis-sorted he had no right to take it out of the office at all—I opened the letter addressed to James Carter before the Magistrate; it contained two sixpences, they could be felt through the letter—I have not opened the other letter—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here opened the letter</hi>) there are two coins here, a half-sovereign, and an American coin—I have not examined them—the post-mark is on the letter addressed to Carter, the date is 19th May, posted in the Eastern district on 28th, it would be dated on 29th; if it were posted late at night it would bear the stamp of the following morning—you could feel the money through both letters from the outside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers at the General Post<lb></lb>Office. On 28th May, I addressed this letter to Mr. J. Easton, which has been produced by Gardner—I saw him enclose the money in the letter, he fastened it and gave it to me—I posted the letter at the General Poet-Offiee, about 5 o'clock on the morning of 29th, I put it in the letter-box—it would leave the General Post-Office to go to the North Eastern district, about a quarter past 5, the bag would arrive within ten minutes of the time of its despatch—I afterwards went with Gardner to the receiving office, when the prisoner came to have his card signed—when a letter carrier has finished his delivery he has his card signed, that we may know at what time he has finished his delivery—a letter posted at Bow addressed to Woodford-green, Essex, about 7 in the evening of 28th, would come in due course to the Geueral Post-Office, and it would go with the 5 o'clock despatch to the North Eastern district; that was the same despatch as this other letter went by—when the Essex letters get to the North Eastern district, they are put before the letter carriers to sort, and then they go in a cart to the Woodford and Leyton post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the inspector of the North Eastern district office—the prisoner was employed as a letter sorter and letter carrier at that office—many others were employed on the morning of 29th in sorting letters besides the prisoner—I recollect the bag arriving with the letters from the General Post-Office, on that morning at about twenty-five minutes past 5—I think I opened the bag and took out the letters; among them I</p>

               <p>found this letter, addressed to Mr. J. Easton, Forest-place, Leyton, Essex—I knew there would be such a letter—it was not loose in the bag; it was with two or three others—I put it into a bundle with some other letters and placed it before the prisoner; he did not touch the bundle—I cut the string and opened the bundle, and left the letters before him to sort; he sorted the letters—there are two boxes, one called the Hackney box and the other the Loughton box—they are placed before the sorter—the letter addressed to Leyton should have been put by the prisoner into the Loughton box—most likely among the bundle there would be letters for him to deliver on his own walk—he would sort them to another department for the town letters—the Loughton letters were tied up in bundles, put into a bag, sealed up, and sent from the office to Loughton in a mail cart—if letters have been sorted for the town delivery, they are set up by the carriers who have to deliver them—the prisoner's walk on this morning was Abbey-street walk—there were two other letter carriers at the office that morning who had to deliver letters upon that same walk; Cheatham and Gargrave—the letters for the town delivery are sorted for each walk, and the carriers who have to deliver them on a particular walk divide the letters between them—the prisoner left the office on this morning to deliver his letters at twenty-eight minutes after 7—I saw him running through the letters before he tied them up—that is not what we call setting them up: they would have been set up before that, but they all arrange them before they leave the office—Cheatham had set some of them in the first instance, and I expect the prisoner did some himself—when the prisoner had left I looked at the letters for Leyton, which were already tied up—after they are brought to the room they are thrown over to the different towns and villages—I looked to see if the letter for Mr. Easton was there; it was not there—I then made a communication to Mr. Gardner.</p>

I am a letter carrier at the North Eastern office—I am employed on the Abbey-street walk, the same as the prisoner—Gargrave is also employed on the same walk—the letters for the Abbey-street walk are all sorted together into one mass and then divided among the three carriers on the walk—Gargrave divided the first—each letter carrier takes a particular part of the walk, and the letters are separated according to the part of the walk that each carrier is going—after they are separated into three parcels they are then what we call set in; arranged in the order of delivery; usually each man does that for himself—if we are setting in the letters and find a mis-sorted letter not belonging to the walk, we put it in the right box—on the morning of the 29th I set in my own letters; I after<lb></lb>wards set in the first portion of the prisoner's letters, up to about ten minutes past 7—those would be the letters I would find there when I got to the office—I go on duty at a quarter to 7—all the letters were set in by me up to ten minutes past 7—somewhere about fifteen or sixteen were set in for my delivery that morning—these letters, one addressed to Leyton, and the other addressed to Woodford, were not among the letters I set in for the prisoner—if I had seen them I should have placed them in the Loughton box—after we have set in the letters we look at them again before we go out of the office—if we find a mis-sort then among the letters it would be taken out.</p>

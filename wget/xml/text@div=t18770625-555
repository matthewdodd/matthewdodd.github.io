                  </hi>. I am a day watchman in the employ of the East and "West India Docks—on 26th May, about 5.30, I was with Policeman Smith at the entrance of the West India Docks, and saw the prisoner coming out at the gate from the docks—Smith pointed to the prisoner's breast, and said "What have you got there?"—he said "What the——hell has that to do with you?"—Smith caught hold of him' by the arm, and said "I want to see what you have got in your breast"—he then struck Smith a violent blow a the face, which caused him to fall back, blood flowing from his mouth, and he fell in the box towards the gate—I took hold of the prisoner very slightly by the arm, and walked away very quietly towards the station—I did not go to the station, as there was a van coming out which I had to examine—I did not see how the struggle began—the prisoner was under<lb></lb>neath—I ran to Smith's assistance, and secured the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 32 1/2, Silver Town, Barking—on Saturday, 26th May, I was passing out at the gate at 5.30, and heard the policeman say to the prisoner "What have you got there?" pointing to his breast—the prisoner made a filthy answer, and said "I shan't tell you what I have got here"—Smith said "You must come with me to a place where I must take you to be searched," and he up with his fist and said "Take that," and struck him between the jaw and the ear, and he fell just by the wall—I did not see him <hi rend="italic">get</hi> up—I walked away, as I was frightened.</p>

               <p>was close by Ludlow—Smith was in the company's box at the gate, in the arms of another constable, covered with blood—it was coming from his mouth—I took the prisoner to the station—it was Smith's duty to satisfy himself if he saw anything suspicious about a labouring man coming out at the gate, and if the search was refused, to convey him to the police-office—he would be quite right in taking hold of a man's arm if he refused to go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 658, Commercial Road—about 5.45 a.m. on 26th May, I was called to the deceased—he had then been dead probably two or three minutes—I could tell that he bad died from haemorrahage—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination forty-eight hours afterwards—both lungs were very much diseased, especially the left—there was a cavity in it, and the vessels had given way and caused the hæmorrhage—I have heard the evidence—I have no doubt that the struggle accelerated his death—he might have lived for a month if free from care and excitement, but such a struggle as this would bring about a fatal issue—death was caused by hæmorrhage from the lungs, the predisposing cause of which was long<lb></lb>standing disease, but the exciting cause was the struggle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming out of the gate with an engine-driver; the deceased constable stopped him to see what he had in his pocket. I stopped at the same time. He searched him, but did not search me. The deceased had two papers in his hand, and he caught me and said "Where are you going?" and cut my lip. I seized his hand and said "What are you doing?" He seized me, and we went to the ground, he below and I on top. He walked up to his box, and the constable took hold of me. I believe there is a witness here who was coming out at the gate with me, but I do not know his name. Nothing was found on me when Douglas searched me except what I worked with. I suppose he heard that the man was dead, for he came back and said "Put the handcuffs on him." I said "You won't put any handcuffs on me," and he jumped up on a stool, reached a staff, and dealt me a blow over the eye. I sat in a corner, and the hand<lb></lb>cuffs were put on.</p>

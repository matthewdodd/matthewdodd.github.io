               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JENNER</hi>. I left town on the afternoon of the 21st of July, and went to Mr. Dyke's at Chiselhurst—on the following morning I heard that a person had called at Mr. Dyke's house, and in consequence of what was told me I went to the Queen's-head at Chiselhurst, and found the prisoner there—I do not think he mentioned his name to me at the time—I was shown into the room, and I said, "Mr. Black I believe?"—he bowed—I told him I was in want of money, as he would perceive by my letter—he asked me what sum—I replied 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one twelve month—I told him I had no security to offer him, except my own personal security—he replied, that he knew, of course, Sir Herbert Jenner, and inquired of me how I should be able to repay it—I told him my income was such as to allow of my paying the sum at the end of the year—I believe I mentioned to him pretty nearly what my income was—he then told me I could have the money, and appointed to meet me the following morning at twelve o'clock at my father's house in Chesterfield-street—it was arranged that I was to have the use of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120054"></xptr>
               <p>money by paying at the rate of five per cent. interest for it, for twelve months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your letter states that you wished to raise 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will ex<lb></lb>plain that—at the time I wrote the letter, I mentioned it as a nominal sum, that I might know what the expense would be, not having made up my mind exactly at the time I wrote, what sum exactly I should wish—I came to town the next day, which was Saturday, the 23rd, to Chesterfield-street, to my father's house—the prisoner came there a few minutes after the time appointed—I was coming down stairs at the time he arrived, and I showed him into a room—there was nobody present but ourselves—after a little conversation about the weather, or some trivial thing of that kind, I asked him whether he had brought the money—I do not think he made any answer to that, but he pulled out a pocket-book, and took from thence a stamped piece of paper—he wrote something on it—he was sitting at the table, and there were writing materials there—I could not distinguish what it was he wrote at that time—he wrote it at the upper left-hand corner of the paper as I was looking at it, above the stamp on the left-hand—he then handed it to me, and requested me to write on it, "accepted," and my name—I did so—this is the stamped paper, and the acceptance I then wrote on it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) I also wrote the words" At Bank of England"—I had no ac<lb></lb>count at the Bank of England at that time, but the prisoner requested me to make it payable there—I did not notice what he had written in the corner of the paper when I wrote the acceptance—I do not remember whether I noticed any thing there—while I was writing the acceptance the prisoner was filling up what appeared to me a Bank of England cheque—an engraved form of cheque of the Bank of England—I could only distinguish one word accurately, which he wrote on it, which was, "Blake"—he then told me it was necessary his brother should also put his name to the cheque, and that he would leave me for the purpose of obtaining his brother's signature to it—I took up my acceptance off the table, saying, "Of course, then, yes will leave this with me till you return"—he replied that that was unneces<lb></lb>sary, and said, "To show you that there can be nothing wrong, here are the figures denoting 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. written in the corner"—at that time I had the ac<lb></lb>ceptance in my hand—I then looked at the corner, and observed "200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—and I think two O's written for shillings and pence, I believe so—they were figures clearly denoting 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had observed the prisoner writing on the stamp—that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must have been written before I wrote my acceptance—it was then agreed he should meet me at the Bank Coffee-house in half an hour, and I permitted him to go with the Bill of Exchange—I went to the Bank Coffee-house, but the prisoner did not appear according to appoint<lb></lb>ment—I saw no more of him for some time—I attended at Bow-street when this matter was inquired into, and saw a person named Edwards there, who was examined as a witness—I never gave Edwards any description of the person who obtained the bill from me, before I got to Bow-street, I had never seen Edwards before I saw him there.</p>

               <p>a bill payable there gave it additional credit—I would have made it payable any where the prisoner desired me—I do not know that I should have made it payable at the house of a private individual—my letter ex<lb></lb>pressed a desire for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when we met in Chesterfield-street he gave me a blank stamp, on which I wrote the acceptance—at that time I do not re<lb></lb>collect that I observed any figures at the corner—I laid it on the table after I accepted it, and he took it up, the paper was in my hand when he said, "You may see it is right by the figures in the corner." and I then closely inspected it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you meant to accept only for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., why did you not write "Ac<lb></lb>cepted for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner gave me the form of my acceptance—I have accepted a bill before—I was not totally ignorant of the mode of accepting—I never accepted a blank piece of paper in this way before, and have only accepted one bill before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having accepted before, and knowing the mode of acceptance, why should it be necessary for the prisoner to inform you how to accept? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did inform me, and I wrote what he told me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You once accepted a bill before, was that for a tradesman's account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—I never gave the prisoner authority to fill up this paper for a greater sum than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Fairlawn-house, Hammersmith. I know the prisoner—I knew him before the month of August last—I met him in the early part of August, accidentally, in Compton-street—he told me he had an acceptance of Mr. Jenner's for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he wished me to buy—he did not tell me who Mr. Jenner was at that time—I declined buying the bill then—I met him on other occasions afterwards on the same subject, and I ultimately agreed to purchase the bill for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I think I first saw the acceptance on the 12th of August, the day I agreed to purchase it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) it was then perfectly blank except the acceptance "Accepted C. H. Jenner, at the Bank of England"—there was a stamp on it—I noticed that the left hand upper corner, near the stamp, appeared to he stained, and asked him how it came to be stained in that manner—he told me it was as he had received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you agreed to give 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for it, what was to be done to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was to be drawn and indorsed by the prisoner for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me Elliott had received the bill from Mr. Jenner—I told him I had heard he had offered the bill to others—he told me he had only offered it to Cook—I think this must have been on the 12th of August—I had been in the habit of meeting the prisoner at a public-house at the cor<lb></lb>ner of a court leading from Jermyn-street to Piccadilly—I met him there next day, the 13th, by appointment, and he there produced the acceptance in the same blank state in which I had seen it before, and on that occa<lb></lb>sion I paid him a £50 Bank note and two cheques, for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. together—I at that time kept an account at the London and Westminster Bank, and at Charles King and Co's., 24, Bolton-street—these are the two cheques I gave him—one is dated the 15th, and the other the 17th—I dated them forwards—(<hi rend="italic">the cheques being read, were one for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on the London and Westminster Bank, dated the 15th of August, and the other August 17th on King and Co. for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I was to give the prisoner 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more if the bill was paid on maturity, or in the event of my getting fresh security—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was to be paid for the contingency, and if it was honoured I was to give more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if paid you would gain 325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not suppose that probable—the prisoner then delivered me the blank acceptance—I kept it, I</p>

               <p>suppose about ten days—at the end of that time I met the prisoner again, and I gave him back the blank acceptance to have it drawn and indorsed—met him again next day at the same public-house; he then produced the blank acceptance, with the signature of "C. Taylor" on it, as drawer and indorser—that was all the addition that was made—"C. Taylor" is in the right-hand corner—I asked him who C. Taylor was—he told me he was a man living with him, and that he had given him a sovereign for signing the bill—I requested him to draw the body of the bill, and he did so—he drew it, "London, August 20, 1836. Two Months after date, pay to my order, Five Hundred Pounds, value received: To the Rev. C. H. Jenner, No. 1, Chesterfield-street, May-fair, "—he did that in my presence—he produced this note to me, I think, * on that occasion—I had made some question as to the bill being for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked him to satisfy me that it was for that sum—I had observed the stain in the corner, and did not know what it might allude to—he then produced this letter—I cannot exactly say the conversation which passed, but he produced the letter as corroborating that it was to be for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said so, and he delivered the letter to me and left it with me—I have since delivered it to the attorney for the prosecution—the address of Mr. Jenner is affixed to the left-hand corner of the bill, (where I observed the stain) with wafers—the bill was drawn by Hart at two months after date—I saw him again the day it became due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came that piece of paper to be affixed to the left-hand corner of the bill with wafers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner went from me to No. 1, Chester<lb></lb>field-street, to inquire the address of Mr. Jenner—I did not go with him—he went away, as for the address, and when he returned he produced this piece of paper, on which is written, "Rev. C. H. Jenner, Rectory, near Cardiff."—it was written very illegibly, with very pale ink, and I passed my pen over it to make it plainer—the prisoner affixed it to the corner of the bill—the bill was then in the state in which it is at present, with the exception of the two following indorsements—I know a person named Atkinson—this indorsement of "George Atkinson," is his writing—it was done at my request—the other indorsement is my own—the object in doing that was to give a greater currency to it—I afterwards applied to Mr. Jenner for payment of the bill, and learnt the circumstances under which it had been obtained; in consequence of which I attended before the Magistrate at Bow-street, and delivered the bill up to the attorney for the prosecution.</p>

                  </hi>. In July last, I was servant to Mr. Dyke, at Chiselhurst. I remember the prisoner coming to Mr. Dyke's house in that month, and inquiring for Mr. Charles Jenner—he gave the name of Blake—Mr. Jenner was out at the time—I told the prisoner so, and he said he should be for an hour, or an hour and a half, at the Queen's Head—that is the name of a public-house at Chiselhurst.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of his Majesty's mint. I frequently have to examine, with great minuteness, different instruments and coins—since I have been in Court, at the request of the prosecutors, I have examined this bill of exchange—I perceive, in the corner of it, an appearance of a stain—to the best of my judgment, it is such a stain as might be produced by the use of an acid—by looking at it with a magnifying glass, it appears to me that the first figure, which now forms a 5, has been altered—I see the stain perfectly—I do not perceive any mark where the stain is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does examining coin give you any knowledge of paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>. No, I do not mean to say it does—I have looked at the paper with a magnifying glass—I cannot see any marks above the figures, where the great portion of the stain is, but it appears to me there is a different coloured ink forming the portion of the 5—some colour forming one part of it, and some colour another—and I think that what is now the figure 5, originally formed part of another figure.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been many years a practical chemist. The stain at the corner of this piece of paper is from an experiment I made, to ascer<lb></lb>tain if an said had been applied there—there was some mark on it, I be<lb></lb>lieve,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120058"></xptr>
               <p>before I made the experiment—the red mark is in consequence of my experiment—there was a stain on it when I first examined it, but no red stain—I am positive an acid has been applied to that corner of the paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The stain now actually on the paper was made by yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In consequence of applying test-paper that very small red mark remains—if a drop of vinegar is put into a wine-glass of water, and you dip this paper into, it will come out red—the least atom of an acid is indicated by this paper—I am confident acid has been applied to that spot—I did not try the paper in my other part, but to that mere portion of the corner where you observe a small red mark left—the smallest portion of acid will affect this paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that many paper-makers use acid in the pulp to make their papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They use the oxymuriatic acid, which is very differ<lb></lb>ent from all others, and will not show the same colour—besides, it does not remain in the paper after manufacture—having bleached the rags, there is no more acid remaining—it is used merely in bleaching the rags.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although that is the proper course, do you not know that many of them also use the diluted vitriolic acid, by way of speedy bleaching? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not to remain in the paper, it would rot it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the oxymuriatic acid they use an acid that would present the appearance, on applying the test to it, which you find on this bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I positively assert, that acid has been applied subsequently to the paper being made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CURWOOD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a visible stain before you applied the test? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly there was.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the acid you imagine has been used, would it have the effect of effacing ink marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, certainly it would.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

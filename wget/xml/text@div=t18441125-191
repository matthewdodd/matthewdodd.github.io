                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable. No</hi>. 375.) On the evening of the 8th of Nov. I was on duty in Ludgate-street, between six and seven o'clock—I saw King carrying something—I followed him to the Old Bailey, and saw he had got something very heavy under his arm—when he got to the Sessions-house, I said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "It is all right, old fellow"—he said a party gave it him, and I might go and look for that party—I said, "No, I shall look to you"—he said, "I shall lose my place; for God's sake let me go"—he made two struggles to get away in the Old Bailey, but at last I succeeded in getting him to the station, and there I found it was this bag of shot which he was carrying, which has the name of "Walker, Parker, and Co." on it—I went to Messrs. Walker, Parker, and Co., and went with the foreman to Shillum, and took him to the station, and then King said that Shillum gave it him, but he asked him for it, and Shillum took it out of the ware-house.</p>

I am manager of the factory of Joshua Walker and others—King was our carman, and Shillum was in the white lead department—we have a shot department—persons can get from the white lead department to the shot department—Shillum had no business in the shot department with<lb></lb>out special orders—I remember King going away on the night of the 8th of November, about six o'clock—the policeman came afterwards, and I went with him to Shillum's house—I found him at home, and took him to the station—I left him outside—I went in and found King in custody—I saw this bag, with my employers'name on it—I asked King how he became</p>

               <p>possessed of it—he said, "Shillum gave it me to carry a little way for him"—I went outside, and asked Shillum to go in—King then again repeated that Shillum gave him this bag of shot—I asked Shillum how he became possessed of it—he said, "I stole it from the warehouse, and gave it to him to carry a little way, but I was asked to do so"—this bag of shot is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Shillum's Defence</hi>. It was from an inducement held out to me by the prosecutor, that I stated what I did; several policemen stated that if I spoke the truth my master would not hurt roe; it was in consequence of that, and King saying that I gave it him, that I stated what I did, but I am inno<lb></lb>ccent of the transaction as a child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bill sticker of 4, Crown Court, Goswell Road—on Saturday night, 17th January, I had been to the Adelphi Theatre about some work, and went with my wife from Charing Cross, underground, to Blackfriars—after 12 o'clock we stopped at a coffee-stall at the corner of Long Lane to have some coffee—I saw the prisoner there and six or seven others; they began breaking the cups, and I said to my wife that it was a shame that they should do so—the man who kept the stall said that they should pay for them—the prisoner asked me what it was to do with me—I said "Nothing, no more than if I had the stall they should pay for the things"—he said "I will pay you," and struck me a violent blow on my right eye with his fist which knocked me down—I got up and got to the side of the stall which was open in front; the back and sides were enclosed—the prisoner struck me again on the side of my head with his fist and knocked me down again, and while I was down he kicked me on my jaw—I felt the bone break, and begged him not to kick me again—I got to the further side of the road and was knocked down again, and all of them kicked me—I got up on my hands and knees, but they kept kicking me—I was knocked down again, and they all kicked me—I called to my wife to hold the prisoner as he was the man who broke my jaw, for I was knocked completely out of my senses—I called out as well as I could for the police, and my wife held the prisoner till a constable came—I had not been drink<lb></lb>ing—I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—the prosecutor came there on the morning of 19th January—I examined him; he had a fracture of the right jaw, and a large wound on the back of bis head; he had erysipelas and was very ill; but I do not know that his life was actually in danger—I requested that his deposition might be taken because he got worse—the fracture of the jaw might have been sustained in an ordinary fair fight, but not the wound at the back of the head.</p>

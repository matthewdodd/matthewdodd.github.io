                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and physician, of West-square—on Monday night, 26th January, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was called to 1, St. Alban's-buildings, and found the deceased on a bed dead—I found four or five abrasions on the left side of her throat, but none on the right side—they were such as might be caused by finger-nails—Wallace gave me the description in the prisoner's presence—I observed nothing further at that time to account for death—next morning, Wednesday, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found contusions on the skull, and extravasation of blood on the left side, corresponding with the marks of the fingers—I removed the skull-plate and found an internal ex<lb></lb>travasation on the surface and on the base of the brain—I did not detect any fracture of the skull, but there was an effusion of the internal structure—I saw a contusion appearing external—both lungs were extremely con<lb></lb>gested; the heart was not diseased; the liver and kidneys were healthy—I attribute death to effusion of blood on the surface of the brain, causing obstructed respiration, death being accelerated by compression of the throat—blows, or a fall, would account for the appearances I saw on the skull—if effusion on the surface of the brain existed, compression on the throat, from the evidence as described to me, would increase it—the second came was the effusion of blood on the brain and congestion of the lungs—compression of the throat would not account for the congestion of the lungs I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You really mean that she died from coma? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Coma, accelerated by compression of the <hi rend="italic">trachea</hi>—I had never seen her before—there may be many causes of epilepsy; sometimes it is produced by disease of the brain, but not always—there was some blood between the scalp and the skull; it was large in extent, but small in quantity—I found effusion on the small vessels of the brain; a vessel might be ruptured by excite<lb></lb>ment, if disease of the brain or of the artery is to be found—if a rupture of the vessels causing effusion had arisen from violence, I should not expect to find a fracture of the skull, and I should not be disappointed at not finding it—effusion of the brain often occurs without any fracture taking place—Mr. Baker also made an examination on the following day—the marks on the throat were such as I should expect to find from the finger-nails; it is usual to find lividity in such cases—there was no lividity of the throat or of the countenance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the very place pressed exhibit it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have always seen hanging or strangling produce it—I have been a resident in a hospital, and have seen it frequently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever meet with an instance in which it was absent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—from my general information, as a matter of science, lividity may be absent, and yet death may follow by strangulation—I ob<lb></lb>served no disease of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is lividity produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Lividity in the face is caused by the arrest of the venous blood, but that is not a constant cause; it depends upon the pressure—the primary cause of death was coma, or the effusion of blood on the brain—the lungs were congested with blood, and did not act in refreshing the blood, and she died from asphyxia; and the reason the lungs did not act was the pressure on the brain, which prevented them from relieving themselves—if there had been no effusion on the brain, there could not very well nave been congestion of the lungs from the stoppage without lividity, not to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020140"></xptr>
               <p>that extreme extent—I cannot say that if there had not been that effusion on the brain, she would have died from the pressure—if incipient or partial coma existed, pressure on the throat would finish it off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I made a post-mortem examination of deceased, and agree with Dr. Constable's evidence; but, hearing the position of the deceased when she fell, it struck me that there might be a fracture of the spine—I removed the spinal process, and found a clot of blood press<lb></lb>ing on the spinal cord—it is quite possible that that might be accounted for by her falling under a bed with her head doubled up between her knees—that would cause paralysis almost immediately, but of course not until the clot got to the size I saw it—the effusion would continue to increase for a very short time after death—in hanging, I have occasionally seen very little con<lb></lb>gestion of the face; it depends upon whether the spinal cord is fractured immediately—in a person suspended for days, congestion would take place of course, but where the pressure is removed the lividity would go off—if there was a compression of the <hi rend="italic">trachea</hi> for half a minute, I should not expect to find much congestion, if any, particularly in this case, because the injuries in the brain were such that this person could not have lived but for a very short time—the immediate cause of death was strangulation—I should not expect to find lividity there, but there was lividity in the marks of the throat—I should not expect to find lividity of the countenance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you heard Mr. Constable say that there was no lividity on the throat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there were marks of the fingers—there would not be marks of lividity on the throat on the first day, but there would be a redness—in my opinion, death was caused by the effusion on the brain—an effusion is caused by the rupture of a vessel or vessels, but not necessarily—I expected a fracture, but it does not necessarily follow that there should be one—an external blow will rupture an internal vessel without rupturing the case—I had never seen the woman before.</p>

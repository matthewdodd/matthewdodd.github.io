                  </hi> I am in the service of Mr. Bonney. On the 26th of Sept., in the evening, my master and mistress were out—the prisoner knocked at the door—I opened it—she asked if Mr. Bonney was at home—I said he had gone to chapel—she asked if I would give her a little water to drink—I said I had no spring water, I would give her some other—she said I need not trouble, and asked me to read a letter she had—I fetched a light, and she had no letter—we went into the parlour—she run across the room and took a bunch of keys out of a cupboard door, and said she had left some linen when she was in Mr. Bonney's service, would I go up and look for it—I said I knew nothing of it, so she had better call again—she said she had left her needle-case on the corner of the mantel-piece, would I go up and get it—I said, "No"—she said she would go up herself—I said if she would give me my master's key's she might, but she would not—she blew out the light, and went up stairs—I went for assistance, and shut her in the house—she was taken in the next yard, with the cash-box.</p>

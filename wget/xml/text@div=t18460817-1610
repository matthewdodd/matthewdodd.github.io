                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner in the shop, with his hand on a handkerchief, under which were some cigars—they had never been given or sold to him—when I accused him be stoutly denied that he was guilty of any robbery—I determined to give him in charge—he was dreadfully alarmed, and went down on his knees and supplicated—I was determined that the case should be examined—he was not at work on that description of cigars that day—they were the remnants of some he bad been at work at a day or two previously—having had some suspicion of robbery on the previous Friday night, I counted, and missed sixty cigars from one man's work—on Saturday the prisoner, being a Jew, does not attend—I looked, and found twenty-four cigars in this part of this machine—(producing it)—on the Monday they were precisely the same—on the Tuesday, on counting, there were some of them gone—I found under the handkerchief twelve which corresponded with those gone from under this machine, which was in the window close by where the prisoner was at work on the Tuesday—these had been secreted under the machine improperly, and those I found under his handkerchief exactly corresponded with them—I had not sold any of these—they were a few left of a previous parcel that he had been working at.</p>

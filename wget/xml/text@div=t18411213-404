                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Barnard Spindler, a leather-manufacturer. On the 4th of December, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was at work on some skins in the dye-house—when I left the dye-house at that time, the skins were safe—on Monday, the 6th, I went to the dye-house, and found the whole of the skins gone—they were in an unfinished, state, not fit for the ordinary purposes of sale—there were seven dozen pink lambs, and four dozen and a half black kid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather-dresser, in the service of Barnard Spindler, of White's-grounds. I have examined the skins produced, and have no hesitation in saying this one is master's, and from their general appearance, I should say the whole are his—one is marked "K. C."—I know this one particularly—it is the writing of S. Jervis, who is in my master's employ—on Tuesday morning, the 7th, I saw the skins in Mr. Bury's shop, in Bermondsey-street—I thought I knew them, I sent for a constable, and they were brought away—these are them.</p>

On Satur<lb></lb>day, the 4th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop with two pink skins, as a sample—she opened them, and asked if they would suit me—I told her I did not want them, they were skins I did not use—she said Mr. Bowler, her husband, had taken them for a bad debt, and it would oblige him if I would take them of her—I agreed to take a dozen, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—she went away to fetch the remainder of the dozen—she does not live more than a stone's-throw</p>

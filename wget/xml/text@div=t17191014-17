Another Evidence deposed, that as she was going to prison she told him the several places where she had sold the Goods; but none went to enquire to see if they could find them in any of those places or no. Mrs. Gibbs, who lived within 14 Doors of the prosecutor. deposed the prisoner liv'd with her 3 Weeks and 3 Days, and was apprehended in her Service; that she told her she had ruined her self by Marrying a Soldier; but behaved her self very well. The prisoner in her Defence said, that the prosecutor kept a Disorderly House, and therefore she would not stay; that she went away about 11 a Clock in the Forenoon, and gave her Master and his Daughter notice of it, and that he refus'd to pay her Wages, unless she would stay till her Mistress came home. Her Master did not appear in Court to contradict her. The Jury <rs id="t17191014-17-verdict82" type="verdictDescription">

I had a Kingswood box, fourteen inches long, and six deep, containing the articles enumerated in the indictment, except the two watches and seals. The value was about 1200 l. or 1400 l. My house is in Berkley-square, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. I missed the box on the morning of the 14th - it usually stood in my wife's dressing-room, where we generally breakfasted; he was in the habit of coming into this room, and seeing the box and its contents, for he travelled with me, and I always took the box with me. I saw nothing of him after five o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th, till Monday following, the 18th, when he was in custody. I had advertised in the Newspapers on the 14th, and received a letter, purporting to come from Messrs. White and Dodson, in consequence of which, I went with Westcoat, the officer, in a direction for Portsmouth; but on the Guildford-road, about twenty-five miles from town, I recognized Clark in a chaise, with one Worger. On coming up with them Worger produced several articles to me, which had been in the box, and I identified them. Some conversation passed between me and Clark; he said voluntarily that he had broken open the box, in a copse by the road side, about two miles beyond Dartford, and left the box in the copse, and had disposed of the gold and silver watch, to two different persons in the town of Chatham; he could not name them. I discovered them by his description. Next morning I went to the copse, beyond Dartford, and the man at the turnpike told me where I should find my box; it was given up to me, about a hundred yards from the copse, by a person who had found it. I went to Chatham, and found my gold watch in possession of Slowman, a Jew; and the silver one I recognized in the window of one Price, at Chatham. When the box was found, some things still remained in it, in a secret drawer. All the property found on the prisoner was produced at the office, and sealed up in my presence, and have been in my possession ever since. Worger afterwards produced a chain. I have recovered every single article, and produce the whole, sealed up, also the box.</p>

I had great difficulty in getting admittance; I found several articles of jewellery in a chair in the room, tied in a blue handkerchief, with two shirts. I found the whole of the property, which is now sealed up, in a box, which I afterwards gave to the prosecutor. I brought him to town, and met the Colonel - he gave me the whole account of the transaction, which enabled me to find the watches. He said where he had thrown the box, and sold the watches. Here are a pair of diamond ear-rings, necklaces, and other property in this box.</p>

            . I am sister-in-law to the last witness. On the 13th of August, I was sitting at the window at work, and saw Clark, and saw the back of a soldier; he went into my father's house, No. 12, (we live at No. 14) I saw him come down stairs, and come out; he then had something on his arm, covered with a white cloth - I saw Clark coming down stairs at the same time. They came out of my father's into my brother's, No. 14, where I was; I let them in - Downes was then carrying the box, uncovered; Clark received it from him before he entered the room - he asked if Dry was at home; he was not. The box was set on a chair, uncovered; they remained there about three minutes. Clark kept fingering the lock, and turned it over, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got something in here, which I want to give to Dry;" Downes said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, Clark, don't break it open." I cannot swear to Downes, but it was a soldier.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 14th of August, I attended at Marlborough-street, and saw Downes there in custody. I neither promised nor threatened him - what he said was not taken down. I heard him tell the Magistrate that he was with 
               <persName id="t18230910-10-person186">Clark</persName>
             the evening before, and accompanied him to a court in Oxford-street; but he did not know what court it was, and that he carried a box, which Clark had given him, and that he went up stairs in a house in that court, and the person not being at home they came down stairs again - that Clark then took the box, and they parted.</p>

             the evening of that day, about seven o'clock, I saw Clark coming out of Gee's-court, Oxford-street, with Downes, who had a red coat on, and a box, like the one produced, in his hand; it was uncovered - I am certain of his person; they appeared rather agitated when they saw us looking at them; they crossed over in the middle of Oxford-street, and called to a hackney coachman who stood there, and both got into the coach. Downes put the box into the coach; when the coachman opened the door, the coachman wanted to take hold of it to put it in, but Downes pulled it away, and put it in himself. They both got in, and drove towards Holborn. I saw no more of them.</p>

            . I am a private in the third company of the second battalion of the first Guards. I was with Jessop about seven o'clock in the evening we marched out of Portman barracks; we were in Oxford-street, and saw Downes come out of Gee's-court, with a box in his hand, similar to the one produced. A young man was with him, who appeared to be a gentleman's servant: I cannot swear to its being Clark; they went over to a coach which stood in the middle of the street - one of them spoke to the coachman; he got off his box, and was going to assist Downes in with the box, but he put it in himself; both got into the coach, which drove towards Holborn. I thought I had seen Downes before, which made me take particular notice - he had a red jacket on.</p>

               <p>DOWNES'S Defence. I did not know that it was stolen property. I was drinking at this public-house, which we frequented, and the last time Clark came out, he said he must join his regiment that night - he said he had something at the Colonel's, which he did not wish to take to barracks, and would leave them at an acquaintance's, and told me to wait at the public-house till he came to me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100010"></xptr>which he did, and gave me the box to carry. I left him in time to be at the barracks in proper time.</p>

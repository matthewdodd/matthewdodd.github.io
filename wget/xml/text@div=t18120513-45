               <p>Q. On the 17th of April last had you any occasion to send any letter to Messrs. Harding, Oakes, and Company, at Tamworth - A. Yes; I sent four; they were directed to Messrs. Harding, Oakes, and Company, Tamworth; and in one of these four letters there were enclosed thirty notes of five pounds each.</p>
               <p>Q. Read the contents of that letter - A.</p>
               <p>"Enclosed are thirty five-pound notes: London, April 17, 1812."</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you seal that letter - A. With two wafers.</p>
               <p>Q. Any sealing wax at all - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that letter and the other three - A. They were put on the junior clerk's desk, Mr. Ariel, before him, these four letters were.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce your book if you please; you have a book containing the numbers of these thirty notes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is No. 4,927 one of those thirty - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is No. 4,952 one other of those notes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. These notes are notes that are issued from the country; they are sent to you to be paid for, and then they are sent back to Tamworth to be issued - A. Yes; they are country bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are made payable at your house in town, and payable at the other house in the country - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said these letters were put before Mr. Ariel, he is a junior clerk - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were put before him on a desk; were they mixed with others? Were there other letters on the desk at the time - A. Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these four letters unsealed - A. I think the four letters were sealed with wafers; three of them I sealed myself, and one was to be copied; the one in question was wafered.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were other letters on the desk - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were wafered - A. I do not know whether they were or were not; only the three that I put there myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mears. Look at this; is that another of the four letters - A. Yes; that was also sent off at the same time; that is sealed with a wafer.</p>
               <p>Q. You have another small book in your possession I believe - A. Yes; it contains the numbers of the notes; I wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>"Fourth cover, sent by post, containing one hundred and fifteen notes."</p>
               <p>Q. There were not any others that evening but these four letters to be sent to Tamworth bank - A. Not any others than these four.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any letters from the London Post that day, by your correspondent Doriel - A. I did; three, and no more; they contained notes. There was a letter of advice with them, they were all the notes that day that we received; they corresponded, but one cover was deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your letter of advice give you reason to expect there was another cover wanting - A. Yes. The letter is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did another arrive by the Post on the next day - A. It did, by the Post, on the 19th; from the same persons: it contains merely these words:</p>
               <p>"enclosed are thirty five-pound notes. London, 17th of April, 1812."</p>
               <p>Q. I observe upon that letter there is the appearance of wafer and wax - A. There is. It came to me in that state, both wafered and waxed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did it actually contain - A. Twenty-eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there among others a note No. 4,927 - A. No such number arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did 4,952 arrive - A. No, all the notes of which I had advice arrived except the two, No. 4,927, and No. 4,952; and these two had been subtracted from the letter which arrived on the 19th; it had the London post-mark on that letter, 18th April, very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. These notes that were thus sent down to you were the notes that had been paid by your correspondents, Messrs. Doriel - A. They had.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are returned to you, your regular course is to issue them again - A. Exactly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you issue them in precisely the same form - A. Precisely.</p>
               <p>Q. They bear no marks, as payable at the house of Doriel and Co. - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a note, No. 4,927; tell me whether that is one of your notes - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the date of it - A. 28th of March, 1812.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more than one note of that number and date in circulation - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot. What length of time is allowed you by Act of Parliament to re-issue these notes - A. Three years for fives and tens. There is nothing done by us to know that they have been issued; no mark whatever.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130040"></xptr> MR. RAVENHILL. I am a linen-draper. I live in Beech-street, Barbican. On the 21st of April the prisoner came to me, and purchased goods to the amount of two pounds and a penny; for which he tendered me a five-pound Tamworth bank-note.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the number of the note he first offered to you - A. I cannot state positively, that this is the first note. I believe it was. I rather objected taking it. I cannot say that this is the number of the note he first tendered me, because I had two in my hands. I asked him if he could not let me have bank of England, or something similar. He told me that he had nothing but a note of the same description; he then produced to me another note of the same description.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you certain that that note which you hold in your hand, was one of the notes - A, Yes. 4,927, that is the one I hold in my hand. I asked him his address; he said his name was

            , living at No. 12, Well-street, Tamworth. I asked him where he was at when in town, he gave me the Blossoms Inn, Lawrence-lane; he said he was well known there; he said he slept at Hackney the night before. I gave him three one-pound bank notes in change. He went away; after which I had occasion to go into the city: I took this note and presented it for payment at Messrs. Doriel's. They refused paying it, saying it had been stolen out of a letter with another note. One of the gentlemen at Messrs. Doriel's went with me to the Post Office. I went from thence to Mr. Parkin's house in Ormond-street, and the next evening I went again to the General Post Office; and after I had been seme few minutes in the Post Office I identified the prisoner as the person that paid me the note; him and several others were in the room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him there when you first went into the room where the others were - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person point out to you any particular man - A. No. I selected him from many others. I have no doubt that he was the person that purchased the goods of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had you seen the prisoner in your life before - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the Post Office in expectation to see him there - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what is there that made you know him again - A. From his person; he was with me from twenty minutes to half an hour, in the middle of the day.</p>

            . Q. you are president of the night-office in the Post Office - A. I am. I recollect Mr. Ravenhill coming to the Post Office when I was there; he came to see whether there was any body there that he had seen in the course of the day. When he came in the room there were between sixty and seventy persons in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he there before he pointed out the prisoner - A. I believe about a quarter of an hour, he pointed him out without any hesitation.</p>

            , Q. Do you belong to the General Post Office - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether that is the London stamp of the 18th of April - A. This is the London stamp of the 18th of April; it does not appear to have any other stamp. I am one of the officers who reside on the evening duty.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there on the evening of Friday the 17th of April - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there on his duty that evening - A. He was. His employment, in the early part of the evening, was to face letters; that is, to put the letters all with the directions downwards.</p>

               <p>COURT. Does the stamp always denote the time of the letters going off - A. The day only. Facing is the first thing that is done to letters after they come into the office, and the next thing is stamping, and then sorting them.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a person who is <rs id="t18120513-45-deflabel258" type="occupation">employed in facing letters</rs>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. How many persons might be employed that evening in that department, in the particular act of facing - A. Perhaps fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it never happened that a letter might get into a different channel than what it ought to get into - A. Certainly, by mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. If a letter had been delivered to a letter-carrier might not it get into his hands - A. This is not a letter of that description. This was to go into the country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott, Q. to Mr. Harding. Is there any street at Tamworth called Well-street - A. Certainly not.</p>

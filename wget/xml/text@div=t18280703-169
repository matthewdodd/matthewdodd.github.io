            . I am the wife of William Love. - The prisoner and her husband lodged with me; I went out on the 14th of June, leaving the prisoner and a girl there to take care of my child; I returned in two hours, and the prisoner was gone; her husband came home after that - he said he was going to the pay-table, and would come back and pay me, but I never saw him any more - I afterwards missed my apron and handkerchief; when the prisoner was taken she had my apron on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not in the habit of lending it to me? A. You borrowed an apron to go out to see for a situation a fortnight before; I was not in the house at the time you took this.</p>

I saw the prisoner go to the cradle and take out this blue apron, and put it on her milking-pail; she then went to the chair, took the handkerchief, and put that in her pail - she said she was going to borrow them.</p>

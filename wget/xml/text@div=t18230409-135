             was in the house by accident; she does not live in the house - I had known the prisoner when a child, but had not seen him for years; he said he came from Mr. Montague, (who is treasurer of the parish,) that he had a note from him for Mr. Horn. I said Mr. Horne was at his office at the Townhall; that he had better go there and he would see him; he said it was something very particular, and Mr. Montague requested it might be left at the house. The Townhall is about three hundred yards from the house. He asked me to lend him a pen and ink to write something on the letter. I turned round from him to go into the front parlour for the pen and ink, and he shut the street door and followed me, I got into the front parlour, and was opening the book case to get the pen and ink, and then received two blows at the back of my head, which stunned me very much; there was nobody else near me; he had something in a handkerchief under his arm when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What further passed - A. I turned round to see what it was, and he tripped me up; I fell on my left side, and immediately I was down I received three blows on the side of my head, from a weapon which was afterwards produced; it was a little hatchet. I was hardly able to move; I had no power to move till the blood ran profusely down to my mouth which I think revived me. I then seized him by the neckcloth and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh you murdering villain." He then dragged me out of the front parlour into the passage; I was on my feet but I do not know how I came there; I continued to hold him all the time, and when in the passage he tripped me up again; I fell on my right side and there I received several blows on the left side with the same instrument. I still held him by the neckcloth, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Let go, you won't let go;" these were the only words I heard him speak; at that instant I heard a violent rapping at the street door; before that, I had screamed out as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>"Fillaroy! Fillaroy," and then he put his fingers into my mouth to prevent my screaming; I bit his finger very hard, this was before I was dragged into the passage; I kept screaming as loud as I could; I do not know whether I could he heard outside the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you heard a rapping at the door - A. Yes; I still held him by the neckcloth and dragged him towards the door; I opened the street door, still holding him; a vast concourse of people were at the door, to whom I said,</p>
               <p>"Come in, I am murdered." Some one took the prisoner, and I know nothing more about it. I was taken into the parlour and a surgeon came to my assistance; I do not know whether I walked into the parlour or was carried; he was brought to my bed-room next day for the Magistrate to take my deposition in his presence; I kept my bed for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This happened a little after two o'clock in the afternoon - A Yes Sir. I live in the High-street, not in a lone house, it is a very public place, where coaches pass at all times, there are shops opposite; it is a narrow street, and no area before the door; the house lays low. I had not seen him since he was a child; there was no malice or ill will between us. I know his mother very well, and go to the same chapel as her; she does not belong to the same class as me. I have told all that passed, there was nothing of anger or provocation, nor any words, it was done so very instantaneously; he had not spoken a word in anger or demanded any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. There was really no cause present, or past, that you could assign for it - A. None at all. I screamed during the whole transaction, calling</p>
               <p>"Fillaroy" - I do not know that I called murder. I have no reason to believe that he was ever at the house before. I have lived there twenty-six years.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Are there blinds to the parlour window - A. Yes, very high ones - there is a garden at the back of the house which is divided from the fields by a ditch only.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does his mother sit near you at chapel - A. No, she sits in the gallery and I below - I never observed him with her. I recollect that there is a bridge over the ditch, which could easily be let down, and a person might escape into the fields. His mother is a straw bonnet maker.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier. I was passing the house at the back of a stage, and heard a very violent scream of murder. A mob collected round the door - I jumped off, pushed the door open, and saw Mrs. Rookes behind the door, screaming, and blood running all down her, from her head; the prisoner had hold of her behind, pulling her away from the door. I made a snatch at his right wrist, and he let go of her immediately. I did not perceive any thing in his hand at that time; he let go with the other hand immediately, and I took hold of that wrist, held both wrists, and said</p>
               <p>"You rascal, what have you been about here;" he said she had been very much ill-treating him; he tried to lift up his hands - I pulled them down, and said I would stand no nonsense with him: by that time a number of people rushed in and seized him by the collar, and assisted in securing him, I pulled him into the back kitchen, on the same floor. Coltman, the officer, came in, bound his hands, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. This is a very public situation - A. Yes; at the time I seized him, a child ten years old might have pulled him down, he was so confused, and turned as pale as ashes.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I went into the house, hearing a noise, and thinking my assistance might be wanted. I went in the back way, and found some slight resistance within, at the back door, as if somebody wished to get out, for a second. I then went in, and found the prisoner in custody, and Mrs. Rooke in the front parlour, in an agitated state, and her face covered with blood. I found a small wound on the right temple, rather contused, which had divided an artery, from whence the blood had proceeded. I stopped it instantly; there was another wound on the left side of the head, that was a contused triangular wound: there was another on the back of the head - that was a cut, and must have been made with the corner of the sharp part of the hatchet; but from the shape of the triangular wound, I think it was made with the back of it. She was much agitated, and nearly fainted, and kept her bed a fortnight, I have attended her till now. I was there the next day, when the magistrate attended, to take her deposition. I apprehended danger, fearing fever might come on, but not from the wounds themselves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You think the triangular wound was made with the back of the hatchet - A. Yes; had the wound in the forehead been in a more fleshy part, I should have called it more of a puncture - it was the depth of the skin - a good deal of blood flowed from the artery. The wound in the head was an incision about three-fourths of an inch long, and not above an eighth of a sixth of an inch deep. The back wound must have been done with the sharp part, no other part of the instrument could have done it. I found the prisoner very much agitated, and almost fainting.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You know nothing of the prisoner - A. I knew him perfectly well; there had been no quarrel whatever between us of any sort; he lived some distance from me; he has been maintained at our work-house, and relieved as a pauper. All I know of his having been in an ill-state of health, is his being sent from the work-house to the hospital last Christmas twelvemonth, with a venereal complaint.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Had you any reason to suppose that his mind was affected. - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you at all aware of his having business with you - A. Not the least; I had not seen him for six or nine months before this affair. I never knew him considered as having his intellects affected at the work-house.</p>
               <p>The paper brought by the prisoner as a letter was here read, it was as follows: -</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father, I am a shipwright by trade, but have not done business in that way for seven years - since the war I have been in the straw-bonnet trade; he lived with me when this unfortunate circumstance happened, he was twenty-six years old last December - he had a paralytic stroke seven years ago which affected his instep and leg; since which time he was first employed as clerk to Mr. Hatton, of Great St. Helen's, and afterwards acted as usher at a school; he has lately been very much given to study, and was remarkable for seclusion, the most so of any one I ever knew - his health was so bad that he declined his place as usher two years ago last June; since that time he has been employed twelvemonth as a ladies' shoe-maker down to December last - the cause of his leaving that employ was the rupture of a blood-vessel, but I do not know where, there was a great discharge of blood; he was under Mr. Frampton's care, as an out-patient of the London Infirmary - his conduct has materially altered since that, he gave many evidences of his derangement of mind. I I have observed, for many years past, a temporary derangement of intellect; after he had in a measure recovered from the paralytic, he left home and went to Bristol without any intimation; a week afterwards I received a letter from him, saying he was there and in want of money to come home - this was about seven years ago; we sent him money and he returned - he was absent rather more than a week; he had no relation there, only he had heard me say I was born there; after his return he was a considerable time out of employ, but by means of an advertisement obtained a situation with Mr. Hatton, as an accountant, where he continued between two and three years; left him in August, 1820, and immediately engaged as usher to Mr. Gilson, and staid with him till Midsummer, 1821; his health was evidently on the decline while with Mr. Gilson, and at the expiration of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090054"></xptr>holidays he was too ill to return, which he intended, and declined going again - after that he manifested an unusual dejection of spirits, such as I ever witnessed before, and as much as in him laid, secluded himself entirely from the observation of the family and society; he scarcely ever attended meals - we never could prevail upon him to come down stairs. I had remonstrated with him on the mode of conduct he pursued, and said the probable consequence of this seclusion would be injurious to his health - this had no other effect than making him, if possible, more secluded than ever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason for this seclusion - A. Not the least; he was hardly able of communication, he was so little communicative, I never knew the like. Some time after this he went to Mr. Cole to learn the shoemaking business, and left him in December.</p>
               <p>Q. Now come to the last two or three months; has he been at home since he left Mr. Cole - A. Yes; we observed some particular traits of his conduct, which I always considered savoured strongly of insanity, some of which came within my own knowledge - on several occasions when he entered his room where he secluded himself, he has did himself behind the door to avoid observation. This seclusion has increased within the last three months, and caused fearful apprehension on our minds, as it respected his personal safety - we were fearful lest he should destroy himself from, despondency.</p>
               <p>Q. From despondency of spirits, or derangement - A. The derangement I considered would arise from the lowness of spirits; I considered he had evident marks of temporary derangement arising from his spirits, dejection of mind, and intense study. He would not be seen by me for two or three days together frequently, though he was in the house, and he shunned me, particularly since I remonstrated with him - he never was so communicative as the rest of my family; he kept up stairs in his room, and scarcely ever went out. He spent his evenings at home either reading or sleeping; reading was his employment all day - he has lately been much disposed to make himself master of the Latin tongue. I believe he was pretty competent in mathematics, before this seclusion, so as to apply it to navigation - he knew geometry and mensuration, but was not so correct in them as I wished.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How long is it since he left off being a shoemaker - A. In December; he used the tools requisite.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. What you have related as to your fear of his destroying himself arose since December - A. We had fears prior to that, but stronger since; he had occasional relief from the parish, but I do not know when. He worked at shoemaking at Mr. Coles's, not at my house. The habits of seclusion took place at my house.</p>
               <p>MR. HORNE. He received relief from the parish about twelve months ago.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. At two particular times he has been affected in such a way as to cause considerable alarm; the first was seven years ago; he was very ill for some weeks. We missed him one morning at breakfast, and found him sitting in his room with his legs across, and when called to breakfast we could get no answer from him; we were obliged to take his breakfast up to him for some weeks after, he refused to come down, and at the end of some weeks he lost all appetite, and had a paralytic attack - he was more communicative at this time, and applied to the London Hospital. When he recovered he was not able to walk without crutches, and was absent for a week Last December he was taken very ill with a spitting of blood, and from that time he remained at our house night and day; he had lived at home for the last twelve months, and about five weeks after December, he complained of great pain and illness, and went again to Dr. Clapton, at the London Hospital, as an out patient.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to mix with the family or was he secluded - A. Till we observed this change, he was as the rest of the family, but since he confined himself wholly to his bed-room. He only went to the Hospital once, and was bled, and then he was seized in this melancholy way, and went no more - I think the last time he went to the Hospital was in February, after that he confined himself altogether to his bed-room, till evening, when he would go down into the yard at the back of the house, and remain there alone for two or three hours; this was his habit when the snow lay thick on the ground, ancle deep - this happened constantly from the time the alteration took place - we have frequently gone down to see where he was. There is no out-house in the yard; he was in the open air, and that in all the severity of winter. On the Tuesday before this affair, I was ill in bed, and in consequence of what I was informed of, I had my son and daughter called up, and desired them particularly to keep a watch over him - I had some time before that gone into his room, and found him in such a posture that I apprehended he contemplated suicide. The door opens close against the wall, and he had pushed a chair against the door, which was ajar, and stood in the corner, where there was scarcely room to stand. An unusual change had taken place in his conduct, for he was of such habits, he used to shun every body before, and I was informed of several things, such as his running down stairs naked, and he went out on the Tuesday towards evening for the first time after his seclusion - this was on the Tuesday before this happened; he returned about nine o'clock. I was confined to my bed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the charge you gave your son and daughter arise from any fear you had of his doing mischief to himself or others - A. I thought his injuring any one was the most unlikely thing in the world, for from his infancy he was the most harmless inoffensive temper, and was often imposed upon.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, and am younger than him. I remember his coming home about Christmas. He broke a blood-vessel; since that time his conduct has been considerably altered. He secluded himself from the family. I do not think that he had any books, but I cannot say; he kept close to his room, and would have nothing to say to any of the family; and we had great difficulty to get him down stairs to meals. Sometimes he had them up stairs, and sometimes would come down - we had to call him five or six times before he came. I suffered considerable anxiety of mind about about him. I went into his bed-room one day, since<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090055"></xptr>Christmas, and saw him behind the door, and was horror struck when I saw him, and could not speak to him, he was in such a situation - standing behind the door, close in the corner, looking down on the ground, with his hands up to his mouth. I immediately went out of the room - there was a chair near the door, but not behind it. This was after he left Mr. Cole, in the early part of the time, when he began to seclude himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What struck you with horror when you saw him - A. I considered he was contemplating self destruction.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any means of self destruction by - A. Not that I saw; but from his strange manner before, and his keeping from the family, I thought so; and during the hard winter, he retired every night into the back yard, and staid three or four hours, when the snow was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the open yards; or is there any covering - A. He used to remain in the privy. I have frequently made observations to him, but could get no answer. On the Wednesday before this melancholy occurrence took place. my mother charged me and my brother to keep an eye on him; for, on the night before, he came home at nine o'clock - I let him in - and the first thing he did was to fix his eyes, in a wild manner, upon me, and put up his left arm, as if to ward off a blow. He then went to the end of the passage leading to the yard; then turned, and fixed his eyes again as before; then he went down to the kitchen. I went up and told my mother, I did not know that I had done any thing to offend him, but he looked at me, as if he would murder me - and so I told her. I never had any words with him, or any disagreement in my life. And once (I think it was on the Tuesday) he came down to dinner, and was some time down before I observed him, and then I saw he was naked, all but his trowsers. He had neither shirt, or any thing on. He was in the room sometime before I observed him; I was at needle work, and a female lodger talking to me, so I did not observe it immediately - he did nothing. I observed him in that state for about half an hour; sometimes walking, and sometimes standing against the mantle-piece. We did not speak to him. I cannot tell whether the children were in the room. My father was out, and my mother was ill a bed. My brother was not there. I never saw him commit such indecencies before - quite the reverse. I never heard him express any dislike to Mr. Horne - he always spoke of him with the greatest respect - saying, Mr. Horne had always behaved uncommonly well since our circumstances had taken an unfortunate change. He was very weak. We had a small chopper in the house - but the one produced does not look like it - I do not think it is ours.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How often did he shave himself - A. I cannot tell - he did shave himself.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He had no razor when you saw him behind the door - A. No. I have frequently heard him talking, or muttering to himself; and, being uneasy, have listened at the door, but could never make out what he said.</p>

            . I lodge at the prisoner's father's, and have lived there two years; but, for the last six months I have noticed several things in the prisoner's behaviour - his keeping up stairs all day; and going into the yard every evening; and remaing there two or three hours on cold nights, when the snow was ancle deep; and besides, the next morning the blood has been on the privy when I have gone there. I have observed this several times when I went to the privy of a morning. If we met on the stairs, and he was coming down, he would run up - he always avoided me. On the Tuesday previous to this occurrence his mother was ill. I went down stairs, and was standing at the front window with his sister - the door between the two rooms is half glass. I happened to turn my eye, I saw him walking backward and forward, in the room, as fast as he could, naked, all but his trowsers. I did not mention it to his sister; but, before a quarter of an hour, he came across to the room, and stood before the glass, and began combing his hair as fast as he could. I I left the room as soon as I could. I thought it very singular, when he would never come into my presence at any other time; and that he never could be in his senses to have done so; and said so to his sister; he looked very wild at me when he came into the room. I observed that he looked very evil at me for the last five or six months, but could never think what it was for - his looks were very unpleasant. During the two years I have been there, I can safely say, he has not exchanged half a dozen words with me.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You thought he was out of his mind, by coming before the glass to comb his hair - A. I thought it strange. I never saw him do it before - he looked very wild, and had no shirt on.</p>

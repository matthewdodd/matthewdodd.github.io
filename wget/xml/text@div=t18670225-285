I live at 65, Fulham Road and am a bootmaker—last Saturday fortnight I saw my shop fastened up about eleven clock—I went to bed about a quarter to twelve—about one o'clock I heard a tre<lb></lb>mendous rapping at the street door—I jumped out of bed directly, and went down half dressed, and when I opened the street door I saw the witness Mrs. Richardson—from what she said, I looked and saw one of the centre shutters down, the large plate glass broken, large enough for me to get through, and one of my boots hanging out—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my boots, and were safe in the shop window when I went to bed.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Richardson, of 63, Sidney Street, about 100 yards from the prosecutor's—on the Sunday morning, about a quarter to one, I was going home; I heard a crash, looked across, and saw a man let the prosecutor's shutter fall, and saw the two prisoners run across—I am sure they are the men, I was within about fifty yards of them—I saw a police constable run after them; he caught them—I went across the road and knocked Mr. Criswick up—I saw the prisoners brought back, they are the men.</p>

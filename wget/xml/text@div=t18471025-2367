                  </hi> I live at No. 6, Beauchamp-street, Leather-lane—the prisoner and his wife resided in that house—her name was Matilda. I was called on Sunday morning, the 3rd of Oct., about two o'clock, by the prisoner's child—I went to the front attic, the room they lived in, and found the deceased lying on the floor insensible—she was supported by her hus<lb></lb>band—he said it was a very unfortunate job, and asked me what he should do—I told him he had better get a medical gentleman, and he went—while he was gone, I laid the deceased on the floor, and applied some vinegar—Mr. Caldcleugh came immediately and examined her person—she had come to her senses before he came—I was with her—she told me that her husband had kicked her—she made use of a coarse expression—she was not sober—I did not see any outward appearance of injury—there was a quantity of blood on the floor—cold water was applied to stop the discharge—I put a large shawl round the lower part of her person—she was not a sober woman—she had complained of floodings several times during the last few months—I have reason to believe that complaint was well founded—I had seen her on the Saturday night, the night before, about ten o'clock—she was then quite well, and in her usual spirits—she had said nothing to me on the subject of flooding that day—I afterwards examined the clothes she had on at the time I found her—I did not find them rent or torn.</p>

                  </hi> I am twelve years old, and am the daughter of the prisoner and the deceased. On Saturday night, the 2nd of Oct., my father and mother were both out—my father came home about eight o'clock—my mother was at home then—they both went out after that, and came back together about ten o'clock—I had then gone to bed—I sleep against the window, in the room to which they came back—they supped in that room—the noise of the frying-pan awoke me, and I heard my mother call my father a bad name—he did not say or do anything on that—mother had her supper, and then she called father another bad name, and threw the tongs, shovel, poker, and a knife at him—the shovel struck him—my father had nothing to drink—my mother had a quartern of gin, and half-a-pint of beer—I afterwards saw my mother go out of the room—she did not take a light—I could see her, as the door was very loose, and flew open—she was standing on the top stair—father was going out of the room, and she called him another bad name, and struck him with her hand, and he gave her a little bit of a kick behind,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184710250098"></xptr>
               <p>before he got back to the door she cried out, "Oh!"—he went to her immediately and led her into the room—before that, I had heard a sound like the rushing of water—when he brought her into the room he sat her o his knee and said, "How foolish you was to suffer me to kick you; I had no wish to do it, but you aggravated me"—my mother had been very poorly the day before that—she had told me that evening, as she was washing and ironing, showing me the way to wash, that she would put some black ribbon on grandmother's cap, for she knew she should not live till the morning—that was about six o'clock—there was nothing sharp that my mother could have fallen on where my father kicked her—she did not fall—the kick was outside her clothes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you awake when your father and mother came home that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I was soon after—they were kind and affectionate towards each other when I first awoke—there was a quartern of gin and a pint of beer on the table—the bad words were not made use of till after the gin had been drunk—my mother drank it all.</p>

                  </hi> I am a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company, and was assistant to Mr. Pollock. I was called in to see the deceased about half-past two o'clock on the Sunday morning—I found her lying on her right side, apparently insensible—she was almost pulseless, and her countenance pallid—after some time I asked her if she was unwell, and she said, "Yes"—I observed a quantity of blood on the floor near the door, and on the two upper steps, and her clothes were saturated with blood—I examined her person, but found no wound then—I subsequently assisted at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon in Hatton-garden. I was applied to, I believe by the prisoner, to go to the deceased, and requested Mr. Caldeleugh to go for me—upon a second application I went myself, about four o'clock on the Sunday morning—the woman was then quite dead—I found a large quantity of venous blood on the two highest steps of the stairs—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the Tuesday, and believe the hemorrhage to have been the cause of death—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here described the nature of the injury</hi>)—the injury might be caused by a kick behind, outside the clothes—it must have been with some violence—it was a lacerated wound, a tear.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you examine the lungs and heart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, n the head—the quantity of blood I saw was sufficient to account for the death—there was not less than three or four pints—I saw nothing else to account for immediate death.</p>

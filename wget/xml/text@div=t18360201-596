                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Horse Artillery at Woolwhich. I was at the Kings's Arms, Woolwich, on the 22nd of January I had been drinking with a comrade—we had three pots of beer—I was quite sober—the prisoner was not in my company, but as I came out of the parlour, she asked me if I had seen some person—I stopped to speak to her—I had my jacket open—she took my purse out of my pocket, and gave it to Mary Mitchell, who was standing with her is the passage—I felt the prisoner take it, and seized her directly—she said, "I have not got your money; the other girl had got it"—she had not asked me to go home with her—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my purse, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You put a shilling into my hand—I went to the bar, and got a quartern of gin, and gave and gave you the change—you said you wanted some tobacco, and I went into the tap-room and lighted your pipe for you—you asked me to take a walk with you across the green—I said I would not, as you were so tipsy—you went to pull me, and fell down—you held up a purse, and said, "In this purse I have got plenty of money"—you put out 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said it should be mine if I would go home with you—we made up our minds to go round the town, and sleep—I then went to speak to a your man—you made use of very bad language, and struck me, and pulled my petticoats over my head.</p>

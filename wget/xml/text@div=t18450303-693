                  </hi>. I am now living in Barrett's-court, Marylebone. I am single. About two months ago, I was in a public-house in Oxford-street with a man and two women—the prisoner came in—he knew the man that was with me, and they began talking—they treated me—I got drunk, and lost my recollection—I found myself, late the same night, at the prisoner's lodging at No. 2, Draper's-place, near Burton-crescent, New-road—I had not agreed to go there, nor was I at all conscious of going with him till I came to my senses in his place—it was dark in the evening when I awoke—I found myself undressed and in bed with him—up to this time I had been in service at a boot and shoe shop in Oxford-street—I had been a modest girl up to that time, and had not been in the habit of going with men—I had a half-holiday that day—in the morning</p>

               <p>the prisoner asked me to go and fetch my box, and said he would go with me—he knew before that I was leaving my place, for I had told him—I went to my place in Oxford-street, and he went with me—he carried my box to Draper's-place—I continued living with him better than a fortnight—on a Friday he said he was going to move his things till he got another lodging—he pointed out the house to me where he said he was going—a man named Reevely used to come to see the prisoner, and he helped him to move his things—he removed them on the Friday evening, the Saturday evening, and on Sunday morning—he took my box on Saturday, and there was a bonnet and shawl in it, that I intended to put on—he said on the Sunday morning that he had taken them by mistake, he would fetch them, and return in ten minutes, and take me with him to the place—he went out from half-past seven to eight on the Sunday morning, and was to return in ten minutes; but he did not return—he had shown me the house where he said the things were to be taken to—it is in Church-way, across the New-road—this pink gown is the one I wanted to put on that Sun<lb></lb>day, and the one that he would go and fetch—I went out to look for him, and saw him in Church-way, beyond where said he would take the things—I called out after him—he turned round and laughed at me—I went to the house where he said he would take the things, and they knew nothing of him—I afterwards saw him in Oxford-street, and asked him why he ran away—he said he had been looking for me—I said I would give him in charge if he did not give me my things—he said he would not give me my things; and if I gave him in charge he would shoot me—he had a pistol in his hand, and a sword by his side—I asked a policeman to take him—the prisoner said, "If you will let me go I will give you your things"—I said, "I don't wish you to take him," and the policeman walked off—the prisoner then began to threaten me again, and I gave him in charge of another policeman—I afterwards saw my box, when I went with the po<lb></lb>liceman to Little Exmouth-street—it was not locked when I left it, but there had been a fresh clasp put on since—it was my box—in the same room, in Exmouth-street, I found this pink gown of mine, a silk bag, four caps, and these other things—these are part of my things, but not all—the best are missing—these two gowns, found at the pawnbroker's, are mine, and were in my box when I took it to his room; but I do not know whether they were in it when be took it away—I gave him authority to pawn one shawl; and that I do not charge him with stealing—I never gave him authority to pawn either of these gowns—I told him my father lived at West Ham—he persuaded me to go with him to my father, and to pass him off as my husband—I pretended we were married—I had no idea that he lived in Little Exmouth-street till I went there with the officer—I thought he was going to the lodging in Church-way—I saw him write a letter to my father, which he posted himself—I believe this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Dear Mother and Father,—We have made up our minds to visit you to-morrow, Sunday.

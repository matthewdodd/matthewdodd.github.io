                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, residing at No. 2, Jacob's Well Passage, Barbican. I have occasionally purchased timber of Mr. Ingram—I purchased three 14 feet deals with two cuts on each, and two 10 feet deals with two cuts on each, of the prisoner, on two separate days—I cannot give the dates, but he came to my house on Saturday 15th Aug., I asked him what I had to give him, he said 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I paid him—I have it booked in superficial measurement—that is not the value of them; when I came to reckon, I found it a trifle under.</p>

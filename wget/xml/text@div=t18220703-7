               <p>"For God's sake let me go, there's a good fellow." I called Mr. Frankland; he felt and missed his handkerchief - I asked the prisoner where it was; he said a man threw it into his bosom. A man called out,</p>

            . I live at Cambridge. I was on London-bridge, on the evening of the 24th of June, about half-past six o'clock. Worrall called me, saying my pocket was picked - I felt and missed my handkerchief. That produced has every appearance of mine. I saw it picked up at his feet. It has no mark on it.</p>
               <p>- WALTERS. I am beadle of London-bridge. I saw a crowd, and found the prisoner in custody.</p>

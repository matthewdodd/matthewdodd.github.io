                  </hi>. I am not in any business now—I was a wine merchant, but retired in 1858—previous to that I had formed a con<lb></lb>nexion with the lady who is now my wife—that connexion has lasted about six years—I have two children by her; boys, who are now living—there was a suit in the Divorce Court; a divorce was obtained, and when the three or six months had elapsed, I married the lady, and am now living with her at Slough—we have lived there since April,1859—my household consists of two female servants, a coachman, a groom, and a gardener, generally speaking—the ages of my boys are eight and ten—I was desirous of obtaining a tutor for them, and applied to an agent named Johnson, through whom I was in<lb></lb>troduced to the defendant, whom I understood to be a clergyman of the Church of England—I should have accepted whoever suited me, whether he was a clergyman or not—I first saw Mr. Birch in May, 1862, thing—I think—I had several interviews with him, during which the position in which I was living or had lived, was not referred to, either by statement from me or, inquiry by him—I made no statements to him misrepresenting my position—I think the utmost I said was that we were very plain people, meaning that there was no show or display in my establishment—I subsequently engaged him to come into my service at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, a furnished cottage and other advantages, for which he undertook the education and that case would be especially short, as one was in extremely delicate health, but to take charge of them also during their hours of relaxation, and if either of us wished the connexion to cease, a month's notice was to be given—he was put in possession of the cottage, on my own grounds, the garden, fur<lb></lb>niture, and so forth—he is a married man—he went on without any objection to be found with him for four months—he and his wife dined at my table frequently, whenever I asked them—he became by degrees more and more five or six hours at a stretch, and I coaxed him as much as I could, as I did not</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS RICHARDSON BIRCH"</hi>—The date in reality was the Friday prior to the 6th of June last year—I answered that letter—I had previously spoken to him on the sub-ject of the boys—I kept copies of my letters; the copies you have there are fac-similes—I never contemplated their being produced in Court, and I have not put "Dear sir" in many of them, but the body I engrossed word for word—I sent that letter by my servant, who is not here, but prior to that I had sent a message (<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

Signed, T. R. <hi rend="smallCaps">BIRCH</hi>"—I saw him after that, and he was almost as abusive as he is in that scurrilous letter—he stated that I had taken him into my occupation under false representations—I had made no representations of any kind to him—I subsequently took another tutor, named Lott, who remained with me two months, and I subsequently hired a gentleman named Sharpe, from whom I received the letters which are the subject of this inquiry—prior to my giving the prisoner notice, he never in the most distant way asked me any questions as to the terms on which I was living with the lady; in fact he wished to remain a month longer than I wished—we are perfectly quiet people—I have the anonymous letter here, and have not the slightest doubt that it is in Mr. Birch's writing, as also the other one written to Mr. Sharpe.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. Q. When did you retire from business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In 1858—I was in partnership with my father and brother; not with any one else—I knew a gentleman named Barlow, about 1848 or 1850—I was never in partnership with him, nor had he anything to do with the business I was carrying on—he was not a partner with my brother or my father—I knew him by his occupying the upper portion of the house in which my business was conducted—I can hardly say I visited him as a friend, but I was intimate with him, and was occasionally at his house—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010005"></xptr>
               <p>introduced me to his wife, who had two children at that time—I do not know their ages; girls about ten or twelve, I believe—I visited them on friendly terms, and then eloped with Mrs. Barlow, if you choose to call it so—she left her husband's protection—I did not commit adultery with her in 1848—I am unable to tell you when it was; it was while she was under her husband's roof—I subsequently took her from her husband and herchildren, and lived in adultery with her for several years—the two children, that were the pupils of the reverend defendant, are the fruits of that adulterous intercourse—her divorce took place, I believe, in March, 1861, I think, and I married her immediately I could, which was in March, 1862, I think; if the gentlemen here are acquainted with the law, they will say that I did not lose one day; Messrs. Jennings and Son were my proctors, and assured me that that was the earliest date—when I engaged Mr. Birch as my tutor, I did not tell him the circumstances under which I had been living—I said nothing about it—I never gave him to understand that the children were illegitimate or the contrary—I told him I had a wife and children—I did not tell him that I was an Oxfordman, or a University man, or that my wife was a lady of high family, the daughter of a colonel, or that she was so virtuous she could not mix with any of the people round Windsor—I lead a quiet life; if it is necessary that the court should know it, I have had proffers of visiting, but I do, not visit—I am not acquainted with the residents of Slough and its neighbourhood—it is not true that no ladies visit at Herschell House; no ladies living in the neighbourhood visit at my house; that is at my wish—the defendant's cottage was close to my house, and he frequently dined with me on Sundays—he dined with me eight or ten times, whenever I asked him, and' his wife eight or ten times also—when the children were ill was not the only time his wife dined with me—the defendant behaved himself tolerably well for four months—giving the boys a holiday was not the only fault I found with him; he neglected them entirely—their hours were nominally from 10 to 12, and after that he let them play by themselves, and they got into the stable-yard, where I was anxious that they should not be—I had not a governess in the family when he was there; I had just before—I never imputed misconduct to her, or heard any misconduct mentioned—Mr. Birch did not complain that the children hadlearned certain facts respecting that young lady from me, and remonstrate with me about it, nor did my wife or any one—I gave her an excellent character—Mr. Birch never complained to me that the children had used improper language with reference to that young lady—I never had any con<lb></lb>versation with him about the circumstances of my family—I do not know, and do not care to know, whether he knew what had occurred prior—he never, in the most distant way, asked me about these rumours, or threatened to resign if I did not give him an answer—he did not resign—I dismissed him; there is a copy of the letter—he did not ascertain from me, the state in which I had been living with Mrs. Taylor, till I gave him notice—that was a written notice, and he and his wife left upon it—he wished to remain a month longer—I did not turn him out—I threatened that in the event of his not leaving my cottage on 6th July, the rental of it would be extremely high, and on that he went—he said that he should consult his solicitor whether he was not entitled to remain a month longer—I gave him notice in June, and he objected to go at first—he had an impression thatas I did not give him notice then, he was entitled to remain till August—he left on 5th July, but objected to do so at first—I first knew Mr. Johnson in May, 1862—he got me Mr. Birch, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Sharpe—I do not</p>

               <p>know whether the tutor pays him a commission; I paid nothing—I paid nothing for Mr. Lott—I received an acceptance of his, which I paid to Mr. Johnson for him—I do not deal in bills—Mr. Johnson sued him for the commission, and Mr. Lott paid him with his acceptance—I gave Mr. Johnson cash for the bill, and deducted it from Mr. Lott's salary—I knew nothing about it being for commission—I knew that it was for some claim—I have not, since the hearing before the Magistrate, made several statements about how much this prosecution has cost me—I have never said that it cost me 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I would pay 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I would ruin this man—I have never boasted how much it has cost me, or made any communication to any one, except my solicitor, about how much it has cost me—I was certainly very glad to find such eminent men on my side as the learned Queen's Counsel and Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, when I was threatened with Mr. Coleridge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have not you written to the papers stating that you had obtained the services of those gentlemen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been very anxious to let the world know that I am not afraid to meet an accuser in open Court, and I gave those names to prove my determination—the person I introduced Mr. Birch to, when he was trying to obtain the chaplaincy, was not a guardian, I believe, but he is a gentleman of considerable local influence—I have never charged another person with writing this anonymous letter—I know a man named Hearn at Windsor—I have had no dispute with him—I placed a pony in his hands to keep—he put it in harness, without my sanction, and wrung its shoulder, and I insisted on his making that reparation which his unwarrantable conduct required—he paid me a couple of sovereigns—I sued him—on my oath I did not charge him with writing this anonymous letter—Mr. Birch has never told me that he received anonymous letters respecting me—the first notice I had of it was contained in one of these defamatory letters—I have never received any anonymous letters—I did not receive this.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose those unfortunate proceedings against you appeared reported in all the public papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. Barlow, when he instituted the suit, did not seek to recover any damages, and no damages were recovered against me—I was in the hands of my proctors, and acting under their advice, I married the lady the moment she became free—there were some legal details respecting the sittings of Par<lb></lb>liament which they entered into; I cannot explain them to you—I put myself in their hands, married the moment I could, and have been living with the lady and the children ever since—it has not been my wish to visit in the neighbourhood—I only took the place with a view of protecting my child, who is subject to epileptic fits—many ladies do visit me, but I have no acquaintances there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The anonymous letter was read as follows;</hi>—"Windsor, October 15th, 1863. Reverend Sir,—For the present, in common justice to a stranger, all are quite willing and ready to believe that you do not know that you have entered into a sink of the greatest crimes and infamy, and vilest disgrace, or else are going to do so; if you still keep your engagement you will receive, and deserve it too, the contempt of all decent people who are not in the Church, and the greatest disgust of all the gentlemen who are so. Inquire of the police of this borough, also of Eton and Slough. If, likewise, you can make up your mind, and think it right to do so, you can apply about those dreadful things of the house at Slough, to the ministers there, namely, the Rev. Mr. Cree, Rev. Mr. Birch, and the Rev. Mr. Sykes. Counsellors to one whom we think needs counsel."—<hi rend="italic">The letter to Mr. Sharpe was as follows: "</hi> Slough,</p>

               <p>October 23rd, 1863. Rev. Sir,—I am grieved to say that the duty which your letter calls upon me to perform, is one of a most painful character. When I entered upon the tutorship I need scarcely say it was in perfect ignorance of any one of the said circumstances of the family about which you inquire, or rather it was under a tissue of misrepresentations as to the social and moral condition of it. About three weeks after my arrival here, I was elected chaplain of the union. When the chairman in full board had told me, as he expressed himself with great pleasure, that I was unanimously chosen with an increased stipend, he added that it was with extreme sorrow and regret be found I stood in any relation to Mr. Taylor, and inquired whether I was willing to resign. I was allowed a certain time for examina<lb></lb>tion of the alleged facts against Mr. Taylor. During that period I received several anonymous letters, referring to law reports in which occurs the case of 'Barlow <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Barlow and Taylor.' I also received a newspaper containing a report of the Consistorial Court proceedings in that lamentable matter. The far greater part of the ladies of this place, while saying how happy they would be to receive the visits of Mrs. Birch, assured me that it was utterly impossible to visit her; and many gentlemen, while calling on me, apologised for not bringing their wives or daughters to the cottage, No respectable persons visit at Herschell House. When Mr. Taylor, after six serious entreaties upon my part, declined to tell me whether, even then, he was married to the woman with whom he lives, and who is the mother of the boys, my late and your prospective pupils, I quitted the cottage. Since that time I have been most credibly informed that there are other facts in this case to which I should be ashamed to refer in writing. The most injurious circumstance of my life is my ever having stood in the connexion with them which I have so unhappily done. I am quite startled at their audacity in again address<lb></lb>ing themselves to a clergyman, but suppose that even their shamelessness has not gone so far as to again address themselves to one who is married. I am, Reverend Sir, yours faithfully, T. R. <hi rend="smallCaps">BIRCH. "</hi>

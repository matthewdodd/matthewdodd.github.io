                  </hi> I am warehouseman of Mr. Athur Wilcoxon he has one partner. Hodge spoke to me—I examined the warehouse, and missed twenty pieces of paper of this pattern—I had seen the paper safe the same morning—the prisoner came to work next morning, and was given into custody—he was questioned about the papers, and he said he knew nothing about them—they were the property of Mr. Wilcoxon and his partner—the prisoner had no order to take paper out at that time—he went without leave—he had been ordered to take some paper out about half past three o'clock—the shopman can give him orders to take out paper as well as I can—the shopman is not here—we did not know what pattern it was till we spoke to Hodge, and then we missed it.</p>

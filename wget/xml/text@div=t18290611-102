On the 13th of April I had 26l. 9s. in the bag - there were fourteen sovereigns and a half among it; I had one bag in another - one contained the silver, and the other the gold; I lost them both; my niece used to come every night and sit with me - she left me at half-past nine o'clock in the evening, on the 13th of April; I know at that time my bag of money was secure: after my niece was gone, the prisoner came up without my ringing for her - she said, "Master, do you want any thing?" I said, "Yes, push me nearer the fire, that I may warm my legs, and then I will go to bed;" I know my money was safe then; she pushed me nearer the fire - I sat there about ten minutes, and rang for the boy to put me to bed; when she pushed me to the fire, she could have taken the bag - it was safe when she came into the room; when I rang the bell to go to bed, I felt for my bag to take it to bed, and missed it - I called her up, and said, "Ann, you have robbed me, and shall not go out of the room till I have an officer to search you;" no person had come into the room from the moment she left me till I missed the bag - she denied all knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She was searched? A. Yes; her bed, and every thing was searched; the boy always helps me to bed - he was not searched; I never undress till I get into my bed-room; I had a good character with the prisoner, from her sister, but I believe it was false - I missed the money before the boy came up, for when I rang the bell she came up instead of him; I told her to go and tell the boy to put me to bed, and then I missed the bag - there was a 5l. note, and 7l. 9s. in silver, in shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns; I felt it safe when my niece went away - she always made me see that it was right; I did not see the bag, but felt it - my niece puts down what I have paid away in the course of the day; I knew the bag was there, for I laid on it, and could feel it - it has not been found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It was quite safe behind you when the prisoner came into the room, and after she put you to the fire you missed it, and nobody but her had been in the room for those ten minutes? A.Nobody; I missed my money about half-past nine o'clock.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fordham. On the 13th of April I remember Mrs. Fordham going away, about half-past nine o'clock; the prisoner was then in the tap-room - she came to the bar for some porter, I said, "Mary, Mrs. Fordham is gone, and you need not go up-stairs till the bell rings, for she has brought down all the glasses and the waiter, so you need not go up;" the prisoner took the porter - I afterwards saw her talking to a person in the tap-room; she then pulled the door open, and ran up-stairs very quick, without the bell ringing; the person she spoke to is Wright, a sweetheart of her's -I have not seen him since; she ran up-stairs suddenly, returned in five or ten minutes, and after that she came to the bar; I said, "Did the bell ring?" she said No; I said, "Have you been up-stairs?" she said, Yes; I said, "Why did you go - I told you not to go without the bell ringing;" she said, "I only went up to put master to the fire, and put down an apple to roast;" I do not know what became of the young man after that - I did not see him go out.</p>
               <p>Q.You had seen her talking to the young man; now, before your master's bell rang, had you seen that young man in the room? A. yes, he was sitting in the room - I was minding the customers; he might have gone out without my noticing him, and she might have spoken to him without my knowledge - he has not been to the house since; when master's bell rang, the prisoner went up stairs, came down very quick, and said, "You must go up-stairs immediately, ma'am;" I said I could not, she must go; she said, Master said I must come up immediately - I went up, and she went with me; he told me what had happened, and an officer was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She went up with you? A.We both went up together - I did not go up at first, because the till was open, and I could not leave the bar - I told her to go up; she came down, and said I must go, and we both went up - I had seen her speaking to Wright by the fire before she first went up; there was no concealment about their conversation that I knew of - I did not see her speak to him after the bell rang.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her after she said she had put her master to the fire? A. No, not in the tap-room; I saw her, but did not see her speak to Wright, or give any thing to him, but I was busy; the bar is not above a yard from the tap-room; the door opens when people go in or out, and I can then see into the tap-room - I do not know how long<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110044"></xptr>Wright staid there; when the prisoner came down, she sat on the stairs; she went into the tap-room, came out again, and sat on the stairs - she knew the young man, and used to call him her sweetheart.</p>

            . I am pot-boy to Mr. Fordham. I remember the evening he lost his money; I had seen Wright in the house in the morning, and had seen him there before - he used to come to the house almost two or three times every day - he would come in as a customer; I have seen him speak to the prisoner; I did not see him speak to her that morning; I saw him speaking to her in the evening before the bell rang - I could not hear what they were saying; I do not recollect her going up before the bell rang - I saw them speaking together about nine o'clock in the evening, in the tap-room - I saw him go out about a quarter of an hour before the bell rang; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he went away a quarter of an hour before the bell rang? A. As near as I can say; I cannot say whether master's neice was gone then, as I did not see her go - Wright went out about a quarter before nine o'clock, I think; if she went at twenty minutes past nine, he must have gone before her - I cannot say whether he went before nine, but to the best of my knowledge it was; he was often at the house - there was no concealment about their manner; I take the liquor into the tap-room; whether I was there much that evening I do not know - there might be twelve other people there when she and Wright were there; they were all men - one was sitting on the same bench, about a yard from them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were you attending to your business? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did you take any beer out at nine o'clock? A. I was in and out; we do not take much beer out-only a pot or so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City-police—prior to the 29th November, I received some information from Mr. Jenkinson—on the evening of the 29th, I was called to his shop and found the prisoner there—Mr. Jenkinson, jun. shortly afterwards came in—there was a large bundle containing three hides lying within a yard of the prisoner; it was not open, it was done up in an apron—I said to the prisoner, "You have brought that parcel in here"—he said, "No, I have not"—one of Mr. Jenkin<lb></lb>son's men said, "Yes, you have"—he then said, "Well, I have brought it in"—I told him we were two police officers (Baker was with me), and asked how he accounted for the possession of that parcel—he said he had bought it—I said, "Who did you buy it of?"—he said, "I bought it"—I said, "Where do you come from"—he said, "From Sheerness"—I asked him when did he buy it, who did he buy it of; and what did he give for it?—he said, he bought it—that was all the answer he gave then—I then took him to the station—lie there said that Sergeant Morris had given it to him—he said that he belonged to the Artillery at Woolwich, and he worked in the harness room, that it belonged to Sergeant Morris, and he had given it to him to dispose of—he was anxious to write to Sergeant Morris, and in my prestence he wrote this letter—I had told him I was going to Woolwich—he said, "You had better see Morris"—I said "I shall see the adjutant"—this is the letter he wrote in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>"Mr. Morris—Three of the buff hides that belong to you I have offered to Mr. Jenkinson for sale; I am now in custody for doing so; see to this immediately—obediently yours, James Morrison")—I afterwards received from Mr. Jenkinson, sen. in the prisoner's presence at the station, 27 hand parts—I asked the prisoner how</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060105"></xptr>
               <p>he accounted for the possession of them—he said they came from the same source—next morning I went to Woolwich and found this bag bearing the prisoner's name, in a room at the barracks where he slept—it contained two or three pieces of leather similiar to these—it is the same description of leather as the hand parts are cut from—I likewise received this letter from the quarter-master.</p>

Now, so far as the evidence goes, that there have been goods stolen, it only amounts to this, that Mr. Morris takes ill something like seven or eight weeks previous to my apprehension, and when he comes back to the shop he finds his goods diminished; and a very likely thing too; there were a great many men at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060107"></xptr>
               <p>work there, and a great quantity of material used, and it is very likely that the goods may bare been out up in our trade. So much for goods being stolen. Then as to the identifying of the goods. It is all very well telling business men that goods are had out of the stores not marked; we all know it is not so; even our gloves, boots, and everything we get, and the tools we use, are marked with the Government stamp; it is only a trick that is tried to be played upon you, to say that there are goods in the store marked and not marked; but it so happens that the goods in question were given out of Mr. Morris's private store. Then as for my stealing them. The only evidence laid before you that I stole the goods, is that I was entrusted with the key from dinner time till evening; if Corporal Weaver had been here he would have told you that he was at work with me, and also another sergeant, and that I did not go to the stores the whole afternoon, and that I left without any parcel, and that I could not have taken or handled the goods without their knowing it; but the witness, very unfairly, is kept back, purposely, no doubt, that you may not see the rights of the case; I leave it to you, gentlemen, to say whether I did steal the goods, or whether they are the property of Her Majesty. I have great doubts whether they are leather at all; if not, the indictment must fail. I trust you will show by your verdict that the humblest, as well as the noblest in the land, can have justice at your hands, and that you will not send a man to prison solely upon doubts and suspicions, without the least foundation, and without being supported by evidence.</p>

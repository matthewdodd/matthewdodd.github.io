                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Banister, of No. 4, Whitehead's grove, Chelsea. On 20th Feb., about 3 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, I was with Miss Hallett in Hoborn, standing at the comer of Hatton<lb></lb>garden—there were several persons there—we only stopped to make our way across; as we crossed there was a man with a bag on his back, and I looked and saw a man's hand against me—I put my hand on it, and he snatched it away and ran—I ran after him, and hallooed "Stop thief!"—a policeman pursued him, and Miss Hallett also—we never lost sight of him—he also took my handkerchief from my pocket, and threw it down—my purse contained three sovereigns, seven half sovereigns, some crowns, two florins, and several shillings and sixpences—I had changed a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece a minute before by St. Andrew's Church—the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>the hand of the person whose hand was in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he snatched it from me, and ran from me—I said, "Oh! I am robbed," and he ran immediately—the prisoner was the first man running—I have no doubt about him, he quite raised my gown—I hare not seen a person named Lyde to day—I may have done so once—nothing was said that I know of about receiving any money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mrs. Banister. On 20th Feb. I was walking with her in Holborn—there was a crowd at the corner of Hatton<lb></lb>garden—I stopped to look what it was, and the prisoner was just taking his hand from Mrs. Banisters pocket—she caught hold of it, and he tore it away, and ran down a court in Holborn—I ran after him, and lost sight of him just as he got into the court—a policeman ran after him also—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see several persons about you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I dare say twenty—Mrs. Banister hallooed "Stop thief!"—I heard her say, "I am robbed," and on that I saw the hand going, and then saw the pri<lb></lb>soner run as fast as he could.</p>

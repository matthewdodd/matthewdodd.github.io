                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a green-grocer's shop, in St. Mary-at-Hill. The prisoner came to my shop on the 5th of March for a pennyworth of onions, and gave me a half-crown in payment—I gave him in change two shillings and fivepence—he turned the two shillings about, put them to his mouth, took them away, and then told me that one was bad; he thought it looked pale, and he did not like to take it—I asked him to give it me back—I took it, and saw it was not a good one—I am positive that the two shillings I gave him were good—I told him I had no bad money—I am sure the shilling which he returned to me was not one of the two I had given him—I examined them when I gave them to him—I took the shilling which he returned to me, and gave him another, thinking he would come again—I wrapped it up, marked it, and put it away in a drawer—he was dressed as he is now, with a smock-frock and a coal-heaver's apron on—he came again on Saturday, the 7th—he then had on a south-wester—his face was dirty, and he had the appearance of a coal-heaver—I knew him again—he asked for a lemon—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him two good shil<lb></lb>lings—as I knew him, I examined my money before I gave it him—he acted very much as he did the first time—he gave me one shilling back—I took it, marked it, and put it away with the other—I am positive it was not one of the shillings I had given him—I gave him a good shilling, and he went away—I made an arrangement with my daughter Zillah, and marked two good shillings on the same day—the prisoner came again on the 20th of March—he was dressed then as on the first occasion—I knew him as soon as he en<lb></lb>tered the shop—he asked for a pennyworth of onions—he gave me half-a-crown—I gave him the two good shillings which I had marked—he drew them off the counter, one in one hand, and one in the other, and returned me one shilling while I was counting the coppers—he told me it was not a good one—I spoke to my daughter so that he could hear me—I gave her the half-crown, and told her to go to get change, as I had determined on with her before he came—she went out, and brought in an officer, who took the prisoner—I gave the officer the two bad shillings which I had received from him before, and the one he brought on the 20th.</p>

                  </hi>. I had some communication with my mother, and a signal had been agreed upon between us—on the 20th of March I was in a room adjoining the shop—the prisoner came and asked for a pennyworth of onions, which my mother gave him—he offered a half-crown—she put the two shillings on the counter—he drew them off with his two hands, and put the right hand one to his mouth—he took another shilling out of his mouth, gave it to my mother, and said it was a bad one—I went out to get change, and got the officer.</p>

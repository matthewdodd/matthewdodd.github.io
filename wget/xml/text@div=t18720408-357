                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and carry on business at 9, Adam and Eve Court, Oxford Street, in partnership with the prisoner's father—I know the prisoner—he was apprenticed to Mr. Broadwood—on the evening of 26th March I went to see Mr. Broadwood at his shop—be<lb></lb>fore I started to go there I said, in the prisoner's presence, that I was going over to Mr. Broadwood's with a piece of work—he heard me say that—Gritten was there when I said so—I went across to Mr. Broadwood's shop, which is on the top floor—I was talking to Mr. Broadwood, and I lent him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay something—I walked to the other end of the shop, while he was paying the money away, and all of a sudden I felt two blows at my back, and heard someone say "You b—, I will take your life," "I will murder you," or some words to that effect—after that he exclaimed "You b—wretch, I will rip your b—guts out"—I turned round, and caught his hand as he inflicted the third blow on the top of my head—it was the prisoner's hand—I seized him by the neck and by the wrist, with this mallet in his right hand; at the same time I called for assistance—the prisoner said he would rip my b—guts out if it was for years to come, and, if he served seven years, when he came out he would do it—his master was with me, and he threatened to rip him up when he came out of</p>

               <p>prison—there were only three blows—the third was on the top of my head, but I caught the prisoner's arm, or it must have dashed my brains out—the mallet was taken out of his hands, and he was taken down stairs, and then to the station—the inspector sent a policeman with me to the hospital—I received two blows on the back of the neck, and one on my head, which laid my head open—it was strapped up at the hospital—I was laid up in bed several days—Dr. Joliffe attended me for very near a week—I was confined to my bed—I had signs of erysipelas, and my head swelled up, and I suf<lb></lb>fered a great deal of pain; it festered—here is the mark on my head—I don't suffer much pain now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that the two blows were in the back—I meant the top of my back—I believe I stated before the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate what I have stated to-day—I stated that he said "You b—, I will take your life," and that he used the words "B—wretch"—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner in my life—he had not the slightest reason for this at all—it was in the dark—there was a candle about forty feet off—there were benches in the shop—I did not see the prisoner when he came up, and I did not see him pass me in the shop—the shop is eighteen feet wide, and forty feet long—there is a space of about two feet ten inches between the benches—I was passing through the benches when I received the blows—I turned round and caught him by the collar as I received the third blow—I did not seize him by the throat—the prisoner's father is my partner—I did not want him to give me a sum of money and dissolve the partnership—I don't owe him about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I owe him a little—I have agreed to withdraw from this prosecution if the Judge would recommend him to mercy—I have not agreed that I would withraw on the considera<lb></lb>tion that I would dissolve partnership unless the Judge allowed me to with<lb></lb>draw—this is an agreement which the father drew up, and he got me to sign it—Mr. Broad wood is here—he and the others in the shop would be able to hear what was said as well as I did—Mr. Broad wood works for me; we are not on very intimate terms—he had nothing to do with me joining Mr. King in partnership—I made him a present of a gold watch after I joined Mr. King, but that Was because he had done me several good turns in business.</p>

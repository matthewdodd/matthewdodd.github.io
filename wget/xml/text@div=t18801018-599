I am a timber merchant—I was trustee in liquida<lb></lb>tion of the effects of a Mr. Herbert Henry Lamb in August, 1876—the bankruptcy proceedings took some time, but at the end of 1879 the majority of the creditors were paid, a few outstanding amounts being left—Mr. Chatterton was the solicitor; the prisoner was his clerk—I had</p>

               <p>known Mr. Chatterson for some time—on 13th September, 1879, the prisoner came to my office to me and arranged to pay another Mr. Chatterton, an advertising agent, the final dividend—I thought he came from the office and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay to Mr. Chatterton—on 27th September he came again and asked me for a small sum to pay other outstanding dividends—I do not remember any reference being made to the previous occasion—the amount was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay Mr. Kish—he said he had met Mr. Kish at one of the police-courts, and that he had told Mr. Kish he had some money for him, which Mr. Kish was glad of, and I gave him the money for that purpose, believing his statement—on 30th September I gave him a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the balance which was at the bank to settle up with the outstanding creditors—on 27th, 28th, and 29th November he came again—he asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the last occasion—I do not recollect the dates, but these two receipts were written in my office—when he asked for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he told me his wages were not due at Mr. Chatterton's office till the following Monday, he was paid monthly, and he was pressed for cash—I was under the im<lb></lb>pression that he was in Mr. Chatterton's employment or I should not have lent him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I eventually heard that he had left Mr. Chatterton's employment; then inquiries were made; in the result I received this letter dated 21st December, 1879. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had received Mr. Prince's letter of the</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th, which had been forwarded to him at</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Draycott Terrace, Shane Street; that he had been unwell or would have seen Mr. Ind before, but would see him on Tuesday and produce Mr. Kish's receipt, so that Mr. Prince should not be a loser, and would write with appointment.</hi>) I had written to his office believing he was there—on 29th December, Mr. Ind, one of Mr. Chatterton's clerks, and I saw the prisoner at the Monster public-house—I there told him I had discovered the amounts had not been paid—he admitted he had not paid the smaller amounts, but stated he had paid Mr. Kish, and the receipt would be found in the bank book in his desk at Mr. Chatterton's office—I have not seen the prisoner again till recently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of Mr. Chatterton's clerks; Holt was under Pearce and me; I was cashier in November, 1879—I supplied the clerks with money and required them to keep an account in a small book in which they entered moneys their received, and the payments opposite—Pearce first had charge of Lamb's bankruptcy, and then it was transferred to me and was in my hands in November, 1879, for the purpose of making up the accounts—a first dividend had been paid to nearly the whole of the creditors—there was a second dividend to pay; Mr. Prince paid them—Holt came in January, 1879—we prepared a draft account and I asked Holt to see Mr. Prince for the purpose of proving it—he had no authority to receive any money from Mr. Prince—if Mr. Prince paid him any it was his duty to enter it in his cash book, and then it would have been entered into the journal to show the payments—no account was rendered to me of the receipts of moneys from Mr. Prince—I have looked through the journal and there are no entries—the prisoner never told me he had received those moneys—there is no such entry in his cash book—Mr. Chatterton did not personally attend to the matter, he scarcely knew of the transactions—I remember the interview at the Monster between Prince, Holt, and myself—Mr. Prince there asked Holt why he bad not paid the dividends, and he admitted having received them with the exception of Mr. Kish's, which he stated had been paid, and the receipt was in the pass-book in his desk at the office, and he asked me if I would meet him at 9 o'clock at the office and he would give it me—he did not come—the pass-book was not found at the office; this is the pass<lb></lb>book—Mr. Kish's receipt is not in it—the prisoner was paid a weekly salary, not monthly—no salary was due to him on Wednesday, 29th November—by the books it appears he was paid up to 22nd November—on the following Tuesday he was discharged for being absent on the Monday; he came at 11.55 on the Tuesday—he had been cautioned—no meeting was afterwards effected between me and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This money was due from Prince, and is a matter of account between him and me. It has nothing to do with Chatterton, to whom I was clerk. Prince promised to remunerate me for what I did, as it was done for him and not for Chatterton; the understanding between Prince and me about Pyman's dividend, was that I was to put in the receipts and pass them through, and we were to divide the money between us, as Pyman had gone abroad. When I borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Prince I was out of Chatterton's employ, and I did not tell Prince that I was in it. I advised Prince as a friend, with reference to several estates, but I never mentioned Chatterton's name, and none of the moneys were received from him, and I never signed the receipts <hi rend="italic">per, pro</hi>, or otherwise, for Chatterton. Prince complained to me, and I said I was sorry for the way I had used him, but would pay him back. These proceedings have been taken against me because I said some<lb></lb>thing about Chatterton's private affairs, and my report of it was sent to his office. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Ind here stated he had teen a report at Mr. Chatterton's office in the prisoner's writing about a week ago, but he did not know when it came. Mr. Pearce stated it was received about two days before the prisoner's arrest.</hi>) When I was brought before the Magistrate no evidence was offered, and I was discharged on my own recognisances to appear on the following Tuesday. (<hi rend="italic">James Sanctuary here stated that this was the case, and that the prisoner appeared on hit recognisances.</hi>) When I appeared on the Tuesday I was charged with embezzling these and other moneys. The charges are all brought against me through spite. I dealt with Prince irrespective of Chatterton altogether.</p>

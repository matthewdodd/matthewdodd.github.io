I missed money from a small cupboard adjoining the shop, and on the 15th of August we marked some shillings, and afterwards, as I missed three shillings, we asked her to lend me 2s., which she gave me, and they were two of those which my son had marked; I then searched her box, and found the other marked shilling; she said she had taken it. Mr. Israel would not prosecute her, and we sent her away, telling her to send her father for her box in the morning, and after she was gone, when I was putting the things back into her box I found the articles stated in the indictment, which I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140045"></xptr>not missed - she had lived with me before three years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You let her go and changed your mind afterwards? A. Yes, when we found the other things; the constable was present; she gave up her key willingly - there were so many things that I did not notice them, as I turned them out, but on putting them in I found them; I had not left the room before I found them.</p>
               <p>HENRY ISRAEL. I am the prosecutrix's son. I marked nine shillings at three o'clock, and put them into the parlour cupboard, and in half an hour I missed three; a constable was fetched, and when the three shillings were found she said they were our's. My father allowed her to go, and detained her box, wishing to tell her father what she had done. These three shillings are what I marked.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was sent for. Mrs. Israel gave me two shillings, saying she had borrowed them of the prisoner, and they were marked - the prisoner denied taking them at first; I searched her box, in her presence, and found a shilling marked in the same way; she had 24s. in her box; she said, voluntarily, that the three shillings were her mistress's, and was sent about her business; nothing else was found while I was there. I took every thing out of the box, but it was nearly dark. She came to Israel's three or four days after, with her father, and was given in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Mrs. Israel examine the things as you took them out? A. Not closely.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The officer said he was not there. Said the prisoner, then I will not go along with you. And Beach said, I have got a warrant or a writ against him, I know not which, and he shall not go along with you.</p>

               <p>Bury. He is an officer, and came in along with the prisoner. Then the prisoner's wife went out, and brought him in a pistol, or pistols. Then the prisoner said, where is my prosecutor? The constable said, he is not here. The prisoner said, who gave you charge of me? The constable said, Mr. Bury did, and I have commanded him to aid and assist me. A person in the room said, take care, he has pistols about him. Then the constable thought proper to take his word till the next morning. I went to Spital-fields for the prosecutor, but did not know where he lived; so I went to the house of Mr. Wright, in Mason's-court, and desired him to come down to us; but he said he was afraid of being murdered. I returned without him; but I had not been in the house above ten minutes, before James Green and Stanley came in. The prisoner then said some words, which I think were these, there is Bury that had me taken, cut away. Then they all fell upon me at once; some had sticks, and James Green had a hanger. I then received these wounds ( shewing scars on three fingers and his thumb on his left-hand, another on the thick part of his right arm, and several on his head ); I am told there were twenty-three cuts on my head; my nose was cut on the upper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150010"></xptr> part, and the end hung down on my upper lip.

I plunged in among them, in order to make my escape; I got out into the street, but how I can't tell. It was very dark, and I got on the other side of the way, where there was no lamp, with intent to secrete myself. They pursued me, and called a bull-dog of Green's which they called Bosson, and set him upon me. He seized me, and I got hold of the dog.

I went with him to the Rose-and-crown, Church-lane, and told the prisoner there I had got a warrant for him, he said, will not you take our words for me? I said, no, but if Mr. Stevens the landlord of the house, will pass his word for your forth-coming any hour to-morrow, I will take his word, but the landlord would not; then one Beach that was there said he had got a warrant against him; I said my warrant is better than yours. Mr. Hudson put his hand by his side and said, I had made a mistake, his wife coming in, after which he said, Blast my eyes if I'll go with any of you; he went out, I followed him, he said, what do you follow me for? if you do I'll blow your brains out, don't come a foot further. Bury came in and called for a pint of twopeny, then in came Green, Stanley, Hudson, and Beach; Hudson said, this is he, and they cut away as fast as they could upon him; how Bury got out I could not tell, but upon tracing the blood I found him in the street, I got a watchman to carry him to the hospital.</p>

On the 31st of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the shop - he asked for some calico, which I served him with; it came to 1s. 4d. - he had a bag which he put down on the ground by the side of the counter - while I was folding up the calico, another customer came in and inquired for an article; a youth named Sills came to attend to that customer; I desired him to fold up the calico and attend to the prisoner while I waited on the customer; the prisoner then asked for some fine twist sheeting; I went three or four yards to fetch it, and when I returned with it he had left the shop - I do not know whether he had paid for the calico; I missed a roll of about fifty yards of gros de Naples off the counter almost immediately - it laid on the part of the counter where he stood; there was nobody near enough to take it but him, except a female, and the prisoner stood between her and the silk, as such she could not take it - I had seen her at the shop before but did not know her; she remained there till after the loss was discovered - she had no bag; the prisoner's bag would contain the silk easily - I immediately sent the clerk to look for the prisoner, but he was not found; on the Wednesday or Thursday following I saw him in custody, and recognized him as the man who came for the calico, before I knew he was custody - I have no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many customers were in the shop? A. There were three or four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100034"></xptr>in the inside of the shop, but none but the female on that side to the best of my recollection - there was not more than three or four customers - I will swear there were not eight persons in the shop exclusive of shopmen; I believe there were two or three in the shop at the time I missed the silk, one or two had left; the woman had no cloak on, if she had I should have noticed it; I swear she had a handkerchief or shawl on, but did not notice her dress, but am positive she had no cloak, or shawl on or I should have noticed it; I think I should know every body who came with a cloak on if I waited on them; I turned my back to the prisoner to reach down the article he asked for - I had told Sills to wait on him, and receive the cash from him - but before I left him to wait on another customer he asked for this article, and while I was reaching it he left in a precipitate manner; I was informed he had paid for what he had - my back was turned about an eighth of a minute - Sills was with him at that time, and went in pursuit; the woman did not leave for some time after - I attended on her afterwards - she might have been in the shop for five minutes; I saw nobody leave the part of the shop the silk was laying in except the prisoner, but my attention was called to another part of the shop - it was impossible for any body to cross the shop and take the silk during the short time my back was turned - it is six or seven yards across; the silk has never been found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It was rather a large package, could a woman, without a cloak, conveniently conceal it? A. Impossible; she must have been observed if she had it- she bought several articles, and did not go till she was suited.</p>

            . I am cashier at Mr. Poole's. I saw the prisoner in the shop when he first came in; master served him - when the shopmen are busy I serve, but not generally; the prisoner paid me for something, but what he bought I do not know - he had a parcel which I gave him, and a bag; I could not observe whether it had any thing in it - Mr. Wilson missed the silk in less than half a minute; I had observed several rolls of silk on the counter, and could not tell one was gone - I immediately went out after the prisoner, but could not see him; I had observed his person - he was close to me; I saw him again about four days after, and am quite sure of him - the woman stood at the counter near the prisoner; no other customer was at that counter - there was a counter at the end of the shop, and two are opposite each other; nobody crossed the shop from the time I saw the prisoner there, till he left the shop, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Wilson called you over to take the money from the prisoner? A. I came to serve the other customer; he said I had better take the money from the prisoner - I was perhaps two yards from him or less at that time; Wilson turned to reach something - my face was turned towards the prisoner; I had an opportunity of seeing him - I did not see his bag till he was going out - I could not see it across the counter; I did not see him take the silk - he could have taken it without my seeing him, and put it into his bag; I am sixteen years old - I swear he might have pulled the silk off the counter while I was looking at him, and I not see him; I cannot swear he did do it - I did not notice what he was doing particularly; I know I have sworn I was looking at him, but still he might take it without my seeing him - I can see across the counter, but not underneath it; it was between me and him - the roll of silk might be between half a yard and yard long; I think I had seen the prisoner in the shop once before, and have seen the woman more that once - I cannot say how often; I have been there about a month - the woman had a black bombazeen or stuff frock or gown, or something on, and a child in her arms; she had no cloak, for I saw her frock and she had nothing to cover it - she was the person I was called to serve; I do not know what she bought, for I went out to look for the prisoner - I cannot say whether the bag contained any thing, he went out so fast; there was a roller in the silk, and it was rather bulky - it was a middling sized bag.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you not have observed the silk in it? A. He was close to the door, and went out in a quick manner - I do not know whether the woman was searched; I cannot say how many persons were in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any body at the counter where the silk lay, except the prisoner and the woman? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 31st of August, Mr. Poole came to me - I got a description of the prisoner from Sills, and on Friday morning he was driving up the City-road in a gig - I stopped him, took him to Mr. Poole's and asked some person there whether he could give us a better description of the man than I had before; the prisoner was with me - we then went up stairs to the bed-room where Mr. Wilson was ill in bed; I asked him if he could give us a description of the person supposed to have taken the silk - Mr. Wilson neither said the prisoner was or was not the man; I did not tell him the prisoner was in custody - he described the man as he had before; Sills was not in the way - I went to Guildhall and desired the prosecutor to bring Sills there, and as I and the prisoner stood at the Justice room I saw Sills coming - I told the prisoner to go in, and directly Sills came he pointed to the prisoner and said, "That is the man;" he did not know he was in custody - I had not told any body of it; the prisoner denied the charge in toto.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He went with you to the shop? A. Yes; he drove me there in the gig.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will consider the awful situation I am placed in, if any gentleman here resembled the person who took the silk it would be a disgrace to him as well as me - if I had been guilty I should never have let the officer come in my gig and drive him to the door; we went to the gentleman's bed-room and asked him if he could swear to the man who took the silk - he said he could not, having no recollection of him; a woman in the shop said the person was very much like a Jew - they said he was not, and the woman said "I will have it that he was;" she was asked if she could swear to him; she said she could - she pointed to me, and said it was a man a little taller than that man.</p>

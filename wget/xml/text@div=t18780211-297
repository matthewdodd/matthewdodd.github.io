                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Camberwell Grove—early in November the prisoner and a woman came to me—she said in his hear<lb></lb>ing that they had just come from Dover to receive some property, and that they were independent people—they said "That is our home, Dover," or some place very near Dover, so near that they could drive in in a pony<lb></lb>chaise—I asked her for a deposit—she said that she had left all her luggage at King's Cross, but she had a little reticule, which she said con<lb></lb>tained valuables, and said "Do not let your servant have charge of it"—I said "No, I will lock it up"—she said that she had brought it in her hand for safety—the prisoner then handed it to me and I locked it up and considered it a deposit—they stayed at my place five weeks and I had conversations with them every day—they only had a bedroom, but I gave them the use of my sitting-room, and they were with me from morning to night—I boarded and lodged them and had every confidence in them; she asked me to do so until she could change a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during the time they were there goods came in for them from different trades<lb></lb>people, to one of whom I had recommended them—on one occasion when some goods came from Mr. Turner, amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I lent the woman 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for them and she put the change in her pocket—they paid me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. while they were there, but 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to me when the prisoner was given into custody—they left the house that day at 11.30 a. m., and the prisoner returned alone at 10 p.m.—I asked him where Mrs. Stevens was—he said ''She is not very well, she has been worried a good deal, and will come back again in the morning"—I have never seen her since—I had received information and gave the prisoner in charge for stealing a blanket—this marriage certificate was found in her box.</p>

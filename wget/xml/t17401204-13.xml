            . On the 18th of October, about seven o'Clock at Night, the Prisoner met me on the other Side of Temple-Bar, and asked me the Way to Leicester-Fields. I had two Bundles with me, one on my Hand, and the other hanging on my Shoulder; he had several Times ask'd me to let him carry them; but I refus'd; upon which, when we were come to the Back of <placeName id="t17401204-13-crimeloc74">St. Clement's Church</placeName>

He was brought back to me, to a Colour-Shop by the Church, and I said, if it was the same Man, he had a Ring on his Finger; but I suppose he had conceal'd that. I am positive the Prisoner is the Man, for I saw the Ring on his Finger, and I look'd up in his Face several Times as we were going along together.</p>
               <p>- Proctor. I was returning from Goodman's-Fields on the 18th of October, about 5 at Night, and just by St. Clement's Church, I heard a Boy scream out; and I saw the Prisoner run a-cross the Way, and drop this Bundle. I never lost Sight of him, but pursued and took him to the Shop where the Boy was; and before I got with him to the Door, the Boy said, if he is the same Man, he has a Ring on his Finger; he knew him to be the very Person; and when we were before the Justice, the Ring was found in his Pocket under some Half-pence. The Prisoner own'd the Ring to be his, and said that he found it. There was a Lamp not 3 yards from the Place where I saw him drop the Bundle.</p>

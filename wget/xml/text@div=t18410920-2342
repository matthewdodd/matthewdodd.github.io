                  </hi>. I live at Mr. William Weller's house, in Bride-lane. About eight o'clock, on the 7th of September, I went down stairs to the closet-door in the kitchen, and could get no entrance—I heard the closet-door open after I had been there a second time—I went and met the prisoner on the stairs—I asked where he had been, he said, "To the water-closet—I asked who gave him leave to go there—he said he had been to "tailor Jones's" up stairs—I said there was no tailor Jones there—we had lost pipe before, and he was after more—he said, "Search me"—I said, "No, I will get a policeman"—I shut him up in the cellar, he could not get out—I fetched the policeman, who found this padlock on him—this pipe and ball belong to the cellar, it was gone from the place—they are the property of Mr. William Weller—the prisoner had this wig on.</p>

               <p>—I saw these things safe at seven o'clock the evening before—this pipe was in the water-closet—this piece of copper was found in the prisoner's pocket—it belongs to the ball that laid the water on to the cistern—I and another person lived near the place.</p>

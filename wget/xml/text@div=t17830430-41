               <p>I am Bailiff to the Duke of Northumberland, I reside at Sion House; on the morning of the seventh of March, I found some poultry was stolen, there was a ladder found adjoining to the garden wall, I searched some suspicious houses in the neighbourhood, I found nothing there, the next day I procured a search warrant, to search the house of

             M'Doughall, I saw Mrs. Ward his partner; he confessed they were partners upon his examination.</p>
               <p>Where is that house? - In the narrow part of Holborn, I asked for some ducks, the constables went immediately into the house, I remained in the shop till Mr. Newport and the constable called me into the yard, to look at a bird that was in the coop, with three birds; I looked, and I did not think it belonged to his Grace; we went into the cellar to search that, I found nothing of that kind in the cellar; the constable desired Mr. Newport to go up stairs for fear the woman should play some tricks; he called to me to go up stairs, and in the back room of the first floor there was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300086"></xptr> window opened; and this bird standing upon the tiles of a shed, I knew the bird, he has been under my direction these seven years, there is no artificial mark only his natural colour, I am sure of the bird; the prisoner said, she never saw the bird in her life before, and did not know how it came there.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was she when you came into the room? - She was in the room with Mr. Newport, the constable insisted upon it the bird had been in the room, there was a feather in the room, and he picked up a feather that belonged to a pea-fowl.</p>
               <p>Do these birds stray much from their own homes? - They every night go to roost, and as soon as he was set down he went to roost regularly, if he had been a stranger, they would not have permitted him to have remained among them, for we have many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. There was another fine peacock at this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You took that away, you thought that was the Duke's? - I said, it might possibly be his, I could not tell, I was desired by the magistrates at Bow-street to take it down, to see whether he would go to roost; I had not seen it for three or four days.</p>
               <p>How or by what means it went away you cannot possibly say? - No, only being told.</p>
               <p>When you came to this house who did you enquire for? - For Mr. M'Doughall.</p>
               <p>Whose house is it? - It is Mr. M'Doughall or Ward's, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did he not say he was servant or partner on board a ship? - She said, he was a servant, he said, he was partner.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of them before, whether they were partners or what situation they were in, you cannot tell? - I never saw either of them before, I did not see him first.</p>
               <p>You say, you saw the peacock standing upon a shed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not that shed belong to another house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it not a distance from that house? - As far as I am from you.</p>
               <p>And as near to the next house, I take it for granted? - I know nothing of the next house.</p>
               <p>You found the bird sitting upon a shed, and you took it away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you not often declared that you did not think that that man stole the peacock at all? - No positive declaration at all, I have declared I did not think he was guilty of the felony of stealing him, if he had, he must have some other accomplice with him.</p>

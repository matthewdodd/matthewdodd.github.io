                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live at No. 3, New-court, Carey-street; I am twenty years old. On the 11th of April, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Bartlett's-passage—two persons came running down and caught hold of me—while I was trying to get away for five minutes, by speaking to them, the prisoner took my purse out of my waistcoat pocket—they had hold of my arm—I did not exactly struggle to get away—I did not feel her put her hand in my pocket, but I saw the purse in her hand—I accused her of taking it—the denied having it—I tried to get it from her—I saw the end of it in her hand—it was a green purse—it got torn—I got part of it in my hand, but did not get the other part away—I gave her in charge of a policeman—the purse and money produced are mine.</p>

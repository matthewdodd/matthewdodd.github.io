            . On the 6th of August, in consequence of what I heard, I went after the prisoner whom I had seen in our shop; I overtook her about one hundred yards from the house; I said I suspected she had something which did not belong to her, and I took this piece of silk from her, and took her back to the shop, she gave me the silk, and wished me to let her go; I said it would not do - this is the silk, it is the property of Mr. William Venables; I can swear to it by the private mark; it is worth 6l. or 7l.</p>

            . The prisoner had not bought this silk, nor any part of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she buy of no one but you? A. No - she bought some black silk, but I cannot tell whether it was off this piece; she paid about 4s.; I don't know the exact amount; this silk was on the counter; I left the prisoner for a short time; there are fourteen or fifteen shopmen; it is called Navarino house; there were no persons near her, she was sitting at the counter - Mr. Smart was near the door; about twenty yards from the prisoner; I don't know any thing to prevent either of the Mr. Venables being here to night.</p>
               <p>COURT, to JOHN SMART. Q. What name is over the door? A. W. Venables, and Co. - Mr. Walford was a partner, but he has ceased to be so; I am acting under Mr. William Venables; he is the sole proprietor, and was so on the 6th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As William Venables and Co. is over the door, how do you know that he is the sole partner; is it not from what you have heard, you state this? A. Yes - the word Co. is over the door, it has not been erased - I saw Mr. Richard Venables to day, but he could not attend here without leaving his business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear of his being subpoened on the part of the prisoner? A. No - Mr. Richard certainly acts as master, and has the privilege of dismissing hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have any of the shopmen that privilege? A. No.</p>

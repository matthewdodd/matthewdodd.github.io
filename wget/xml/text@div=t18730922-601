                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of 36, Great Sutton Street—on 12th August the prisoner came to my shop with two silver watches, and said he wanted the plates taken off to he regilt—the name on one was "Adam Burdees, London, No. 1,027"—I took the plates off, and he took them away—he came again next day with the plates; the name had then been obliterated, but you can see part of it now—I had received the police sheet at that time, and I said to the prisoner "From information I have received I shall detain those two watches"—he said "Very well, I will go and fetch the man that I bought them of"—he left, and I saw no more of him—I can identify this plate as having had the name of Burdees on it; the other one was numbered 528, and that has been altered.</p>

I live at 72, Upper Ground Street, and am a foreman in the Lime Works—on Sunday evening, 10th August, I was in Bishopsgate Street, about 9. 15—my watch was snatched from me—it was attached to a chain—the name of "Adam Burdees "was on it, and the number was 1,027—I saw it again the next week at Guildhall—I gave information that it had been stolen—this is my watch—I can swear to it.</p>

On Wednesday, 13th August, I saw the prisoner in a public-house in Castle Court, amongst several others—Mr. Steele had given me a description, and I went down there with him—I told the prisoner he was charged with receiving a watch, well knowing it to be stolen—he said he knew nothing about it, and he had not taken the two watches to Mr. Steele's—I called Mr. Steele forward, and then the prisoner said "I did take the two watches, but they were my own, and I have had them for a long time."</p>

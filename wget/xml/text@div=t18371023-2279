                  </hi>, I am the wife of Nicholas Crowder of Great Saffron-hill. On the 5th of October the prisoner came in with some boots in her hand—I thought she was one of the shoemaker's wives come to sell them—she put her hand on some coats, and I said, "What do you want with them?"—she said, "You lie"—I said, "What have you got in your lap? you have got some boots, I saw them"—she said, "It is meat, not boots"—I looked at the door-post and missed four pairs of boots—she struck at me, and knocked me down twice in my shop—she had this piece of bacon and some mutton in her apron—I kept her till the policeman came—she</p>

               <p>struck at roe again, and very nearly knocked me down in the street, and bit my arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I bought a bit of bacon—these boots hung on a nail at the door, and she was near to me—I had the load on my arm—these boots came off the nail and she said I wanted to steal them—my friends had given me a drop of drink. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> A witness saw me take them from her lap, but that witness is not here—if it had not been for the gentleman who came in she would have murdered me—if she had given me the boots I would have let her go.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 65.) I took the prisoner—she was fighting and struggling to get away—the boots were lying just within the door of the shop, very greasy, as though they had been with some meat—she was in liquor.</p>

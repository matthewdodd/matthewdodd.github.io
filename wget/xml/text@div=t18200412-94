I saw the prisoner with it on his shoulder, on the 4th of March, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock, at the Feathers, public-house, Grosvenor-place - I knew it as soon as I saw it. He said he was employed by a man named Johnson to take it to my house, and he was to pay me for it. He said he had known him for four years, and he was to wait at the public-house half an hour. I waited more than an hour, but he never came. I have no customer of the name of Johnson. I sent for an officer, who took him into custody. I saw him looking through the gate, and took particular notice of him.</p>

                  </hi>I am a whitesmith and bell-banger, my shop is in Red Lion-court, Christchurch, Spitalfields. On Friday evening last it was broken open—it is not in my house—I left it secure at six o'clock—I went again at eight o'clock in consequence of information, and found the glass of the back window broken, the bars unfastened, the window thrown open, and a clock and a pistol taken—the clock had hung up in the shop, and the pistol bad been in a drawer—the prisoner, John Starbrook, had been for<lb></lb>merly in my service for about two years, off and on, and left in September.</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. On Saturday evening, between six and seven o'clock, in consequence of information I received, I watched the prisoners in Petticoat-lane, opposite a marine store shop—they looked about there for a few minutes—I then went up to them and spoke to Frederick—I asked what he had in his pocket—he said, "A pistol"—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, "To sell it"—I said, "Is it yours? "—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he bought it—he said, "In Petticoat-lane, at a stall"—I asked what he gave for it—he said, Two <hi rend="italic">bob</hi>"—(meaning 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—I asked if any body knew that he bought it—he said, "No"—I said, "How long ago is it? "—he said, "About two months"—I said, "Did any body know you had such a thing in your pos<lb></lb>session? "—he said no, but he had pawned it several times—I said, "Where? "—he said he did not know, but if I thought it was not his I might go and find an owner, for he knew I could not find one—I asked who that was he was with—he said he did not know, he had merely met him there—I said, "I saw you speak to him"—he said he did not, he knew nothing of him—I took them both to the station-house—Mr. Scanes had given information at the station-house of his robbery.</p>

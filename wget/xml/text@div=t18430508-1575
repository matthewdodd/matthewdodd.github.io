About six o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 18th of April, I received information, and went after the pri<lb></lb>soner—I saw him go out of his lodging—he had nothing—he went back again, about a quarter to ten, with this large empty black bag in his hand—I followed him up stairs, and knocked at the door—he said to the person that was in the room, "That is <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, I dare say; come in, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—I went in—there was the prisoner and a female; and in a chair was this drab coat—I asked him whose it was—he said his own—I asked how he got it—he said he bought it—I looked round, and saw the black bag standing by the fire, and in it found this other coat—I asked whose it was—he said his, he bought them both—he went to the station with me, and there he told the inspector that he bought them, the day before, of a groom in Russell-square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor. On the 17th of April I was at the Friend in Need public-house, in the Colonnade, in Russell-square, about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner there with a groom, a short man, he had on top boots and a dark coat—he had two coats—the prisoner and he came in together; and after some conversation, I saw the prisoner hand some money to the groom, and they went away together—the prisoner took the coats—I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

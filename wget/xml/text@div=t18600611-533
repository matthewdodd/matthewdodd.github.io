                  </hi>. On the night of 24th April, I walked into the Green Man public-house—the prisoner and the deceased were there, they were sparring together—only the prisoner was sparring—he was sparring near Dixon—Dixon stood leaning his back against the partition; he did nothing; but he said to the prisoner "You can't fight, you never could"—the prisoner asked him to fight—Dixon said, "You never could fight"—they had a little bit of a bustle in the house and then went out—the prisoner struck at Dixon, missed his blow and fell backwards—he then got up and hit him in the bowels, and they both went down together—I am sure of that—he hit him with his fist, he did not kick him—this was on the footpath—they only fought one round—I did not take any notice of how they were as to liquor—after they had had the one round, I saw Dixon walk into the Green Man again—he walked in and sat down there—I went in after him and asked him if he was hurt; he did not make me any answer—he appeared to be hurt—he put his two arms like this, over his bowels—I did not take notice whether the prisoner was the worse for liquor—he did not seem so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I was called to the deceased on 26th April—I found him lying dead on his bed—I made a post-mortem examination—in my judgment the cause of death was inflammation of the bowels, from the contents of the bowel having poured into the abdominal cavity; it was the ilium that was ruptured—it was produced by external violence, there being no ulceration of the bowels to cause a rupture—there was no morbid appearance to account for it—it might be produced by a blow, any external violence sharply applied would do it—he appeared much more healthy than I expected to have found him, having known him some years.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110037"></xptr>
               <p>below the skin—I have not the slightest doubt that the death arose from violence applied to that part.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the Tuesday this took place I was at work all day at Shepherd's Bush, and coming home I happened to go into the Green Man to have some refreshment; I stopped till half-past nine, I left work at halt-past 6. I was a little excited with speaking about this great fight between Sayers and the American; we were both excited with liquor; we got as far as to holding one another; we got to words and to blows, and I believe we got outside and hit one another; we had one round out there, but it was furthest from my intention to have words with him if he had not began; we were both partly the worse for liquor; this was on Tuesday. I worked all day on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, not knowing that any accident had taken place at all, and coming home on Saturday night at 4 o'clock I went into the same house again to get half a pint of ale, and the policeman was there, and apprehended me on the charge of killing this man. I passed and repassed the place night and morning, and I was not aware that there was anything the matter.</p>

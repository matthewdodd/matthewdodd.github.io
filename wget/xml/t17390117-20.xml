I can't say I saw Piper take it, but I saw Davis pick it up, and I took particular Notice of the Frenchman; he had a Livery Frock on, and the Watch had a String, and a flat Sort of a Chain to it.

I lent the Man a Guinea to make his Money up 45 s. that he might make her a Tender, and the Money was laid down upon the Table; then Miller's Wife ask'd me, if I thought her such a foolish B - ch, as to take the Money before Witness? So she beckon'd the Frenchman out into the Yard, and he followed her; when he came back, I ask'd him, whether he had got the Watch? he told me, no, and said, she insisted upon having the Money first; upon this he charged me with her, and while we were waiting for Justice Chandler's coming home, a Woman advised her to deliver the Watch, and take no Money. I have seen this Miller (the Husband) since this Accident; I us'd often to see him before, - he's a Sort of Gambler, and sells Rabbets about the Streets.

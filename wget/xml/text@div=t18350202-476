                  </hi>. On the 27th of January, I was going along the Co<lb></lb>burg-road, in the parish of Camberwell, at half-past six o'clock in the evening—I heard footsteps behind me, and the prisoner Wilton passed on a few yards before me—I was on the left hand side of the road, and he on the right—I saw him come across the road to meet me—he met me and seized me by the collar and throat—I was dressed as I am now—he snatched my bundle from me, which I was carrying in my hand, at the same time as he took me by the collar—I immediately turned round, and called, "Stop thief"—he ran down a turning in the Coburg-road—there was another man behind me—I saw them both running together—I had not seen that per<lb></lb>son before Wilson came up—I only heard footsteps behind me—it was done very quick—it did not occupy above a minute or two—there was a gas-lamp about a dozen yards from me—it threw the light on Wilson's face—I could not see the other man's face, nor could I describe his dress—the bundle contained a gown—it was tied up in a silk handkerchief—there were some pieces of silk in the bundle with the dress—it was one or two pieces of silk pinned up together—I have seen the handle since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson. Q</hi>. Did you not state, when I was taken, that you could not swear to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was at the station-house when he came in without a hat—I did not speak positively; but immediately he put on his hat, I re<lb></lb>cognised him—I did not say I could not swear to him.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 27th of January I was watching in the Coburg-road, in consequence of information which I had—soon after seven o'clock, I met Phillips with the prisoner Wilson a short dis<lb></lb>tance from Coburg-road—I turned down the Coburg-road, and within a few yards of the turning I met Parker with the bundle under his arm, about 150 yards from where I had met Wilson—I followed Parker—he turned down the Kent-road towards Greenwich—he still had the bundle under his arm—I was close behind him—I ran almost to keep up with him—he turned into the Lord Nelson public-house—I stood outside a few mo<lb></lb>ments, and then went into the public-house, and as I went in Parker came out—from what I heard from the landlady, I ran out and caught him a few yards from the door—I asked him if he wanted a policeman—he said, "What?" and seemed confused—I asked him a second time, and he said he did—I told him if he turned back with me I would take him to a policeman, but I took him into the Lord Nelson, and took the bundle from him—I found it was this dress—I detained him, and sent for a policeman to give him in charge—I took the bundle from him—I went next morning to the place where the prosecutrix described that the man had run up, and found there was no thoroughfare, and at the very extremity of the turning I picked up these pieces of silk, which are the same pattern as the dress—I examined the bundle when I took it from him—there was a dress in it—it appeared as if it had been opened and rolled up in a smaller compass—I gave it to the policeman at the station-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Parker. Q</hi>. You said you took the bundle from me before you went to the public-house; did not you take it up when I put it down before the landlady?—I said, "I want a policeman, I have found this"—did not you take it off from where I laid it on the bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not, I took it from under your arm, and opened it on the bar; I think I took it form him inside the public-house, just as he entered the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 27th January I was on duty in the Albany-road, at the bottom leading into the Kent-road—the prosecutrix came to me and gave me information—I went to watch, and in about twenty minutes I saw Wilson coming up from the turning where she said she had lost the bundle—he was sneaking up underneath the wall in Coburg-road, about twenty yards from where she told me she had lost her dress—he had no bundle with him—I asked him what he was doing there—he told me he was trying to get a few halfpence, and that he was a gentleman's servant out of employ—I asked him where he lived—he said in Kent-street—he did not know the number, but it was the name of Mrs. Price—I said he answered the description of a person who had robbed a lady of a dress—I took him to the station-house—I did not see the last witness, to my recollection—I was at the station-house when the prosecu<lb></lb>trix came—she recognised him after he put his hat on, but not at first—she never said she was not certain of him after he had put his hat on—I searched him, and found a duplicate on him for a shirt—I then asked him where he had been on the previous night—he said to Kensington—the duplicate was for a shirt pawned at Kensington.</p>

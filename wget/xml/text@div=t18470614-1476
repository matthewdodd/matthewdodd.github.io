                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live in Star-street, Paddington. On Saturday, the 15th of May, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in Little Carlisle-street, Portman-market—I was not quite sober—I was proceeding down the street, and the prisoner came across from the opposite side—I do not recollect his saying anything to me, but he knocked me down with his fist, and struck me on the said, and then he robbed me of my watch—it was in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and attached to a small piece of cord round my neck—the cord was cut off my neck—the part that was round my neck remained on till I got to the station, and the other part was attached to the handle of the watch—the prisoner walked away very fast—I got up and followed him, met a policeman, and gave him in charge, and he was taken to the station—the policeman, some time afterwards, produced my watch to me—I am sure it is mine—this now produced is it.</p>

               <p>live there—there was a drunken man standing on the other side of the way—the prisoner left me, and went towards him—I waited at the door, and they walked together down the street five or six doors—I turned my head the other way for a moment, and heard something fall—I looked round, and saw the man that was drunk lying in the road—it was the prosecutor—he pri<lb></lb>soner was then several yards before him, walking away—he did not walk fast—the prosecutor got up—I did not go to him—he called out, "You vagabond, you have robbed me of my watch," and went down the street after the pri<lb></lb>soner—they met a policeman, and he took the prisoner into custody—I did not see how the man fell.</p>

               <p>came up towards me, and I made towards them—the prosecutor was calling out, "You vagabond, you have robbed me of my watch"—that was pre<lb></lb>vious to my coming towards them—when I got within six yards of them I saw the prisoner throw something away, up a gateway, where there are no stones—I could not tell what it was he threw—I then met the prisoner and prosecutor, and the prosecutor said, "I give this man in charge to you for knocking me down and robbing me of my watch"—I said, "Are you certain that this is the man? be sure; it is a very serious charge"—he said, "I am quite cer<lb></lb>tain; there was no other man near me"—the prisoner opened his coat and said, "You can search me; I have got no watch about me"—that was after I had seen him throw something away—I said, "I shall search you"—I took him by the collar, and took him up the street to where I had seen him throw something away—I turned my lantern on, which I had in my belt, and there I saw this watch, and picked it up—the prosecutor was then behind me, and I said to him, "I have found a watch; I do not know whether it is your or not; you had better come and see it"—he claimed it at the station-house—I did not show it to him before—I have it here—the guard seems to have been cut off—I took this part from Britton's neck, and it corresponds with the other.</p>

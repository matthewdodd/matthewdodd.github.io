               <p>Q. When was it this happened? - On the 26th of March last we did not hear her so soon in the morning as usual, either I or my wife, and we waited some time and heard nothing of her, and after some short interval of about twenty minutes, her mistress went into her room hearing no answer to the bell, and found she was gone, and her box and a great deal of property missing. On Sunday week I went down to King's Langley, in Hertfordshire, in consequence of a letter having been seen in her box, dated from that piece. I found that she had been down there in a post chaise on the Saturday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300024"></xptr> subsequent to the robbery, and I traced her back to Watford, she there took another post chaise and came to the Green Man at Islington; but I should tell your lordship first, that I saw the boy at Watford that drove her, and he told me that there was part of the property left at the Green Man at Islington, which I have got here and can swear to some part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the Green Man when you found the property? - No, she had been gone some days; the property was brought forward by the landlord and landlady of the house, the landlord's name, I believe, is James Thomas.</p>

               <p>The prisoner took a place at our coach office for Kingston, from Kingston to London, she booked the place on the 26th of March in the evening, outside, she came up by the coach on the 27th of March, she came to the Angel, the back of St. Clement's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the bundle with her then? - I did not see the large bundle, that she did not carry, but she had a small bundle then in a small silk handkerchief; and she went back with me to Stones End to know if the bundle was come by the other coach. She went with me on the box to the Stones End, to the Horse Shoe, where she found it was come to the Cross Keys, in Gracechurch-street; but I bought a watch of her in the day time. left her at the Horse Shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy that watch? - Between the hours of one and two on the 27th.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you bought it? - At the Crooked Billet, the corner of Wych-street, I went with her from the Angel Inn to there, it was only across the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen, had you had any talk about that watch? - She had something of a twist about her finger, and I asked her about it, and she said she was at play the night before, and had broke her ring, and she pulled her housewife out of her pocket to shew me a ring, and she could not find it; but she found a mourning ring, which she said was her grandmother's; she then opened her bundle and took out a tea caddy, she then took out two watches, one was a plain gold one, and the other was a green studded case watch. I asked her if she would sell the plain gold watch? she said, I should have it if I chose; I asked her what I should give her for it? I told her I did not know the value of such a thing, but I would give her what she pleased for it; she said it was a very old watch, much battered and bruised, and it was her grandfather's; but if I had it cleaned it would go well, and I should have it for my own price. I said if she would I would give her three guineas for it; she said I should have it. and I bought it of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it was gold then? - I did not. I took it to the Angel Inn, and shewed it to one of our clerks, and he said it was not worth more than fifteen shillings, but afterwards it was shewn to a watch maker, and he said the outside case was worth two guineas; we went then to Stones End, in the Borough.</p>

Mr. Cooke made a mistake in saying I slington. She came to me the latter end of March, the day I cannot say, it was on a Saturday, and she came away the Saturday following; she said she had been in search of her brother, and her money ran short, and she wished to leave a few things that she had got, and desired to have a guinea and a half on them, and she would send for the things in a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q.

I broke the pendant the night before the robbery, in consequence I did not take it up stairs that night as I used to do, but I left it on the chimney-piece. It cost me nine guineas, I bought it as second hand; I suppose it is worth now six or seven guineas, the cloak cost about four pounds, the muslin cost three shillings and six-pence a yard, the rings are worth three pounds.</p>

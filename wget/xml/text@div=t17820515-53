On Saturday evening, the 4th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, as my wife and I were sitting by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150038"></xptr> the fire, I heard a noise. I went up stairs, and found the prisoner on the landing-place of the stairs, and the things mentioned in the indictment lying by her. She was shoving them into the bed-room. They had been taken out of the chest, and laid in a chair, as I was going to lend the chest to a friend. The great coat was dropped in the middle of the room. I called a lodger down stairs, and sent him for a constable, and gave him charge of her.</p>

            . On the 17th of June, I was in Spitalfields - the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy a bugle - I said I did not particularly want it - I asked if it was a good one - he said, "Yes," and asked 15s. for it - I bought it for 14s. - I paid 9s. as a deposit - I afterwards pawned it at Hebert's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040106"></xptr>value of this? A. About 16s - I am a musician - I have one which cost four guineas - there is no maker's name on this - I pawned it three or four hours after I bought it - I am not in the habit of buying things in the street - I was taken up, and gave every information - I know this is the same instrument; the bridge is off - you cannot play it without a bridge - I was going to have one put on - I teach the key bugle - I had to pawn one of my own instruments to buy this - I have scholars who learn of me - I was playing with two musicians when I bought this, neither of them are here - it was about eleven o'clock - I sounded it in the street - I found I could not play upon it - it was hung up in Mrs. Moffat's bar till I paid the other 5s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went down Petticoat-lane, and met a man who had a lot of cloth and this bugle-horn - he offered me the whole for 2l. - I gave him 30s. - I took it home, and made the cloth into caps, and hung the horn in my window, but could not sell it - I then saw this man playing, and asked him if he would buy it - I left the horn at Mrs. Moffat's for him - the next day she told me that the officer had been making inquiries for me - I went to the office, and saw Atfield - I asked him if he had been making inquiries for me - he asked me my name, and said, yes, he had.</p>

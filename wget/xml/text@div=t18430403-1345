                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 124.) On Sunday evening, the 19th of March, my attention was attracted to a house, No. 2, Bedfordbury, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-fields—some bricks had fallen from the cornice-work—on the following Monday I went and examined the state of the lead, it was coiled up when I first saw it, but would require cutting before it could be taken away, and the place where the lead had been was vacant—I saw the prisoner at the window—he was within reach of this lead—I went round my beat, and returned about twenty minutes past six o'clock—I then noticed that the lead was beaten out, and flattened down to its place—I came again at half-past seven o'clock—I saw a truck, and the prisoner brought a barrel out of the house, put it into the truck, and pushed the truck round to King William-street, from the front of the house, and left it there—I looked at it, and found the barrel contained some lead—it was much heavier lead than that which I had noticed before—I then saw the prisoner at the barrel—I asked him what he had there—he said "Nothing, it is my own pro<lb></lb>perty"—I was not satisfied, and took him to the station—I went back to the house, went on the roof, and found the dormer had been stripped of lead—the cornice was left as it was—there were four nail-holes in the lead.</p>

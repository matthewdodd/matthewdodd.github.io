            . I am clerk to Messrs. Reed and Knowles, silk-brokers, of Austin-friars. I was at the East India-house when three bales of silk, Nos. 4591 -4592, and 4593 were bought; they were to be sent to Messrs. Smith and McDonald's, silk manufacturers, at Manchester; silk was 20s. 6d. per lb. on the 6th of February.</p>

            . I received three bales of silk, Nos. 4591 - 4592 - and 4593, from Bacon, at the India House, and took them to Mr. Bache's warehouse, in Moor-lane, Cripplegate; one bale had a tear in it, which I helped to sew up - I could see that it contained Bengal silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw a tear in it? A. It fell off the cart, the string broke, and the bale burst. I know Bengal silk when I see it - this was on the 5th of February.</p>

            . I am employed at Thomas Bache's premises; I weighed these three bales while Newton's cart remained; 4591 weighed 1 cwt. 1qr. 17lbs.; 4592 and 4593 each weighed 1 cwt. 1qr. 181/2lbs.; this was about eleven o'clock in the morning; I saw them again about four o'clock, in the lower warehouse - Nos. 4591 and 4593 had then each been opened at the corner - I re-weighed them, and found them each 1lb. deficient.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you weigh with a patent-machine? A. Yes, and sometimes use a small weight to turn the scale. I have the book here in which I enter the weights.</p>

            . I manage Mr. Bache's business in town; he is a carrier. When these bales came in I determined, for particular reasons, to have them watched; they were put into the lower warehouse, so as to be seen from two trap-doors in the upper warehouse. The prisoners were in Mr. Bache's employ, in the lower warehouse; there was a man named Goff worked there in the course of the day, but he was backwards and forwards; the warehouse is about eight yards by five, and quite light; Mr. Bache is accountable for goods in our care. - I saw the bales re-weighed - there was no break in them.</p>

            . I remember these bales being placed in the lower warehouse, and about half-past eleven o'clock I placed my son James, to watch, in a loft in the upper warehouse, so that he could not be seen; no workmen were in the lower warehouse then. The prisoners immediately came in, and went to the lower warehouse - no other man was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see them come in? A. Yes. My son was fourteen years old last April; I have been fifteen years in Mr. Bache's service. I did not watch myself, as my business is downstairs, to receive goods, and enter them. I had nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150008"></xptr>to watch but my son, who is an acute lad - he is not in the prosecutor's service; I never had a misunderstanding with the prisoners; we had been robbed a day or two before, and I thought I would endeavour to find the thieves - I placed the bales so that the boy could see if anybody touched them; he has left school twelve months, and has been about the premises, but had no occupation there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Why not set your eldest son to watch? A. He was out; I had not arranged to set a watch till the bales came in, and then I thought I would place my son in the loft. I saw Wood go out as I stood at my office door; Hudson remained there an hour after that; my son was locked in the loft, and could not come to me till I let him out.</p>

            . I live with my father and mother, at Mr. Bache's. On the 6th of February, at a quarter-past twelve o'clock, my father placed me in the loft to watch; the trap-doors were open, and three bales of silk immediately under them; I was to see if any one touched them; I saw Wood and Hudson there in about a quarter of an hour - Wood put his fingers into one of the bales, opened it, and took some silk out, which he put into his left-hand breeches pocket; a cart came up the yard, and Hudson stamped his foot, as a signal for Wood, who pinched up the hole in the bale, as well as he could, and then left it; they then went away to the cart - they returned in five minutes, and I saw Wood go to another bale, open it, put his fingers in, and take some silk out; he put that down the flap of his apron; Hudson, who was watching at the same place as before, then went to the crane, got a woolhook, and hung it on the bale, to assist Wood - Hudson then asked Wood if he had got any silk handkerchiefs; he said No, and Hudson said he might have some made - I went to the front of the place, and beckoned to my father, but could not make him see me, and being locked in, I could not get out, or I should have gone down immediately. As soon as I saw my father I beckoned to him, and he let me out - the prisoners had left the warehouse before that. (Looking at some silk) this looks like the sort of silk - it was made up in the same way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many of your family are in Mr. Bache's employ? A. Only my father and brother, who is twenty-one years old - I am not in the service. I went to Mr. Tate's, a baker, in Holborn, on liking, for a short time, but left in two or three months, as I did not like the business; we did not quarrel; I have used a gimblet to make rabbit-hutches with, but not for any other purpose - I never bored a hole in a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not bore a hole in a cask of spirits, and treat the men with it, saying, "This is the first time, but it shall not be the last by many hundreds?" A. Never. I was in the loft when these men left the warehouse; they were out of my sight for an hour and a half - I did not call out. because I was told not; I came down from the loft before Wood left the premises; I saw Wood put his hand into one of the bales, and then go away - Hudson remained behind; he went out of the warehouse before Wood; I was coming down stairs, out of the loft, during the five minutes they were absent - I was beckoning to my father when they were taking the silk out, but he was signing a man's book, and could not see me. I do not expect to be employed in the concern.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the men left the bales the first time, did they remain in the yard? A. About five minutes - they went to take some tea out of the cart, and then came back to the silk; they staid at the bale again about five minutes, and then Wood went home to his dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you give an alarm? A. When he went out at the gate I called to my father, and said he was going out; he went to dinner - it was his dinner time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the dinner hour? A. One o'clock; I was put into the loft about half-past twelve. The first time Wood left the warehouse was to get the tea out of the cart; Hudson went with him. I did all I could to make my father see me - if he had come up to let me out they could have left the place the while - the men were going down the yard when I told him; we went in pursuit of them immediately, but could not see them; my father could not find an officer - they came back in about half an hour. I was never accused of using a gimblet for a dishonest purpose.</p>

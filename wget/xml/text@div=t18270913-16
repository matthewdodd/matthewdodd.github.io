On the 28th of August, having some company to dine with me, I missed a silver salver - he was then in my employ; I asked him where it was; he said he would go and get it - he did not know that I wanted it; this was about five minutes before dinner time - it was his duty to attend the table - he was butler; he did not leave the room; a female servant proposed to go: he said, "I will go myself;" and on looking in his face, I suspected there was something wrong, and I myself went down to the street-door, which is the only way out of the house, and sent for an officer, who came in five minutes, and I gave him into custody. I have not spoken to him since - I saw the other plate at Bow-street that night, some of which I knew. I never gave him authority to pawn or lend my property, or make away with it at all.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Young, a pawnbroker, of St. Martin's-lane. I have a silver salver, asparagus tongs, a cheese-knife, six table-spoons, and a soup-ladle, all of which were pawned with me by the prisoner - I am certain of his person; the soup-ladle and two table spoons were pawned on the 29th of March, four spoons on the 21st of August, and on the 28th of August the silver salver, asparagus-tongs, and cheese-knife. I have not the slightest doubt of him - the plate has been in my prossession ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You knew who he was, and where he lived? A. I knew him before - I have had the property before, and it has been redeemed; I did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you advance on them? A. On the salver. asparagus-tongs, and cheese-knife, I lent 13l.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130025"></xptr>MR. PRICE. I know the salver, the soup-ladle, and cheese-knife to be mine; the other things I believe to be mine, for they are similar to those I have in my possession. I live in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the whole house your's? A. I pay 200l. a year for the house, with the exception of the shop, which was let before I came there - it is the house I live in; I have a separate door and separate passage. The people of the shop cannot come into my part of the house, nor into my passage; there is no communication whatever from the shop, or the room behind it, to my house. The prisoner came to me with an excellent character; I never doubted him in any way - he has a wife, and, I believe, four children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I always maintained a good character, and was never even before a Magistrate. Unfortunately I was a long time ill, and had no idea of the danger I was running into by doing this; I was much reduced by my long illness, having a wife and family. I had some very severe surgical operations, which reduced my health, and injured the spine of my back. Under these circumstances I beg for mercy.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glover, and live in Church-street, Lambeth. On Wednesday morning, the 22nd of March, about one o'clock, I was at the Coburg Arms—I saw the prisoner there—he and I were fighting—a man named Bon<lb></lb>ner was fighting with him—when I went in at the bar, and as I was passing through the bar, I was <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> against him by Bonner—he struck me, and I struck him again—he struck me in the face several times—I went away, and had something to drink at the bar, and in ten minutes afterwards I found I was stabbed just above the ankle—I examined my trowsers next morning, and found they were cut through in four or five places—I had only one wound—when I discovered that I was wounded the prisoner was gone—I searched for him before I found myself wounded, as I found Bennett was wounded—he was taken to the hospital, and so was I.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 19th of March I was at the Islington station, Islington-green, about eight o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came and knocked at the door—it was opened, and she came in, and said she wished to give herself up, she had murdered her child—I asked her in what way—she said, "By throwing it into the liver"—she</p>

               <p>said the child was three weeks old on the Tuesday before—I went with her to the New River, at Owen's-row, and opposite No. 19, she pointed to the house, and said, "It is right opposite here where I put it in; I had been sitting down at that door for half an hour," and the child had been crying the whole time she had been sitting there, and had been crying all the afternoon—she said she had no food for herself, and no milk to give the child; that she had been that morning to Marylebone workhouse for relief, and there they searched the books, and found her mother's name, but not her's, and that was the reason they told her they could not relieve her—she said she had committed herself, and then went to Maidstone gaol for three months, and a fortnight before her time expired she was confined with this child, and the child was registered in the name of Eliza Harris—I have since been there, and got a copy of the register in that name—I made search for the body of the child, and found it, after two hours' search, be<lb></lb>tween fifty and sixty yards from the place where she pointed out as having thrown it in—the child was on the surface of the water, stopped by the iron grating that goes across the bridge, near St. John-street-road—it was dressed in the clothes which I now produce—it was a female child—I took the child and clothes to Rosoman-street station—it was examined then by Dr. Edmondson—at the time the prisoner came in she bad this small parcel in her hand, containing a small quantity of bread.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bowling-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner from three years of age—on the 18th of March, the night be<lb></lb>fore she committed this act, I was going towards Turnstile, Saffron-hill—the prisoner passed me, with a child in her arms, about a quarter after seven o'clock—she told me she had come from the Borough—I saw she had a baby in her arms, and asked her whose it was—she said it was hen—I was surprised at it—she said it was three weeks old—she took me to a shop window and showed me the baby—it was very small and very pale—she told me she had no breast for the baby, and was afraid it would not live—I asked where she was going—she said to Islington—she said she was living with a young man, a shoemaker, and he was earning 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I said that was very little—she said they were comfortable—I then asked her if she would like to see her mother—she said, provided she would not scold her—I said I would go to her mother for her if she would wait—I did so, and she waited—her mother was not at home—I came back and told her so—I then asked her if she had any message for her mother when I saw her—she said, Nothing particular, I might say I had met her, she bad got a little girl, and had now made her mother a grandmother—I said, "It is early days for you to be in the cold"—she asked me several questions concerning her mother—I then bid her good night, and we parted.</p>

On the evening of the 19th of March, I went to a house in Owen's-row, at not quite eight o'clock, but very near it—I saw a woman with a child, sitting on the step of the door—I went into the house No. 14, and re<lb></lb>mained there about ten minutes, as near as I can guess—when I came out I saw her there again—I did not see her face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the body of the child on the 19th of March, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening—the clothes were dripping wet—I saw it immediately it was brought to the station—the child was stripped—I observed that the surface of its body was unusually pale, except the skin of the head and face—its eyelids were partially open—I did not open the body—from my external observation, the cause of its death appeared to be suffocation from drowning, from immer<lb></lb>sion in water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear, before you examined it, that the body had been found on the surface of the water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, stopped by the grating—I did not make any <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I think there was sufficient appearance to enable me to say it had been drowned—as far as external observation went, I am of that opinion—the mouth was quite closed—it is not usual to find the mouth of a drowned person open—I have seen many drowned persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the body of the child on the 22nd—there were no external marks of violence—in dividing the skin, very little fat was found between the skin and muscles—the stomach was healthy, and contained about half a spoonful of fluid, resembling milk—the lungs filled the cavity of the chest, and, had a redder appearance than usual—they were filled with frothy mucus—the vessels of the brain appeared more congested than usual—the <hi rend="italic">diaphragm</hi> descended towards the abdomen—on turning over the body, a little fluid issued from the nose—in my judgment the child came to its death from suffocation, from drowning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What quantity of fluid was there from the nose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Probably a tea-spoonful, nearly as much as that—the immediate cause of death was not the congestion of the brain—there are many causes to account for its death—the deprivation of air from the lungs.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184104050108"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was there to indicate it died from drowning, and not before it was immersed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The frothy mucus, and the blood not coagulating, I infer from that the child was alive when thrown into the water—the child was very thin and emaciated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the want of food, either substantial or fluid food, account for the appearance of the brain, or the <hi rend="italic">diaphragm</hi> descending towards the ab<lb></lb>domen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it would—I did not examine the prisoner—no water issued from the stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing it to be in a dying state for want of food, would its ap<lb></lb>pearance immediately before death, or for some minutes before death, be such as to lead a person to suppose it was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might present symptoms of great exhaustion, but not that of death, I should think—drowned persons are generally found with their mouths shut—it may or may not be so—I have seen grown persons, who died from suffocation by drowning, and, no water found on the stomach, but not often—generally speaking, it is not so—the pupils of the child's eye were dilated, the eyes were shut—I believe they are generally open in drowned persons—it may or may not be so—the froth in the air vessels would not be caused by the child being without food for a long time—at the time of death it is possible for a little water to form in the lungs, and become mucus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But if the child died for want of a sufficient supply of milk, is it not possible that the milk going into the air vessels would form that ap<lb></lb>pearance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, if the child was at the breast, I do not think it posssi<lb></lb>ble for the milk to get into the air vessels—milk would produce a different appearance to what was found—it was frothy mucus—it was very differ<lb></lb>ent to milk—I do not mean to represent that milk could not find its way into the air cells, but it is a very improbable thing—during the straggle for life, it is possible the water might find its way into the air cells from the mouth, but it would not find its way from the mouth without that struggle, because the lungs are protected by the <hi rend="italic">glottis</hi>—supposing the child to be actually starving, it is very unlikely it should find its way then—if any thing gets down the windpipe, it produces suffocation, or at least great distress.</p>

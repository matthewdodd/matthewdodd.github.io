                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. James Cover. On the 30th of Dec. the prisoner came into the shop, took this piece of mutton from the board, and put it under her shawl—she then looked at two or three pieces of meat, but purchased nothing—she walked out, and when she had got about four steps from the door, on the pavement, I took her, and found the mutton on her.</p>

               <p>and they were not very good; I took this bit of mutton, and was going to the door to ask her if she would buy half of that; the man said, "Put that down," and I did; I had no intention of doing any thing wrong. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She had the mutton concealed under her shawl; she had some halfpence; I did not see any silver—she was not drunk—she got four or five steps from the door, opposite the next house.</p>

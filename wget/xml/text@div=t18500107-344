                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, of Hatfield-street, St. Luke's. On 29th Dec. I was in the Maidenhead public-house, in Goswell-street, about a quarter-past eight o'clock—I had something to drink with one of my mates—I remained there nearly two hours—I saw both the prisoners there; they were not acquaintances of mine—I knew them by sight, particularly Smith—I left the house as near half-past ten as possible—the prisoners left at the same time—I was a little the worse for liquor, but I knew what I was about—the prisoners laid hold of my arm, to see me home, as they said—when we got to Hatfield-street, which leads into Golden-lane, I was knocked down by Smith; Reed laid hold of my mouth, so that I could not halloo—Smith pulled a knife out of his pocket, and with it cut my watch-pocket, where I had two half-sovereigns, which were safe before I came out of the house—I lost them—I had two half-crowns in my breeches'-pocket, and they were gone too—they were safe about a minute before I came out of the house—Smith took the scarf off my neck—they then ran away different ways.</p>

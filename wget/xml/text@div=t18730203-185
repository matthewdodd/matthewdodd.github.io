                  </hi>. I live at 11, Sugar Loaf Court, Minories, and am a van guard on the Midland Railway—on Saturday, 18th January, about 4.30 o'clock, I was in New Street, Bishopsgate, loading wool—I was on the van—I dropped my wool-hook in turning the bales over, and got down to get it—I saw some men teasing Pom before I got down—he came past me with his hat in his hand, going away from these men—his hat caught up against me, and fell out of his hand—he turned round and closed with me—a man tried to part us—the prisoner let me go in about two minutes, and as I went away he put his hand in his pocket—I did not see that he took anything out—he made a rush at me, and struck me in the temple and in the neck with some sharp instrument—I put my hand to my head, and found my cap was off—I did not feel any effect then, but there was blood—I turned round and asked for my cap, and as I did so he rushed at me again, and struck me on the nose and cheek with some sharp instru-ment—blood flowed, but I did not feel anything for a minute or two—the</p>

I am house-surgeon at the Metropolitan Free Hospital—on 18th instant Smith was brought to me, and I examined him—he had a cut across the bridge of the nose and on the right cheek, evi-dently done by the same blow glancing from the nose to the cheek—it had been caused by such an instrument as this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

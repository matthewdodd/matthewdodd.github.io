(<hi rend="italic">In each of these accounts, there was a charge of "Boat and two men through canal</hi>, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.")—I paid him the total sums on these papers—these accounts were delivered at the same time as the wages' accounts, and the amounts paid to the prisoner on each, on the faith of these documents being genuine and containing a true, account—I had not given him in<lb></lb>structions to discharge any one after the second and third voyages of the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi>—I saw him every Monday from 6th June up to 18th October; but until 18th October, I was not aware that the number had been reduced from eight to seven—I met Cutting subsequently to 18th October—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the defendant and told him I thought he was acting unfairly and unjustly towards Cutting, after his having passed and obtained Her Majesty's certificate—he said that the man had not carried on the duties of the ship to his satisfaction—I afterwards saw Cutting again, and communicated to him what the defendant said; and I subsequently, about 6th December, had Cutting face to face with the defendant; and, reading from this document, I said, "It appears for three weeks after 12th April, up to the time of Cutting leaving, you have been working the vessel with seven hands instead of eight, and it is a very awkward thing"—he said, "I was not aware of it"—Cutting left, and I then pointed out to the defendant the very serious nature of affairs; and said that, unless he could prove that his documents were true, he would stand in a very awkward position—he said after a little while that he was not aware of it, and that he could make it good; he could return it—I said that that was not the point at all, and that he would be in a very awkward position, and I could not treat with him upon that—this occurred on Tuesday, and he left Mr. Robinson's service on the following Monday—I did not dismiss him, for which I was reprimanded—the money I handed to him on 23d May was Mr. Robinson's—he carries on business in Mark-lane, and I am manager under him—they were not my moneys—I gave him a cheque signed, by myself by procuration for Mr. Robinson—at the time of his dismissal, my attention had not been called to the charge of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going through the canal to Rotterdam, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going back from Rotterdam—the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi> continued her voyages after</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Marine-street, Bermondsey—I was on board the Magnet with the defendant, as chief officer—he was master—on 12th April, 1864, I was transferred to the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi>—she sailed for Rotterdam every Wednesday, and returned every Sunday—on the first voyage I went, I had eight hands under my control—these are their names (On a list), and there was a boy named Peter Conolly—I paid the hands—I got the money from the master—I paid the eight hands and the boy On the first voyage—I had nothing to do with the engine-room, or with the steward and cook—after the third voyage, the defendant told me that Mr. Robinson would not allow more than seven hands, and I was to discharge one, and mentioned Turner in particular, who he said was neglectful at the wheel—I told him Turner had been quartermaster so long, and proposed discharging the last man who entered the ship, Charles May, which I did—he had been under me previously, as well as a man named Todd, who was working with May for a week before his discharge—Todd afterwards left the service—that was in the fourth week—May had been only one week in the ship when he had to leave—Todd left the next week, and then May was</p>

               <p>taken back again—May was in the ship a week and out of the ship a week, and then he returned—only seven hands and a boy were then used to navigate the ship, and I paid them the amounts against their names, amounting to 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that included the second mate and carpenter—it was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when I first joined the ship—I got the money to pay the wages from the captain—I had nothing to do with these lists—I did not see them alter I had left—the captain did not hire a boat to go up the canal to Rotterdam during those three weeks, 23d May, 30th May, and 6th June, nor any boat or men to come down the canal—a boat was used at the entrance of the canal at Helvoetsluys to run the ropes away, going in and out—I know nothing about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. being paid for it—another boat was used at the New sluice going out—no boats were hired but those two—no other boot was used through the canal except the ship's boat, manned by her own people—I had nothing to do with making up these disbursement accounts, and never saw them—on 18th October, I left the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi> as the prisoner came to me and told me that it was Mr. Robinson's request that I should stop at home to obtain a master's certificate, as they could not allow any mates to be without one—I stayed for that purpose, and passed ray examination; I have my certificate in my pocket—I then went back to see the captain, and told him I had got my certificate, and that Mr. Robinson had told me to see him as he had said nothing about it—I then walked away and applied for another berth, but was refused, as I could not give an account why I had left my last ship—I afterwards saw Mr. Roberts—he had this paper (produced) in his hand—it is ray writing—he told me to Walk Outside the office and I do not know what he said to the defendant—I do not know how many people were in the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi> after I passed my examination—I occasionally went on board—the mate took charge of the ship in my place—there were seven hands when I left—I know nothing about these accounts—I said nothing to Mr. Roberts about them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the eight men under your control? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I discharged May on Monday afternoon—we went away on Wednesday, and when I returned on Sunday, Todd bad a little more tobacco than he was allowed, and I discharged him for it; May came on board looking for a berth, and I took him on again—the captain was not consulted at all; it was always left to me—I give a discharge to the men—printed forms are signed by the captain in blank, and I fill them up on discharging seamen—I filled one up for May, who is now in one of Mr. Robinson's steamers; the Lyons, trading between London and Harlingen; he remained till the end of Sep<lb></lb>tember—he was out of berth a week, and then he went up the Baltic; he came back and went into the Lyons—I gave Todd a discharge; it does not specify the character; he came to the captain afterwards and got a written character—he has been working for me lately in my new ship—I left the Magnet because her station was altered and bet captain and deck hands transferred—I had shipped from the <hi rend="italic">Lyons to the Magnet</hi> on 7th August previously—when I lived in Marine-street, and was not at sea, I used to drive about a little now and then for pleasure, in a light working cart—the man who the cart belonged to drove—I never drove a pair of greys—I drove twice to Bexley, and twice to Bromley, and the last time I went down the Croydon-road with my wife and friends—I believe I gave up driving out before I was discharged; I began it in the spring—I did not drive every Sunday, because every other Sunday we were late, according to the tide—the cart holds six; we paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, drove to a public-house to tea, and divided the expenses—my wages are 21 a week—in going through the canal</p>

               <p>the boat is not kept at the stern; it is kept to heave the ship off by—our own people go into our own boat and make the ropes fast to the posts—there are men at the ends of the canal to fasten the ropes to the posts; I do not know whether anything is paid them for that, as the same men attend to the ship after she is through the locks—the boat is used to pull the vessel away from whichever side she touches—I am mostly on the forecastle deck, but not altogether—the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi> is 560 tons—other boats are hired at the entrance and the exit of the canal, going out and coming in—men always go ashore and attend the ship until she is locked through—I do not know what the charges are—the canal is about seven miles long, and there is a lock at each end—one lock is close to Helvoetsluys, and the other is called the New Sluice—I told Mr. Roberts that Todd was discharged when I was at the office.</p>

                  </hi> I have been the boatswain of the <hi rend="italic">Zephyr</hi> since 12th April, and am still employed there—from 1st December to October last the prisoner was master of the vessel and Cutting the chief mate—there were eight hands employed on board on 12th April, and they were continued for three weeks, when one was discharged and no other taken in his place—the crew continued to consist of seven only till the week after Mr. Cutting left—we went one week to Rotterdam without him, and the following week we had another hand—during the passage through the canal at Rotterdam our own boat is employed to run the ropes out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the crew frequently changed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not fre<lb></lb>quently, we had fresh faces perhaps once in a month or two—the seven seamen would be all over the ship during the voyage, wherever they were required—the helmsman is one of the seamen—five men are employed in different parts of the vessel, and two quartermasters to look after the cargo in harbour—the canal men fastened the ropes to the posts to keep the ship straight in the lock—we seldom had any ropes out in the canal unless a ship was passing, and then we used our own boat—she gets aground occasionally and then we throw out the ropes and use our own boat—the ropes are made fast to the posts by our men—we employ a boat to pull us into the first gate of the lock, and when we are in the lock and the gate is shut we occa<lb></lb>sionally use the canal men to make the ropes fast—the lock is one ship's length and seven or eight feet more—when we are through we have to go through the canal and do the same thing at the other end—going through the two locks will sometimes take an hour and sometimes two—Mr. Savage is the new mate.</p>

               <p>and a boy—at the beginning of May, about the third voyage after I joined, one hand, Charles May was discharged—I saw Todd on board after that—he afterwards left and May came back—after that there were never more than seven hands, up to the time Mr. Cutting went up for his examination—during the time the ship went through the canal, her own boat was employed and two hands from the ship—I know of no strange boat being employed between the locks—a boat was employed, I believe, to carry the rope ashore at Helvoetsluys and New Sluice—I was always present when the captain gave Cutting money to pay the men—he gave him 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd for the first three weeks, while the full complement was there, and afterwards 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say a word about the captain till you had been discharged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said it then—I did not go before the Police-court—I have not given evidence before this—some lad came and said that I was to be at Mr. Robinson's office at 9 o'clock next morning as they wanted to see me, and in the evening Mr. Cutting came round and also asked me to go next morning—he knew where to find me, because I had left my address on board the ship and at the office.</p>

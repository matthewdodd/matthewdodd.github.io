                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at No. 29, Edward-terrace, Cale<lb></lb>donian-road. On the 7th of July, after nine o'clock at night, I was returning from Frederick-street, Gray's-inn-road, into Frederick-place, and saw the prisoner at the corner of Frederick-place with another man—when I got up to them they begged of me, they desired me to give them money—they both spoke—I made them no reply—they renewed their request for money—I said, if they persisted, I should be under the necessity of giving them both in charge—they then allowed me to go a few paces in advance of them, when I heard footsteps, and heard them muttering something—the only word I could distinguish was "now," and before I could turn round the prisoner made a grasp either at my watch or chain—his hand caught me just under my waistcoat pocket—I had a watch and gold chain in that pocket—I seized him—a struggle ensued—he overpowered me, and got away—he had not proceeded far before I caught him again—I called, "Stop thief!"—he said nothing the first time he was taken—the second time I caught hold of him he begged of me to let him go, saying he was only begging, and he got away again—the third time I caught him by the corner of a street—a crowd collected, who seemed disposed to yield to his statement—he got away again—I pursued—he ran round Regent-square—he never was above four yards in advance of me, but I was afraid of him, seeing him put his hands into his pocket, and apparently arranging some<lb></lb>thing behind him—at the corner of Regent-square a man secured him, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did his hand come against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had my chain banging as it is now—he came from behind, and grasped at me violently, with intent to take my chain—I immediately seized him, and the struggle ensued—his hand touched my person, apparently grasping at my watch or chain—I feel certain it was his intention to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was I not meeting you when the other man was begging; did not you ask me if I saw a policeman, and I said no; the other man ran away, and you took hold of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I was looking for a policeman, to give you in charge—I had seen you both together—you both addressed me—you made the grasp—directly I called, "Police!" your com<lb></lb>panion, who I saw remaining at the corner, ran up a street.</p>

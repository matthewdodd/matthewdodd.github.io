                  </hi>. I live at Canonbury-place, Islington. On Wednesday, 22d December, about half-past 3 o'clock, I was coming out of the London and Westminster bank; when I bad got as far as the corner of Bartholomew-lane, Mr. Higginson accosted me—I did not then know him—he asked me if I was Mr. Salomons, I told him "No"—I presumed he meant the Al<lb></lb>derman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030034"></xptr>
               <p>and I told him the Alderman was then in the London and West-minster bank, as I had just previously ascertained—I returned to the bank about half an-hour afterwards, and met Alderman Salomons coming out of the bank; I joined him, and we proceeded up Bartholomew-lane, towards the South Eastern Rail way, intending to go to the station—Mr. Higginson then accosted the Alderman, I should say within ten yards of the place where I had previously seen him—he spoke to the Alderman in a somewhat excited tone, with a gradually raised tone—thinking he might have business with the Alderman, I advanced a few paces, to leave them to transact their business—I did not hear what his first words were, but I soon heard what he was saying—I did not hear the first words that passed between them on either side—the first words I overheard Mr. Higginson say, in a somewhat raised tone, which was the cause of my overhearing them, were "What do you mean by delusions?"—I did not hear the answer clearly, as the Alderman spoke lower I presume—I naturally turned round, and saw Mr. Higginson in the act of striking the Alderman with a stick over the shoulder—it was an or<lb></lb>dinary walking stick; he was very near the Alderman, and he struck in this manner (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>); if I recollect right, he struck with both hands, but I am not certain; I then seized Mr. Higginson round the waist—a crowd presently collected—he did not say a word after I seized him, until we got to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you brother-in-law to Mr. Salomons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—when you first spoke to me on that afternoon, you spoke courteously and calmly—when I afterwards returned to the London and Westminster bank, I did not inform the Alderman that anyone had inquired for him; it made no impression on me—I did not know who it was that had spoken to me—I had no conversation whatever with the Alderman on the subject—it had not been arranged that I should go with the Alderman to the railway—I was frequently in the habit of going with him—I did not go with him in consequence of having seen you—I was not in the habit of going with him every day; it might be twice a-week—I could not have informed the Alderman who you were, for I did not know; I had scareely heard of you, more than what I had seen in the papers—we did not arrange any plan what to do if you spoke to me; on my oath no such arrangement was made; we did not arrange not to speak, or not to listen if we were spoken to; there was no arrangement whatever—I did not see the Alderman push you aside, or hear him say that it was untrue that he had said you were mad, and he was in a hurry to get to the railway—I heard no more than I have already stated—the Alderman and I left the bank together—I don't think we were arm-in-arm, I would not undertake to swear it, but I believe not—I should say I was not more than four or five yards from the Alderman when you accosted him—I think it is quite possible for the Alderman to have pushed you aside, and have said that, it was untrue that he had said you were mad, without my hearing it; I am not so quick of hearing, perhaps, as some per-sons, and I was not listening to your conversation—I was a little in advance; I don't know on which side the Alderman I might have been, I think it was a little to the left—I cannot say what he did with his right hand, as my back was towards him—I did not see the Alderman knock your hat off—I did not see your hat off, I did not notice it—I will not swear it was not off—the Alderman did not drop his railway wrapper that I am aware of—I will not swear he did not—I seized you round the waist, and I believe I held you pretty tight—I believe I seized you by the arms—I should say I did not put both hands to your throat and squeeze you against the wall; I think not—to the best of my impression I did not seize you by the throat, but I think I should have been perfectly justified if I had; I will not swear</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030035"></xptr>
               <p>I did not—I assailed you very strenuously, that was after you had struck the Alderman with the stick—I saw no more than the blow which you made at him with the stick—my impression now is, since you have spoken of it, that your hat was off at the time you struck the blow, but I will not undertake to swear one way or the other—I heard the Alderman state at Guildhall that I pinioned you against the wall—whether in holding your body I leant against the wall or not I cannot exactly state, I might natu<lb></lb>rally avail myself of the wall—I cannot undertake to swear that you said you did not wish to hurt the Alderman—I will not swear you did not say those words, I don't recollect hearing them—I released my hold of you because the Alderman was separated from you—I was not afraid of you personally—I did not hear you say that the Alderman might have been content to swindle the Atlantic Telegraph Company without imputing mad<lb></lb>ness to you—I will not swear those words were not spoken—I don't think they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did I not say that the telegraph cable had been broken from the first, according to their own reports, and, therefore, no message could ever have been passed through it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear one word about the telegraph—I did not hear it mentioned, I swear that—after the assault a crowd collected—if such words were said loudly, I should say it would be impossible but that they could have been overheard by some one—I could not swear they were not said—I have had no conversation with any one as to what I should say here, I swear that—I should say I have not had one word with the Alderman about it—to the best of my knowledge your name has hardly been mentioned between us; on my oath, this inquiry has been very casually alluded to, nothing more than as to the sanity or wisdom of the aggressor—there was no agreement between us to impute insanity to you, nor any discussion as to the propriety of doing so—I do not believe you violently insane—I have not been examined by the attorney conducting this case, as to the nature of my evidence; on the day after your examination, the solicitor took a note of the evidence that I had to give—I have had no conversation with any one respecting the evidence I had to give—I had not said one word to the Alderman respecting my evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had any conversation with any member of the Atlantic Telegraph Company on the subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know any of the members of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, nor any of the shareholders, as share-holders—of course I know the Alderman, I don't know him in his capacity of a shareholder—I have not had any communication or conversation with any shareholder in the Bank of England on this subject, I swear that—the Alderman did not say after the policeman arrived, that he had a great mind not to give you into custody—it was not at my request that he gave you in charge, I believe it was his own act—some few minutes elapsed before the policeman came—I am almost certain that no such occurrence took place—I swear to the best of my belief that it did not—I accompanied you to the police-station in Bow-church-lane—I heard the Alderman state the charge—I will not swear whether I did or did not hear you say that he was not telling the truth, I do not recollect it—I did not hear him reply that he was not then on his oath—I should think he could not have said so without my hearing him, but I did not pay particular attention to the words—I will not swear he did not say so—I don't remember hearing you request him to remember that he was "on the gentleman"—I do not recollect any such expression, and I think I should have recollected if you had said it—I heard the Alderman state that he did not wish you to be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030036"></xptr>
               <p>detained—I did not hear him order the inspector to take your recognizance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and discharge you if you gave your address—I was not out of the police-station from the period that I went in, until I departed with the Alderman, I might have been at the door, I believe I was at the door, to request a policeman to get a cab—I heard the Alderman tell the inspector that he did not wish you to be detained, that he should be satisfied with your address and an undertaking to appear—I do not recollect any sum being named—there was a man in uniform, I presume he was the inspector—the Alderman requested him to be as expeditious as possible in the business; he was in a great hurry in order not to miss his train.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could any other person than a magistrate in the execution of his office have given such an order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The officers would naturally have some deference toward those immediately above them, and would perhaps give them a little more facility than to others—I cannot say whether that might be so or not—as to whether a common accuser could have given any such order, I know no more than any other individual, I know nothing at all on the subject—it did not strike me as monstrous or singular, that any roan should act as accuser and judge at the same time; I did not perceive that there was any judgment in the question, nothing of the kind; I was not dazzled with the magnificence of nay relative's position—I saw no gross violation of justice in the matter—I made no statement at the station—I don't think the Alderman discharged you on your recognizance, my impression is, that he did not act as a magistrate at all in the matter, but merely as any individual giving you in charge might do—I think anyone else but a magistrate might have acted in the same manner—I never witnessed such an occurrence before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you heard a magistrate or cadi so conducting himself in Russia, France, or Constantinople; would you not have known it to be a gross oppression, and glory in your privilege as an Englishman, to be exempt from it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot answer that question—I have never discussed the result of this case with any person whatever—I swear that—I did not consider as to whether the Alderman was over-matched by you, when I seized you—I considered his position was not consistent with a street row, or scuffle—I think I was perfectly authorized under the circumstances, in seizing you—the Alderman was entirely passive as far as I saw—you did not struggle with me, you were remarkably quiet—I did not assail you until I saw you in the act of striking the Alderman—It appeared to me to be a violent and ruffianly assault—the Alderman was not hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it that he was not hurt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared to me that Mr. Higginson was too close to him, and that only that part of the stick nearest the handle must have descended on the shoulder.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Upton, near Stratford—I was in Bartholomew-lane, on 22d December—I observed two gentlemen approaching me—I did not know either of them at that time, but they proved to be Alderman Salomons, and Lieutenant Higginson—I did not hear anything said by either of them—I was about three or four yards from them—I noticed Lieutenant Higginson make a kind of snatch with his open hand, at the face of Alderman Salomons—The Alderman threw his head back, and then the defendant raised a stick which he bad in his hand—I think it was in his left hand—It appeared to be an ordinary walking stick—he brought it down as it appeared to me, on the Alderman's shoulder—I then noticed Mr. Cohen; he rushed forward, seized the lieutenant by the two shoulders, and pinioned him against the wall, and at that moment his hat fell off—I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030037"></xptr>
               <p>not noticed the Alderman give any provocation—I then advanced, but did not touch him myself—I heard him say that he was Lieutenant Higginson, and that his object was to bring his case before the public; that he intentionally assaulted the Alderman and pulled his nose—he then said to the Alderman "You have treated me very ill, you know you have—I have assaulted you purposely—I wish to be taken into custody"—some few minutes after, a policeman came up and he was given into custody—I went to the station, and I heard him make a similar statement there; that he had intentionally assaulted the Alderman—the Alderman expressed him-self extremely desirous of getting home; he had, as he said, a dinner party, and his words were, "I do not wish the defendant to be inconvenienced and therefore I hope" or "wish he may be discharged on his own recognisance"—I don't recollect the defendant making any observation to that—I have no doubt that he was discharged on his own recognisance, bat I left before the form was completed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where did you first see the Alderman and I on the day in question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very nearly opposite the Auction mart—I was coming from the Exchange towards the London and Westminster bank, and I saw the Alderman and you approaching me—I did not witness your first meeting—my impression was, that you made the snatch at his face with your right band, but I should not like to say positively—I was in front of you on the pavement, three or four yards off—your hand was open decidedly—I then saw you raise the stick—your hat was on at that time—I am quite sure of that—I did not see the Alderman push you before that, nor do I believe he did—I think I should have seen if he had done so—I cannot say whether he had done so before I saw him—I saw no one but you and the Alderman when I first observed you—I did not see Mr. Cohen at the moment—if he had been alongside of you I must have seen him—I did not see him—I volunteered my evidence to the Alderman—I said that I had witnessed the assault—you did not see me walk down from the bank and join the crowd afterwards—there was no assemblage at the moment I saw you commit the assault, but immediately afterwards, when Mr. Cohen laid hold of you and pinioned you against the wall, then a crowd collected—I can't tell where Mr. Cohen came from—the first time I saw him was when he seized you by the shoulders—I think he held you by both your shoulders—I don't think he held you round the waist—your hat came off from Mr. Cohen's laying hold of you, that is my impression—he pressed you suddenly, I may say violently, against the wall of the Bank of England, and the jerk knocked your hat off—Mr. Cohen's hands were not on both sides of your neck, not that I saw—I should say that your stock was not torn—I did not observe it—I will not swear it was not—your dress was not at ail disarranged—I will not swear it was not, but I did not see that it was—I did not know Alderman Salomons when I met him—I called him Alderman Salomons after I heard who he was—I knew who he was when I tendered my evidence—I did not consider this a good opportunity of making his acquaintance—I swear that—will you allow me to explain the reason I volunteered my evidence; I happened to know Mr. Roy, the Alderman's solicitor, extremely well, and I was on my way there at the time I saw this assault, and as I saw Mr. Roy afterwards I told him what I had seen—I have had conversation since as to what took place on this occasion—I will tell you the nature of it if you think proper, but it will not be very complimentary to you—I expressed an opinion without a doubt that you were under delusions, and I am sorry to say I think so now—I have said that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030038"></xptr>
               <p>believed you were suffering under some delusion or other, and I was sorry to see so gentlemanlike a man as you labouring under delusion—I have never seen you before—I have read the accounts in the papers of your appearance before the Alderman—I cannot believe that a gentleman holding such a position as you do, would be guilty of such an assault on an unoffend<lb></lb>ing gentleman, unless you were partially insane—your conduct at the Guildhall was very eccentric, and different from other persons—I think my grounds of belief quite sufficient, that you are labouring under a delusion; you are labouring under an imaginary grievance, therefore I think you are not sane—I have no other grounds for saying so than what I saw in the papers, and what took place on this occasion; but I think they are sufficient—I am a literary man, and connected with the press—I am connected with the <hi rend="italic">Field Newspaper</hi>—I am not in any position in which the Alderman could be of the slightest benefit to me—I heard you say that you wished your case, as connected with the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Telegraph Cable,</hi> to be brought again before the public—you said that Alderman Salomons had treated you very ill—I understood you to mean in connexion with the Atlantic telegraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I make use of these words, on your oath, that the Alderman might have been content to swindle the Atlantic Telegraph Company, without imputing to me madness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You never uttered any such words in my hearing—I did not hear you say that the Alderman ought to be ashamed of himself, or words to that effect—I heard you say to Mr. Cohen that you had no wish to hurt the Alderman—I accompanied you to the police-station—the Alderman said he did not wish to detain you; that he was in a hurry to get home; that it was not his wish to inconvenience you, he hoped that you would be discharged on your own recognisance—no sum was mentioned in my hearing—I swear that he did not, in my hearing, tell the inspector to take your recognisance in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think if he had said so I must have heard it—I was not out of the office—I cannot swear he did not say it—I did not hear the Alderman say to Mr. Cohen that he had a great mind not to give you into custody—I never saw anybody act with greater forbearance in my life, than the Alderman did towards you—I did not see him acting at all as a judge—he directed the inspector to take the charge as soon as he could—he then said he did not wish to detain you; that he wished your recognisance to be taken, and that you should be discharged upon that being taken—I left before the form was completed, and don't know what the sum mentioned was—the inspector was not in the office when we first went in; he was sent for—I remember Mr. Cohen going out for a cab—I should not consider it a grievous oppression if I had been so treated—I should think it extremely kind to be discharged on my own recognisance—according to my impression the Alderman was not acting as a magistrate at all—if instead of ordering you to be discharged, he had ordered you into a cell, that would not have been so kind—I think if I had been the accuser instead of the Alderman, the inspector would have listened to the same suggestion from me—I attended at the Mansion-house next day—I sat on the bench beside Alderman Salomons—the Alderman sat on the bench beside Sir Robert Carden—the Alderman was sworn according to the Jewish form, he gave his evidence from the bench—I don't think he spoke several times confidentially to Sir Robert Carden during the examination—I say decidedly not, because I heard everything that he said—he said he placed himself in the hands of Sir Robert Carden for the case to be dealt with in the ordinary way—he did speak to Sir Robert Carden, but not con<lb></lb>fidentially</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030039"></xptr>
               <p>—I swear that—he did not say anything to him that I did not bear—I was too close not to hear everything that was said—I really don't know whether it is customary to have an accuser and a witness sitting on the bench with the judge; I have seldom attended a court—I think it is decent—if my lords had the witnesses for the prosecution sitting beside them I don't think it would be a gross violation of public decency, if they wished them to be there—you asked to be allowed to cross-examine the alderman—Sir Robert Carden said that as you wished the case to be sent to the Sessions he would not permit any cross-examination—you were not allowed to cross-examine, because you were out of order—Sir Robert Carden said that as you did not wish him to adjudicate upon the ease he should send it to the Sessions in accordance with your wish—there appeared no reason to me why you did not wish Sir Robert Carden to adjudicate; it was certainly not because he would not allow you to cross-examine the alderman; I should say that was not your objection—you did not express the objection on that ground openly before the whole court—you did not say that as you were not allowed to cross-examine the alderman you objected to the jurisdiction of the court—I swear that—you said you did not think you should have justice done you in that court; you gave no reason why—you did not state that it was because you were not allowed to cross-examine the alderman, because you would have been allowed to cross-examine had you allowed Sir Robert Carden to go into the case—you asked Sir Robert Carden if he was a shareholder in the Atlantic Telegraph Company, and he said he was not, and never should be, and never had been—he did not at first order you to enter into your own recognizance in 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to appear and take your trial—I swear that—he ordered you to enter into your own recog<lb></lb>nizance in 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to find a surety for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Alderman Salomons did not interfere and propose that you should find the additional bondsman in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that—I do not think anything was said about your keeping the peace; I will not swear it—I did not hear Alderman Salomons object to the case being sent to the Sessions as too trivial a case, and one that ought to be decided by the magistrate there—he did not say so openly in court; I swear that—I did not hear him say so, and I do not believe he did; he might have said it without my hearing it, I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever heard of magistrates thus acting as accuser, advocate, and judge in their own case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not perceive that they acted in any such form; they did nothing of the sort that I witnessed—if a stipendiary magistrate had acted in the same way I think he would have acted very properly; I think a stipendiary magistrate would have done the same—I do not think there was any oppression in the case whatever.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">Esq., Alderman.</hi> On 22d December, I was walking in Bartholomew-lane—as I crossed from the London and Westminster Bank to the apex of the Bank in Bartholomew-lane, some one joined me, and it turned out to be the defendant—I did not at first perceive who it was—he addressed me, and asked whether I was Alderman Salomons—I said I was, and looking straight at him, I said, "Are you Lieut. Higginson," or "You are Lieut. Hig<lb></lb>ginson?" interrogatively—he said, "Don't you know me?" I then said, "Indeed, I hardly recollected you," or some words to that effect—he then said, "You have said, "or" You say that I am a madman;" to which I answered, "No, I don't think I have; but I have said you are under delusions"—he then quickly said, "What do you mean by 'under delusions'"—to which I replied, "You must put your own construction upon it, "or some words to that effect—the words were hardly out of my mouth, when he rushed from</p>

               <p>my side, and got in front of me, and I felt his hand in my face, just touching my nose—I convulsively raised my arm to ward off the attack, when he stepped back, and raised a stick violently, which just came on my shoulder, because, in the meantime, my brother-in-law who was close to me, rushed upon him and pinioned him—to the best of my recollection, I never did anything in the way of resenting a blow, or uttered a single word to him, except order an officer to be sent for—a crowd collected, and a gentle<lb></lb>man named Milk, who I did not then know, came up to me, and told me who he was, and said he had witnessed the assault—after an interval of a minute or two, to allow an officer to come up, I gave the individual in charge, followed with the officer to the police-station, and gave Lieut. Hig<lb></lb>ginson in charge, precisely in the same way as any other individual may have done—I think it right to state that my wife was expecting me home by the express train, and it was a most painful thing to me, fearing she might be alarmed if I was detained; my brother-in-law went to get a cab, and luckily, I did save the train.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When I first addressed you; did I do so quietly and calmly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so—my brother-in-law, Mr. Cohen, was with me at the time—I did not stand at the corner of the Bank some little time—I did not tell you that I was in a great hurry to go to the rail—I have mentioned what occur<lb></lb>red when you addressed me—it all took place between the corner of Bar<lb></lb>tholomew-lane and the Bank-gate, which is probably not twenty yards—when we first met, you said to me, "Are you Alderman Salomons?" to which I answered, "Yes"—I then looked at you stedfastly, for I had never seen you, except the day at the police-court, and said, "Are you Lieut. Hig<lb></lb>ginson?" or "You are Lieut. Higginson"—you said, "Don't you know me?" or "Sure you know me"—I said, "No, I do not recollect you"—you then asked me whether I had said you were a madman, or were mad; to which, of course, I said, in the most polite language I could, "No, I have not; but I have said you are under delusions"—you then asked me what I meant by "delusions," to which I said, "You must put your own interpretation upon it"—that was what took place; then you assaulted me—when you accosted me, I did not tell you that I was in a hurry, and could not stop—I never said one word of the kind—you joined me by the corner of the Bank of England, to the best of my recollection, and before we had got to the Bank-gate, which is not twenty yards, you assaulted me—there was not much time for conversation—we walked just as would allow the conversation which I now state, to occur—I do not think I said, when you first met me, that I could not stop, for I was in a hurry to get home to Mrs. Salomons; I may have said so, but if I am bound to swear, I say I did not—I will swear I did not say so—I have not said that you made use of any violent expression—remember one thing, that I am not only on my oath as a man, but as a Magistrate—I know what is due from a Magistrate, and I am very scrupulous what I swear to—you did not make use of any violent expression—I was on the side nearest the Bank of England, the right-hand side—Mr. Cohen was on the outside—I should say I was in the middle, between you, when you joined me, you were inside—I am pretty sure that was so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I ask you, why, being an admitted shareholder in the Atlantic Telegraph Company, you had adjudicated in your own case at Guildhall; and, on the following day, had selected Alderman Rose to sit with you, he likewise being a shareholder in the company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, after a crowd collected, you did say something about the Atlantic Telegraph Company, but what it was I cannot recollect; my mind was too much occupied at that time—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030041"></xptr>
               <p>was addressed to the crowd—I cannot say what it was—I don't think you said that my dishonestly selecting Alderman Rose to sit with me was a disgrace to the judicial integrity of the City Magistracy; but you may have said so, for I really took no notice—you may or may not have said so; but, if you did, it was not true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I ask you why, in your address to the Greenwich electors, because I denounced the Atlantic Telegraph as a swindle, you had said I was a madman. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection, not one single word passed between me and yourself till we got down to the police-station—I swear I did not hear that said—I dare say if it bad been said I should have heard it—you may have said that the fact of the cable having broken three times whilst being laid down on the last occasion, was reported by the Atlantic company them<lb></lb>selves, as you were ready to show by their report—I know you have said so—I did not hear it—you said something to the crowd—my mind was far too much occupied with the outrage that had been committed upon me, and the anxiety of my family, to attend to what you might have addressed to the crowd—if I did recollect it I should say it undoubtedly, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I ask you to stop and answer me, stepping before you, and did you push me aside saying you were in a hurry to get to the train? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never touched you to my knowledge, most distinctly, on my oath; I say most distinctly and decidedly, no—you did not ask me to stop—I thought until to-day that Mr. Cohen was by my side at the time, but it appears from what he has said, that thinking we had some private business, he went a little aside—we came out of the bank together, not arm in arm, he was close to my side—I was in a very great hurry to get to the rail, that there is no doubt about—I have not had any conversation with Mr. Cohen, or any other witness respecting this matter—I saw Mr. Cohen last night at his father's, and I never mentioned your name to him—I met him at 10 o'clock this morning at the Old Bailey, but I never mentioned your name to him—on my oath I have never discussed this matter with Mr. Cohen, nor in my family; I never even told my wife until I gave her the newspaper—I never dis<lb></lb>cussed this matter with Mr. Cohen; we never discuss matters that are to be gone into in a court of justice—you don't suppose I <hi rend="italic">crammed</hi> him—I have had no communication on the subject with the Atlantic Telegraph Company or any of its officers, except speaking to Mr. Freshfield's partner, Mr. Newman, on the day when he was a witness; I said that you had got some very strange de<lb></lb>lusions on the subject, or something of that sort—I have not sworn that you at<lb></lb>tempted to pull my nose—I said that I felt your hand just touching my nose, and I convulsively threw my arm up to defend it; you know best what you attempted—I will take back the word "convulsively," if you like—I threw up my left arm suddenly, or violently—it did not touch you, only your arm—I dare say my arm came in contact with yours, and threw it up—it did not knock your hat off—I was not in a striking attitude—I was astonished at the attack, and as any other man would, taken suddenly, I threw up my arm, seeing your arm coming across—I do not know whether I touched your arm or not, for you went back so quickly with the stick—on my oath I had not touched you at all before that, as we walked together—I am quite clear as to that—I did not let my railway wrapper fall to my know<lb></lb>ledge; if you say it was on the ground, I will admit that it was, but to my knowledge it was not, I think I kept it on my arm all the time; I should say it did not fall, because if it had fallen it would have been dirty—if I am bound to swear, I will swear it did not fall—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030044"></xptr>
               <p>I think it was on my left arm—to the best of my knowledge Mr. Cohen pinioned you—I saw him assault you—I believe he threw himself round you so as to pinion you entirely, and hold you against the bank—I consider he did me a great service, for he saved a scuffle, which I should have lamented exceedingly—I think he threw himself round you, so as to pinion your arms—his object no doubt, was to prevent your using your arms—I think he put his arms round your body and your arms, grasping you within his arms—he had not hold of you by the throat, most distinctly not—I did not see your hat off, but it may have been—I really cannot say—I was close to you, as close as I am to the gentleman in the jury-box—if I am bound to swear, I should say your hat was on; but I have heard a gentleman say it was off—to the best of my knowledge it was not off at all—I swear that that is my impression—I think some words passed between you and Mr. Cohen when he seized you, but I do not remember what they were—I heard you complain of his holding you—you said he had no business to do so; that he was not a constable, or something to that effect—you did not say he was choking you—I think you said that no constable could take you, because he had not seen the assault—you also addressed the crowd, something about the telegraph, which I do not remember—I do not recollect your saying anything about not wishing to hurt me—I will not swear you did not my so—I doubt whether it could be ten or sixteen yards from where you first met me, to where the scramble took place—to the best of my recollection you joined me at the corner of Bartholomew-lane, and the scuffle took place long before we got to the Bank-gate—it could not be more than ten or fifteen yards—I cannot speak within five yards—Mr. Mills came up when the crowd collected; he was one of the crowd—we had not got to the gate of the Rotunda before he came up; it was very near it, some few yards from it—he addressed me after the scuffle as one who had seen the assault—I did not see anybody present when the scuffle commenced, but Mr. Cohen, you, and myself; but I was engaged talking to you—I thought Mr. Cohen was by my side, but it appears he was not—you have heard what he has stated, his evidence is better than mine; he can speak about his own acts, which I cannot do—I did not hear you throughout make use of any violent language, and nothing took place as to words, except what I have sworn—you were eool at first; when you spoke to me, you were a little more warm, but nothing to warn me of any attack—I did not see you assault Mr. Cohen in any way; if you had done so, I could not have helped seeing it, at least I think so—I was not at any time so far off, as not to see and hear what was doing—I have heard Mr. Cohen examined to-day—he is one of the most truthful men in the king<lb></lb>dom; I am quite sure that whatever he says is true, therefore if he differs from me, you have the advantage of it—I did not hear you ask Mr. Cohen to take his hand off your throat, and say you could not breathe; he is too much of a man to do anything of the sort—if you had said so, I certainly should have heard it, nor should I have allowed him to assault you in any way—I did not know Mr. Mills—he addressed me as a stranger—I have not since had any conversation with him as to what he was to say here; not upon any occasion or in any place—the attorney for the prosecution has not examined me as to what I was going to say to-day—I do not think that I desired a working man in plain clothes to take you into custody, prior to the constable coming up; I may have done so; I should say not—I ordered a constable to be sent for—the man did not reply that it served me right, and he would not do it—when the policeman arrived, I gave you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030045"></xptr>
               <p>into his charge—I never said that I had a great mind not to give you into custody, I should say decidedly not, but my anxiety was so great to avoid alarm, and to get down to the country, that I will not swear such a thing may not have been said, in case a policeman could not be found; but I don't think it did take place—I say distinctly and decidedly that I did not say so after the constable arrived—I wished to avoid, if I could, going down to the police-station to make the charge, on account of my anxiety to save the train, but the policeman said it was necessary, and therefore at the hazard of losing my train I went to make the charge at the station—I have received three letters from you, to which I sent three answers—I have your last letter, I cannot find the other two (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner handed in copies of the letters</hi>)—this is the third letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received two previously—(<hi rend="italic">at the prisoner's request the letter was read dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th November</hi> 1858)—I sent an answer to that letter, of which this is a copy—(<hi rend="italic">this was read, and also one from the prisoner, dated Portsmouth, 19th October, 1858, and Mr. Alderman Salomons' reply, dated October</hi> 23,)—I also sent an answer through Mr. Gardiner my secretary to the other letter.</p>
               <p>H. D. <hi rend="smallCaps">GARDINER</hi>. I wrote a copy of a letter, and posted it myself addressed to the defendant, according to the address contained in his letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ALDERMAN SALOMONS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Recurring to our happy meeting, did I inquire why you had denied to the Greenwich electors that you had apologized for your misconduct as a Magistrate in open court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not quite see what answer I can give to that—I had never seen you from the day you were in my court until the day you assaulted me—I never did apologize to you in open court at any time—I swear that—I know perfectly well what you allude to—what I did was this: from your violence I was obliged out of respect to my court to order you out, and when you came next day I expressed the natural regret that any gentleman or any Magistrate would feel at being obliged to do so to a person of your rank—I thought that was due to myself, and that it might soothe your mind also—I did not apologize to you in open court for my conduct to you on the preceding day, but I expressed in the most courteous language I could, the regret that I felt—and which I feel now at being here to-day, very strongly indeed, for I am very sorry to be here—not as an apology but with a view to soothe your mind, as well as to express what I felt at being obliged to adopt the unusual practice of ordering an applicant to be led out of court—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner here read an extract from a newspaper, of an obser<lb></lb>vation addressed by the Alderman to the defendant at the police-court, containing the words,</hi> "If I was not quite so forbearing to you yesterday as I might have been, I regret it,")—I have no doubt whatever that that is a true report—that is not an apology—seeing you to be a lieutenant in the Navy, and not being aware of the peculiarities which you exhibited afterwards, I wished as far as possible to treat you just as ray equal, and I used the strongest language I could to express the extreme pain and regret I felt at being obliged by your own conduct to order you out of the court—I thought it would be an amiable thing on my part, both to relieve myself and to make you as comfortable as I could—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner again read the extract</hi>)—I did regret it—I regret it even now—there is nothing in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030046"></xptr>
               <p>your letters manifesting any hostile spirit on your part—I think the letters are courteous, and I think you are always courteous when you are not contradicted—I have never made use of any language towards you that could be construed as offensive—I may have been asked about your notions of the cable, and I may have said off-hand "He is a madman"—I did not mean to say you were a madman—I have not promulgated that you were—I may have casually said with regard to your opinions, or fancier, or views of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, "Well, he is mad," or, "He is mad upon it," or, "He is a madman," in that way, but not with a view to stigmatize you—I did not mean to say that you were a madman <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>—it was not solely in compliance with Mr. Cohen's request that I gave you in charge to the police constable—the constable could not have heard me say so—I followed you to the police-station—I was very impatient that they should take the charge quickly, as I was most painfully anxious to get away by the 4.30 train, which was the only train I could get home by—I did net hear you say that you were anxious to get home—I do not know that the Bank of England has refused to pay you 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for work and labour done for them in an invention supplied, on account of your hostility to the Atlantic Telegraph Company—I never heard of it till now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that the Atlantic Telegraph Company suppressed my work "The Ocean, its depths, and phenomena" because it revealed the impossibility and the fraud of the undertaking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not—I could not make out what grievance you had with the Telegraph Company, except what I heard incidentally that it was something about some work which you say they suppressed—I think I heard that from Mr. Freshfield's partner, Mr. Newman—I say as I have said before, that I have not had any communication with the Bank of England or the Atlantic Telegraph Company upon this subject, except incidentally some conversation with Mr. Newman on the day of this assault—I know nothing about whether your pamphlet was suppressed by the company, or whether they deprived you of the results of your literary labours as well as deprived you of your invention without compensation—the only thing by which I knew of your having anything to do with the Atlantic Telegraph Company was from a pamphlet which you sent me and which I read, containing letters to them—I know nothing about any work being suppressed—I do not know that they adopted your invention of laying it down without paying for it—I should doubt it very much—I do not know that in 1851 you registered the machinery, with the exception of the pulleys, which was used on board the Agamemnon, except from your letters in the pamphlet which I read—I was not an active member of the company; I am a passive one—I have only sunk my money, and I am very glad to have taken part in that invention—I have no knowledge that your invention was used with<lb></lb>out compensation—I have not the smallest knowledge on the subject, of any kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In fact, has not the whole power of the Atlantic Telegraph Company been used through you, as a magistrate, upon several occasions, to crush me and my plans? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So far from it, I beg to say, that in this instance, although summonses are always heard in private, this being a summons against a public company, we took it out of the usual course; for I thought you had some wrong that might be remedied—Mr. Martin, the clerk of the court apprised mo before I came in, of the nature of your application, so far as this; that it was an application to which the Atlantic Telegraph Company was a party, and I then told him as I told you, that I could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030047"></xptr>
               <p>not bear the case—Alderman Rose came in on the following day as a spectator, and sat next to me—he did not say that I was to be sup<lb></lb>ported; I swear that—I believe Alderman Rose is a shareholder in the Atlantic Telegraph Company—I did not know it then—I know it now, for he was at the company the other day as a shareholder, and he has told me he was a shareholder—the newspapers say that he moved a resolution the other day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then both you and he, being shareholders in the Atlantic Telegraph Company, sat at Guildhall to adjudicate on your own case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; that is not so at all; do not couple Alderman Rose with me—he came in as a spectator, and sat upon the bench, as he might sit upon the bench now as a commissioner of this court; that is all—when you were very violent Alderman Rose did interfere, but I put him down, I am very jealous of my brother Magistrates interfering when I am sitting—I don't want their assistance—I did not at the Bow-lane station, exercising my jurisdiction as a magistrate, order the inspector to take your own recognisance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and discharge you on giving your address—I did what any prosecutor would do, either suggested that he should take bail, or not, believing your word could be taken, to appear—I was most anxious to get away, and suggested that you should be let out on your own recognisance, and I think that was a kindness for which you ought to thank me, and not find fault with—without that interference, if I had been a common accuser, they would not have let you go without your finding bail—the moment I had made the charge I left—I don't know what was done between you and the inspector; I was too happy to get into a Hansom cab and gallop off to save my train—I did not order the inspector to take your recognisance in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I swear that—I suggested that he might let you go on your own recognisance to appear next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was I prevented by Sir Robert Carden from cross-examining you at the Mansion-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think Sir Robert Carden suggested, when he had heard my statement, that as the case must go elsewhere, and he had heard sufficient to enable it to be sent there, he must stop further cross-examination—he is responsible for his own acts—I have nothing whatever to do with it; I was there like any other complainant—I should say the police-inspector would have released you upon a similar order from any private individual—the police are quite independent of the magistracy, and are regulated by their own rules—I presume he acted upon his own impulse, and not from any order of mine, to the best of my knowledge—I did not ask you, when you said you had been assaulted, why you did not give Mr. Cohen into cus<lb></lb>tody; I never heard such words used—I cannot say whether you said that the whole affair was far too trivial and contemptible to be made the subject of a charge on either side; you may have said it; I do not know whether you did or not—I was at the Mansion-house next day—I knew you had been discharged on your own recognisance—I inquired; I cannot recollect of whom I did so; it was some of the Mansion-house people—I should say I did not know before that—I wished to do, and I believe I only did do, what any person would have done in the matter—I did not act as a magistrate; I gave the inspector no order—when at the Mansion-house next day I sat on the bench, not by Sir Robert Carden's side—perhaps we were as close together as my lords are now—when I gave my evidence I was not close to him; I was on the dais.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was I prevented from cross-examining you upon your depositions in chief, because you were a magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You did not cross-examine me;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901030048"></xptr>
               <p>but as to anything else, the magistrate before whom you were examined can answer the questions, not I—that was not the reason stated; the stated reason was this, that enough had been stated by me to enable you to go to the Sessions as you wished, and therefore no cross-examination was entered into—that was Sir Robert Carden's decision and statement—I think you requested that the case should be sent to the Sessions; I don't think it was on that account—I think it was in consequence of your wishing it sent to the Sessions that you did not cross-examine—you know best what your reason was for wishing it sent to the Sessions—I do not remember what you said—Sir Robert Garden then ordered you to enter into your own recognizance in 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to appear—I did not say anything upon that—upon my oath I did not propose that an additional bondsman of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be found; I am in<lb></lb>capable of doing such a thing—with the exception of my testimony not one word passed between me and Sir Robert Carden, either at that time or since—I did not state to my attorney, he being on the other side of Sir Robert Carden, that an additional bondsman should be found; I swear that—I cannot tell you how the additional bondsman affair came forward—I pre<lb></lb>sume Sir Robert Carden did not think of letting you go without taking some security for good behaviour—nothing was said by me about a bondsman in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to keep the peace; I heard Sir Robert Carden say 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one surety of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I thought very low—I do not know that it was to keep the peace; I daresay it was; I did not observe—I swear that the additional 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not at my suggestion—it is usual to desire a man to enter into recognisance to keep the peace and then send him to be tried, or else it would not have been done—I never opened my lips to Sir Robert Carden on the subject either before, at the time, or since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was I at that time actively opposing your return for Greenwich, by giving lectures upon the laying down of the Atlantic Telegraph cable, and your conduct to me at Guildhall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You were making yourself excessively ridiculous; you had a meeting there, and they all thought you mad—you tried three meetings afterwards, and nobody came to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did not you or your partisans send three wagon-loads of people from Deptford for the purpose of opposing my lectures? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Upon my oath, to my knowledge, nothing of the kind was done; the universal opinion at Greenwich after two lectures was that you were a madman—I saw the lectures advertised, and felt quite sure that you would fail—I know the prison regulations for the treatment of prisoners in Newgate—I never Bent you to prison; I prevented your going there, or being locked up at all—if you went to prison, of course you were subject to prison regulations—I have not been to Woolwich since this assault; I have been unwell, and confined to my house for some little time—I know nothing about your son being refused admission to you in prison; I never heard of it till now—I heard you say you would not find bail, and you were consequently shut up, but I had nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath have you not been advised and instigated to push this matter to the utmost, with a view of getting a verdict and judgment that should shut me up, and prevent my appearing for a time in the Atlantic Telegraph Company, and in your electioneering proceedings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As God is my witness I did as little as I possibly could for my own protection, and for the purpose of doing my duty, for the gross outrage committed upon me—my answer to your question is, I did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in any way afraid of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not show much fear when you accosted me—I should be sorry to acknowledge myself afraid of you or</p>

               <p>any other man, I have done you no wrong—I never saw or heard of you until you came into my court—I do not know that you have received two medals from the Humane Society for saving lives at the expense of your own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been cheated out of your invention, had your literary work been suppressed without compensation, had you been ordered to be assaulted in open court, refused all explanation, and your prospects ruined by a false imputation of madness; in short, had you been oppressed as you know me to have been oppressed, I ask you, on your oath as an honest man, could you have borne it so patiently as I have done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you apply that to me, I have done nothing of the kind—I have no doubt if I had suffered all you say I should have felt very irritated—I had not, previous to meeting you on the day in question, been told by Mr. Cohen that a gentleman wished to speak to me—I have, learnt since that you had asked one or two of my brother directors whether they were me—Mr. Cohen came back to the bank for me—he is a very late man, he does not come into the city till 4 o'clock—he very frequently goes with me to the rail—he had left the London and Westminster Bank—I am sure I cannot tell you what he came back for—he met me somewhere inside the Bank, I think in the passage—he did not say a word to me about you—I was in a great hurry, it had struck 4—he did not say that any person had spoken to him—he afterwards accompanied me to the police station, and he got a cab for me there—I think he volun<lb></lb>teered to do so—I was not influenced by any advice of Mr. Cohen's to give you in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence read a very long statement, in which he entered into a recital of his services in the navy, and the nature of several inventions he had perfected, as well as the alleged use of those inventions by the Atlantic Telegraph Company, from whom he asserted he had received great injustice; he then entered at great length into the circumstances contained in his cross-examination of the witnesses, commenting upon various portions, and contended that the first assault was committed by the Alderman, who pushed him when he accosted him.</hi>

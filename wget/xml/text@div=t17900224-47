               <p>What did you lose? - I have lost two sheets; I cannot tell when: it is a good while past since I let these lodgings, about half a year, perhaps; they pay two shillings a week, one shilling each of them.</p>
               <p>When did they leave it? - Last Saturday.</p>
               <p>Did you go into it after they left it? - They sent me the key; and at night the prisoner came home drunk; and I charged the prisoner, and found the things at the pawnbroker's, Mrs. Tate's.</p>

               <p>I keep a pawnbroker's shop in Catherine-wheel-alley, Whitechapel: the prisoner and Mrs. Brass together, pawned the sheet on Monday, January the 4th; I remember her perfectly well; she brought also one blanket for eight-pence, December the 28th, an iron pot for four-pence, the 28th of December, a bolster for four-pence, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240050"></xptr>11th of November; the things are all in the name of Brass.</p>
               <p>But did this woman come with Brass? - I am positive to giving her the money for the sheet.</p>
               <p>(The things produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>- LEVY sworn.</p>
               <p>I know this to be Mr. Skuse's property; I have lodged in his house, and am always in the rooms that he lets; the lodging was let to this woman, to work there; and she took in Mrs. Brass as her companion.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Brass and I took the room as a two-penny lodging; though necessity I pawned the blankets for eight-pence that I owed; and could not, through necessity, raise the money to get them out.</p>

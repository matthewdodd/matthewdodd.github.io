I live at 7, Horford-street, Mile-end.—I am a foreman at the London Docks—I know Hoffman—on 10th April he was driving a van belonging to Messrs. Jones and Candler—he brought it to the docks for a, load of tea—another van of theirs came at the same time—the whole con<lb></lb>signment was 300 packages of tea—I delivered them myself—I checked every one of them—150 were delivered into his van and 150 into the other van—Hoffman helped to load the van—he was on the box part of the time, not the whole of the time—he had a man assisting him—the other man took in some of the tea—I have not seen that man since—the chests were all ad<lb></lb>dressed to Her Majesty's Customs, Belfast, F. G. and Co., (Foster, Green and Co.) there was a van of Pickford's there at the time—I gave Pickford's some goods as well—in consequence of some information I received, I fol<lb></lb>lowed Hoffman in about five minutes—I saw the van drawn up at a public-house, Hoffman was at the horses' heads—I saw a man with a chest of tea on his back in the act of bringing it round the side of the van and he put it in an empty cart which Gauron was in—I did not see it come from the van—I did not see the man until he made his appearance round the van, the van hid him from my view—he was coming off the pavement round the van and then put it in the cart—the cart was drawn up I should think about a yard from the van, at the tail of it—I directly went over and examined it I recognised it as one of the 150 which I had put in Hoffman's van—I asked Gauron how he came by it and he said a man put it into the cart and wished him to take it to a certain place—I asked him what place and he said, "Up there," pointing up a turning opposite Sparrow-corner—he did not know where it was to go to, but the man was coming to let him know—he like-wise said that the man had told him to cover it over with a sack which he had in the cart, but he would not do that because he thought there might he something wrong—he had time to cover it over before I went up—I did not go up while the man was speaking to him—the man put it in the van without saying a word—I did not make myself known to Hoffman—I told Gauron he had better bring it with me which he did very willingly—I went with him to Messrs. Jones and Candler—we arrived there before Hoffman—when Hoffman came Mr. Candler asked him how it was that one of the</p>

               <p>chests had got off into a cart—he said he did not know he had got his right number, he knew that—I told him "I know you have got the right number but you have got one that you ought not to have," and on examining them I found one—that had not the same marks on it as the rest, quite dif<lb></lb>ferent—the card had been torn off and was found next morning in the dock where the van had stood—the nails were left in the piece of card at each of the four corners—I left it with Mr. Candler—the two prisoners were given in charge—that chest that I spoke of came from another warehouse, not from mine—it ought to have been delivered to Pickford and Co—to the best of my belief the man who was assisting him in the dock was the man who was carrying the chest of tea—that man we have not been able to find.</p>

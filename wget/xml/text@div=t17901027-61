I came down stairs and missed the things from the dining room; I took a candle and went up; and found the prisoner; he had a round hat over his face; he came out of the bed room with the bundle under his arm: I was very much frightened, and my candle went out: he run down the gallery stairs, and I cried, stop thief! he went to a door where he was stopped, which I had locked a quarter of an hour before; he came back to the dining room door again, and flung the bundle down within the threshold of the door, and he went down the back stairs: I lost sight of him; I saw him again in five minutes; he was taken off the back stairs by the cook: he was never out of the house: I have no doubt of his person: I picked up the bundle and threw it into a back parlour, where some gentlemen were at supper, and it was brought into the bar to my mistress; I saw the bundle brought out of the bar, and given to Mr. Smith; I saw the contents of the bundle; it contained the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you know the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know his father? - Yes; but I did not know he had a son; I knew he took care of the horses: he has slept at the inn; but very little in my time; he slept in the boots room, up two pair of stairs, and to get at this room they must go past that room where the transaction happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper. On Thursday evening, 7th Feb., I went to Wombwell's wild-beast show at Greenwich, about nine o'clock—I had my watch in my waistcoat pocket, and the guard round my neck—I missed it when I had been in the show a quarter of an hour—there were perhaps 50 or 100 persons there—the ring of the watch was taken off the end of the guard—I gave information, and saw the watch the same night at the station—this is it—it is mine.</p>

               <p>intoxication—I gave him in charge for his disgusting language—he was taken to the station—I followed him—I saw him throw something behind him with his right-hand—it fell within two yards of him, and within one yard of me—immediately it fell on the ground I saw it was a watch—the glass was smashed all to pieces—a young man picked it up—I caught him by the left arm and said, "Give me that watch"—I thought he was a confederate of the Prisoner, and was going to give it him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the prisoner do anything more than just throw his hand out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw this leave his hand, and I never lost sight of it till the other man took hold of it, and I took hold of him—this was about half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

I had the prisoner in charge, from Mr. Robinson—I was going to the station—I had hold of the Prisoner, and Mr. Robinson walked behind—I heard something go smash behind me—I turned, and saw a man pick up this watch, which was handed to me—I asked the prisoner what he had thrown away: he did not answer—my brother officer found the ring of the watch—there was plenty of gas light.</p>

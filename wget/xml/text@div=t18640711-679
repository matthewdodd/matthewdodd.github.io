                  </hi>. I was a police-inspector—I am now employed by the Mint authorities—on 18th June, about half-past 7 in the morning, I was in Caledonian-street, King's-cross, with Inspector Fyfe and other officers—I saw the prisoner come out of No. 17, with a mug in his hand—he immediately disappeared, and I crossed into No. 17 with Inspector Fyfe, and gave instructions to the officers to follow me—the prisoner had not gone back, then—I went into the kitchen, and while I was there Sergeant Cook called me—I ran up with Fyfe, and found Cook and Elliott struggling with the prisoner in the first-floor back-room—they said, "He has pat something into the bed"—Fyfe pulled the prisoner away from the bed towards the door, and Elliott commenced searching the bed clothes, taking them off one by one—a female undressed was sitting on the bed—Elliott said, "I have found this packet"—the prisoner then attempted to get away from Fyfe, and snatched it, saying, "God strike me dead, somebody must have put it there"—Elliott gave me the parcel, and the prisoner said, "I have a right to see it"—I said, "So you shall," and while Elliott was handing it across to me the prisoner attempted to snatch it, but Cook took it and handed it to me—I then showed it to the prisoner—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contains seven half-crowns and two florins separately wrapped in paper—Elliott then took a waistcoat off the bed-rail, put his hand in one of the pockets, and handed me a small packet containing two shillings, separately wrapped in paper—Cook then took up a bag and commenced searching it on the landing in the prisoner's presence, and found this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped up, which he gave to me—when Elliott gave me the two shillings the prisoner said first, "I picked them up at Ascot Races," and afterwards he said, "At Hampton Races"—he said that the man who found the shilling in the bag must have put it there—I said, "You are rather unfortunate, Mr. Smith; very recently two men accosted you in the Waterloo-road, made you drunk, and put some counterfeit money in your pocket"—he said, "Never mind, Mr. Brannan, I got over that, but, so help me God, I know nothing of it"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I went with Mr. Brannan—I saw the prisoner enter the house, and followed him up stairs; Brannan followed me up—Brannan had gone up before me, while I remained outside—the prisoner went to the first floor back room, and immediately locked the door—I tried to unfasten it, and finding it was locked, Cook and I forced it open with a hammer—Cook called Mr. Brannan, who came up, and I entered the room, and saw the prisoner go to the bed, and put his right hand under the clothes—there was a woman in the room, who was out of bed, but she got into bed after I went in—she had gone to the fire-place and was turning some meat which was cooking at the fire—she was undressed—it was while she was in front of the fire that the prisoner put his hand under the bedclothes—Brannan and Fyfe came in, and I then pulled the bedclothes off one at a time, and found a packet containing counterfeit money, which I handed to Mr. Brannan—the prisoner was then in custody, and Fyfe pulled him away, while I searched the bed—I saw Brannan open the packet, and the prisoner said, "So help me God, some one must have put it there"—he attempted to rush towards Brannan, but was forced back—I found a waistcoat on the bedstead, and asked the prisoner if it belonged to him—he said, "Yes"—I found a small packet in the pocket containing two counterfeit shillings, wrapped separately in paper, which I gave to Mr. Brannan—the prisoner said that he picked them up or got them at Hampton Races. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Here are seven counterfeit half-crowns; three of 1819, from one mould, and three of 1845, from one mould—these two florins are from one mould, and both are bad—these are two counterfeit shillings, of 1856 and 1857, which were found in the waistcoat-pocket—this shilling found in the bag is counterfeit—some are wrapped in tissue paper, and some in soft paper; the object of which is, that they shall not rub one against the other, which spoils their appearance.</p>

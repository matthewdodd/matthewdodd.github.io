               <p>Q. Did he lose a great on the 18th of July last - A. Yes; out of the kitchen about half past two in the afternoon, I had seen it about half an hour before she took it, I was at my sister's next door at the time she took it. In consequence of what the next witness came and told me, I pursued her and overtook her, in about ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140047"></xptr>minutes walk from my house; I asked her how she came to go in my house and take the coat: she hesitated, and at last said she did not take it she had got the coat on her right arm; she said she bought it; I said she could not have bought it, and I asked her to give it me back; she said no, unless I gave her three shillings; she said she gave two shillings for it; I sent for an officer, he took her in custody.</p>

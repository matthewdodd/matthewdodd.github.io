On Sunday, the 2d of April, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I locked all my property up safe in the presence of two of my servants. I returned at ten o'clock at night, I found the door of my chest unlocked, and about 600 l. worth of Jewellery gone, it was all my own, except about 80 l. of Mr. Hamlet's. I heard nothing till Saturday, the 24th of June, when I called at Mr. Hatton's on business. I called again in the afternoon, and took Bedford with me. I saw a man by the door who I believe to be the prisoner.</p>

When I came home I found my brother in bed, he said I was very careless about my property; for he had found diamonds on the floor. I locked the chest, but not the room door.</p>

            . I am a gold and silver refiner, and live in Chapel-street, Oxford-street, and have known the prisoner many years; on the 24th of June he brought me a ring and three pins, and asked if I would buy them, he said he had them to sell for a person who wanted 10 l. for them, and I should have them for 11 l.; he took them away. The prosecutor called on me that day, and it struck me it might be his property. I told him to come in half an hour, and I would get them from Leith, he did not come till a quarter past ten o'clock at night, and while I was talking to him, the prisoner was waiting at the door expecting either the money or the things, as I had got them from him. Haydon claimed them. I do not think them worth above 12 l.</p>

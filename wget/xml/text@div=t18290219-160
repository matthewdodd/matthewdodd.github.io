            . I was guard of the Southampton mail coach in December - it passes through Alton. On Tuesday, the 30th of December, about two o'clock in the morning when it passed through Alton, I received the seven mail bags from Miss Camplin - they were on two different straps, but these two straps strapped together; one strap had the Alton and Alresford, Alton and Winchester, Alton and Southampton bags on it - the other strap contained four bags, which were to go below Southampton- when I got on the coach I unstrapped the two straps, and put the three bags which I have named on one strap, and buckled them with twelve other bags; after changing horses at Bishop Sutton, a mile before I got to Alresford, I strapped the bags in three different lots - the Alton and Winchester on the Honnslow and Winchester strap, with the other bags which I had taken up before for Winchester; I had to leave five bags at Alresford, and I took these five bags off at Bishop Sutton, and one of those was the Alton and Alresford; I should have had to leave six bags at Winchester, and those I put together before-between Bishop Sutton and Alresford, I put five of the bags together which I had to leave at Winchester, and the one I had taken up at Alton - I am quite sure I had it in my hand just before I entered the town of Alresford- I mean the bag from Alton to Winchester; I am quite certain of it, for I took it off the strap, and added it to the Winchester strap, and the Southampton bag from Hounslow; I strapped it to four others - as I strapped it, I remembered having only one ring to the bag, and tried with my finger to see if that ring remained safe, and found it was so- the mail reached Winchester about five minutes past four o'clock; I delivered the bags to the post-mistress' son.</p>
               <p>Q. After feeling the ring safe, had you to alter the bags? A. After taking up the Alresford bag, I had to unstrap the Winchester strap on which the Alton and Winchester bag was, in order to put a fresh bag on it - the mail arrived at Winchester about four o'clock, and I delivered the bags to the post-mistress' son, and at that time I believed that the Alton bag was among the number; on my return I understood that the Alton bag was missing; I could not tell where I had dropped it, but suppose it must have been at Alresford in unbuckling the strap, in order to add a fresh bag; Alresford is fifty-eight miles from London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Whether you dropped it at Alresford, or between that and Winchester. you cannot say? A. No; I am certain I had it at Alresford - it is usual to have two rings to a bag.</p>
               <p>HENRY FLIGHT. I am the post-mistress' son at Winchester. On the 30th of December, I received the bags from Sweatman about four o'clock in the morning - I sorted them when they come in, and on looking them over I missed the Alton and Winchester bag - that was about a quarter of an hour after I received them.</p>

            , Esq. I am solictor of the Post-office. When the prisoners came to town they were brought to me at the Post-office; I saw Ward first, separately from Mason - Ward stated that Mason had picked the notes up in a pocket-book; I put Ward aside, and questioned Mason - I told him he was in custody on suspicion of having found a mail-bag, and having taken some notes out of it - he denied that he had found any bag or notes whatever; I did not ask if he had found any pocketbook, that I recollect - I might have asked it: he admitted that he had come to town with his uncle, but said he did not know what for.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the boy appear a good deal frightened? A. It did not strike me so - he does not appear one of the brightest; I cautioned him, and said he was at liberty to say any thing or not, and whatever he said might be given in evidence against him.</p>
               <p>

            . Mason gave me up this pocket-book about the third hearing he had at the Mansion-house - it was several days after this conversation with Mr. Peacock; he had never before told me any thing about finding the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he give any account of it before the Magistrate, at the first examination? A. Nothing whatever - he denied all knowledge of it till the third hearing, when he held up the pocket-book, and said "This is the pocket-book I found the notes in;" I heard Ward examined at the Post-office, and I believe he said Mason had given the notes to him; he did not say that to the Magistrate till, I believe, the second examination: I did not tell the Magistrate what he had said, nor did Mr. Peacock, in my hearing; I know Mason denied all knowledge of the notes to Mr. Peacock and me, till the third or fourth examination, and he said nothing to the Magistrate about finding them till then - that might be the first time he was asked about them; I cannot say Ward ever gave me any account of the notes, except having them from Mason.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Did he, in the country, say one word to you about having any notes? A. No, neither of them; Ward said he knew nothing of any notes at all; he did not speak twenty words from there to town.</p>

On Sunday the 7th of June, I came home about eleven o'clock at night, and missed 1200l. worth of property, chiefly in gold seals and chains; I advertised it. Mr. Bradbury produced two seals to me, which I knew to be mine; he said he bought them of a person who sold old clothes, and that he thought he lived in Barbican. We went to Play house-yard; and found the prisoner at a house there. He appeared to be a general dealer in old clothes. Mr. Bradbury immediately said he was the man. I asked him if he had any more of the seals which he had sold to Bradbury, he said he had not; I immediately beckoned to Humphreys to come in, he began to search, the priosner's wife, a girl, and a boy were in the room; the prisoner pretended to faint, and wanted a little vinegar, his wife also expressed the same inclination, and was apparently fainting; I thought it a trick, and sat against the door to prevent any body going out; I heard a noise in the passage and thought they might be moving some of my property, and opened the door a little way to see what was going on, at that instant his wife passed her hand through the aper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090032"></xptr>ture, and gave something to a person outside; I pulled the door to; Twenty or thirty Jews came round the door, and made a great noise, we were literally beat out of the house. Humphreys brought the prisoner away. We found nothing.</p>

            . I live in Broad-street, Bloomsbury, and am a dealer in lace. I have known the prisoner three or four years, he passed my house once or twice every week. On Monday the 8th of June, about ten o'clock, I gave him 10s. and an old seal for the two seals. I afterwards saw Mr. Warwick's advertisement, and showed him the seals; he recognized them. I had sold the prisoner old clothes before. We went to his house, and had great difficulty in searching.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I believe the prisoner gave his address; he had two or three more seals.</p>

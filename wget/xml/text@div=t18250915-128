               <p>JOHN LLOYD. On the 27th of July, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I fell in with the prisoner in Chiswell-street; she accosted me, and I went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18250915-128-crimeloc695">Grub-street</placeName>

I went up one pair of stairs; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150053"></xptr>took my watch out, and laid it on the table. When I had been in the room about a quarter of an hour she moved from one side of the room to the table, and put the candle out - she pretended to go down to light it, and I went after her, and found her on the stairs, with the watch in her hand. I suspected that she had got my brooch as well; I alarmed the landlady, and gave her in charge; she was taken to the watch-house, but nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me 1 s., and say that was all the change you had, but if I liked to go and leave the watch with the landlady for a few shillings, I might do it? A. Upon my oath I did not.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was called for as I was going round at three o'clock. I saw the prosecutor standing at the door - he said he gave charge of the prisoner, and that she had robbed him of a brooch; I said, "Have you got it?" she said No. I said, "Is it in the room?" the prosecutor said No, he had looked with the landlady, and it was not there. He then said she had taken his watch.</p>

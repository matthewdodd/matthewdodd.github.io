                  </hi>. I live at 49, Thorn Road, South Lambeth—on 16th January I went to bed about 11. 30, being the last person up—I saw that the house was properly secured—I went downstairs next morning a few minutes after 6—I found the place in confusion; the par<lb></lb>lour doors open, which were shut the night before, and which are usually kept shut; the kitchen door open, as well as the drawers in the dresser, and the cupboard; the linen and papers and everything was lying on the floor—in the breakfast parlour the drawers, a tea-caddy, and writing-desk had been opened, and the papers and other things were lying on the floor—the catch of the window in the breakfast-room had been put back—I went upstairs and found the back parlour open, the front parlour door had been forced—I missed two coats, a waistcoat, and a pair of gloves, a shirt front, three keys on a ring, and one loose in a drawer—the value of the property missing was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the shirt-front, gloves, and keys in the possession of the police on Saturday—I know the gloves from having worn them, and they are torn, and the front from an iron mark of wax—I have tried the keys in the locks, and I have brought one lock with me.</p>

On Saturday morning, about 1. 30, 19th January, I saw the prisoners in the Clapham Road—I watched them till 2. 45, when I got assistance, and asked them to give a proper account of themselves—one of them (I don't know which) said, "We have lost our way, we want to go to London Bridge," the other said he</p>

               <p>lived at Hackney—I said, "If you cannot give a more satisfactory account of yourselves I shall take you into custody, and you will be charged with loitering for an unlawful purpose"—I called another constable who was near, and took them into custody—when we had got about 30 or 40 yards I noticed Harris putting something in his pocket—I told the constable to take whatever it was out of his hand—he did so, and gave me this candle—Ross then attempted to get away, and we had a desperate encounter for about a quarter of an hour or more, and he struck me on the poll—these are some of the matches that were scattered about—Harris was quiet all the way—we took them to the station and searched them—I found in Ross's coat pocket this pair of glares, and he was wearing this shirt<lb></lb>front—I also found these two knives, and this old blade of a knife, which might be used for pushing back window fastenings, and this match-box, latch-key, and twopence in coppers—on Harris I found these four keys on the steel ring, this purse, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a lead pencil—they were charged with unlawful possession—Ross refused his address, and Harris gave 22, Mary Street, Kingsland Road, which was false.</p>

About 2.30 on Saturday morning, 19th January, I saw the prisoners walking together in the Trigon Road towards the Fentiman Road—Foster was following me—one of the prisoners looked up at a house and said "I think we have made a mis<lb></lb>take"—Foster ran in front of them and said "I have been following these two for this half-hour, now give an account of yourselves"—I took hold of Ross and North took hold of Harris—North said "What do you do out this time in the morning?"—one of the prisoners said "We have merely lost our way"—I put my hand into the inside pocket of Ross's coat and found some matches—North took a new candle from Harris's pocket—Foster said ''I know enough of them, take them to the station"—Foster held Ross's arm—Ross became violent and endeavoured to make his escape, and in the struggle Ross struck me in the mouth—he said "I won't be taken"—Foster drew his truncheon and Ross caught hold of it and tried to get it away—they were taken to the station and searched.</p>

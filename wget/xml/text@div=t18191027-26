            . I am servant to Mr. Scales. On Saturday morning, the 16th of October, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and take the carcase of a sheep - he <rs id="t18191027-26-deflabel150" type="occupation">occasionally did portering business</rs>

In about three quarters of an hour the man who had bought that sheep came for it. I saw the prisoner a few minutes after, and got an officer, who took him between eight and nine o'clock. My master charged him with taking it, he denied it - I am sure I saw him take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Mr. Scales hung them there, to be sent for by the persons who bought them - A. Yes; the prisoner was employed by persons to load their carts.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Drury often employed the prisoner to fetch carcases for him - A. The prisoner denied taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say Drury sent him for it - A. Yes, but he took two. I apprehended him where he always stands for employment.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner, and charged him with stealing the carcase of a sheep - he said he was waiting there for a constable to come and take him, as he understood he was suspected of taking it. He said he took one, thought it was the wrong one, and weighed it.</p>

               <p>JURY to WHITEHEAD. Q. Did you see him take two carcases - A. Yes. Drury had bought only one. We hung the first one on the scale, to see if it was right. I asked him if he had taken another, to hear if he would say he had. The last sheep he took was Drury's, that was weighed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable at Nine Elms station. The prisoner was in the employ of the London and South Western Railway Company—on the night of 10th Jan., at half-past twelve o'clock, he was employed loading for the morning departure—after the wagon was loaded, it was his and Phillips's duty to sheet it over—I observed them doing that, went round the wagon and saw the prisoner get into it; and saw him take a pair of boots out of the box—he turned, and saw me, and put them under his arm—I cannot say whether it was in or outside his jacket—I asked what he had got under his arm—he hesitated—I asked a second time, and he handed them to me—I told him he must go with me to Mr. Thorn, the superintendent; and he then said he picked them up in the corner of the wagon—I had seen the box before it was put in the wagon; it was not in good condition, and I fixed it as well as I could—it was not so loose that the boots could have come out of it—a pair of boots could not have come out without lifting the lid—I saw it turned over afterwards in Mr. Thorn's office, and nothing fell out—there was a gas-light nearly in front of this wagon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the Company's employ. On 10th Jan. I was employed with Stiles in sheeting over the luggage-van for Staines, and while we were in the wagon, Bolster came up and said to the prisoner, "Show me what you have got there, Stiles"—the prisoner said, "What?"—he asked him again, and he said he had got a pair of boots that he had just picked up in the wagon, and I saw him take a pair of boots out of his left hand with his right, and gave them to Bolster—it was such a pair as these produced—I saw the prisoner near the part of the wagon where this box was afterwards found—I think he could have seen Bolster all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the goods department at Nine Elms. I remember the prisoner being brought by Bolster to my office about one o'clock in the morning, and Bolster said he had stolen a pair of shoes out of a box in the Staines wagon—the prisoner said he was innocent of it, he picked them up—I went with the prisoner and Bolster to the wagon, had the box brought to my office, and turned it over to see if it was possible for any of the contents to fall out, and found they could not—it appeared impossible for them to have fallen out.</p>

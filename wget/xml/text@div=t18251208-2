On Friday morning, the 18th of November, about ten minutes before seven o'clock, my daughter alarmed me - I got up, and found the kitchen and school room broken open; the school room is a detached building; I found a pane of glass in the kitchen window broken; the snap was pushed back, close to the broken pane - the window was open two or three inches, and resting on some linen, I had fastened the window myself, between ten and eleven o'clock the night before; the pane was then whole: there is no outer shutter to the window. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The school room door is opposite the kitchen - I found a hole bored in the back door of the school room with a centre-bit, which laid by the door, opposite the hole. A person could introduce an instrument, and unbolt the door; it was wide open - I had seen it secure about eleven o'clock the night before. I found part of a candle and a match there - I missed a chimney glass from the parlour, adjoining the kitchen - it hung on a nail over the mantel-piece, but was not fastened to the wall. I missed all the articles stated in the indictment (enumerating them); they were worth about 15l. The stockings belonged to the trustees - I had the charge of them; the rest belonged to me. I went to Worship-street that morning, and saw part of the things - here is the glass; I have had it many years; here are two hats, one of which I had worn the day before, and the other I believe to be the one left on the premises; here are two pairs of pliers, a pair of callupers, a file, and the tracer of the penograph; they are all mine. Here is the center-bit which I found on the premises. My desk was broken open.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 18th of November, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner going down Golden-lane, about a hundred yards from Mr. Bennett's, and coming in a direction from there; it was dark - he had the looking-glass in a sack. I followed, and stopped him - I asked what he had got there - he said, "Why?" I said I insisted on seeing what he had got; he took the sack from his shoulder - I put my hand in, and felt the looking-glass; I said he must go to the watch-house - two other watchmen were with me; Williamson carried the sack; he tried to run away as we took him along, and Yates stopped him; nothing else was in the sack; he did not say where he got it. I found the callupers, tracer, file, and pliers in his pocket; I gave the glass to Bee - that produced is the same.</p>

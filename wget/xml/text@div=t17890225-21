               <p>Court. Was there anybody by when he took you by the hand? - No, there was nobody.</p>
               <p>Did he drag you in by force? - He did, into the tap-room, and I said my nose bled that I might get away from them.</p>
               <p>Did not the maid, or the mistress, go or send after the men? - No, Sir.</p>

            . On the 27th of February, about a Quarter after Seven, I went Home in a Coach, it was dark; and as I was getting out of the Coach, I saw a Boy loitering about, and asked him what he did there; he said he came to get some Water; and when I came to step into the House, I saw one of the Parlour Windows below Stairs was open, and two Cases of Silver-handled Knives and Forks stand in a Chair, ready to be taken away. I called to the Hackney Coachman, but he was gone. They had taken away two Cases of Silver-handled Knives and Forks. - There are two Lamps in the Yard. I saw the Parlour Window open before I got to the Door of the House. - The Prisoner was taken and denied the Fact. - He threatened to beat this Boy because he offered to discover him.</p>

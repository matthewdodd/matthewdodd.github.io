               <p>Q. Do you keep a house there? - A. Yes: On the 27th of January, we discovered that the house was broke into through the cellar-window, by wrenching out an iron bar; there was a lattice before the window; I was not in the cellar the night before, but I saw the lattice safe the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. They could not undo the iron bar without taking away the lattice? - A. No, it could not; I am certain the lattice was safe over night; my servant maid found the house broke open, about seven in the morning, and came and called me, and I got up directly I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, and many more.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before this? - A. I saw the candlestick after ten o'clock on the night of the 26th; the tumbler, I believe, I had at dinner, I don't know that I had it at supper; the candlestick and goblet were shewn to me by an officer belonging to the office in Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that? - A. The Friday after, the 26th was on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the candlestick and goblet to be your's? - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You don't fasten your own windows? - A. That window never was fastened more than it was that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the house broke open on the 27th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the house fastened over night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. Yes, one; but he does not live in the house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any share in the property of your house? - A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning? - A. About a quarter before seven o'clock; when I came down stairs, about a quarter before seven, I found the wind blew very much; both the doors were open, and the window taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. What doors? - A. The door that went out of the kitchen and went up stairs; the iron bar of the window was taken down, and the window taken away; the wire was not taken down, but turned up; I thought there was somebody in the house, and went and called my master, and we came down together.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street: On Wednesday, the 27th of January, I had an information against Ashley; I was informed he was at a public-house in Petticoat-lane; I went, in company with Foredum, in search of him; going up Petticoat-lane, I met Ashley; we took him into custody, and brought him down to the office; there I searched him; in his pocket I found this silver candlestick, and this silver half pint tumbler in his coat pocket; upon a little further enquiry, we found the gentleman that had lost them, Mr. Penn; he came forward, and proved them to be his property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. I believe the things were wrapped up in a handkerchief? - A. Yes; the same handkerchief is about them now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a snuff-box upon him, Yes; he said the snuff-box was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he was going to do with it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>(To Mr. Penn). Look at those things. - A. These are both my property; the snuff-box is not mine; they have my marks upon them; there is my crest upon the candlestick; and the initials of my name at the bottom of the tumbler.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Grissith). What time did you take him? - A. At half past twelve o'clock in the day of the 27th.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, I understand you have already determined that the accomplice is unworthy of credit.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I lodged at Smith's: On Wednesday morning, he asked me if I would stop to breakfast, which I did; he said he wanted a box made the same as I had got; he said, my father has left me some silver; it was in a handkerchief; he wanted me to sell it for him, I refused to take it; I said, he might take it himself; he forced the handkerchief into my pocket; I did not know what it was; I was going with the box; I have a witness to prove I had it of him.</p>

               <p>Q. You know that man has accused the prisoner of this offence? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing any thing, and when given to the prisoner at the bar? - A. To the best of my recollection it was this day three weeks; it was on the Wednesday in the morning, between the hours of nine and ten, Smith asked Ashley if he would go to London with him; we lived at Bethnalgreen; Ashley answered him, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night? - A. About ten o'clock; I never saw Smith from three o'clock on Tuesday afternoon till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What occurred in the morning? - A. He asked Ashley if he would go to London with him; he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Ashley at home that night? - A. He came home about eleven o'clock on Tuesday night as he was taken into custody on the Wednesday; Smith asked me to give him a clean pocket handkerchief; if this is it, it has had three letters picked out of the corner, (looks at it); this is the handkerchief, here are the letters partly picked out.</p>
               <p>Jury. What were the letters? - A. I cannot recollect what the letters were, though I had the picking of them out; I think one of them was a D.</p>
               <p>Jury. (Look at the handkerchief.)There are no letters picked out of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Penn). Do you know the handkerchief? - A. I think I do.</p>
               <p>Dixon. That is the corner; I do think that is the handkerchief; I should not chuse to swear it.</p>
               <p>Jury. There does not appear to have been any letters picked out; she has a fine eye if she can discover it.</p>
               <p>Dixon. It was the pattern of that handkerchief, there were three letters picked out of the corner; Mr. Smith gave me the handkerchief about a fortnight before he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. The handkerchief came originally from Smith? - A. Yes; Smith gave me a handkerchief, and desired me to pick the letters out.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what it was you saw given by Smith to the prisoner? - A. When I gave him the handkerchief, he put a little quantity of something into it; I cannot say it was this, it was about this bulk; he asked Ashley to put it in his pocket, he said no,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170020"></xptr>he would carry it in his hand, and Smith turned him round, and I saw him put it into his pocket; what it was I don't know, for I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - A. I have lived with this man, Smith; turned of seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a notorious thief? - A. I am sorry to say he gets his bread in an unaccountable manner; I never knew what he did; I said he should never bring things into the house not come honestly by.</p>
               <p>Q. Ashley and he agreed very well? - A. Ashley lodged in the house five months.</p>
               <p>Q. You continue in that line of life now? - A. The way I maintain myself since he has been in prison, is by parting with things to keep him and me; I never mean to enter a home with him any more; if I do, I believe I shall come to an untimely death.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe this is my handkerchief; I have some of the same pattern.</p>

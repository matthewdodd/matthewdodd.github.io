                  </hi>. I am a labourer, at Uxbridge. I occupy a house in Windsor-street, which consists of only one room, adjoining a little barn—on the morning of Shrove Tuesday I left my house, and locked the door—I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there, consisting of one half-sovereign, two <hi rend="italic">holey</hi> sixpences, a crown-piece, an old shilling, and the rest was half-crowns and shillings—there was one shilling which I think I had had between three and four years—I left the house at half-past ten o'clock, and returned at a quarter-past eleven—on returning I unlocked the door, and the first thing I saw was a large hole broken through the ceiling—I saw my box broken open, and the money gone—I am sure the shilling produced is the one I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside at Uxbridge. On this morning Mr. Eades came to my door, and asked what o'clock it was—I told him half-past ten—just after that I saw the prisoner going in the direction of Mr. Eades's house, which adjoins a barn—the roof of the barn is quite hollow all along, and you have to get across a beam which leads on to the roof of the house—the barn belongs to the prisoner's grandmother—when Mr. Eades came back he came to me, and I went back with him, and saw what had occurred.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I found the prisoner at Windsor, which is between nine and ten miles from where Eades lives—I got there before he came—I went by the rail and he walked, and I caught him as soon as he came—I searched him, and found on him three half-crowns, twenty-four shillings, two sixpences, three halfpence, and this shilling—I asked him how much money he had got—he said he did not know—Mr. Perkins, the Superintendent of the Eaton Police, asked him, in my presence, how long he had been at Windsor—he said two or three days—he asked where he slept—he said under a rick—he said, "There are no ricks at Windsor"—he made no answer to that—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of Hillingdon.</p>

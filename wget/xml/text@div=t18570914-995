                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I was at work at Lambeth on 10th June, with Purcell; after we left work we went to a beer shop, and the prisoner came in—we played at skittles, and had some beer; then five of us went out together; the prisoner was one—some quarrel took place between him and Purcell, and Purcell <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him down; the prisoner said he should suffer for that before night—he came up, and Purcell did the same again—we were talking, and the prisoner held up his hand—I did not see any knife—I came up, and said, "What is the matter, Purcell?"—he said, "I am done for!" and he put his two hands to the knife in his face, and pulled it out—he was falling down—I had not seen them both on the ground—Purcell did not fall, because I caught him—I was walking behind them—I saw the prisoner draw his hand, but I did not see there was any knife—I was not so close that I could see the hand go to his face.</p>

I was with the last witness—I saw the prisoner and Purcell quarrelling—Purcell knocked him down—the prisoner got up, and Purcell pressed him against some railings, and tried to press his weight against him, and he said to Purcell, "I am done; I want no more to do with you"—Purcell knocked him down, and he got up, and pulled his cap off, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it down, and Purcell said, "When my two sons grow up they shall fight you for me"—Purcell caught him again, and knocked his head against the fence—I saw the pensioner had a knife, but I did not see him stick him with it.</p>

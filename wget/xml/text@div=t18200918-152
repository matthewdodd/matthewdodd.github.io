On the 5th of June I missed five fowls, and afterwards got them back. I got a search-warrant afterwards in consequence of suspicion, and searched the prisoner's premises, which are fifty or sixty yards from my house. I found two elm and an oak board nailed up to his pig-stye, which I had lost, and am certain of them. I did not like to pull them down, but marked them, and went next morning to take them down, but they were gone. I could not find the prisoner till three weeks ago, when he surrendered himself. He was a weekly servant, and left me on Saturday without coming for his wages.</p>

             I said I was engaged, but at any time after I would attend him. He surrendered on the Wednesday. I swear to the boards - when they were removed the rest of the sty remained, which were old boards.</p>

            . I am a constable. I accompanied Eaton on the 8th of June to the prisoner's house - he claimed three boards which were nailed to the pig-stye, they were too good for that purpose. He marked them, went for them next morning, and they were gone. The prisoner absconded.</p>

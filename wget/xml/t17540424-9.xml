               <p>Stowel. I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I have this to say for myself : This woman that they call my first wife, she gave out that she was not married to me; it was a drunken frolick at Welch's house, and he must be a very bad man to let the last wife be with me two hours in his house before we were married, and have a wedding dinner there, if he knew I had another wife living. This old woman gave it out that she was dead, and Welch told me if I would give him 5 l. I should hear no more of it. I own my selling some of my wife's goods in order to pay Welch for what I had expended in beer. The old woman said after this that if I would go to any remote part of the world with her she would go with me, for she was ashamed to live with me where she was known, she being so old, and myself a young man. This Welch will forswear himself presently, I hope, my Lord, you will not take his part.</p>

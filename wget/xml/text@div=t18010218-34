               <p>Q.Had you made him any promise? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor threatened him? - A.Neither; I kept charge of the prisoner all night, for I could not procure an officer; in the morning I procured an officer, and told him that was his prisoner, I gave charge of him; when I went to look for the sack I found it removed very near the barn door; I went to search for the nail he spoke of, but instead of finding the nail I found this key, (produces a skeleton key); before I put my initials into the sack I looked at the heap of corn on the barn floor, and there appeared to be some gone; It was put there to be cleaned, and I found in the sack a quantity of the same sort of dust; corn is generally skreened, and this was taken out before it was skreened; I have no doubt of it being part of the same heap, there are three bushels and three pecks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took the corn with intent of giving it to the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do with feeding the horses? - A.Nothing at all; he had no business with it.</p>
               <p>RALPH ANDERSON sworn. - I am barn-man to the last witness; I was ordered into the barn by my master, on the 17th of January; I had been employed that day in cleaning corn in the barn; the prisoner was backwards and forwards in the barn several times; the street door of the barn was left open in the evening, and I let myself in and fastened the door, and I covered myself in the sheaves that were not threshed; after I had been there about ten minutes, I heard somebody open the door and come into the barn; he came down the barn floor and went to the sack of oats, at the end of the barn; it was upon some trusses of straw, about my height; I heard him take down the sack, he moved it to where the floor rose, and then he took it upon his shoulder; I rose from out of the sheaves that I was covered with, and said, stop, or I will shoot you dead; he turned round and said, will you; I said, yes Henry; I went up to him and told him he must go with me to my master, and then it would be explained who came for the lack of oats; he said he did not care for that, for he was only going to take them to Joe, who was our carter, and has since absconded.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it usual for you to skreen the oats before you gave them to the horses? - A. Always before it is given to the granary, or else they are not finished.(Potter Batson, the constable, produced the sack; containing some oats and a piece of paper with the initials of the prosecutor upon it).</p>
               <p>Hutchings. This is the same piece of paper that I put into the sack; the prisoner came to live with me last Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

I let the prisoner a bed for one night, on the 22d of June; this pair of sheets was on the bed - I missed them the next morning, as he was going down stairs; he had paid for the lodging; I called the servant to detain him; the prisoner denied having them; I sent for a constable, and before he came the prisoner took one sheet from his hat, and the other from under his coat.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CUSS. I am a constable. I was sent for, and found these sheets on a bench in the back parlour; Mrs. Watts said the prisoner took one from his hat, and the other from round his body; he did not deny it; there were ten duplicates found on him, and 3s. 6d. in money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I arose by half-past eight o'clock, and was going out; Mrs. Watts said, Stop! and she sent for a constable; the sheets were found on the bench, they were not on me.</p>

On the 14th of October, I left my watch in my breeches, hanging up in the stable; I locked the stable door, and left the key in the door, at about half past one; I returned at about half past four; I missed my watch.

            . Q. Were you sent for to apprehend the prisoner - A. Yes; I apprehended him at his master's stable; the prisoner went with me to his room, he unlocked the box himself; I found this watch in his box; I asked him how he came to steal the watch; the prosecutor told him it would be better for him to confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do not tell what he said - A. I took him to Enfield; the lock was off the watchhouse door, I took him to the Nag's Head; he sat very quietly with me; as soon as the smith had put the lock on and brought me the key, I took him out to put him in the watchhouse; he broke from me as soon as he got out of the public house door; he kept away for five or six week; he was taken last Saturday; he is the same man, he has a wife and two children.</p>

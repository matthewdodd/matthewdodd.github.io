               <p>Q. Was the prisoner your servant. - A. No, he was the excise officer on duty.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this soap concealed. - A. In a room in the manufactory, between the cieling and the floor. In consequence of discovering it, I kept watching, and at half past twelve o'clock at night I observed the prisoner now at the bar coming into the room where the soap was concealed; I saw him put his hand in a situation to take the soap, which he apparently did, and then he put it into his pocket; I did not say anything to him, but waited; in the course of half an hour the other officer came to relieve him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see you. - A. He could not. When Dunstan, the other officer, came, the prisoner then was going away; I went from the place where I was to look, that I would be sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no doubt before. - A. I had no doubt; finding the soap gone, I called to my brother that he might stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to the other excise officer. A. No, not a word of it; my brother stopped him, and the soap was taken from him in our accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it. - A. I saw part of it took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you mention it to the other excise officer. - A. We wished to keep it as secret as possible; he knew of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. The other officer was on the premises when he was detected, you saw him did not you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As he passed you it was very easy for you to have called him, you might have done that. - A. We might, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this man visited you. - A. Six weeks or two months.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of soap was there in all. - A. About four pounds, it is worth about three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took this man nobody was present but your brother and yourself. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for a constable. - A. Yes, we searched him before we sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say. - A. He begged for mercy, and he begged for mercy when the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. When you challenged him did not he give you the soap himself. - A. I cannot say, for the first part, that my brother took from him; the latter part was taken from his pocket.</p>

             sworn. I am brother to the last witness; I was waiting down stairs for the officer going out; my brother called out, I immediately went up to the officer, and accused him of having some soap, and insisted upon searching him; he immediately begged for mercy; I told him to go up stairs into the accompting-house; when we got into the accompting-house, he gave me the soap, which we here produce.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he beg for mercy after the constable came. A. He did. I am sure this is the soap that he delivered up; it has not been out of our possession ever since, nor he had not been out of our premises before it was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I declare myself innocent as to my intention of taking the soap; finding it in a secret place, I took it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Did he say he took it because it was in a secret place. - A. No, the very word that he first said, was begging pardon.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

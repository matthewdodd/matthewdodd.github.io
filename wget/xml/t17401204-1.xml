               <p>Mr. Barker. On the 4th of Nov. I saw three Pieces of Goods which I believe to be mine, at Mr. Hook's a Mercer in St. Martins le-Grand ; I desired to know how he came by them, and he inform'd me he had them from Elliot, who had been his Neighbour. The next Morning I was sent for to the Baptist's-Head in Milk-street, where Elliot own'd that he bought the Goods of the Prisoner. The Prisoner had serv'd us as a Porter, and when he was taken, he confessed that he had robb'd us of all the Goods mention'd in the Indictment, and directed us to go to his House for the 20 Yards of Garlix, which we found accordingly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ravenhill. I saw three Pieces, a black Callimancoe, a brown Stuff, and a wash'd Garlix, at Mr. Hook's, which I knew to be mine. The Prisoner acknowledg'd the Fact, and told us where the Garlix might be found.</p>

            . Elliot brought a Piece of blue Mantua to my House, and as he was a Neighbour I bought it of him; he afterwards brought some Silver Ducape, and ask'd me 4 s. a Yard for it, I then had a Suspicion of it, for I knew that most of the Trade gave more, but I bought that likewise, and then sent for the Person who makes these Goods, and by his Means I found out the Prosecutors: I desir'd Elliot, that I might better fix the Thing, to bring me more Goods, he did so, and among them this Callimancoe, and the brown Stuff, which Mr. Barker believed to be his. When Elliot was asked about these Goods, he owned that he bought them of the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sawbridge. I was at the Baptist's-Head with the Prosecutors, Hook and Elliot; the Prisoner was sent for, and acknowledg'd that he had sold these Goods to Elliot, and that he had robb'd his Master ever since 1739. <rs id="t17401204-1-verdict4" type="verdictDescription">

I know very well;" and went away with it; I advertised it, and four days afterwards found it in the Borough.</p>

            . I am constable of the night, of St. George's, Surry. On the 19th of October, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoner with another man at the Black Horse and Swan public-house, Blackman-street - the prisoner had a bundle on his back, and went upstairs with it - I followed, and asked him what he had got - he made no answer - I asked if it was his own - he said a man employed him to carry it - I took him, and produce the bundle which contains this furniture.</p>
               <p>MR. HILL. This is the furniture which I gave the prisoner to carry to Finchley.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man, whom the officer saw with me, hired me to carry the parcel - he bears a notorious character, and I was led away by him - I met him on the Wednesday, and he said, "My man, will you go to No. 102, Hatton-garden, and fetch a parcel to go to Finchley;" I went, and they asked if I was the Finchley carrier - I said, No, the carrier stood at the corner - I took the parcel, and delivered it to him - he gave it back to me, and said he would return directly; but he did not - I took it to the Cock public-house, and booked it for Finchley; the next day I met this man - he asked what I had done with the parcel - I said I left it at the Cock - he went there with me, and got it - he put it in a coach, and when we got out at the public-house door, I was taken - I have driven a Greenwich coach seven years, and never was in trouble.</p>

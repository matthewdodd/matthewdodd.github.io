                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Standard public-house, in Vauxhall bridge road. On 8th Nov. the prisoner brought me an order—I believe this to be it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Please to let the bearer have 8 pots to George Bugbee")—I was in the habit of delivering beer on the ticket or order of George Bugbird—I do not properly know his name, but I know him—I was induced to let the prisoner have the beer, under the belief that this was a genuine document of Mr. Bugbird's—this is the ordinary form of request upon which I deliver beer to him.</p>

               <p>—I asked him no questions, and he said nothing to me—he gave me no explanation of the paper—I have not got any of Mr. Bugbird's orders here; we destroy them at the week's end, when the money is paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the contractors of the Westmin<lb></lb>ster Improvement Company, and live at 77, Great Peter street, West<lb></lb>minster. This ticket is not in my hand-writing—I am in the habit of sending tickets for beer for the use of the workmen, but not similar to this; those I send are a deal different to this, a different hand-writing altogether—I did not authorise the prisoner to get any beer for me on that day; I know him—he has been employed under me—I have on former occa<lb></lb>sions sent him to Mr. Moy's for beer—I did not receive any porter from the prisoner on that day; he was not in my employ that day, he was dis<lb></lb>charged, and I had paid him his money the day before, I believe.</p>

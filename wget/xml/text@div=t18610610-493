My husband asked me to come home, and he would give Mrs. Clark's company up. I said I was afraid to come home, for she would not let him. I went into the house when my husband and Mrs. Clark had done tea. Mrs. Clark said, 'Put her out of the house, Charley,' meaning her husband. I said I should not go out of the house without my husband. She said, 'Go and fetch White, and have her locked up.' White, the constable, came: my husband told him that he did not send for him. Mrs. Clark said, 'Put her out or lock her up, and do not let her annoy me.' I went out afterwards with my husband; he stopped out with me till 10 o'clock. He did not come home to me till Saturday night. I slept at our</p>

               <p>house. Mrs. Clark took her things out on the Tuesday before the Friday. Mrs. Clark came down in her chemise, at half-past 5, to let my husband in, I prevented her going. She said she would open the door for him at any time she liked. I saw Mrs. Clark, and said, 'You have been along with my husband again.' She said she had; and was going to meet him again that night, and he would buy her a new cap; and that he would not give me any more money. I saw Mrs. Clark and my husband go upstairs together, and come down, and I heard her say to my husband, that Charley could see that something was the matter with her. She said, 'Don't have her home again.' My husband said he must, for I was his wife, and he must keep me. She said she would lose her life before she should give up my husband's company. My husband has given her a shawl."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller of No. 7, Belinda Terrace, Canonbury. Last Saturday, 3d July, I was in Bishopsgate Street, about a quarter or twenty minutes past 8 o'clock—I took a cab opposite Bishopsgate Church, and told the cabman to drive me to No. 7, Belinda Cottages—three or four minutes before that I had met Mr. Day, and he gave me a sovereign; I gave it to the cabman through the trap door, and asked him to get it changed, and give me the difference—Mr. Day was not in the cab when I got in, but he got in two or three minutes afterwards—the cabman drove to a public house in Acorn Street, 150 or 200 yards from where I got in, he went in, and came out and said, "I shall not drive you any farther, you only gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—at that time a policeman came up, and my friend Day—I said I gave you a sovereign, and I shall give you in custody—I said, "Give me my sovereign, that I gave you to get change"—he denied it, and said that I had only given him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I had not 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I met Mr. Morgan in Bishopsgate Street, I was standing at the door of Mr. Case, the tobacconist, when he passed by—I gave him a sovereign, put him into a Hansom's cab, closed the door and the cab drove off—I was rather in a hurry to save my train from Shoreditch, but I saw the cab pass me, and I saw Mr. Morgan's hand pass through the top of the cab and saw the cabman take something of him; a man behind me said, "Your friend has given the cabman a sovereign"—the cab drove round Acorn Street, and I saw a crowd assembling, I went up and said in the prisoner's presence, "Where is the sovereign I gave you;" he said I gave it to the cabman to change, and he will not give it me back, and will not drive any further—"I demanded it of the cabman, and he refused to give it up"—I asked him for his ticket and he refused it—I saw his number on the back of the cab, and then he gave me his ticket—a policeman then came and took him—having only just time to save my train I ran away; the prisoner said, "I have not received any money at all—Acorn Street is only about 200 yards from where he got in, or I could not have overtaken the cab.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H.</hi> 193). I was on duty, in plain clothes, at the corner of Acorn Street, on this Saturday night, and saw the prisoner there—there was a mob and a cab; the mob said that the cabman had got a sovereign belonging to the man; the prisoner, was the cabman; he was then getting on the box, at the back of the cab; a gentleman followed him, and the cabman stopped in a few yards; the prisoner got down, and I followed with the mob; another cabman followed close behind, and I saw the prisoner with a sovereign in his hand, in this way, passing it to the other cabman—I caught hold of his hand, and the other man's hand, saying, "I am a police constable;" the other cabman then said, "I have nothing to do with it."—I released his hand, and took hold of both the prisoner's hands, and said, "Where is the sovereign?" he said, "I have got a sovereign in my pocket, but that belongs to me"—it was not in either of his hands, I found it in his pocket, and he said, "It is my own"—when I commenced searching him, he said, "If I have got any gold about me, it does not belong to me, it belongs to that gentleman," meaning the prosecutor—I found this sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said, "Here is the sovereign;" he said, "Well, it does not belong to me"—I found 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides, which I gave up to his wife, as she wanted money.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH PARSONS. I am the wife of Read Parsons. I did not miss these articles till the Police-man brought them - these are my window curtains and knives and forks - I imagine they had been taken from a chest; I had seen the curtain about a month before - I cannot say when I had seen the knives and forks: the prisoner worked for me as a <rs id="t18300527-62-deflabel332" type="occupation">charwoman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What sort of a curtain was this? A. An old one; I took the sheet to be a government one.</p>

            . I searched another room, and found these things up the chimney there - I asked the prisoner, who was in the room, about them; she said she knew nothing of them - I asked what place she washed at; she said at Chelsea-hospital - I went there, and saw the witness; the sheets were marked as government property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not tell you that she had worked at Mrs. Parsons? A. Yes - there were three persons in the room when I found them.</p>

            . On the 12th of May, about five o'clock, I was standing in the court; the prosecutrix came and asked where Mrs. Savage was - I went in with her, and found three knives and forks up the kitchen chimney of the prisoner's house; the prisoner was at that time in custody - I took them to the office, but did not tell the prisoner I had found them; Mrs. Parsons owned the knives and forks when they tumbled down the chimney.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe she has been very kind to you? A. I was a pensioner, and she had some children to nurse for me, but I paid her for them.</p>
               <p>MRS. PARSONS. These are my knives and forks - I have no mark on them, but they are made by Underwood - Varley lived as cook with me for a fortnight; she did not suit me - she had left me a few weeks - these things were very likely taken while she was there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer E.</hi>) On Tuesday night, 3rd January, I was in Euston Koad, with Chamberlain, another detective—I saw the three prisoners, in company with a drunken sailor, who afterwards turned out to be O'Hara—I watched them, and saw them go into the "Euston Tavern," at the comer of Judd Street—they remained there about a minute—Kelly and Roach came out together—I placed myself in a urinal, close by the door, and I heard Roach say to Kelly "He says he is going to New York; he must have some <hi rend="italic">chips</hi> to do that"—Kelly said "Then go in and bring him out"—Roach went in, and in about half a minute, Cann, O'Hara, and Roach, came out of the house—Kelly said "Old fellow, you are going to New York, so am I, come with me"—he then took him by the arm, and walked across into Judd Street, and just as he got into the middle of the street, I saw Kelly place his left hand in O'Hara's right hand coat pocket—O'Hara said "You blackguard, you are robbing me "—Kelly then struck him in the body with his right hand, and knocked him down, and his face came to the ground—the two women were walking behind—O'Hara cried "Police!"—I ran and caught Kelly, and detained him—the two girls looked round and saw me and Chamberlain, and ran away—I was within three yards of O'Hara when he was knocked down, Cham<lb></lb>berlain was behind me—we were in plain clothes—a constable in uniform, <hi rend="italic">E</hi> 217, came up at the time, and I gave Kelly into his custody, and said "Be careful of that man, he has got something in his left hand, see that he</p>

               <p>does not throw it away "—he was taken to the station, and Chamberlain and I took O'Hara there, and charged him with being drunk and incapable—at the station, I saw the constable open Kelly's hand, and take out four penny pieces—I then went to a public-house, in the Euston Road, and there saw Cann—I said "Annie, I want you"—she said "I have not done anything"—I told her I should charge her with being concerned with Kelly and Roach, in assaulting and attempting to rob a sailor, in Judd Street—she said "Strike me blind! I don't thieve! I am a prostitute, but you know I don't thieve "—I said "I know you do thieve, and you have been convicted for it times"—I took her to the station, absent for the divisional surgeon to examine O'Hara—there was a slight cut in his face, it was covered with blood, but nothing very serious—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found in his trowsers pocket—he was fined 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. next day for being drunk—his right hand coat pocket was torn down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The sailor was quite drunk—when I first saw him, the two women were leading him, and Kelly was walking behind—when they came out of the house, I might be four or five yards from them—when he was knocked down, I was not more than three yards from them—O'Hara was too drunk to charge them—he said, next morning, that he missed a bottle of rum from his pocket.</p>

Mr. Chamberlain, I know nothing of it; I saw the man lying down, but I don't know anything of it"—she was taken to the station—at the station the women said they had not been in the "Euston Tavern" that night, and had not had anything to drink with O'Hara.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the marshalmen of the city of London. - A. Yes. On Saturday, the 14th of October, between six and seven in the evening, I met the prisoner in Aldersgate-street, I asked him what he had got in the sack, he said a few beans, he had brought them from St. John-street, and was going to take them to Wood-street. Hawkins was with me; I told him we were officers and would have the truth; he then said, he hoped we would not hurt him, he had a sick wife and three small children; he had got the beans of

            . I am horse keeper to Mr. Willan. Last Saturday morning the prisoner applied for the key of the granary for some bran to make a marsh for a sick horse. I gave him the key, the bran is in the same room with the beans. I told him not to touch the beans; we have some of the same sort at home as these that were found on the prisoner.</p>

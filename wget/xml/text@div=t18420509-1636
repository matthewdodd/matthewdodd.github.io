                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, and live in Old-street-road; On the evening of the 2nd of May, about six o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a halfpenny worth of nails—I served him—he paid for them—he was at the further end of the counter which there was no oc<lb></lb>casion for—as he was leaving I had suspicion, and stopped him two or three doors off, and saw something under his jacket—I said "You rascal what have you got there?"—he said he was going to take it home to show his mother—he had not asked for anything to show his mother—I took the parcel of ten padlocks from him, and gave him in charge—they are my padlocks, they were in the shop before he-came in—I saw them there that day on the counter.</p>

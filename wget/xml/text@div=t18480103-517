He would have been seventeen years old on 28th Jan.—on 5th Nov. he had his supper, and went out between nine and ten o'clock—in a short time Caroline Meritt came and told me something—I went, and found him sitting in a chair at Mr. Reed's, at Plaistow—he was crying very much, and his face was swelling—there was a blow on the left side of his nose, across the cheek—we got him home—it was a very short distance—Hannah Reed put her hand under his arm, and I helped him also—he went to work next day, but the day after that he was getting very bad, he could not sit down; he had to lie on a bed—he went to work for eight days afterwards, bur complained every day when he came home—he could scarcely sit up—he had shown no illness before—he had no diffi<lb></lb>culty in walking, before 5th Nov.—after eight days he took to his bed and remained there till he died; spitting blood, and passing blood downwards—his work was going out with horses, and going on errands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I have heard the statement of Catharine Mahon—I think the kick which the deceased received in his side might have caused his death—any degree of violence would accelerate his death in the state I found his heart and body—I first saw him on 18th Nov., he was then suffering from fever and delirium—I was not informed until 21st that he had been ill-used—he complained of pain in his right side, and had a blister put there—he did not complain of his left breast till five days before his death—he died on 5th Dec.—I opened his body—there was an abscess as large as my fist on the right side of the chest, between the ribs and the lungs—it was full of purulent matter—there was inflammation of the heart, and a serous infusion into the pericardium—one of the lungs was healthy—the right one was inflamed—the intestines did not exhibit symptoms of inflamma<lb></lb>tion—the immediate cause of death was the inflammation of the heart—fever</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801030104"></xptr>
               <p>and inflammation would produce that—the boy was always healthy before—he was never well after he received the kick—a severe blow on the right side would, in my opinion, produce inflammation, and lead to the dis<lb></lb>ease which ended in his death—a boy like that would be more likely to have inflammtion than an adult—he would suffer more readily from violence—there was nothing in what I discovered, to exclude the idea that death was caused by violence.</p>

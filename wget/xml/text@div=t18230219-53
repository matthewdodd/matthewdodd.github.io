On the morning of the 5th of February, at a quarter past ten o'clock, I was on the drawing-room stairs, and heard somebody in the passage; I looked back, and saw the prisoner. The door had been shut - I cannot swear that the latch had caught. I had seen the outer door not a moment before, but did not examine it. The persons coming into Mr. Grisewood's office, came through there; Mr. Grisewood pays the taxes, and keeps an office in the house. I saw the prisoner go into the office, and take down a great coat, and put it in his basket; I came down to him, and he asked if I wanted to buy any pens - I said No, but he had a great coat in his basket; he denied it. I went outside, shut the door, and called the hostler, who took him; he had thrown the coat up on the nail again. I am sure I saw him take it off the nail, and put it into his basket.</p>

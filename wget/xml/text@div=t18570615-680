I saw a light in the chapel a little after 12 o'clock on this night—I looked in at the window, and saw two men walking about—one of them had got a light—I did not see who they were—I told the schoolmaster, and we both looked in at the window, and saw them in the pulpit—the prisoners are a great deal like the men—I sprang a rattle—the policeman came, and Bone was taken close by the chapel window, which was open, inside the railings which surround the chapel—there was no open gate—he must have got over the railings.</p>

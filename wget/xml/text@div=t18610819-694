                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service as a domestic servant, at 95, Gloucester-place, Kentish-town—I believe She had given my wife notice to leave, but I was then in the country—I went from home on the Monday previous, to 19th July, and on the Wednesday following, my wife came to me at Ramsgate—I returned on Saturday morning, 20th July, by the express train—I went into my bed-room and found the bedstead, the bed-clothing, the bed and part of the mattress burnt; and the paper behind the head of the bedstead was also burnt away, and some sheets and other articles out of the drawers were partially burnt—the wood work over the cupboard was burnt, it had been on fire, and the room door being open, the wind had apparently blown the flames round the room and ignited the Venetian blinds—the webbing of the blinds was burnt, and the blinds had fallen down—one pane of glass was broken, and thirteen or fourteen cracked.</p>

I live next door but one to the prosecutor—on the evening of 19th July, I saw some smoke coming out of his back bed-room, and I saw the servant (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) come out of the house and run down the garden with a bundle—she got through the hedge with it, but did not take it with her—I afterwards took it and gave it to the policeman.</p>

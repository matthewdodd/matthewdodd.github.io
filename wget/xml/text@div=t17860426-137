               <p>Can you recollect, whether the person at that time applied to you as being a representative of the executor to the will, or as coming from him in any other character? - He applied as executor; because there was no power of attorney, only the probate of the will.</p>

               <p>For instance, could you tell, at this distance of time, whether it was a probate, or letters of administration to the seaman? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether there was an objection to the administration, or the probate, which it was you do not recollect? - No.</p>
               <p>Might it not be, then, quite consistent with all your recollection of the subject, that that person might come as his attorney to enquire whether the objection was removed? - They certainly came for payment.</p>
               <p>It was on or about the 4th of April? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many days might you officiate for Mr. Slade? - Four days in that week.</p>
               <p>Might there not be other men in the four days? - There might; but I do not recollect that there were; I am not so perfect in my recollection, as to say that they were not.</p>

            . I am a waiter at this house. The prisoner was there; I did not see him go out. Dockrill missed his bundle. I went out, and took it from under the prisoner's jacket, two or three hundred yards off, and told him it was not his. I do not think he said anything. He was taken in two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say "You may have it. I took it, supposing it belonged to some of the young men" - A. I do not recollect hearing him say so, he made no resistance, and was rather the worse for liquor - he had been drinking with four or five companions.</p>

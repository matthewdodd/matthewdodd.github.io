                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, at 229, Regent-street, and deal with Messrs. Welling and Co., salt-merchants. The prisoner has been in the habit of calling for orders—on 14th Aug. the prisoner called for orders, and applied for payment of my account to Messrs. Welling—I said I was very busy, and asked him to call on Monday, which was our pay-day—he called on the Monday, and I gave him this check, which has since been returned to me paid—he gave me this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Berry, bought of Welling and Co. goods amounting to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> After I got the order on the Thursday, Mr. Berry said he had an account to settle with Mr. Smith, and I explained to him that Mr. Smith had purchased Mr. Welling's business, and that he would give him credit for any time. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was not my proposition to pay it; be applied for it <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE SAMUEL BENSTEAD</hi>. I am manager to Mr. Benjamin Smith, who carries on business, under the name of Welling and Co.

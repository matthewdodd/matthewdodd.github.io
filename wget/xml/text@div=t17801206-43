               <p>I get my living by carrying goods with a horse and cart for different tradesmen. On the 3d of December I had in my cart a sack with several lasts and three wicker baskets which contained some pattens.</p>
               <p>How much were they worth together? - Ten pounds. I left my cart in Bishopsgate-street, opposite the London Tavern, whilst I went to the King's-arms; I might be gone about five minutes. Coming back I met my cart in <placeName id="t17801206-43-crimeloc221">Leadenhall-street, within six or seven doors of the Kings Arms</placeName>

I seised him within five or six doors of the corner.</p>

               <p>I was coming to Guildhall to see the lottery drawn. I saw a parcel of boys coming along with this cart; they asked me the way to the Green-yard; I said any body will shew you the way. Then this man came up and knocked my hat off my head; in my fright I ran away. I was stopped and taken to the Compter; I never was near the cart.</p>

               <p>I was going on an errand for my mistress. Facing the London Tavern I saw several boys about the cart; they were talking of taking the horse and cart to the Green-yard as there was no owner to it; I saw a person in an apron holding the horse; I saw the prosecutor meet him in Leadenhall-street, and strike at him with a whip or a stick.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

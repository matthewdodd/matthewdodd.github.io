                  </hi>. I am a purchaser of miscellaneous property, and live close by St. Mark's-place, Kennington. On Saturday, the 11th of Feb., I was out between one and two in the morning—I had not been drinking very much—I was in the neighbourhood of Westminster, and entered the King's Head public-house in Orchard-street—I was alone at first, but was afterwards in company with Eliza Spillard—I am not aware whether she went in with me—she might have followed me into the house—I do not recollect being in her company, only from her statement—I saw all the four prisoners at that public-house, and they asked me to treat them—I think it was Bassett first asked me—I treated them, after much solicitation—they said, "Will you not pay even for a pint of beer?"—I said, "I do not mind a pot, as you have been out of work many weeks—I am sorry to see you so distressed"—I threw down some money—I do not know whether it was sixpence or a shilling, and they had some beer—the weather was exceedingly bad that night—I waited at the King's Head probably three quarters of an hour, during which time I sat down, I am told, in the tap-room—I do not know whether it was the parlour or tap-room—I recollect sitting down—I remember leaving the house by myself—after I left the house I was molested by four or five persons, two men and two or three women, and it is very probable that Spillard may have been among them—I was laid hold of on each side of the arm by some man on each side, and I was pushed down Union-court, and into No. 9, I believe it is—I made some great resistance—the door was open, and I was forced in—there was no light in the passage—after I was forced in I was laid hold of by the clothes, and dragged, or rather forced up stairs into the front room, first floor—the first person I had any communication with was Mary Bassett—they were all of a gang together at the time I was forced up stairs—it was in the dark, and I could not observe Bassett then, but she afterwards brought a candle, and I think offered me some liquor—I forget whether I partook of it; I am not certain—I perfectly recollect Bassett—I identified her in the morning—I remained there perhaps till eleven or twelve o'clock in the day; I cannot say the exact time—I found I was in a very low bad place—I said to Bassett, "Let me out of this house; what shall I give you?"—I gave her some silver, something of little consequence, for her to let me out of the house, which she said she would do—I heard a noise below—she said it was lodgers quarrelling—I heard some screaming—she had pre<lb></lb>viously prevailed on me, as much as possible, to lie on a bedstead, which I refused to do—she went down stairs, saying, "I will go and see all clear"—she returned almost immediately and closed the door after her—I heard some<lb></lb>body outside walking up stairs at a very quick step, and Fitzgerald rushed into the room, and said, "What does this man want here?—you have done me an injury"—I said, "For what reason?"—he asserted something similar to certify that I had been connected with his wife—he said to Baesett, "Has he got any money?"—she told him it was in my pocket—he then laid his hand on me—I said, "I can give, but I will not be robbed"—I dashed</p>

               <p>myself from him, and a struggle ensued—I told him I could not fight much, but I would try what I could do—I was making a rush at him, but I was struck violently on the head with some instrument—I cannot swear that he struck me—I was so close within his grasp, and it was done so suddenly, that I was thunderstruck, almost stunned—another scuffle ensued to get me out at the door—there were two other men at least at the door—they tried to get me out at the door, and I was pitched on my head down stairs, which caused concussion of the brain, and great bleeding happened afterwards—the cut is not closed yet—the bone of the head was fractured by some instru<lb></lb>ment—a jerk of the neck caused the vessels to break, and I lost a great deal of blood—I bled the greater part of the morning on the stairs—I recollect M'Grath hitting me several times, down stairs as well as up stairs—he is the man that stood at the door—I am not positive whether it was M'Grath or Fitsgerald struck me with some instrument—M'Grath was standing at the bed-room door—the door had then been opened with the intention of getting me out, or throwing me down stairs—Fitzgerald is the man who fought me first, and took my purse—my clothes were taken afterwards—I no doubt had my clothes on when I went into the room. I did not go to bed at all—after losing a great quantity of blood I recovered from the sort of faintness in which I had been from the stunning blow I had received, and found I was lying on a flight of steps, very wet and dirty—I raised myself step by step till I came to the first floor door; I tapped at it, but could get no answer—I said if they would fetch a doctor, I would forgive them—however, I received no answer—I pushed the door, went in, and asked them for God's sake to let me only sit or lie down, and I laid till it was near day-light—Fitzgerald then got out of the bed—he was lying with a woman, and on the other side was a woman who is now in the hospital, who had the typhus fever—a more horrid sight could not be—the. woman he was in bed with is not here—after I was robbed he weet out of the house, and returned with some woman, and on that bedstead I asked to lie down till it was light—when I recovered myself on the stairs, on getting up, I found my boots were gone, also my stock, great coat, and hat—I had my trowsers and waistcoat on—I had no under coat—I had but one coat on, and that was taken—it was a tight coat—about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver was also taken, a purse, keys, some little odds and ends, and a silk pocket handkerchief, which was afterwards found—Fitzgerald got up between the lights, after he had been passing the greater part of the night with this woman—he said to me, two or three times over, "You b----why don't you get up?"—I said, "Let me lay, I don't do you any harm;" and I said to the woman, "What is he getting up for?"—the, woman said, "He is only getting up to go to his work at Pimlico; he works at Pimlico basin"—she got up herself about five minutes after he got up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any more of M'Grath in the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He made a most fiendish countenance at me in the outset—I was hit several times on the stair-case—they were in and out all night, but I cannot recollect who the parties were—at last they all left the room except the poor woman ill in bed—some woman came into the room, and I said, "Here is a woman dying; for God's sake, go to the hospital, and get her in"—Bassett was in the room the first part of the night—she did not sleep in the room—I did not see her—I do not think she did—there could have been no place for her to sleep, unless it was on the floor—Bassett was in the room at the time I was beaten and received the blow on my head—she stood back behind the door—Fitzgerald came in as she stood, and she said, "Here he comes"—she knew that he was coming, no doubt—Iam sure she was in the room when I received the blow—I saw a light-haired woman, I cannot positively swear it was Nolan—I cannot say whether that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184304030056"></xptr>
               <p>light-haired woman was in the room at the time I received the blow—she may have slipped out—I was too much agitated in a scene of that kind to pay par<lb></lb>ticular attention—I remained in the house, I think it must have been till eleven or twelve o'clock—several persons came in in the course of the morning—Bassett sat at the fire, with a child on her knee, with a diseased head—I asked if I could get my great-coat—a dark woman, who is not in custody, told me, if I said a word, they could prove I had broken into the house—after several people coming in, from curiosity, to see if I was still there and still alive, a little boy peeped in—I asked him to fetch me a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which he did immediately—I was covered all over with blood—I had then ventured down stairs, seeing that the house was deserted—everybody had gone out of it—when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came, I walked into the street, across the yard, throught the wet, in my stockings and shirt sleeves—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man came round to me, and gave me a piece of carpet or a horse-cloth to put under my feet, but I put it over my shoulders and head—I was extremely cold, and in a sort of <hi rend="italic">treme</hi>—he drove me home—for two days I was extremely delirious and foolish—I do not believe I was in my proper senses—I went to Mr. Barker, a surgeon, to have my head examined—I could feel that I had a serious wound on my head—I was under medical treatment about three weeks—I was confined to my bed nearly seven weeks—I did not find my handkerchief myself—I have been asked since if a handkerchief corresponded with mine, and I have five or six like it—I compared it with them—I cannot say it is mine except by com<lb></lb>parison and the pattern—there may be many thousands of the same—it has no mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett.</hi> I never saw the gentleman in my life till next morning; he never gave me any money; I came down next morning with a baby, hearing a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> in the house, and said, "You look very bad, are you the man that fell down the stairs?"—he said, "Yes, but I was very tipsy;" I asked him if I should wash his head. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She had a child on her knee at the fire, but she never spoke one word to me, and she very shortly retired—I have no re<lb></lb>collection of her offering to wash my head—I do not think she did, but I would not swear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett. Q.</hi> Did I ill-treat you, or take anything belonging to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You instructed Fitzgerald to take the money from my pocket, and said, "Take it all," and he took it all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Grath. Q.</hi> Can you swear positively that I struck you with some weapon outside the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not swear that you did, but one or the other did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald. Q.</hi> What time did the boy peep into the room, as you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say the hour—I think he was the last one that came in to look, just to see if I was there—I have seen him since—he said he lived in the house—it was about half-past eleven o'clock when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man took me away—the boy was not gone for him five minutes, and he took me away directly—I think there were not more than two men <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me up stairs—there was atleast two or three women—there were other men in the house—somebody pushed me behind—whether they were men or women I cannot tell—I presume it was four or five o'clock when you got up—it was nearly getting daylight—the woman you slept with was a young woman—I have seen her since at Queen-square—she got up about five minutes after you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a girl of the town. I live at No. 18, New Tothill-street, Westminster. On the night, between Friday the 10th and Saturday the 11th of Feb. last, I met the prosecutor opposite the Horse Guards about ten o'clock—I never knew him before—I went with him up the Strand to an oyster shop, and then to the Pine Apple, in Hungerford-market—we had</p>

               <p>drink there—we afterwards went to the King's Head, in Orchard-street—we got there about half-past one, or it might be twenty minutes to two in the morning—I saw the two female prisoners there—I did not see the men—I knew the females by sight, by seeing them about Westminster—they were there when I went in with Mr. Prebble, and they joined us—they asked Mr. Prebble to treat them—he said they were a different party, he did not know them—Bassett said if he did not treat them they would <hi rend="italic">muzzle</hi> him, and his <hi rend="italic">Moll</hi> too, and with many words he treated them—when he had treated me with glass of something to drink he came out of the Ring's Head, to the bottom of the steps—Bassett and Nolan followed him out, and asked him if he wanted a room—the gentleman said he would have no objection to going and staying an hour or two with me if I would like to come, and they came down Union-court—that is right opposite Tothill-street—the gentleman and me, and the two women turned down Union-court, one on each side of us—the gentleman was tipsy—I went to turn round to go back again as the gentle<lb></lb>man refused going into the house, and saw the two male prisoners behind following us down—that was the first time I recollect seeing them that night—I did not see them in the public-house—when I turned round the two men dragged the gentleman into the house, and the two girls dragged me in—Nolan shut and fastened the door—the two men then went up stairs, and Bassett took the gentleman, and helped him up stairs—the two men went up stairs before the gentleman—the gentleman did not appear to be willing to go up stairs—he called out to bring up the young person that was with him, to bring up his lady—Nolan held me in the passage, and told me the room was not convenient for me to go into it—Bassett came down stairs again in about three minutes with a wine glass of something for me to drink—I was still in the passage—she told me to drink that or else I should be sick—I refused it once, but she put it to my mouth, and I drank it—Nolan was in the passage by the side of me holding me up by one arm—I had been drinking a little, but was not tipsy—I drank it because they told me to drink it, or else I should be sick—I was frightened—about two minutes after I had drunk it I found myself quite insensible, and very sleepy—I was not able to support myself—Bassett and Nolan then began to take my clothes off—they untied my cloak first—I was in a helpless state—I was standing with my back against the wall in the passage—no one had hold of me after they gave me the drink—I remained on my feet all the time, but felt very sleepy—Bassett took my cloak off—they took all my clothes from me except my shift—in the morning I found myself lying in the passage in a great pool of water, very wet and only my shift on—my gown was by my side—I had on my shoes and stockings when I went into the house—also a petticoat, bon<lb></lb>net, and cloak—Bassett said when she took them off, "You little cow, you don't keep these fine clothes"—it was about half-past seven when I awoke—I was very stiff from the bruises, and the ill usage that I had had—I did not hear any disturbance up stairs—I was overpowered by what I had taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the King's Head, Orchard-street, Westminster. My house is open late every night except Saturday—I know Fitzgerald quite well, and M'Grath—I saw them at my house on Friday night, the 10th of Feb., between one and two o'clock, with several other men and women, all in company together—I recollect seeing Bassett that night—I cannot recollect Nolan—she might have been there, but I am not able to swear to her—I have not been subpœnaed or bound over, but have come to state what I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what time of night did you see Bassett there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were there the most part of the night, till, I should say, about two o'clock, but I cannot swear positively to the exact time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett. Q.</hi> Did you see me accost any one to ask for anything to drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember your asking to be treated, but I recollect Mr. Prebble treating you with some gin and water—I did not see you with Spillard that I recollect—I do not remember Spillard being there—I heard that she was, but I do not remember seeing her myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Grath. Q.</hi> Did you see me in Mr. Prebble's company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, but you wanted to take two glasses of gin and water into the tap-room with you, and I would not allow you to do so unless you brought the money first, as is our usual custom—I afterwards took the gin and water to Mr. Prebble in the tap-room, and he paid me for it—I cannot say whether you wore a cont that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Grath.</hi> I was drinking there with my sister, and she sent me for the glasses—did not my sister pay for two glasses of gin and water at the bar <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not know his sister—she might have come there, but I did not know her to be his sister.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald.

               <p>No. 10, Union-court, Orchard-street—Bassett and Nolan lived there at that time—I slept in the second floor back-room—early on the Saturday morning I heard a noise in the house—I was in bed at the time—I had known Bassett for about three weeks, and was able to distinguish her voice—she came down to us in the room, and told us they had a <hi rend="italic">swell</hi> and another young woman in the house, and asked George if he would come up-stairs—two other boys, named George and Robert Cuttle, were in the room—George is about sixteen years old—he put on his clothes and went up-stairs—there is another floor above us—she did not say in what part of the honse the parties were—I know M'Grath—he had been in the house that night, very late, after I had been in bed, but before I heard Bassett's voice, he came to the room where I was in bed, and asked George what business he had with the gentleman's coat, and he took it away from him—that was after the noise, and after Bassett had been to my room—George went up-stairs when Bassett called him, and when he came down he had a coat, a pair of boots, and a hat—he brought them into the room where I and the other boys were sleeping—it was after that that M'Grath came into the room, and asked George what business he had with the gentleman's coat—George did not make any answer, and M'Grath took the coat from him, and took it away—about ten minutes afterwards he came in for the boots, and said the house was going to be searched—I cannot tell the time at all accurately—I saw Nolan in the room that night—I do not know the hour—she brought in a mantle, a bonnet, and a boa, laid them on our bed, and said, "George, will you let these be here till the morning?"—George afterwards took those things away in the morning, and took them up to her—she used to sleep up-stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">M'Grath.

The prisoners know I never saw the woman in my life till I was taken into custody. On the 18th of February two policemen came into my room; they never said what they came about, but began to search my room. I did not know they were policemen. Jane Ingram and Lloyd swore to me and Mary Cain, a young woman who was washing in my room, and said we were the two women that beat the young woman; she directly contradicted him, and told the policeman that belongs to the Westminster division, that she had only been out of prison on the Tuesday; he said he did not think she had been out long; when they took us to the station, Lloyd went over to the fireplace to Ingram, and said, "Swear to the tail one." I asked what they had to swear to me for; they made no answer. Bradley, Mary Cain, and the young man went away all together. The inspector asked me if I knew what I was taken for; he dare say I did—I said I did not; he said, "For robbing that young woman." I said, "Where was she robbed?" he said, "In your place"—I said I knew nothing of it; I heard of John Fitz robbing a young woman at No. 7, Union-court, but I knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>I never saw the young woman till I was taken into custody. Nolan knows I was not there when she was robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Nolan's Defence.</hi> I was not there; John <hi rend="italic">Fitz</hi> is the man that did the robbery; he and her went down the court together. About half an hour afterwards I was going down the court, and met <hi rend="italic">Fitz</hi> with the bonnet, mantle, and boa.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">M'Grath's Defence.</hi> I know nothing of the charge, and don't know either of the prisoners now at the bar; I never saw them before. When the boy was brought to Queen-square, the man there said, laughing at me, "Here is a boy that will do for you." I never made any remark that I know of; I might, but I don't recollect it. One says I had the coat on my baok, another says in a bundle; one swears I forced the man into the passage; another says I did not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald's Defence.</hi> Mr. Prebble states, that when he first entered the public-house in Orchard-street, he saw me, M'Grath, the two female prisoners, and Spillard, there all together; that he entered the public-house by himself. I hope you will bear that in mind, and that we applied to him for something to drink, saying we were poor, and out of work, and that he gave us 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get a pot of beer with; that he stopped there about three quarters of an hour, and went out; and as he went out, he was accosted by three women and three men; me, the prisoners, another woman, and another man. He says that Spillard was one of the women, that they enticed him down the court, and we followed him; that he did not like to go into the house; and that Bassett laid hold of the collar of his coat, and dragged him in; that M'Grath and another man shoved him up the stairs into the first floor; he states that he was in the dark till Bassett fetched a light to him, and he said, "I will give you some money to let me go out." The next witness, Spillard, swears that she met him at the Horse Guards at ten o'clock in the evening; it was at one o'clock, he says, that he came to the public-house, in Orchard-street, by himself; she says she accompanied him to an oyster room in the Strand, then to the Pine Apple, in Hungerford-market, and then to the King's Head, in Orchard-street; they called for something to drink there; she states that the two female prisoners induced him to treat them, which he did; but as for me and M'Grath she says she never saw us there; she never saw us till she was at the bottom of the court, when she was about to turn back again from the door of No. 10; she says she met us there, just by the door, and we would not let her go away; she then said the female prisoners came and forced her into the passage, and the gentleman was in the passage all the while; that we went up stairs before the gentleman, and Bassett helped the gentleman up stairs, while Nolan held her in the passage by the arm, with the door shut. The third witness, the gentleman that had the twelve months' imprisonment, then states, that he was coming home at half-past one, and saw the two female prisoners take the gentleman down the court, and then come out and take the female in, and then heard us say, "Make haste, and take him up stairs, and we will be up directly." I hope you will bear in mind that there are three different statements: the boy states nothing at all concerning me; he never saw me; and Jane Ingram states that she saw me and M'Grath come out of the house, one after the other; the gentleman states that he was in the first floor; and two other witnesses state he was in the second pair; when the prosecutor was so much in liquor when he came out of the public-house, why did he go down this court? why not refuse at first? He was intoxicated when he came out of the public-house, and after he got down to the bottom of the court, as he states, he was sober. I do not think a man can be sober when he is out drinking all the</p>

               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner with stealing twenty five pound of iron - A. I lost a deal of property.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you had from your boy did you go to this place and see these pieces of iron where they ought not to be - A. I did. On last Friday week the prisoner and his partner were out in Holborn fixing some bars; he and his partner were came home in the evening, I was sitting up stairs in my room, my boy informed me that he had taken away the iron under his coat; I pursued him as far as Saffron hill, I could not catch him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your iron - A. No. I went to Hatton Garden office and got an officer; when the officer arrived at his lodgings the prisoner had just got home; I charged him with stealing a bar of iron, he denied it; I told the officer to take him in custody. I have never found the bar again. When I looked under the stairs at my own house the large bar was gone and the small one left.</p>

I told my master immediately of it, and he and I pursued the prisoner; he got out of sight. At Hatton Garden office I told him I saw him take it, he denied it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Hedges. When had you last seen the bars of iron - A. About five minutes before he came home I had seen both; I looked after he was gone, the large one was gone.</p>

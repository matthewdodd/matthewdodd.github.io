                  </hi>. I live at Red Cross—street, Southwark. On the 6th of May I and Charles Evans were at the top of Red Cross-street, and saw the prisoners together at Mr. Williamson's shop—the window was broken—I had not seen that before they were there—there was a tea—chest placed against the opening—I saw Gibbons shove the chest away, put his band</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Aldersgate-street. On the morning of February 4th, I came out of my house about 1 o'clock, in company with Thomas Henry Mason—we were going out to supper—we were going along Aldersgate-street, when the prisoner and a companion ran up against us, and she fastened her arms round me—I saw nothing at that time—some time after my companion said there was a policeman coming up, and then she fell down, and pretended to be drunk—she was well able to stand before—then I observed that my watch ribband was hanging out of my waistcoat pocket—she had taken my watch from the ribband—the ring was left upon the ribband—I tried to pick her up previous to seeing that; then I let her remain, and the policeman came up—the watch was found down the area grating—I charged her with taking it—she said she had not—I saw the watch down the grating when the policeman turned on his light—I am sure it was my watch, and it was safe when I came out—she asked me to go with her, and I said, "Certainly not"——my companion is younger than myself.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you not with two females when I came up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not ask you to go to a brothel with me—you threw your arms round me, and wanted me to go along with you, and I said, "Certainly not;" and then my companion said there was a policeman coming, and you fell drunk—I was not doing anything indecent to you—I suppose the reason my companion said there was a policeman coming, was because he did not want a disturbance—it was about ten yards from my door where yon took hold of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Mr. Reade on this morning—we were going out to look for some supper—when we got into Aldersgate-street, we met two girls coming down the road—they shoved up against Mr. Reade, and one took hold of me, and one of Mr. Reade—I danced about a little with the one that took hold of me, and then I said there was a policeman coming, and the other one instantly dropped down on the ground, and ap<lb></lb>peared as if she was fainting—my young lady walked away—when the policeman came up, my companion said something about his watch, and then she was down on the ground—the police constable came up, and said, "You had better be careful, or you will be robbed "—she must have heard that, for he said it quite loud—my companion said, "She has got my watch," and she said she had not—the police constable instantly turned on his light and looked on the pavement, and then down in the grating, where we saw it—she had the opportunity of putting it down the grating.</p>

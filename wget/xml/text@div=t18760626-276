                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Holland, of the Pavilion Tavern, North Woolwich—oil Thursday evening, 6th June, the prisoner was a bar<lb></lb>man under me; he had only come the day before—I cleared the till several times; the last time I examined it was at 10.20—there were two half-crowns there and a florin, and some small silver—I kept a watch upon him, and in two or three minutes saw him serve a man with some drink, who gave him a sixpence, which the prisoner put in the till, and gave the man two separate shillings and some halfpence—the man left, and I said to the prisoner "What did that person give you?"—he said "A half-crown"—I said "That is false; he only gave you 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I went to the till, and found there only the two half-crowns which I had seen previously—I informed Mr. Baker, the head cellarman, and Highall the under cellarman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The premises are not large—there are several bars on the establishment and in the grounds, and several persons serve—there is only one till where I am, which serves for all the persons in the bar—only the prisoner and I served there—after looking in the till I went on serving—we were very busy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the under cellarman—Baker made a communi<lb></lb>cation to me, and I went into the bar and saw a man come in who was not served with anything—the prisoner put his hand in the till, and gave some silver into the man's hand—I cannot say how much, or whether it was large coin or small coin, but it was silver, and he went out with it—I told the prisoner that he had given the man change without his having anything to drink—he said that the man gave him a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, but I am certain he did not.</p>

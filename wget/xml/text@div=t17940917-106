               <p>Q. Did you observe these two lads together before? - They were both in company together, both following Mr. Crosby and another gentleman that was along with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There were a great number of Persons of course assembled on this occasion, a great crowd? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen a great number of other persons in the course of the day that you had been obliged to watch? - Not that I know of; I watched these two particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not acquainted with these prisoners before? - I knew them before, and I believe a great many more besides.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor got his handkerchief again? - I have got it now, and have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>- Court. You had known them before? I had seen them at a house, in Field-lane before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know nothing more than the last witness has related; I suppose it is my handkerchief, but I never swore to it, nor cannot; there is no mark on it; I believe it is mine, and I had no handkerchief in my pocket when the witness informed me that my pocket was picked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is a very common pattern indeed? - It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thompson. I look upon it to be of no use to speak any thing, for I look upon him to be a man that will say any thing. I have had friends here every day, waiting for my trial; I don't know whether they are here now or no.</p>

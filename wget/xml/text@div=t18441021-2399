                  </hi>. I live at Colham-green, near Hillingdon. I lived there on the 29th of Sept. last, in a house belonging to Miss Perry—I was the tenant, and lived there with my wife and family—on Sunday morning, the 29th of Sept., I was aroused at half-past two by the policeman—I got up and went down stairs, opened the door and went out—the policeman said, "All the back part of your place is on fire"—I ran to the back of the house, and the shed at the back of the house was all on fire—the shed leaned to the house—it was the shed which I occupied with the house—it was all burned down, and two carts were burned also, a little one and a big one—it was not down when I got out—it was all in flames, and the two carts were burning—I laid hold of the shafts of one cart and pulled it out all in flames—the shed was covered in at one side and one end—there was no door to it—it was open at the other end—there were two bundles of straw bands in the shed—the prisoner lived in the next house to me—he had lived there all the summer—he</p>

               <p>came some time last year—I had lived in that house five years, and have lived three years in the house I am in now—his house is about eight—yards from mine—his garden adjoined the shed—the prisoner worked for me all the summer at bearing off and brick-making—I was his employer—he has quar<lb></lb>relled with me several times, and threatened to fight, but I never had any words with him—the quarrel was not about his work in particular, but about running away from his work, sometimes one thing, and sometimes another; and when I have spoken to him he has threatened to fight me—about nine or ten weeks before the fire I heard him threatening us, that he should like to set the place all on fire, and burn the b—s out—I was leaning over the pales in front of my house at the time, smoking my pipe after supper—it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night—it was a summer's night—the pri= soner was in his own house, and his wife with him—he was talking to his wife—I had used the out-house as a pig-sty, but after selling my pigs I put two carts into it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I saw the shed on fire on the Sunday morning—about nine or ten weeks before that I had been standing with my husband out of doors, and heard my husband's name and mine repeated in a most infamous manner, in a <hi rend="italic">jealousy</hi> sort of way—I heard the prisoner say, "There is one at work, the other at work, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> at work, Hannah at work; he wants to get rich; he wants all the money; he wants to get rich before his neighbours are out of debt; I should like to set light to his b----place, and burn the b----s out of it"—I had repeatedly heard him say the same words before, that he would like to set light to the place, and burn us out—he has said it to his wife in-doors—we have not been listening par<lb></lb>ticularly—we were standing in the yard, as they were in the front of their house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>a fire in the shed adjoining Sibley's dwelling-house—I aroused Sibley and his wife and children—they all came out of the house—I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house, which was close by, and saw his wife—she was up and dressed, and there was a fire in the sitting-room—I called Blake several times, but received no answer until his wife told him to answer me—he then answered, and asked what was the matter—I told him there was a fire, and asked the reason he did not come and assist in putting it out—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I told him I had met him at two o'clock—he said he was in bed by eleven—I asked his wife for a candle—she said she had ne'er a one—I then went to Sibley's, and got one—I came back and saw the prisoner in bed—he asked his wife if we had been trampling his plants down—he then asked her to give him his trowsers, and said he would soon bundle the b----s out of it—I then returned to the fire, and after I had been there a minute or so the prisoner came out—I heard him say he had no water—I searched his garden on the Wednesday, two days after, and found this burnt rag between two and three yards from the shed, in the direction of the prisoner's house—I had a warrant for him on the Tuesday—I saw him that evening come out of the Crown public-house, on Fulham-green—I said, "Hallo, Blake"—he said his name was not Blake—I asked him if he intended to deny living up the lane close by—he said he did not live in the lane, he lived in Cane's brick-field—I took him to the light, identified him, and took him into custody—when I went into his house I saw a coat lying on the bed, which he had on when I met him—I had seen him wear that coat a great many times—he had it on when I met him at two o'clock—it was a very bright moonlight night; the moon was just at the full—I afterwards looked for the coat on the Wednesday, but could not find it.</p>

I saw the prisoner at the station, at twelve o'clock at night, when he was remanded on this charge—he did not seem out of spirits at all, or uncomfortable—he made a moaning noise, and I went into the cell, thinking he was ill—I asked him if anything was the matter—he said no; he supposed he should either be hung or transported—he appeared cheerful.</p>

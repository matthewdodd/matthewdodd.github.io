               <p>Q. Were there only three or four, or a great number? - A. I cannot say whether it was three or four; one of them crossed over, and he went in front of the foreigner to tantalize him, like as if he wanted to play with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to him? - A. He did nothing at all to him; the foreigner then kicked at the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the boy then do? - A.Nothing at all, that I saw; then John Harris, and another came over.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the bundle? - A.After he took the watch, he and another ran over the way, and then the others ran the other way with the bundle.</p>

               <p>Q. When the foreigner had his watch taken from him, did you hear him call out? - A. He made a very comical noise in his way; he called for his watch and his bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say, watch? - A. He said, watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the bundle? - A. I knew what he meant, because I saw the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to say, whether that bundle was taken from him, or whether it dropped from him? - A. No, I cannot; I saw some of the men running away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man run away with it, before Harris took the watch? - A. No; after Harris took the watch, the other ran away with the bundle.</p>

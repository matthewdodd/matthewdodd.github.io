               <p>Q. Did you miss any property - A. On a table at the end of the room laid thirty-six watches, and three time pieces, they were stolen; the watches I value at forty pound, and three pound the time pieces, the watches I put on the table an hour before I went to bed, and the time pieces I saw there. I discovered the side board drawers had been opened, I lost out of it two gowns. Part of the watches are here, I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before your house had been broken open - A. I might have seen him, but I cannot say.</p>

            . I produce the property, I found it in the prisoner's lodgings on the 30th of August, between three and four in the afternoon. The prisoner was not there, he came in about a minute afterwards. As soon as he came into the room I searched him; I found a silver watch in each pocket; I have got them here. In the top drawer in his room I found six more watches, two watches in the bottom drawer, and three time pieces in the middle drawer. He told me that some man brought them there to him. I found some shirts and some napkins, they are all here. I found on the woman three pawnbrokers' tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is that your property - A. I can swear positively to the watches and time pieces, two shawls, and this gown.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watches are there - A. Eight, they are worth eighteen pounds; the time pieces have my own name on them; I finished them myself, and the watches I finished, they have not my name on them.</p>

            's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury; I am charged at the bar of this most honourable court on suspicion of committing a felony, to which I declare I am innocent. I lived in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate. I am a private in the first regiment of Royal Tower hamlet militia. I arose at five o'clock in the morning, and on my way to Hackney I was met by two men at Norton Falgate. They offered me the articles in question to pawn. I asked them why they could not take them themselves; they replied, they had particular business to attend to, they would call on me at night, and pay me for my trouble. I asked them whose property it was, they said, one of their brothers, who had left off business. I took them home in order for my wife to pawn them. I have been seven years in the navy, and in three general actions. I was at the battle of St. Domingo, under the command of Admiral Duncan, in which I exerted my best endeavours for my King and country. I volunteered myself to go down. I was struck with a splinter across my loins, and by the skilful exertion of the Surgeon I was enabled to do my duty at last. When I came over, I exerted my greatest endeavours in cutting out three privateers. I attended on Captain 
               <persName id="t18100919-8-person121">Cockman</persName>
            , and likewise General Abercrombic. I assisted in taking him on board the ship appointed that honourable Commander, who expressed his desire that those brave men who attended him at his death should be acknowledged.</p>

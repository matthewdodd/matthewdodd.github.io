I know you, old <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>"—he was a perfect stranger to me—he said something about standing something—I said it was too late—it was 2 o'clock on Sunday morning—we went to a coffee-stall, and he had some coffee—he followed after me and asked me the time, two or three tines—I told him without taking out my watch—I afterwards pulled it out—he looked forward, as if to see the time—he snatched the chain and ran off with it—I ran after him and caught him, and we had a greet struggle—the chain broke into four pieces—while I had hold of him he took his belt off—as soon as I saw him do that, I took the belt from him and threw it in the road—two constables came up and held him till a third came up—he looked about and found the greatest part of the chain—they took him to the station, and I charged him with the robbery—he made a blow at me with the belt, but I threw him and took the belt from him.</p>

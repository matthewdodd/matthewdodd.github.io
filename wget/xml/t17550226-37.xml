               <p>James Dredge. I am book-keeper at the King's-arms, Holborn-bridge; I saw the prisoner at the bar jump up at the tail of a cart, and take a basket out this day se'nnight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cart going?</p>
               <p>Dredge. It was coming into the yard, (the basket produced) this is the basket. I was before the alderman when the prisoner was there, the prisoner said he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the cart ?</p>
               <p>Dredge. I was within five yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you secure the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dredge. Directly, with the basket in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this is the basket?</p>
               <p>Dredge. I took particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner any time in the yard before?</p>
               <p>Dredge. I never saw him in my life before.</p>

             on Snow-hill; Mr. Dredge and I were coming out at the King's-arms together, I saw Mr. Dredge seize the prisoner with the basket in his hand; I did not see the prisoner take it. I took the basket, and was with him when the prisoner was secured; Mr. Dredge taxed him with taking it out of the cart, and with a great many oaths and imprecations declared it was his own. I did not look to see what was in it.</p>

             about three weeks ago at Barnet; I was just turning to go into the yard, when the prisoner and the first witness were quarrelling about the basket; the cloaths are also the colonel's; I said to them, that was my cart: the prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know colonel Conwallis's christian name?</p>
               <p>Griffin. It is Edward.</p>

               <p>I was going through the King's-arms-inn-yard, I can't say I did rightly see the cart at first, there lay this basket; a person came up, and said, is that your property? and said, you took it out of the cart. I said I did not, and if it belonged to it throw it in. He said he had been a great sufferer in this sort, and he would send me abroad for it. It was so dark, that it was impossible for any body to have seen me, had I taken it out of the cart.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coachman, and live at Bell-yard livery-stables, Strand. On the 31st of March, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I was on the stand at St. Giles' - the prisoner came and asked what was the fare to Gun-street, Union-street, Spitalfields - I said 4s.; he said he would only give me 3s. - I agreed to take it; he then put a roll of carpet into my coach, and got in - as I drove down Holborn-hill he pulled down the near side glass, and asked if I had any side blinds; that excited my suspicion - I told him Yes; he then told me to drive on at a sharp rate - when I got to Gun-street he gave me a 5s. piece; I said I had no silver, and went to a cheesemonger's shop and got change - I wished to detain him as long as I could; I saw a Police-officer, and spoke to him - he took him into custody, and the carpet.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ two years ago, when I was a retail brewer at Shadwell; I am on half-pay, and have been a lientenant in the army - he lived with me till Christmas, 1828, and then went to Mrs. Storey, my next door neighbour, at Shadwell: he remained with her till eight or ten weeks ago, and could not get employ - after that he went to Sheerness to enter the navy; he bore a good character - he did not live with me in Gun-street; I ordered her to bring no carpet.</p>

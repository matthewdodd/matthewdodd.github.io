On the 9th of May there were five tablespoons missed out of my kitchen; questions were asked in the house what was become of the spoons, nobody could tell; it was made known to me. I asked my servant when they were missed. She said that on that morning, or the night before, they were in the kitchen. I asked who had been there. She said nobody but a bricklayer to repair the copper; she naturally supposed the man had been sent by me. Knowing I had not sent any person there, I therefore took it for granted that the man had made that an excuse to steal the spoons. I went to Sir

               <p>I am cook-maid to Mr. Gibson. On the 9th of May the prisoner came down the area and asked me if the labourer was come. I asked him for what. He said to repair the copper. I told him it could not be done then.</p>
               <p>Did you know that it wanted mending? - Yes, it did want mending at the same time. He said he must look at it; he had four bricks in his hand when he came; he went to the copper and looked at it, he did not stay a minute; then he went to the scullery-door, and asked me if we did not want something done to the sink. I told him no, nothing there. He said he should come again after breakfast; he took up his bricks and went away.</p>
               <p>Were there any silver spoons in the kitchen when he came? - Yes, there were five lay upon the table.</p>
               <p>How soon did you miss them? - He came about eight o'clock, I missed them about eleven.</p>
               <p>You are sure they were there when he came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had any body else been in the kitchen? - No, nobody at all.</p>

               <p>Had the man a wig or his own hair? - I thought it was his own hair, I was not certain; I believe it was a wig.</p>
               <p>Gibson. The copper was a double boiler; they often complained to me that it was not fit to boil clothes in; I had determined to have it taken down, and put a copper up in the room of it. I told the servant that, but I had not spoke to any person to come and do it.</p>

On the 25th of January the prisoner knocked at the door at eight o'clock in the morning; I opened the door to him. He said that he was sent to paint the kitchen and parlour windows. I asked if he was come from Mr. Hugginton, that is the man who painted our house. He answered me yes.</p>
               <p>Did your parlour and kitchen windows want painting? - Not that I know of; a painter had lately been looking at the house; he followed me down into the kitchen, and looked at the windows; he came up stairs with me again, and went into the parlour; he opened the lower half-shutter of a window; he told me he wanted a duster to wipe the lodges; I desired him to go down to the cook and ask for a duster; he did so, as I then though; but instead of going down into the kitchen, he went into the back parlour.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because the things were lost from the back parlour; he went out and left the door wide open.</p>
               <p>Did he leave his pot and brush? - No, he took them away.</p>
               <p>Was the door shut before he went out? - It was; in about an hour after he was gone I missed all the things, mentioned in the indictment, out of the back parlour. I saw them there not a quarter of an hour before he came in; I went in to carry something down into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Had you no suspicion when he went away and left the door open? - I was gone to fetch a jug of water for breakfast, the cook was in the kitchen; when I came in I found the door open, I shut it after me.</p>
               <p>How soon after you came in did you go to see after the things? - Very soon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the prisoner is the man? - To the best of my belief he is the man.</p>
               <p>Had he his own hair or a wig? - A wig; the same I believe he has now.</p>
               <p>Are you sure or not that he is the man? - To the best of my belief he is the man.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the things missed? - About thirty-five shillings the table spoons.</p>
               <p>What were the tea spoons? - About twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>What was the tea tongs? - Thirteen shillings.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Sir Sampson Gideon. As I was cleaning the copper the prisoner came into the kitchen; I do not rightly know the day; as near as I can guess it is between two or three months ago.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - I do not know. Sir Sampson sent to

            's immediately. It was at about seven o'clock in the morning he rang the bell at the door; the house-maid let him in and showed him into the kitchen; he looked at the copper; he said he was come to mend it. I asked him if he came from Mr. Barr, who is a bricklayer and plasterer, that always did our work? He said he did; he put the mortar down and said he must go and look for a brick. I went the further side of the kitchen and watched him. He went very near the area gate, the area gate happened to be locked. I went to my work again directly.</p>
               <p>How came you to watch him? - I had a suspicion came into my head, because I never saw the man before; I never saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280136"></xptr> any more; it was supposed that he went immediately into the powdering room and took my lady's ink-stand; the footman had brought the ink-stand down not above a quarter before, as he said he is not here.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner was not put on his defence.)</p>

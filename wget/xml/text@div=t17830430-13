               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Gwynne, on the 26th of March, the prisoner came to me, and desired I would shew her some fine muslins, either striped, spotted, or corded, she did not care which it was, but it must be fine and curious; I shewed her some spotted muslin, and some streaked, she bought a quarter of a yard of the spotted, and gave me four shillings and sixpence for it, in the mean time she stole a quantity.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by one quantity? - It might be two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>How do you know she stole it? - I did not see her take it, but immediately after she was gone I missed this muslin.</p>
               <p>What did you miss? - Fine streaked muslin.</p>
               <p>A piece or what? - I fancy there might be about three yards.</p>
               <p>Was it a separate piece? - Yes, the piece had been in paper amongst the rest that I shewed her, and she asked me the price of it, I am sure of that, I cannot exactly say what it contained, but last Christmas when we took our stock, I measured three yards and a half, and no one in the shop can recollect cutting it since; but I cannot positively swear that any of it was not sold since.</p>
               <p>Was it off that piece that she had bought? - It was part of another.</p>
               <p>What might that piece that you missed be worth at prime cost? - It cost us seventeen shillings and six-pence a yard.</p>
               <p>You cannot speak to the quantity there was then of it? - I cannot, she was got out of the shop, clear off before I missed it two minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300032"></xptr>When did yo u see her again? - The next day she walked by the shop, I knew her again, and followed her directly, and charged her with it, she denied ever seeing it, she said she had been a very good customer and was very sorry such a thing should be supposed of her, as she had laid out a great deal of money; she told me she lived in Peter-street, Westminster, but afterwards we found she lived over Westminster-bridge; she continued to deny it for some time, but going to Justice Hyde's she caught hold of my hand and said, my dear sir, if you will forgive me, I will tell you where you may see the muslin; I told her it was out of my power to forgive her, she must apply to Mr. Gwynne; when we got to Justice Hyde's she denyed saying any such thing, she said it was the muslin she bought that she meant, upon that Mr. Justice Hyde granted a search warrant, and I went to her lodging and found part of the muslin, which was of the same piece that she took the day before, there was about a yard and three nails; after that she confessed where the remainder of that piece was; it was at the pawnbroker's in St. Margaret's church yard, I got it; there was about a yard and a half which she pledged for eight shillings.</p>

               <p>Court. What character did this woman bear? - A very good one, I never knew any blemish in her character, she never had but one place, and she lived in it ten years.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know if her family is in any distress? - Yes, my Lord, they kept a chandler's shop and ran out a good deal of money, they were very much imposed on, and lost all they had, and I believe they are in very great distress; they owe me a great deal of money for rent, and I am sure they would have paid me if they could.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called four other witnesses who all gave her an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The defence of the prisoner is rather addressed to your compassion than your justice, for she does not deny the fact but pleads for mercy; therefore if you think her guilty, you are bound by your oaths to find her so, however painful it may be.</p>

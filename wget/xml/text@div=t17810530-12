I was going home from London to Pleasant Row; Calcott first came up to me; it was a dark night, considering the time of the year: he accosted me, but what he said I don't remember; but he gave me a touch of the elbow. The next that came up to me was Webb; he had a bludgeon in his hand; he stood with the bludgeon lifted up in a position to knock me down; he said, Your money! I was about 100 yards from my own house; I thought I could run home; I was getting off the foot-path, to get upon the road; upon which Calcott took me by the collar: he was buttoned up quite close; he got his hand in under his coat, as if he was drawing something out. I looked over my left shoulder, and saw two more men advancing up; they called out, D - n his eyes! what, does he resist? blow his brains out! As soon as the other two closed up, they pushed off my hat, and held it before my face; it was pushed off behind, but Calcott, I imagine, held it, for it was held even flat against my face; then Webb rifled me; I lost five shillings in good silver, a bad shilling, and four-pence halfpenny; one was a halfpenny, three parts cut. When they took that five shillings, they said, What money have you got about you? I said, I had a little silver, which you have got, and a few halfpence in my waistcoat pocket; they took them out instantly; then they asked me for my watch; I said I had not one; they felt me all the way down, from my head down to my shoes; my watch I kept in my hand all the time.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay with you? - About ten minutes; then Calcott led me on towards my home, for two or three yards; he held my hat before my face; then he said, Walk on, make no noise, and no resistance; if you do, you are a dead man. When he was gone, I looked over my shoulder, and saw them walking up the hill towards Islington.</p>
               <p>They were not disguised? - No: nothing over their faces. Webb had an old round hat on when he committed the robbery; there were no lamps upon the road; my own lamp at my door was not lighted: there had been so many robberies committed on the road, that I took my watch out, and put it into my hand, when I came into the road at the Angel at Islington. I was robbed on a Tuesday night; on the Wednesday I was sent for to Bow-street; I went on the Friday; I enquired at the office; they told me the foot-pads were in at the public-house; they asked me if I had seen them; I said I had not: I was asked to go into the public-house, to see if I knew them; I went into the tap-room; there were fifteen or sixteen people there; I was desired to look about to see if I knew any body; I looked about, I fixed upon Calcott; they asked me if there was any body else; I said, no, there was not. I was desired to go into a back-room; there were about ten or a dozen there, I believe: when I came out again, a man asked me if any body I knew was there; I said, yes, the little man that has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300010"></xptr> got an apron on, is the man that rifled me, but he has now got a cocked hat on; when he rifled me, he had a very old round hat, and his hair hung down below his face; that was Webb; I understood they were all four in custody; I did not see the other two.</p>
               <p>Did you discern the faces of the other men? - I cannot say I did observe them; they came up side-ways, and I had my hat before my face.</p>
               <p>What dress had Calcott on? - A drab-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Calcott. He said, a light-coloured coat, before the justice.</p>
               <p>Hine. It was a drab-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Calcott. He mentioned before the justice, that some people had seen me drinking at a public-house in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Hine. I understand there were people that saw them there, but they are not here.</p>
               <p>Webb. The gentleman said, I had a round hat on, and my hair hung over before my face; if I had had a round hat on, he could not so positively swear to my face. I never was in custody before.</p>
               <p>How could you see his hair, when his hat was on? - His hair came below his hat, and I saw his face very plain when he stood with the stick up, as I mentioned before.</p>

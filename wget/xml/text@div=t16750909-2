The Gentleman was on Horse-back, and in the dusk of the Evening, discovered the head of a fellow behind a Bank as he rode, and presently with one blow he knockt him off his Horse, and two more coming in upon him he was forced to surrender about five pound in Money, a stricking Watch, worth about Ten pound, and several other things of value, for they stript him even of his very shooes, and left him in that condition: wounded very severely, and his Horse turned loose, but he in some short time coming to himself again, made what speed after them he could in that condition, and finding out the Watch, that constantly attends at Pancridge-Church, he made his Complaint to them, who immediately went in pursuit of the Rogues, and in the very next Ground met with Three men on foot, which the Gentleman immediately concluded to be those that had Rob'd him, as I think any man would have done in his case. But upon their Tryal it was proved that they were honest <rs id="t16750909-2-deflabel9" type="occupation">Labourers</rs>

These two instances, though they may not give the Reader that satisfaction he expects, because there is no condemnation or Execution in the case,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16750909005"></xptr>yet my design in the reciting them is rather to warn all people that they take care how they wander late in the Evening about the out-skirts of the City, than to satisfie the curiosity of such as take delight to see and hear of the tragical ends of those miserable wretches, that are the Authors of such mischief.</p>

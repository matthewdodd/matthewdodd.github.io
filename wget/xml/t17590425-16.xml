            .

               <p>Q. At what town did you miss these goods?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I do not remember the name of the town; I was looking for a lodging, and I left the prisoner to look after my three children, which I had with me at a door, and when I came back again she was gone, and took the bundle, and left my children there. I asked my children where she was, they said she was gone, but they knew not where. I pursu'd her to London.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this that she left you?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It was on the twenty-fifth of February, being on a sunday. On the twenty-seventh I saw her at the Windmill near Hick's Hall: she had been taken up by the directions of my daughter, who had seen her at Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your daughter ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. She is fifteen years of age. I told the constable, the cloaths that the prisoner had on was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What cloaths?</p>
               <p>Taylor. A gown, a shirt, an apron, an handkerchief, and a cap. They were taken from her. Produc'd in court, and depos'd to. I got some more trifling things, which were sold at Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find them there?</p>
               <p>Taylor. The prisoner told me she had sold them there. The constable and I went there and found them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the person's name where you found them ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I do not know. He is a broker. A bible, common-prayer-book, and some small things, produc'd in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get any more of your things?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear these things to be your's; and that they were in the bundle that you lost?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I can. They are my property, and were part of the bundle which the prisoner own'd she took away.</p>

            . I am constable; the prosecutrix's girl followed the prisoner, as she said, from Islington, and call'd out stop thief, and she was stopped just at my door. After she was in my charge, she confessed to me the taking the several things mentioned in the indictment. She told me, she had sold the bible and common-prayer-book, and these other things, at a house near the sign of the sun; I can't justly remember the particular things she mentioned. There were several small things belonging to the children; a bed-gown, and other things. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250023"></xptr> prosecutrix and I went to Hampstead, and saw the things lying in a window, and she swore to them, before she went into the shop. We had a search-warrant, and went and demanded them, and they were delivered to her.</p>

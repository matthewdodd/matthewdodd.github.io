            . I am a boot-maker, I live in Snows-fields, in the Borough. On Easter Sunday, I was in <placeName id="t18140420-174-crimeloc961">Gracechurch-street</placeName>

On my going away, the prisoner followed me, and offered me four oranges for sixpence; afterwards five, six, seven, eight. They were fine oranges. I was taken with the eight. I gave him a shilling to pay for them; he refused it; I gave him another; he did not like that; I gave him a third; he liked the third very well. He said he had no sixpence; he gave me the three shillings back, and said he saw I had some three-shilling pieces in my hand; he could give me a shilling and an eighteen-penny piece. I had a blackbird in one hand, and a bag in the other. I was obliged to hold my hand out to him and let him take them. He took a three-shilling piece out of my hand; he did not like that; I held out my hand and let him take another; he did not like that. He gave me two bad ones in the room of my two good ones. He took another, which he said was good. On his searching for an eighteen-penny piece, he said he had shillings but no eighteen-penny piece. He said if I gave him a three shilling piece he could give me a dollar, which would make it right to make it up six shillings with the oranges. On searching for the dollar he said he had no one, he must take the oranges and give me the money. He gave me two three-shilling pieces, took the oranges, and told me to go about my business. I then went away. The three-shilling pieces I had given him were good ones; I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200075"></xptr>they were all good. I went on my journey to my friends, at Tottenham. I was with my father. I was going to send my sister for some beer, I discovered that all my money was bad, in looking at the three-shilling pieces. What I had were of the old coin; what he had given me were of the new. I then put them in my pocket. I stopped with my friends until the evening, and then I went home. I went down to Bermondsey watchhouse. On the following Sunday morning, Mr. Myers and I went to Cornhill; I there saw the prisoner standing at a door with oranges. I laid hold of the prisoner, and

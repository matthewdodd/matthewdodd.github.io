On the Saturday morning these things were put up in a lot in the stable, to be sent off to be sold by auction—I know nothing about—the life-preserver—these brass pieces belong to a hall-lamp—I do not know how these things got out of the stable—I did not band them to anybody—they were not to be sold on the premises.</p>

I saw these things in the stable in the morning, and in the evening when the prisoner was taken they were found on him—I knew this life-preserver by a mark—it had been hanging in the shop—these fitting were in the stable piled up—they may be odd ones—they are of little value—these pieces of brass are part of an ormolu candlestick—I saw it as a candlestick a week before it was taken.</p>

The father says he checked her for so doing, and consequently she has kept out of my sight. When I entered into this marriage I had no knowledge of my first wife, and thought I was at liberty. I do not know now whether their words are true, or whether she is alive or not. She has not been brought forward, and she has not been with me seven years out of the twenty-two. She has always been flying about and prostituting, and never staying at home, and taking my things whenever she did come home.</p>

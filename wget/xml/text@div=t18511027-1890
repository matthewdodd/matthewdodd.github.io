                  </hi>. I reside at Moulsey-grove, Surrey. On Sunday afternoon, 5th Oct., about four o'clock, I was near Hampton-court Palace-gardens—I was leaning over the railings on the footpath, watching a steam<lb></lb>tug towing a barge along the river—I observed four boys throwing stones at the barge; the stones did not hit the barge, I particularly noticed that—the prisoner was on board the barge—I heard the report of a gun; I saw the smoke of it from the barge, and I felt the shot strike myself—I was between fifty and sixty yards from the barge—it was spent shot that struck me; it did not inflict any wound, it struck my hat and shoulder—I should say the boys were about twenty-five or thirty yards from the barge—I saw the boys after hearing the report—one of them, I think, stumbled on his knee, and the others ran away—I ran to their assistance, on hearing them exclaim</p>

               <p>they were shot—two of them were bleeding a great deal—I got a constable to go on board the barge, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday afternoon, 5th Oct., about 4 o'clock, I was at the water-side, near Hampton-court; I was throwing stones at the rope between the barges, trying to hit the rope—there were two barges being towed by a steam-tug—I saw three men on board the last barge, two at the stern, and one at the head—I saw one of the men at the stem shake some<lb></lb>thing at us, which looked like a gun—I do not think I threw again after<lb></lb>wards, I laughed—I was then shot, and know no more afterwards; I became insensible—I did not see the man fire—I was shot in the forehead, the instep, and the side of the face.</p>

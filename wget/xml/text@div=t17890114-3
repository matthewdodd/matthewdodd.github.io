I delivered the parcel and the bill, and requested payment of the bill; on which he went into a back room, under pretence of looking at the stockings: he took them out of the paper; he returned from the room, and came to the front room, and said he was going to shew them to a person, a friend of his.

He went out, and I waited about two hours, with anxiety, hoping he would return; he did not, and I came home. He was apprehended the next day, at the Magpye and Platter, in Butcher-row, between three and four o'clock. He was taken before Sir

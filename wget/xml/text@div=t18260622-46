Reeves interfered to get me away from losing my watch - he was knocked down - another scuffle ensued, and in a short time they all ran away except Abrahams, whom I collared - they had not robbed me then; Abrahams called out for the other four to return, and not let such a d-d thief as me take him; they all four returned, and I was knocked down. Reid was the most desperate of them - they took off my hat, which was torn a good deal in the struggle - I produce it; I was hallooing out Watch! for full five minutes; when they got my hat they all ran away - the watchman came up, sprung his rattle, and I saw Reid drop the hat; I picked it up - Burke pursued him, and neither of us lost sight of him till he was taken; he was taken to the watch-house, and as I came out of the watch-house door, the first man I saw was Abrahams, standing outside the door; I recognised him directly, and collared him till Killmartin came up and took him into the watch-house. I swear positively to both of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. You had been making merry with your friends? A. No; I was quite sober - there had been no quarrel - my hat was certainly taken with an intent to steal it - they tried to get my watch first- Reid took my hat off when they returned to rescue Abrahams, but after they had rescued him, not while they were doing it.</p>

            . I am a coach-trimmer, and have worked with Cree. I was going home from my father's, and met him in about five minutes; he was perfectly sober; as the clock struck he took out his watch, under a gas-light - some of the men made a snatch at it - I stepped up and interfered - I was knocked down and stunned - there were five of them; when I recovered I found Reid running from the prosecutor, who was calling Watch! - I called Watch! too, and very soon after the watchman stopped him - he was never out of my sight - I cannot identify Abrahams.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Saturday night, about a quarter past twelve, I heard a scuffle, and call of Watch! in Compton-street; I saw Reid run from where the scuffle was, and saw him drop a hat - I pursued him down Church-passage, through two courts, into St. Andrew-street, where Price stopped him, without my losing sight of him. I am certain he is the man who dropped the hat. I took him to the watch-house, and, as we came out, the prosecutor pointed out Abrahams, and gave him in charge.</p>

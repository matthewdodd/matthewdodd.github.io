Taylor said he did not know his way home, and asked me to see him home to Milk-street, Cheapside, about twelve o'clock; then we went to the Hampshire Hog, about a quarter of an hour after that he fell asleep; we had before that half a pint of mulled raspberry; he had not been asleep five minutes before he lost his money.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, searched the prisoner's box, and found a pair of gloves, two collars, and 2l. 3s.; I took him to the watch-house -I neither threatened nor promised any thing - I went to the watch-house on Sunday to take him some dinner, and asked how he came to rob his master of his cash; he said he had got acquainted with a girl, and got into bad company - I asked what had been the amount of the most money he had taken: he said the first time was 2l., the second time 3l., and the third time 6l.; I asked him if he recollected what he had taken at any time - he said he could not, but he thought he had taken from time to time from 20l. to 24l.; I asked him if this was not the key, he had opened the box with - he said it was part of it - I had found this part of the key on him; he said it was part of the key, and he had thrown the other part of it away; I tried it to the lock, and it corresponded exactly with the wards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never told him I had taken 6l. at one time. Witness. He did - I made a minute of it at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN. This key fitted my cash-box - I believe it to be part of my key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master locked me up in the warehouse two days and a half, to make me confess, and promised to forgive me if I told the truth.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN. It is not correct. I detained him on Friday evening while I sent for his father; that was before I sent for the officer - I did not threaten or promise him at all; I sent to his father to know if he had given him some things, which were in his box - these gloves are ours, and have our private mark on them; the shirt collars have my initials on them.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character,</p>

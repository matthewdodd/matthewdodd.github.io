                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Isaac Marks, of 140, High Holborn. Early in the morning of 21st July I was awoke out of my sleep by a noise—I got up, and left my room—a man was coming in at the staircase window—he was in the act of descending from the window sill—I asked him what he wanted there—he said he was shut out—I alarmed my sons and the persons on the third floor—I then went down, and found the prisoner in custody—the window was not fastened inside—it is nearly six feet from the stairs, but outside it is very easy to get in—I am able to swear to the prisoner being the person—I did not see his face, I could swear to his voice.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 115). I was called to Mr. Marks's house; I searched the leads at the back—I got into another yard, and found the prisoner in the water-closet, concealed—he could get from the window sill to the cistern, and down to the other water closet—there was a sieve on the top of the water closet—I asked him what he wanted; he said he did not know—he was perfectly sober—I found on him a knife, a tobacco box, and a penny—there were some lucifers down the water closet where he was—I found one lucifer match of the same sort inside the window—I traced footsteps from the window to the spot where I. took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any Thing?</p>
               <p>Robinson. Yes, Sir, In the short Time of her dwelling with me she said Money was short, because her Husband was not in Business; there was a Guinea to pay, and she desir'd I would not be severe with her; I told her not to be uneasy about it, and said, in my Family there was always something to do, and she should fare as I did; she was handy with her Needle.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Robinson. She was doing as the Family requir'd; and out of my Kitchen and Chamber she took these Things, a Stuff Quilted Petticoat, a Check'd Linnen Shirt, a white Callico Apron, a white Dimity Blanket, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find these Things.</p>
               <p>Robinson. I went to the Prisoner's Husband, he said he had not seen her, but when he did he would let me know it; and her Husband was the Occasion of her being taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her where the Things were?</p>

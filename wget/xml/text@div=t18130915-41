            . I am an officer. I went up, when the former witness was talking to the prisoner; the prisoner said it was tea; it was handed over to me; he then said it was brandy; that it was given to him by a sailor two nights before. There was brandy where the prisoner was stationed, and in the next station too.</p>

            . I am a cooper, at the London Docks, near the prisoner's station. There was a brandy cask that had been been recently plundered. On the 14th of July, I examined it about nine o'clock in the morning, it had been bored in the bouge of the cask; it appeared to me to be recently done; the cask contained brandy rather paler than is usually shipped to an English market. This bottle appeared to contain the same liquor; I have no doubt about it; the liquor in the stone bottle is the same that was in the cask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th a sailor, an old lodger of mine brought me this brandy on the South key, I told him I did not want any more than a glass. I put it by the side of the dock. On the 14th I took this brandy out from where I put it; when Clements asked me what it was; I said brandy; I got it from an old lodger of mine on the South key. I begged Mr. Slater to come with me to the ship on the South key to compare the brandy with the brandy on board the ship near the South key.</p>

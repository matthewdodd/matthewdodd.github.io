               <p>Samuel Clark. I had a silver pint mug taken out of my house on the 24th of Dec. between the hours of 3 and 6.</p>

               <p>Clark. She was the only person that was in the house at the time. I had left her in the house while I went down to draw a pot of beer, and she and that were missing together.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found it since?</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On Christmas evening, between 6 and 7 o'clock, the prisoner brought this mug to me, and desired I would lend her 15 s. upon it. I took it in my hand, and asked her whose it was: She said, It is mine. I said, Pray how long have you had it: She said, A great while. Who bought it? My husband. What might he give for it ? She said there was some old silver in exchange, so she could not tell the price it cost. She said she wanted but 15 s. to make up some rent, and she would fetch it again next week. Don't you, say'd she, know me? I brought a tea-spoon before. I said I did. I lent her the money, and she went away. The next day about 11 o'clock I read in the Advertiser, '' A silver pint '' mug, marked E. M. M. stole out of the Two '' Chairmen, in Warder-street, Soho.'' I sent my daughter to the house, to desire

             to come to me. He came. I said, You have advertised a mug. Is it remarkable? I asked him this because the mug had a wooden bottom, not mentioned in the advertisement. He said there is E. M. M. on the handle, and it is very much bruised. I said, Is there any thing else: A wooden bottom, said he. I said, I have your mug. I asked him whom he suspected: He said a woman nam'd Eliz. Davis (a name the prisoner went by) and that he had lost two silver tea-spoons. The prisoner brought me another tea-spoon when she brought the tankard. He took her up, and I went and saw her; when she said she neither knew me nor the mug. She had altered her dress; but I was certain as to her, and swear that I took the mug of her.</p>

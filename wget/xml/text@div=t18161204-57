            . I am an officer of Bow-street; I was out, on the 15th of November, with Maidmant, Wilson, and Townsend; we were at Mr. Morrison's at the time the mob were crying out bread or blood! I heard the windows break, and rushed forward among the mob; I saw the prisoner, with a small stick, with a hook to it, breaking the windows; he put his hand through one of the panes, which he broke himself, and was in the act of taking a loaf from the end of the counter; I seized him by the collar; Maidmant came to my assistance; the mob cried, rescue! He did not make a violent resistance; we took him to St. Martin's watch-house. Maidmant searched him; I saw him find some pieces of cemented mortar in his pocket; they corresponded with the piece found in Mr. Morrison's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. There were about three hundred persons. I was close to the shop; he was surrounded by a crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the stick here - A. No; I did not take it; I suppose he dropped it. I am sure he held the stick; he did not resist; when I went up, he was in the act of breakiing the glass; I saw him in the act of drawing a loaf from the counter with the stick; he had nearly removed it from the place on which it stood. I should not think that any part of it stood on the place that it did before.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAL MAIDMANT. I am an officer. I saw the prisoner close to the window; when I seized him he said nothing; but the mob cried out, rescue! I did not see what he was doing, because Esthelby was before me; I searched him, and found upon him two bits of mortar and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040030"></xptr>a hymn-book (producing them); the mortar was in his coat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. There was many persons surrounding the shop - A. There was; my attention was directed to the whole group, not to one in particular.</p>

            . I am an officer; I was out with Esthelby and Maidmant; Esthelby seized the prisoner; I had not observed him before that I found this piece of mortar in the shop (producing it); it appears to be the same kind as that found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. Is it not a finer grain than the other - A. I do not see it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I beg to state that I am perfectly innocent of the charge; I trust, when my witnesses are heard, that you will think so. It is very unlikely that a person in my situation of life should be guilty of stealing a loaf: my situation in life has ever been respectable. Esthelby is the only witness I have to complain of, he has not said what it true. I have been a Yeoman in the Guards, and have been always ready to exert myself for the public good.</p>
               <p>Court to WILSON. Where was the prisoner when you seized him-A. About four yards past the window; Maidmant and I saw him close to the window.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he got away from the window-A. I seized him directly.</p>

I observed a man in a brown coat go and speak to Morrison. I then saw a boy in the shop gather the bread together from the window; the people as they passed knocked their elbows through the window. Several stones were thrown from the opposite side of the way. I did not see the prisoner there.</p>

            . I am a cordwainer. I was present at Mr. Morrison's shop; there were several windows broke on both sides of the shop. I saw the prisoner previous to my arrival at the house; he had no stick in his hand. I know the prisoner slightly before this evening; I had seen him in the company of his brother, who live with Messrs. White and Co. in the Haymarket. I was on the steps of St. Martin's Church; I followed the crowd; I met the prisoner at the corner of Hemmings-row; he was going with them towards the Haymarket. He told me that he was going to see his brother. I went part of the way along the street with him. The pressure of the crowd was so great, that we parted. If he had a stick with him I must have seen it. I went on with the crowd to Mr. Morrison's, which is a very short way from Leicester-square. The windows were broken. White and Co. live next door to the Theatre.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. In what state were the windows when he come up - A. They were broken before he arrived. There was nothing remaining in the window; I did not see him throw any thing. The mob was pushing about. I was there where he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was he when he was taken into custody - A. Very near the door. The mob cried out-rescue. I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

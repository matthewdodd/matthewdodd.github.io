The prisoner was in their employ - I saw him go out on the 16th of February, with a laurel shrub; I said nothing to him, but spoke to the head clerk; and on the prisoner's return, between six and seven o'clock, an officer, who was waiting, took him into custody - I went to his house in City-gardens; the officer asked where the trees were which he took from the wharf - he made no anwer, but went to the cellar, pulled out the two trees, and gave them to the officer; we found these staves in the cellar - he acknowledged taking them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. Did you know the trees? A. No - we had a quantity on the wharf; he has been five or six years in our employ.</p>

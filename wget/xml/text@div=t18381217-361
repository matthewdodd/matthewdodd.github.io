On the 10th of December I was in Smithfield, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, standing a good way from the pens in which Mr. Burrell's sheep stand—the prisoner came to me a little before seven o'clock—he is a drover employed in the market—I had known him before—he asked me if I had any thing to do—I said I had not—he asked if I would take a sheep over to Newgate-market for him—I said I would, and was glad of the job—I went with him to the pens of a man named Eaves, within a few yards of Mr. Burrell's pens—the prisoner there tied down the legs of a sheept put it on my back, and told me to take it to Mr. Gam<lb></lb>ham's in Newgate-market—I noticed the sheep was marked with ochre on the shoulder—the prisoner told me to tell Mr. Garnham to kill it, and he told me not to draw any thing over there, as he would pay me for carrying it—he told me he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. next Friday—I took the sheep and delivered it.</p>

               <p>before seven o'clock, lift a sheep on the man's back—it was marked across the shoulder with red ochre—I did not take particular notice which way the man went with it, but I thought he went by the Bull's Head—that would be one way to go to Newgate-market—in about a quarter of an hour after, I heard of a sheep being lost, and there was a good deal of noise made about it in the market—I had moved Mr. Burrell's sheep about half-past five o'clock that morning, from the left side of the alley to the right, and I secured them—there were then two lots—one lot of ten, marked across the loins with red ochre, and one lot of nineteen, marked across the shoulders—this is the skin of a sheep which I saw at Guildhall, pro<lb></lb>duced by the officer—it has the same mark on it that the nineteen sheep had.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell the prisoner that Mr. Burrell had lost one, and did not the prisoner say it was one that had strayed into his pens? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not think he did—he said he knew there was a sheep over there, that it became ill, and he sent it to be killed, thinking it was his master's—I said, I thought the best thing would be for him to pay for it, and prevent all bother—I am not aware that he has paid for it—I have heard so—he did not tell me so—I have known him in the market about fifteen yean—he conducted himself as a respectable drover and an honest man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sexton of West Hackney Church, and live opposite the north side of the Church. On the evening of 30th Dec, a little before 7 o'clock, in consequence of what my two children came and told me, I looked towards the vestry room of the Church, and saw a glimmering light through the vestry room window—I sent for Thomas Williams, the beadle—I keep the keys of the Church—I took the keys, and went over to the Church with Williams, my wife, and the two children—I unlocked the outside back lobby door, and went into the Church—I locked the door again immediately—I then lighted a candle—I saw Williams go towards the vestry—he turned back, and said, "There is something up," or, "It is all up, let me out"—I let him out, and locked the door after him—I then went to the vestry room—it was dark at this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020077"></xptr>
               <p>time—I did not find any one there—I found the iron chest wrenched out of the wall, and turned upside down, about four feet from the place where it had stood before—that chest contained the communion plate, a flagon, two chalices, two patens, and an alms dish—the churchwardens are Mr. Thomas Waller and Mr. John Carter—I had last seen the chest at 11 o'clock that same morning—it was then safe in its place—in the evening after we had discovered this, there were traces of violence on it; the lap of the door was forced off, and there were other marks—there are two doors to the chest; a lap of one folds over the other; that was wrenched off, and other marks made apparently by that lap having been used as a lever or crow bar, and there were marks of another crow bar, to get the lid open—the handle was wrenched off one of the doors, and also the escutchens from the keyhole—in consequence of what my little girl said to me, I came out of the vestry—I heard a noise towards the back door of the Church, and proceeded in that direction—when I got to the inner door of the lobby, I saw two men—Stannard was one, the other was a man named Cox, who has not been apprehended—they bad been trying to get out of the back door, but that being locked, they retraced their steps some few paces to the door leading down to the vaults, where they had originally entered—I did not go down after them, having no assistance—I had employed Deller the whole of that day in wheeling some earth away, about twenty-one yards from the back door of the Church, and Stannard I had employed for an hour and a half, from 11 o'clock in the morning till about a quarter to 1 o'clock, to assist me in fixing some stones, about fifty-one yards from the Church—I saw both the prisoners in custody about 11 that same night—I saw Deller in the vestry that evening; when I went in the second time, he came behind me; I was not aware that he was behind me until I heard him exclaim, "Dear me, what have they been doing?"—I then turned round, and was astonished to find him there—at that time no part of the Church was open by which he could have got in, no legal entrance—the way in which they had got in was through a grating at the east end of the Church; that was loose, and had been so for some time—it would be easy for any one to get in there if the grating was lifted out of its place; it only lay there by its own weight—the inner door of the lobby was broken open; I had seen it safe at 11 o'clock in the morning—besides the iron chest, there was a sheet iron chest taken from off a high cupboard, and a wooden chest from underneath the form, and placed on the top of the form; that had been opened, although not broken open—the table was moved out of its place—Deller had been employed on one occasion before this, assisting in decorating the Church with evergreens on Christmas eve.</p>

               <p>are obliged to jump down—the height is about four feet six inches; the aperture is about two feet across, and rather higher than broad—the wall is three feet thick—it is rather a disagreeable passage—you must crawl on your hands and knees part of the way—there are three front outer doors to the Church, and one at the back; one pair; they are double doors—I examined all the doors that night after seeing these men; I found them all locked except the inner door; that had been broken open—that would be done by any persons who had come in by the vault—they could not have come in any other way without breaking the outer door, and that was in a sound state—the two men I lost sight of, must have got out by the same means by which they came in—it would not be more difficult to get out than to get in; I have tried it—it was about five minutes after seeing the two men, that Deller came behind me as I was in the vestry; I was not aware of his presence in the Church until then—he came up, and said, "What is all this about?"—no property was taken—I missed a piece of lead next morning, weighing about 7 lbs. or 8 lbs.; I had seen it safe about 11 o'clock that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. Previous to the night of 30th Dec. I had seen the prisoners about the Church yard—I had not taken very much notice of them, but I had seen them, and had spoken to Stannard that morning—I accompanied my husband and Williams into the Church that evening, when a light had been seen through the vestry window—I saw Stannard in the Church on that occa<lb></lb>sion, and I saw Deller afterwards, but I did not know that it was him at the time, until I saw him at the police office; when we were in the vestry, some one came up, and spoke to my husband, but I did not see who it was—I believe my niece gave the keys to the clock winder in my presence that afternoon—he brought them back to me, and I then asked him the time—he said, "Seventeen and a half minutes past 4 o'clock M—when he comes to do the clock, we generally ask him the correct time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever been down this grating? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have been near it, in the vaults; the furnaces were there; I could get through it; there is sufficient room—I saw the light in the vestry window in the first instance when the children came to the door—I went over to the Church with my husband—I was a little alarmed, but I did not know whether there might have been any fire—we had had a wedding in the morning, and there had been a little fire left, but I found it was out—as soon as we got in at the back door, we heard some one running up the north aisle towards the front door—I do not believe in ghosts—I could not see at that time who the persons were—I was behind my husband when they passed us—he had a candle—I do not know whether he was frightened—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am the beadle of the church. I accompanied Langdon—when Stannard was brought in, I looked at him twice—having had his whiskers cut off, I did not identify him at first, but I had a second look, and I said, "That is the man," from the description the sexton had given.</p>

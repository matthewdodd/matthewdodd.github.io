                  </hi> On the 9th of June I was passing St. Andrew's-terrace, in the Waterloo-road, and saw the prisoner there—there was nobody with her—I went home with her to her house—I was to give her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after that, she took half-a-crown from me, for which she has been tried and acquitted—I wanted it back again—she would not give it me, and struck me over the legs with a pair of tongs—I would not go till I got my half-crown back—she called out for help, for assistance to get me out of the room—somebody else came in with a poker in her hand, and cut me over the bead with it—the prisoner did not say anything when the other woman came in, but struck me with the tongs across the knees—the blow of the poker laid my head open—I do not know how I got out of the house—the prisoner did nothing to me but struck me over the knees with the tongs—I went to the hospital.</p>

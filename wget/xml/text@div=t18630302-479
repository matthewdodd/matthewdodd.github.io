                  </hi>. I live at 2, Whitefriars-street, and am a bricklayer—on the night of 20th February, about half-past 10, I was coming along Bridge-street from work and met the prisoner; she was shaking with cold, and asked if I would give her a little drop—I gave her some gin, and after leaving, I went over towards my own place, and she came after me, put her arms round me, and asked me to go with her—I said, "No, not to<lb></lb>night;" and then I put my hand to my pocket and missed my pocket-book, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns and a half, and some postage-stamps.</p>

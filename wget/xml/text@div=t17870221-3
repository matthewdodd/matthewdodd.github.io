               <p>Did you see them join? - After what passed, I looked just to, and I saw the three men together near Mr. Brown's the cabinet maker's; they walked a little below Mr. Holland's the oil shop; they then got before me, and the three men passed me, and went and jostled against Mr. Hughes, and tripped up his heels.</p>
               <p>You were not walking arm in arm then? - No, my Lord; I had my little child in my arms; Mr. Hughes was tripped up; he fell against the bars of a cellar window; then I saw the prisoner on Mr. Hughes; Mr. Hughes cried out he had lost his watch; and laid hold of the prisoner; Mr. Hughes had his cane in his hand; the prisoner had one end of the cane, and Mr. Hughes had it also, so that I cannot say Mr. Hughes had the cane totally in his hand; he attempted to take the cane from Mr. Hughes, when he collared him, he carried him into the house of Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner; is he the man that he carried into Mr. Holland's house? - Yes; he never lost sight of him after the dispute about the cane; they never were parted.</p>

               <p>In what condition was Mr. Hughes, was he drunk, or was he sober? - He was not sober, nor he was not in liquor; he was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Was he sober enough to know what he was about? - He certainly was, my Lord; he immediately cried out he had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Was the boy searched that night? - Yes, nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Were there many people in the shop where the prisoner was carried into? - Mr. Holland was there, and two more gentlemen came in; but none of the people from the street.</p>

On Saturday night, 4th June, about. 5 o'clock, the deceased came up to me bleeding from four or five cuts on her face and eye—she made a complaint to me, and mentioned a person's name, in consequence of which I took the prisoner in custody, and told her she was charged with an assault on Elizabeth Ellis, and cautioned her—she said "I did it, there is the remainder of the cup I threw at her"—I had never seen Jane Ellis before—I afterwards took her to the London Hospital, and on 7th July saw her there dead.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—Jane Ellis was admitted there on 4th June—she had two or three small lacerations about her face and scalp, and was suffering from slight concussion—there was a wound on the left side of her head, and another on the right of her nose, which was of the most consequence; it went down to the bone—erysipelas set in about a week afterwards—she was ill for two or three weeks, and then died of erysipelas—in all probability erysipelas would not have set in if she had not received those wounds—we find small wounds about the face exceedingly likely to take erysipelitic action, but she might have had erysipelas if she had not had the wounds—it is improbable—the cause of death, in my opinion, was exhaustion attendant on the erysipelas—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187007110054"></xptr>
               <p>if this cup had been thrown at her when it was whole, it would very likely have caused such wounds—I think it very unlikely that the cup would give her concussion of the brain; a blow might have caused it, but it would re-quire a good blow—I cannot tell the state of the blow, or of her general health, but if she was in a bad state of health erysipelas would set in more readily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's son—on 4th June she was it home when I went in—I knew the deceased—she had no name whatever—she was not Jane Ellis, and she was not Jane Waterson—she was there when I went in, sitting on a chair, and my mother, who was sitting on the other side of the room, told her to go out, for she was apprehensive of an altercation—she said it would be best for her to go out—the deceased had a petition in her hand to raise a subscription to bury an unfortunate girl, the daughter of a man she had cohabited with, and this Mr. Ellis had at one time come and assisted me and my father when we had a child to bury, and we thought we could not do less than return it—I gave the deceased a shil-ling for my father and myself—there was then a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> between my mother and her about some back debt—my mother said that the daughter had been tattling and backbiting—bad names were used, and the deceased struck my mother a severe blow on the mouth and cut her mouth, which was bleeding at the station—they were both the worse for drink, and they struggled, and the woman fell—my father said "For God's sake will you go out?"—I asked her to go out, and she would not, and my mother ordered her out—she went towards the door, and my mother picked up a cup off the table, when I had hold of her, and threw it—it struck the deceased, to the best of my belief, in the face—she walked about some considerable time, till she saw an officer—there was blood on the deceased before the cup was thrown, from a clout with the hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gun-maker and dock labourer—I lived with the deceased as a wife—for the years I have known her her name has been Jane Waterson—she might take a glass now and then, but she was not a drunkard—she got tipsy sometimes—I afterwards saw her dead—I have known her fourteen years—she has not been subject to erysipelas.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On Whitsun Saturday, about 12.30, she came to my door and wanted to see my husband. She had had a little to drink. I said she could not see him, as he did not get to bed till 3 o'clock that morning. I asked her to go, very civilly. She wanted to stand in my passage and annoy the people opposite, but I would not let her; I put her out at the street door, and went on with my work. About 1.30 she came again, and got in on to the door mat; I got all the skin off my hand getting her out again, and shut her out. She came a third time, and said she would not go without seeing my husband. I called him up, and she spoke about the petition. She would not go out, and as I went to put her out, she spat a mouthful of filth in my face. I took her by the shoulders, and she fell and struck her head against the door. My teeth were knocked out, and in my passion I took the cup and threw it at her. I was driven to it. The skin is off my leg now.</p>

I am a harness maker, of 12, Dudley Street—on the night of 26th November I was coming up Queen Street, Seven Dials, between 10.30 and 11 o'clock—three persona who were coming down on the same side gave me a shove, and two of them seized me while the prisoner put his hands in my pockets, but there was nothing there—the others struck me, but whether with a kick or a 'blunt instrument I do not know, but my eye was damaged—I kept hold of the prisoner, and a policeman came and took him—the others ran away—I had drank a little, but I knew what I was about—I do not say that the prisoner struck the blow.</p>

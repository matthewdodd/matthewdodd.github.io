                  </hi> I am a City detective officer—in consequence of information I went with two other constables to Barking churchyard, Tower Hill—I there met Brough—I told him we were detective officers, which he knew, and that we should charge him with being concerned with a prisoner of the name of Howe and William Buckley in stealing a quantity of Cork carpeting and some hearthrugs, which we had since received from Mr. Joues, of the Two Chairmen public-house, Wardour Street, Soho—he said, "I know nothing of the robbery"—I then took him to his house, which was close by, searched it, and found nothing there—we then con<lb></lb>veyed</p>

Temple and Co., say they thought it well to be rid of him—the book of the department is the book I am referring to; this is it; things sold from the Cork depart<lb></lb>ment would be entered here—there is no special book in which things sold by one servant to another would be entered—each department has a book—these pieces of carpet are the pattern that we sell from—we have no retail shop—if a hearthrug was wanted to match a carpet it would be Brough's duty to match if, the pattern would be brought back again—it would be of use to sell, and as a pattern—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—patterns go out of fashion—these pieces are not sold by one servant to another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Knightsbridge. One 18th Dec. I met a young man for whom I had been making a waistcoat, near the bar at Kensington—he paid me for the waistcoat, and we went into the Goat, and had some bread and cheese, and a pint of ale—I saw four persons there—the prisoner was one of them—I had no talk with them—they were passing some remarks on me; what it was I do not know—I and the young man left the public house about 12 o'clock—we went down the Gloucester-road—I observed the four persons that I bad seen in the public-house were following us—my friend left me just by the Gloucester-road, and I waited a few minutes as I saw the four men following me—I waited till the placeman came—he passed, and they were wishing him good night—I waited a few minutes for them to go—they came up to me, and smothered my face in mud, and the prisoner said, "Pin the b—r's petticoats over her head"—my pocket was cut off, and they opened a knife, and said they would rip me up if I hallooed—I hallooed "Murder!" and "Police!"—they took my handkerchiefs and my money, and all ran away—when the policeman came up, I went to the station—the prisoner was not taken till the next day—I did not see him before the Tuesday—this happened on Saturday evening—the prisoner cut my eye with his fist—it was one who was not taken who cut my pocket off—the prisoner was by at the time—my gown and shawl were torn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I say anything to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you did by the Gloucester-road—I did not give a silk handkerchief to a young man in the public house—one of the <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> did not say to me, "I will give you a <hi rend="italic">tanner</hi>"—you and another did not pass me by, while the other <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> remained with me—one of them did not give me fourpence, and then want it back, and I would not give it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I speak a word to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you said, "Pin the b—r's petticoats over her head," and you cut my eye, and smothered my face with mud—I had not a black eye before—the eye was black and bleeding when I went to the station—this is my shawl that I had on, it has been cut and torn, and this is the gown from which the pocket was cut.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 251). I was on duty, and passed this witness and a young man talking under a lamp post—after I passed I saw four men standing on the opposite side, under a hedge, where no foot passengers passed—I turned on my light and observed the prisoner and two others standing together, and another person at a short distance off—I asked what they were about, and they said, "Looking after some women"—I told them to go on, and fearing something was wrong I stopped a short distance off—I heard a cry of murder, and police—I came back and found the prosecutrix</p>

               <p>with her face covered with mud; her eye was bleeding fresh; her pocket was cut out of her gown, and her shawl all torn—there was nothing the matter with her when I passed her just before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How many were together when you met us? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three; you and Dooley and Lane were together, and Keith was at a distance from you; I could distinctly see this girl's face as I passed; she stood under a gas lamp at the corner; you were not walking along the road, you were standing on the side of the road, in the dark; I asked what you were up to, and you said, "Looking after some women," and I told you to go home; I did not ask you how your arm was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> A man said, "That policeman that broke your arm is watching you, and he will give you three months;" I said, "I will go home;" I went home, and the next night I came to you. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, you were taken, and when you were in the cell you said to me that if I got you off you would divulge all about the others.</p>

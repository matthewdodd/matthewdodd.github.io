                  </hi>. I belong to the Cameron West Indiaman. Last Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, I was in the King William public-house, New Gravel-lane—I found the prisoner there—I had known him by sight, for about six months—we had bad a quarrel, and I asked him to have some gin, to show that I bore no malice—as we were in the passage, coming from the bar, he put his hand into my pocket, and took out my money—some of it dropped, and while I was picking that up, he absconded—I had one sovereign and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, in that pocket—I believe I had two half-crowns and eleven sixpences—I lost in all 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he took out of my waistcoat pocket—I did not see him again till Sunday afternoon, when I found him in a public-house, called the ship, if Farmer-street, and gave him in charge.</p>

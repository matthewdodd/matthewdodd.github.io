On 2nd July I went with her to the shop, and told her she had given me the tickets; she said that she was very sorry I should say that, as she was likely to lose her situation if it was known, and it would be a great loss to her, as her husband was in bad health, and that was all she had to live upon; that it was much better to settle it, and asked if my father could help me. We went to the shop, and I told Mr. Laitcham I would pay for what I had had; he said that he wanted the money down. I said that I was not prepared. I cannot write anything like these tickets; what tickets I have had she has given me. I was remanded twice because she would not appear.</p>

            . I met the Prisoner in Water Lane by the Custom-house; she had something in her apron; I asked her what she had got there; she said, go look, with that I rummaged her, and found it to be tobacco, which I carried to his Majesty's warehouse. The next day she came to me again, and desired me to give her her apron; I told her I could not do that, it was not in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174502270020"></xptr> power. I acquainted Mr. Clack the Keys Constable with it, and she was taken up.</p>

            . Mr. Sturgeon brought the Prisoner to me, and asked me if I knew her. I said I knew something of her face, but did not know that she ever stole any thing. I took her to be a dealer, one that buys from them that steal. She told the sitting Alderman she would be hanged before she would confess. I believe she deals in uncustomed tobacco. <rs id="t17450227-24-verdict125" type="verdictDescription">

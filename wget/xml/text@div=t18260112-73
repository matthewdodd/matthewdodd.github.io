            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Priddle. I was the only man to see the bricks delivered that day; these 800 bricks were not delivered; the prisoner was not there at all that afternoon; he sent the delivery ticket on the Tuesday following, by a man - I said I was positive there were no such bricks delivered - he then came himself, but I would not take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did it state on the ticket that they should have been delivered on the 17th? A. Yes; and the prisoner said he had delivered them on the spot, but there being no person there to take the ticket he was forced to take it away; but I knew they had not come; I had only left the yard at twelve o'clock, to take my dinner at the Woolpack, which is just opposite, and I could see the yard all the time; there was a bricklayer and a labourer at work there; nine or ten loads of bricks were delivered that day, but I am sure the prisoner brought none; when the bricks were delivered the carter delivered the tickets, which I gave my master the same evening - I was there from three o'clock till six.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have delivered bricks scores and scores of times, when there has been no person to take the tickets - I delivered these bricks, and took the ticket next day.</p>

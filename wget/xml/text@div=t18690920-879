                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hodson, of 14, Lyndhurst Road, Peckham—Annie 'Bedford is my servant—on Thursday afternoon, 13th July, about 3 o'clock, she went out for a walk, with my children—I was in my room the whole time she was absent—my bedroom window is over the portico—my watch and chain, two brooches, and three rings, worth between 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were then safe; also two purses, containing 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my desk was safely fastened—I went down and opened the door for my nurse, when she returned, and, after going down to the nursery, and speak<lb></lb>ing to my little girl, returned to my room, not having been absent ten minutes, for I had looked at my watch before leaving my room—when I re<lb></lb>turned, I heard a rustle, and saw something like an elbow passing out at the window—my desk was wrenched open, on the bed, my papers were scattered about, my watch case and ring case were empty—two purses had been emptied of the money, and were left behind—one ring was left behind—the gate bell had been broken some time; I remember the prisoner coming and asking to mend it—I recognized him directly, at the station—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect having any talk with him, but he stood some time at the gate, and would not take "No" for an answer—it was broad daylight—I think he must have been more than once, as I recognised him so soon—I only said "No" to him from the window—I did not see anything of him on 30th July—I afterwards saw him in the dock, and recognized him directly—to the best of my belief, he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you tell us the date when he wanted to mend the bell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but it was not long before I was robbed—there is only a little garden, and I was in the sittings-room window; I do not remember whether it was open—I shook my head, and did not employ him to mend the bell—I do not remember whether he had a basket—I think he wore a black cap, but I cannot tell—there was nothing to attract my attention in his dress—a close wooden paling, like a park paling, 5 ft. or 6ft high, divides my house from the next; it is higher than I am—there are no trees or shrubs on the other side—the nursemaid had two children with her; one was not a baby in arms, it walked up the steps.</p>

I am Mr. Hodson's servant—on 30th July, I went out with the children in the afternoon—I returned about 4 o'clock, and' saw a pony and cart standing still in the square, about fifty yards from the home, and saw a man sitting in the cart—when I passed into the house, I saw the prisoner in the next garden, standing against the fence, and looking up at our portico and the windows—I passed about three yards from him—saw me, because when I looked at him, he walked away towards the gate, but he did not go out in my presence; he looked down at the ground—it was bright weather, and broad daylight—my mistress came down to let me in, and the prisoner was still in the garden, walking very slowly, and looking down at the ground—he wore dark clothes, and a very thick gold Albert chain—I did not see him again till he was in custody, on 8th August, when I was taken to Carter Street police-station, and saw seven or eight persons with hats on—I recognized him the moment I entered the door, but I was too frightened to speak, and did not say anything—he was wearing a hat too—Sergeant Ham said, "Is there anyone you know here"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Is this the man?" and went close up by the prisoner's side—I said, "Yes"—I had not said or done anything, or pointed to anyone, to let him know which it was.</p>

On Sunday morning, 8th August, about 7 o'clock, I went with Ranger to 8, West Place, West Square, St. George's Road, Southwark; that is about a mile and a half from Lyndhurst Road, Pcokham—we rushed up stairs, and in the second floor back room, we found the prisoner, lying in bed—I said, "Now, <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> get up, we want you for being concerned with another man in breaking into a house in the Lyndhurst Road, on 30th of last month, by means of climbing the portico, and stealing a quantity of jewellery"—he said, "I do not know what you mean"—I then saw Ranger find this bag hanging by the side of the bed, containing these housebreaking implements and skeleton keys—I said, "And there was another job done at Lewisham last night, but I cannot tell you the particulars of it now"—when Ranger found the bag, he said, "What is this, <hi rend="italic">Billy?</hi>—he said, "Oh, that is nothing"—in the bag were these two <hi rend="italic">jemmies</hi> and other housebreaking implements—this centre bit was found in a box in the front room up stairs, a large quantity of large skeleton keys, the keyhole saw, which is to saw the holes larger after the centre bit has made them—I took the prisoner to the station—the inspector placed him among a number of others, and Radford was sent for—I told the prisoner that he could place himself where he liked, and then left the room—one man was a milkman, another was a man who works about the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 7, East Place, West Square—on 30th July, I saw the prisoner looking at his pigeons—I saw him all day in the yard; he very seldom went out—I saw him all the afternoon, till about 4.30—I think he went in then—I can see them at tea, if I go up the yard—I know it was Friday, 31st July, because I was whitewashing my kitchen.</p>

Q.</hi> Did your husband know that you were white wash<lb></lb>ing the kitchen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he is not here—he did not help me—he has got his work to do—I made the whitewash myself, and put it on—it is a small kitchen—it took me two hours, as I also washed the paint—I did not borrow a brush—I have one of my own—that is the tot time.

               <p>done it since I have been there—my husband came home in the middle of it—I had to leave off to get his tea at 5 o'clock—I have never said any-thing about washing the kitchen before to-day—about 4.30, or from the to 5 o'clock, I heard Mrs. Bentley say to the prisoner, "Come in to your tea, Bentley," and I saw him at his tea—I saw Mrs. Simms there—there were no clothes in her garden, but there were cloths in Bentley's garden—there were no lines in Mrs. Simms' garden—it never hangs anything out there, because there is a shed—I have not been in Court—I was turned out—I have only been intimate with Mrs. Bentley, by speaking to her over the palings—I do not know John Sinclair but I have seen a stoutest man at Mr. Bentley's on Saturday nights—I had never been there before this happened—he let the pigeons out ever day—I have only lived there four or five months—Mrs. Bentley told me on Thursday that he was charged with burglary—she did not tell me the day, and I did not know the day the burglary was—she said on Thurs day that a robbery was committed, and that Bentley was taken no suspicion, and it was on the Friday I was whitewashing, and I said, "That was 30th July"—I told the Magistrate that I was cleaning the kitchen—I did not say, "Whitewashing"—I did not notice that that was not put down—I said that I was whitewashing on 30th July—I did not make a note of it—I knew it by my sister coming up from the country—she is not here.</p>

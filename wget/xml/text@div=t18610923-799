               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This was not the first conversation you had had at Birmingham with Mr. Dales, was it, about these matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—we had many conversations at Birmingham and in London—we had per<lb></lb>fect confidence in him at that time—we ceased to have confidence in him when he was made bankrupt, but not quite then; we had a strong opinions as to his straightforwardness for some few days after the bankruptcy—that was 17th August—our confidence lasted for some days after the bankruptcy—we became bankrupt on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. September in consequence of Mr. Dales bankruptcy—I cannot give you the amount of our debts—our liabilities included some acceptances we gave to Dales, and the whole amount, including those, was upwards of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but not a great deal upwards—I do not know what amount has been realised: I have not the smallest notion—it is more than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not prepared to swear that anything has been realised because I have not had access to the books, and have heard nothing of the matter—the first conversation with Dales was in January—we had had previous small transactions in December—we were not at this time dealing with Parker at all—the first parcel we sent to Parker on his own account was February 29th, 1860—(I saw Parker in Dales' office)—this continued for about three months: it closed on May 9th—the total amount of goods which Parker had on his own account was 3,267<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we had a person largely indebted to us named Debeck—I cannot tell you the amount of his debt, because I cannot tell what bills are paid—I have no means of telling you how much he is our debtor—I have not the particulars of bankruptcy here—I do not know whether those bills have been paid or not—I cannot tell you the amount of the debt at the time of the bankruptcy or of the goods not paid for without the balance-sheet—I can give you the total amount of goods we supplied to Debeck, it is 1,769<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I may be in error 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but under 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—I have not attributed our bankruptcy at all to Barker and Debeck's debts as well as to Mr. Dales—Dales made an assignment of all his property—I certainly did not press him to do so, on the ground that Barker and Debeck's debts, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230111"></xptr>
               <p>some others in Glasgow, had to involved us, that we must have his property to help us—we pressed him for the assignment because he promised us 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and afterwards 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then he reduced it to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had a telegram saying that we should have 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the following morning; but we were under no pressure from our bankers—we pressed him because we wanted his money to go on with, and I think I did say that in consequence of Debeck's and other losses we could not find the money; but we should not have stopped on that account, because we had 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left—we did not have a meeting in Birmingham or London before that assignment, in which we pressed Dales to take goods and got 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent advanced on them—I never dined with Mr. Dales near London-bridge—he dined with us at Ander<lb></lb>ton's hotel—that is the only place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect coming up with Mr. Thomson and Dales and discuss<lb></lb>ing his difficulties and your difficulties, and dining together in the middle of July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was in the middle of July—I did not tell him then that I would send him up any amount of goods if he could get 80 per cent on them; I said that we could let him have goods if he would pay for them—he was largely indebted to us in the middle of July, and I should think we sent him 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., worth after the middle of July—I said that I would send him up any amount of goods if he would pay for them; but I never heard such a matter mentioned as 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—I do not remember the date, I think it was early in July, 1860, that we discussed the defendant's difficulties, but not our mutual difficulties—we were not in difficulties at that time—we did not telegraph to Mr. Dales to bring him up from Maid-stone to meet us; and I do not know that it was done—I have no recollec<lb></lb>tion of anything of the sort—I believe the total amount of goods unpaid from May was 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which 11,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were supplied in July alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand that you supplied him with 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of those goods after July when you discussed his difficulties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I am not really clear as to the time in July when we met, I think it would be the early part of July—I have said that he was indebted to us at the time of that conversation less by 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than he is now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the whole of those goods sent up in July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> July 12th they commenced—the amount is 361<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., then we go on 13th, 14th, to the 21st, when we begin very large amounts, 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the whole of those goods in July were sent after the conversation about his difficulties—12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods were sent up in July—I cannot show any orders for them; they were given verbally in our counting-house in London—there were some written orders, but in July the orders were given verbally to me by Mr. Parker and Mr. Dales, and we went into the market to get them—it is impossible for me to say what part of these goods went in consequence of the order of Mr. Dales, and what part in consequence of Parker's; because, generally speaking, we had one or two orders from Mr. Parker—there was one letter read this morning; one of the letters ordering Borne sheeting—all the orders in July were supplied on the orders of Parker—he did not show me a piece of paper giving an account of his previous bankruptcy—I heard of it in June or July—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was shown to me in June or July—it is an account of his previous bankruptcy—he brought it out of his pocketbook—we were not aware that he was bankrupt before—that was before these goods were sent up—he had a patent for deoderizing—no proposal was made for my having a share in it: certainly not; nor was it proposed to assign it—there was no assignment except the deed—I do not remember an interview on 6th May, 1860, at Birmingham,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230112"></xptr>
               <p>at which my partner was present, at which we agreed to assist Mr. Dales to the extent of a considerable sum of money to carry on the patent—we never agreed to assist him at all—I remember an interview at which we agreed to accept bills for Mr. Dales; that was, I think, 5th May, 1860—on that oc<lb></lb>casion we accepted bills for his accommodation to 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a bill of his due on 26th May, for 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was also a bill of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then running—those two bills the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did not cover over transactions at that time—on April 24th we sent him 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the total amount of debts that we claim now from Mr. Dales; it is about 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. including the bills; I am speaking from memory only—that is for goods, and for the accommodation bills—when we gave him accept<lb></lb>ances which he wanted for his patent that includes the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. accommoda<lb></lb>tion bills—I do not think they have been paid, they fell due after the bankruptcy—the total amount of our goods is 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sorry I have not his balance-sheet here, or I could tell you exactly—I say that he cannot our bankruptcy—I did not say that we received nothing during July; certainly not—from the commencement of the transaction we received in bills paid and in cash 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we received 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash in July.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At this interview which I have alluded to on 5th May when the 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills were accepted, I believe a conversation arose about a contract with the Brighton Railway for some works? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ton are in error about 5th May, because it was in London these bills were accepted, in Dales' office—it was in London that I agreed to give them—he was not in Birmingham on 5th May—I was in London—I would not fix the date at all—I said that it might be 5th May—there was an interview in London at our office, and not at Birmingham, at which it was agreed to advance 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was not shown on that occasion; I never saw it before—I do not remember that it was explained to me that the contract on the Brookvills and Ottawa Railway required a large amount for its completion; some<lb></lb>thing? did not occur—it was not explained to me that a very large sum of money would be required for completing the contract on the Brockvills and Ottawa railway, nor to either of my partners, in my presence—I did not know that the contract was not completed, I never enquired, because it was on the door of his office—I had not such implicit confidence in him that I enquired nothing about it, but he said that he had agreed with Mean Gurney to advance upon them when they arrived—I did hear Simpsons name—the goods were supplied for shipping—Mr. Dales did not tell me that a person named Simpson would advance eighty per cent directly they was shipped—he told me nothing about Simpson—I asked him at the recasting at Manchester, when we had Mr. Dales with us, about his patent—I was asked if I had heard that the goods had gone to Simpson, and I said, "No, I never heard of his name"—the first time I heard Mr. Simpson's name was when he said, "No, that he had sent them to a person named Simpson—that was on 23d August, 1860—at the meeting of our creditors in the office of Sole and Worthington, solicitors, Manchester, I asked him the question, and he said that Simpson had made no advance upon them—I never heard of the Brighton Railway contract—I heard that he was trying to get a contract for a branch of some railway, but I do remember the name—he said that he had taken a contract with a railway company—we did not agree to advance him money and supply him with the means of going on with it—I do not know when we heard about the contract with the railway company, heard so many things; it did not interest us any more than if we sold the goods and got the money, and those were inducements to us give him</p>

               <p>credit, because we believed he was making money very fast—I do not know. then I first heard of the railway contract; it has gone altogether from my mind—on 10th May, the bill of 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. became due, and was dishonoured—on 11th July the bill of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., became due; that was before any of these goods were supplied—that was honoured—I do not know on what day I was first examined before the Alderman, it is about three months since—I do not know whether the examinations of myself and the other witnesses extended over a month—I neither suggested or produced these letters until to-day—I saw Parker there one day—I did not know that he was subpoened as a witness—he was not examined during my stay—I do not know how I happened to get these letters addressed to Carlton and Co.—they are people who we do business with, large merchants in Manchester, and to whom we were largely indebted—the bulk of these goods were supplied by Carlton and Co.—I think they are the largest creditors we had—it was in June that we had first knowledge of Dales' bankruptcy—it is impossible to fix a day; perhaps Mr. Thompson might; he is here—excuse me, I think I can tell you the date (<hi rend="italic">Looking at the bill-book</hi>), no, I cannot, for these bills are not entered here; they are in the official assignees hands—it was in June—on that occasion I believe I saw the piece of paper which you have put into my hands—it was not explained to me that the claim upon the Ottawa and Brockville Railway Company was in consequence of that uncompleted contract—he said that he had been bankrupt with his brother—we were not aware that his brother and he had been bankrupt—he said that he had paid all the claims of the bankruptcy except some 5 or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had no farther liabilities—I was sure he had not any contract with the Canada Railway since 1858, and had not become possessed of 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bonds since the bankruptcy—I presumed that that was before the first bankruptcy, and that he had that left after satisfying all demands, and that he had met those demands, with the exception of 5 or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we asked him for the 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of bonds, and he said that they were delayed in consequence of the new issue, and had not arrived in this country—the statement to us was, that he had 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest in the Brockville and Ottawa Railway Company—that was previous to our knowledge of his bankruptcy—I am referring to a conversation in June, when we heard that he had been brankrupt with his brother, and we asked him the question—he told us of his former bankruptcy, and that he had satisfied all the calls except 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bonds due to him—he produced that paper, and said that the whole of the liabilities of that bankruptcy had been satisfied except 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stated that since his first bankruptcy, he had still that 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that all was satisfied, and that this was die to him; that he had got 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest in the railway to meet the 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he still owed—I did not ask him if he had acquired that since his bankruptcy—he said that the Railway Company were in difficulties, and could not pay, and there was a new issue, in consequence of which he said was the non-arrival of the bonds—he did not tell me that the contract with the Railway Company was not completed, and I did not inquire—I mean to say that distinctly—he made no representation as to the sale of the patent for the fluid to the Leicester Manure Company—I heard him say once that he had some patents which were in use at Leicester—I did not wish him to go down and sell the patent in order to raise 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in order to get some cash—I supposed he was entitled to 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not go to the Bankrapley Court to make any inquiry—I am certain of that—I never said that I went to inspect the schedule of his previous bankruptcy—it never occurred to me</p>

               <p>to me to do it—we understood that hit former bankruptcy was discharge except that 5 or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and therefore we made no furthern enquiry about it—we made no inquiry about the Brockville and Ottawa Railway Company farther than what has been stated—we obtained an assignment from Dales on 10th August of all his property in it, and I suppose Mr. Hall, the solicitor, who made out the assignment for us, took possession of all his papers—on the 17th, we petitioned the Court of Bankruptcy for a adjudication; I believe that was superseded on the ground that it was made against good faith—I do not know whether it was the insufficiency of the act of bankruptcy, or the insufficiency of the assignment; I am not a lawyer—I never heard anything from Mr. Dales of the completion of the contract—I presumed he had done with the railway when he had got his bonds—there is a letter enclosing the bond which was seat over, allowing under what circumstances it was sent—I have not got it—there was no arrangement before the letter to send one as a specimen; we never asked our bankers, but Mr. Dales I believe did, to see whether they would advance him money upon it—I believe he went—we showed the bond to our bankers, not to ask for an advance of money, but to show that the bonds were arriving—we gave the bond into the hands of our solicitor, and it afterwards appeared that the bond was only borrowed, and not his—we were not pressed for money at all; we never were in difficulties with one banker's at all—our bills for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. became due on 5th August, and we were to have had 5,000., previously to that from Mr. Dales, and we received a telegram saying that he had completed a loan of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the money should be at Lubbock's on the day following—I went there and showed the telegram and requested that they would not honour our bills until they had the money—the bills were coming due on 4th August—it was about August 2d that I went to our banker's—they did not advance us money; you understood me wrongly, I said that we had bills coming due on 4th August, and we should have all this money on 1st August—Mr. Tomp<lb></lb>son come up on 2d August to see about the money, and telegraphed that on the following morning we should have the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at that time we were indebted to our banker's to a large amount, and these bills were coming due on the 4th, which would have made our account about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I went and showed the telegram, and said "If the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is there meet our acceptances, if not, refuse them, and we must call a meeting of our creditors because we cannot go on without"—we were indebted to our banker's between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in consequence of that we directed them not to honour bills then coming due.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What day was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The adjudication was dis-puted on Thursday, and this appeared on the following Saturday—it was 20th August, I think—I did not, at that time, know anything at all about the goods having gone to Simpson's—I did not, at that time, know that he bad no interest in the Canada Railway; I believed he had—it was before I knew the real position in which Dales stood—there had been no examination—Dales was in Birmingham upon our bankruptcy—we were opposed on the ground of that transaction with Dales—the matter was very fully inquired into by the Commissioner, Dales being called, and a great many other witnesses also—as the result of that, the Commissioner acquitted us of any fraud in the transaction, and we have got our certificate—I did not know till 23d August that any of our goods had gone to Simpson's, or been sold in any way than in the ordinary way of trade—if I had known that they had been sold to Simpson under cost price I should certainly not have sup<lb></lb>plied any more—I never heard Simpson's name.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you partner with Mr. Wood house, of Birmingham? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; our bankruptcy took place in September, 1860—I knew Dales in the beginning of June, 1860—I remem<lb></lb>ber his coming down to Birmingham either the end of May or the beginning of June—there were some bills given to him in the commencement of June—they were not exactly accommodation bills—Mr. Woodhouse gave the 4,000<hi rend="italic">/.</hi> worth which are due, with my knowledge—they were accommodation bills in a certain sense, be gave us some bills in return for part of the amount—I am sure of that—they are in the hands of the official assignee at Birmingham—I cannot say whether that was on 5th May, but I think it was not so early—there were bills given at different times—the first bills I believe were given in London—I believe there was an arrangement made somewhere in May, to let him have 4,000<hi rend="italic">/.</hi> on accommodation bills—I am not aware that that was to assist him in carrying on his patent for deodorising the Thames—he was our debtor at that time largely, but there were some securities—there is a list of them in the hands of our solicitor—I am not aware that there was a negociation between us for the assignment of the patent to us for disinfecting the Thames; not so early—I cannot fix the date when we first heard of that patent—I think I heard it mentioned before June that there was such a patent—when it was arranged between us that 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in accommodation bills should be given, I do not remember Mr. Dales telling me that he could get about eighty per cent. advance on goods if I would send them up—there was a bill coming due at the end of May of 849<hi rend="italic">/.</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was from home when that bill became due—I was not in London in the beginning of July—I may have dined with my partner, Mr. Woodhouse, and Mr. Dales in London early in July, but I do not recollect—he was indebted to us in the beginning of July to a certain amount—the goods we sent to him were sent in the regular way—I do not remember the meeting in London you refer to—we had no difficulties then—we may have dined at the same place—I remember him calling at Anderton's hotel; that was the hotel I stopped at when I was in London—I dined there with my partner and Mr. Dales; we could not discuss his difficulties there because we expected an amount of money from him—he had promised to pay us 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4,000<hi rend="italic">/.</hi> in the beginning of August—I do not recollect any meeting at the beginning of July at which we discussed his difficulties—Mr. Woodhouse managed these matters himself with Dales—the first time I saw Dales was in the month of June—I was not in London when Dales gave the assignment of his property; I was in Birmingham—I recollect the receipt of this letter of 2d August (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) we were in no difficulties at all at that time—we bad never had a returned bill at that time—no arrangement had been made</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Deptford, and am a tallow<lb></lb>chandler. The prisoner had been in my employ for five or six years—on Saturday, the 16th of February, he came to work, about five minutes before seven o'clock, and hung his coat up in the usual way, about a quarter of an hour afterwards I felt down his coat, but found there was nothing—on my return from tea, at half-past five o'clock, I placed my body against his coat, while looking at his work, and felt something bulky in the pockets—I took no notice, but let him go on till he had finished work at half-past seven o'clock, and as he was passing the front-shop, I told him I suspected him of having robbed me—I sent for a policeman, and he found 2 1/2 lbs. weight of tallow in one of his coat pockets, 2 1/2 lbs. weight of kitchen-stuff in another, and 2lbs. weight of kitchen-stuff in his hat—his house was searched, and some more found there.</p>

The patrol, after we had been in the watchhouse some time asked me if I should know the man that took my chain and seals if I were to see him. I told him I thought I should; I went out with the patrol, there were a great many of them about the place; I pointed our the man to the patrol, I then went into the watchhouse for safety; there was some error between the patrol and the watchman, they brought in some other man that was not there. The patrol said, here is a great number of them about here, I had better look out, I did, I saw the prisoner Daniels, whom I identified; he was taken into custody.</p>

On the 31st of May, the prisoner Smith was brought into the watchhouse Mr. Potter gave charge of him; the inspector went out, Mr. Potter pointed to a man that pulled the chain and seals from him; he brought in a man, Mr. Potter said he was not the man; after going out again this Daniels was pretending to be very drunk; Mr. Potter immediately pointed to this man that pulled his chain and seals off, and gave charge of him.

               <p>of the 13th of October I was in my office, and heard, what I thought was glass break up stairs—I went up to the hack-room second-floor, and found the prisoner packing up a variety of articles in a bundle—it was tied up—most of the articles belonged to my brother, and some to me—I collared him—he said he had been sent by my brother for them—I took him down stairs with the bundle, which was tied up in his own handkerchief, and gave him in charge—a cloak, belonging to a friend, was found in addition to the other things.</p>

             . I am a Pawnbroker, and live in Hart-street, Covent-Garden . The Prisoner brought Goods to me fourteen different Times; the first was in July, and the last about the middle of December. All these Goods were pawn'd with me by the Prisoner, and she said, the Person who own'd them, was an Acquaintance of her Mistress, and was at Law. I have lent her half a Crown, 3 s. 20 s. and 30 s. on Goods, but 36 s. is the largest Sum that I ever lent her at a Time. - I did not ask her every Time she came with the Goods, whose they were, because I had known her a long Time; I have taken Things of more Consequence than these from her, and always thought her honest.</p>

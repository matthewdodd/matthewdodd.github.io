                  </hi>. I am single, and live at present at No. 25, Harrington-square, Hampstead-road. About May, 1853, I resided at No. 16, Southamp<lb></lb>ton-street, Fitzroy-square, with my sister Martha—the two prisoners at that time resided in lodgings nearly opposite—I was sometimes in the habit of walking with my sister in the square, not in the enclosure; and in doing so I was accosted by the elder prisoner—he apologized for speaking to me, and said that he had been making inquiries, and found that I had just arrived from the country, and he wished he knew some of my friends, or else he would have had a regular introduction—I requested him to leave me, and he bowed, and did so—he wrote to me the same evening, I think it was, and appointed a meeting, but I did not go, I went with my sister somewhere else—he wrote again, and in consequence of that I met him, and an acquaintance commenced—I have neither father or mother—I had property in the funds, from my father, upon which I lived—the elder prisoner told me that his name was <hi rend="italic">Turenne 0'Keil</hi> (the younger prisoner was not with him then), that he was single, and that his intentions were perfectly honourable—I did not infer that he was single from his saying that his intentions were honour<lb></lb>able, he said so distinctly—he told me that he had been residing some years on the continent, and a great deal about himself—he said he had a title, which he did not make use of, on account of the whole of his property being tinder seal,</p>

               <p>or confiscated, in France, in consequence of his different political opinions—the next day he came up and spoke to me when I was with my sister (the younger prisoner was not with him at that time)—he merely told my sister what he had said to me, with respect to his intentions—he repeated, in her presence, that he was a single man, because she raised a great objec<lb></lb>tion to Mr. O'Keefe speaking to us—the second time that my sister was with me, he brought the younger prisoner, and introduced him to us both as his nephew; we were then in Fitzroy-square, not in the garden—the younger prisoner addressed the elder as his uncle—in these meetings marriage was proposed; he spoke of it constantly, because meeting him like that, he was obliged to say what his intentions were—he said at the very first meeting that such was his intention, and he confirmed that afterwards—he did not propose at the first meeting, but he said his intentions were honourable—he proposed about three weeks afterwards, and I accepted him—after this he was always exceedingly attentive and polite, and I looked upon him in the light of an accepted lover and an intended husband—this went on for more than twelve months—it is now a year and a half since the acquaint<lb></lb>ance began—about a month after our acquaintance began, we were driving in a carriage with my younger sister and the younger prisoner, whom he sent to make inquiries at several places, and when the younger prisoner came out, the elder one inquired of him anxiously, "Have you succeeded?" he said, "No;" and then the elder prisoner was in a dreadful state of mind, and told me that he was exceedingly annoyed for money, that he had given his word of honour to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had not got it—when we returned home he asked me if I would lend him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did so—he addressed the younger prisoner as "Turenne"—a week or two afterwards he asked me to lend him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did so—soon afterwards, in July, he asked me to lend him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did so—he told me, in his son's presence, how much dis<lb></lb>tressed he was for money; that it was through political affairs in France; that he had an action brought against him, and had to pay costs, and that it was utterly impossible for him to get any money, as it was all locked up—I had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash at that time—after that he borrowed 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me; it was in Aug.—we were in a carriage which he had hired, and he went into his solicitor's, Mr. Edwards, in Cannon-street—I and my sister were in the carriage—he sent down by the clerk a note, which has since been destroyed; it was torn up in the presence of the younger prisoner—it stated that he was very much pressed for money; that if he did not have it it would be the ruin of him, and asking me if I could let him have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent him back a verbal message, "No"—he pressed the matter very much, but I had already promised to lend my sister money—he came out and spoke to me—he said it was exceedingly annoying, but he must have that amount, or else the case would fall to the ground—in the presence of all, my sister Martha said that she could do with less, if I liked to lend it to Mr. <hi rend="italic">O'Keil</hi>—we went home, and he waited—I went out into Fitzroy-square with my sister, and gave him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—between 18th and 31st Aug. he said he was going to Liverpool to try the cause there—he applied to me again for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he knew that I should be in the receipt of more money, because he had asked me all about it first, and I had told him—he afterwards went to Liverpool, and wrote to me to go down there—I did not go at first, and he wrote again, and I and my sister went; he had engaged lodgings for us; we had apart<lb></lb>ments in a lady's house, hired lodgings—it was in Pembroke-place, I think—he then asked me, in the presence of his son, in the drawing-room, for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave it to him; that made 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was not on the day we</p>

               <p>got there; we were there about a week or a fortnight, I am not certain which—we went about with him there, and on our return back to London, the elder prisoner asked me for more money—we were to have been married before we went to Liverpool, but he put it off because of this law suit—no day was fixed, but dresses and everything of that sort were prepared, and a travelling dress, as we were going abroad—when he wrote to me to come down to Liverpool I imagined that I was to be married there—after return<lb></lb>ing from Liverpool I took apartments with my sister, at North-crescent, Bedford-square—as we were going to Brussels we came to town, and chose them ourselves—the elder prisoner wished me to go abroad, because he said he should be obliged to go abroad himself, and he had rather be married at Brussels, because it must be kept very secret, an his friends wished him to marry some relation, and that there were other reasons—I went to Brussels with my sister, and he came to us there in about a fortnight—we went to Mrs. Matthews, who keeps a private boarding-house—we were recommended there by friends in England—he only had 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me there—I stayed there about three weeks, and then went to my married sister in Calais, who brought me up—her name is Mrs. Dangerfield—her being in Calais was the reason I was in London alone—I afterwards returned to England at O'Keefe's request, to sell out a Sun Fire Office share—my sister Martha did not come with me.</p>

O'Keefe came over in the end of Jan.—my married sister had come over from Calais part of that time, and was with me—about Feb. this year, when Mr. O'Keefe had come over, he asked me to leave Mrs. Cox's, because he did not like coming there, and he said, "We must be married now"—this was after he had fixed the day in Jan—after this he stated that the reason why he did not marry was because he should lose 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—at that time, when I had given him all I had, I heard that he was married; it was owing to a dis<lb></lb>agreement—I told him how cruel it was of him to deceive me, and that I heard that he was a married man—he said it was true, but that he could marry, as he was divorced from his wife, in consequence of her being insane—I told him the same evening that I heard that his name was not O'Keil, but O'Keefe—he asked me who told me that (the truth is that it was more supposition than anything else)—I told him that my brother-in-law, Mr. Dangerfield, had told me; that he had said that he had his doubts—he said it was not O'Keil, but O'Keef—when I paid the sums of money to him the younger prisoner has seen me do so—I parted with my money because I believed that we were to be married, and that he was a single man—I re<lb></lb>member his being taken up—I met him a short time before that, in Vine-street, Regent-street, about 12 or 1 o'clock in the day—I cannot say who spoke first; we shook hands, and were good friends—I asked him whether he intended to return me the money, and said, "Because how do you suppose I am to live, if you do not return me the money?"

                  <hi rend="italic">The following letters were here read:</hi>—"Tuesday. 8th Aug., 1853. 11, Brownlow-street, Liverpool. My dear Miss East. Although I appreciate the motive for refusing my request, yet I must say that the tone in which you expressed your objection and determination, is, to say the least of it, extremely humiliating to my feelings. I feel the more deeply wounded, as you are the very last human being from whom I expected a doubt, much less a reproach. As I am a gentleman, I assure you that my motive in making the request was most religiously pure. In a word, I wished to see you on a matter of mutual interest, one which I cannot fully enter into in writing, and which I must defer till after my law suit, which I hope will be decided on or about the 16th or 17th instant. I believe I named to you that I had an important law question to <hi rend="italic">decide here;</hi> this, together with the utter impossibility of my leaving just now, urges me to trespass upon your good nature. As to scandal, you ought not to forget, that at the risk of great injury to my health (the consequences of which I have since felt), I prevented you taking a step which would have given food to scandal mongers. Do not suppose that I name this with any intention of finding fault with you; no, I am too sensible and grateful for the feeling which actuated you <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, and I now refer to it, to disarm your mind of any doubt as to the intention on my part I am not a man to pen honied words; I pride myself on my actions—time will convince you of this. I trust, <hi rend="italic">en attendant</hi>, that you will credit me when I say that I would not lose your good opinion or esteem for any worldly consideration; your undivided con<lb></lb>fidence, free from all doubt, would indeed be a treasure. I am sorry, very, very sorry, you indulged in that ridiculously common-place phrase, 'If I had been regularly introduced to you,' etc. etc. At the risk of offending you, I must say it is a sentiment unworthy of you; and when applied to me, it is unjust and offensive. Let me change the subject. I must tell you I am no longer bandaged up, my arms are free; I can write without pain, though not quite freely yet; this will now mend each day. Apropos, you also gave me a leetle rub about your health. Do you forget that you wrote to me that you were <hi rend="italic">quite recovered</hi>! only a little weak, etc. Ah! Mademoiselle Priscilla, you are somewhat capricious. There is, however, one consolation in your angry letter; and it is the kind manner in which you express your affection for, yours, most sincerely and truly, T. O'K. Love to the little fox; for she is one."—"Hotel de Normandie, 240, Rue St. Honore. 18th Oct., 1853. If you will be so kind as to examine or refer to my last, you will find that this very day I named as likely to me to return here. I hasten to answer your letter, my very dear friend; this will reach you to-morrow, on your birth day. To use a Spanish salutation, 'May you live 1000 years, and may your shadow never be less.'

               <p>indeed, I am serious, in wishing you, my dear Miss Priscilla, many happy returns. You accuse me of being cold and laconic in my letters: I beg once more to refer you back to some of my London letters, in which I dis<lb></lb>tinctly told you that I was a man of deeds, not of honied words. As to my affairs, I am still in <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>, and uncertain; everything proceeds slowly. I hope to be able to run down to pay you <hi rend="italic">mes homages</hi>, in the course of a few days; that is if you do not leave for England before, in which case be good enough to send your address. Please offer my best regards to Miss Martha, and direct as usual to me. I will send every morning for my letters. I find I am too late to post-pay this; indeed I fear much this will not go before to-morrow morning, which I need not say will be a sad disappoint<lb></lb>ment to yours, most sincerely and truly, T. O'K. I write before I unpack, and yet I find I am too late.")—(<hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter, dated</hi>, "Bordeaux, Nov. 16, 1853. To-morrow, D. V., I start on my long journey; but rely upon it, neither absence nor time will ever cause me to forget for one single moment one who has given me such proof of affection and confidence.

My dear Miss East,—My uncle has just tapped at the wall, and desires me to write you a few lines. He fears he was brusque in his manners when you awoke him suddenly, which would indeed be ungrateful for your kind thought and welcome present. The sudden start has brought on a frightful headache. The doctor, who has since called, and was very much annoyed at seeing anybody in the parlour, has given strict orders to everybody in the house to allow nobody whatever, under any circumstances, to see him. They expect a crisis one way or the other about 11 or 12 o'clock to-morrow. I earnestly implore you not to see my uncle again till I call on you to-morrow, which I will do after the doctor's consultation in the morning. I would call to explain this matter to you myself, but am forbidden to leave the house. Yours very truly, Turenne. P. S.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your attention directed to Mr. O'Keefe, or his to you, before you met him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I used to see him sitting at the window when I was at dinner—I did not make signs to him, nor did he to me—I never held up music paper to him, and made signs—my sister was there; she is not here to-day—I cannot say for certain whether she has been examined before the Magistrate—I mean to say that I did not in the first instance make signs to Mr. O'Keefe from the window, certainly not—it was about three weeks after that that we met in Fitzroy-square—I bad seen him from day to day at the window before we met, and I am sure he saw me; he could see into the room—the window was open, and I sat at the head of the table—I did not shut the window when I saw a strange man; I was not at the window, I was at the dinner table—he did not offer me marriage the first time we met, but he said his intentions were perfectly honourable, and he spoke of marriage to me very shortly afterwards—on the first occasion when we met, I had seen him leave the house about two hours before, and he met me at the corner of the square—on that occasion, I requested him to leave me immediately, and he did so, I think, in two minutes—after that he wrote to me—all the first letters were destroyed by Mr. O'Keefe's particular</p>

               <p>request—I have produced letters from Liverpool—it was before I left town that he requested me to destroy all letters, as we were going abroad—when he wrote to me, I did not meet him at first—shortly afterwards I met him in Fitzroy-square again, in company with my sister; and I went out with him, in company of my sister, in a carriage, after he had introduced his son—we did not go to the theatre a few days after I had met him—I did not go and dine in the Haymarket with him, not until lately—it was just before we went to Liverpool; there was I, and my sister, and his nephew, and himself—I did not go to the play with him—I dined with him in the Hay<lb></lb>market, at the Hotel de Paris; and his son and my sister went to the play, because he wished Martha to see it; but Mr. O'Keefe was taken so very ill at the hotel that he did not go—he had told me that he had broken his ribs, but was much better, and if I would go to the Hotel de Paris, he would meet me—I represent that to be the truth, positively; but it was the man who brought the letter who told me, and he said in the letter that he feared he had broken his ribs—he and I remained in a private room at the hotel till my sister returned—she went about 9 o'clock; I do not know whether it was to the half price—they did not go to the whole of the play—they came back as soon as it was over, about half past 11 o'clock, because we got home about 12—on my oath, they did not go to the first part of the performance—the piece they wanted to see was Villikins and his Dinah—it was not the Haymarket, it was the Olympic—they went from the Haymarket to the Olympic, and came back to us at the hotel—MR. O'Keefe was exceedingly ill all the time he was alone with me—he had had an accident; he was going down stairs, and slipped, and injured his ribs very much—we were talking all the time we were alone—I had not to call in the attendance of a doctor—there was supper at the hotel when my sister came in; it was wine and biscuits—there was no wine on the table when my sister left us together, as Mr. O'Keefe was so ill—he was lying on the sofa all the time—I think I had known him about three months then—we afterwards all returned home—I went to Liverpool at the end of Aug.; it was just before that—MR. O'Keefe wished to be referred to my brother, but I could not then, on account of some family matters—none of my family, except my younger sister, were aware that I was engaged to be married to Mr. O'Keefe—he wished to be married secretly—my younger sister was aware of it; he spoke of it in her presence—there is no member of my family here, or any friend, to whom he spoke of marriage—I knew the parties I lodged with in Southampton-street, but Mr. O'Keefe never came there, it was kept so perfectly private—I did not, a few days after I knew him, offer to come to his rooms disguised as a boy, never—when he broke his ribs I wished to see him, and it was to prevent my going to see him that he proposed going to the Hotel de Paris—he said he was so much better that it would relieve my mind if we all dined together—Turenne had said that he thought his uncle was dying, and of course I was very unhappy about it—I wrote to him in Southampton-street, and said, "Shall I come and see you?" and it was to prevent my coming to see him that he asked me to meet him at the Hotel de Paris; he sent word round that he was so much better—I did not offer to go disguised as a boy, but as an old woman—I did not know how I could go without anybody knowing me—I did not know how I could manage to see him without the people of the house where I resided knowing it—I did offer to go disguised as an old woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you get a boy's dress for the purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I thought of it—I offered to go disguised.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a boy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Disguised any way; this (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) is the letter I wrote to Mr. O'Keefe, offering to come over disguised—I had some thoughts of having a boy's dress; I did not know how to disguise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you had some thoughts of a boy's dress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An old woman's dress, I thought it was—this was just before we went to Liverpool—the step which he prevented me from taking, which he mentions in one of his letters, was putting on the disguise—in Oct., 1853, I went over to Antwerp; Mr. O'Keefe was to meet me there, to receive the 262<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the reason I left Calais—I went to him with the money—I was at the Hotel de St. An<lb></lb>toine at Antwerp two nights—I went over by one boat, and came back by the next—I should have returned the same day, but there were no means—Mr. O'Keefe was not at the same hotel—he merely came to draw up a memorandum—he did not dine with me alone—he did not spend the evening with me; he was only there long enough to count the notes and to write certain documents—I most certainly did not invite him to come up to my room and spend the evening with me; but when I was at dinner, the chambermaid asked me for the key of my room, and when I went; Mr. O'Keefe was there writing some letters—I was not in his company during the time I was at Antwerp, because he only went to fetch me to go to Brussels with him and make purchases, and we came back—we dined together at Brussels, at the table d'hote—he did not take tea with me at Brussels, most certainly not—I was at Antwerp all night; I did not stay at Brussels, I only went there and made purchases—it was in the spring of this year that I first became aware that Mr. O'Keefe was a married man—I will not be certain whether it was as early as February; it was not as early as January this year—I became acquainted with the fact of his mar<lb></lb>riage and of his name being O'Keefe at the same time, on the same day; it was in the spring of this year, at the time he was expecting his son over—after he had told me that his wife was alive, he said that his son was coming over—I never was aware that this young man was his son until that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this letter of 27th Oct., 1853; do not you here ask him for his son's address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I explained to you how that was; at that time I did not know whether he was the son, but I fancied that I saw a great likeness at times, and that is the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Reading the letter</hi>). "Martha has written to the Isle of Man to inquire if his letters have been called for;" was not the son at that time in the Isle of Man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. O'Keefe had told me that—it was in 1853—I was in Brussels—my sister Martha corresponded with the son—he used to write to her constantly, and Mr. O'Keefe sent him to the Isle of Man to prevent the correspondence being kept up, as he saw that his son was getting very fond of her, because, he said, it would prevent our mar<lb></lb>riage, as the uncle could not marry one and the son the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Reading the letter</hi>). "I think, if possible, she will find out your son's address;" had not Mr. O'Keefe at that time told you that he was a married man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he never told me till the spring of this year, but I wrote that because I wished to find out whether he was the son, for three times Mr. O'Keefe, in speaking of different things, had said, "<hi rend="italic">my son;"</hi> I turned very pale, and he said, how very jealous I was; how could I suppose he had a grown up son of that age?—he told me afterwards that he had got a natural son in Paris, and that that was the reason he had made the mistake—I asked Turenne several times, "Are you the son?" and he told me "No" on his oath solemnly and sacredly—that was alter the money was advanced; he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180113"></xptr>
               <p>told me his uncle was single at the first—I did not always call him the son; I did once or twice, to see if he was deceiving me or not—this is my sig<lb></lb>nature to these depositions; they were read over to me before I signed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say here, "I used always to call him the son?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a mistake; I told them at the time that there was a mistake in the depo<lb></lb>sitions—I said so before the Magistrate and before everybody—I pointed out the mistake when my depositions were read over, but the Magistrate said it should not be altered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the mistake, "Martha was not acquainted with the younger prisoner as early as October;" was not the "not" struck out by your desire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Show the Jury any other mistake which was not corrected by the Clerk. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Levine, who was acting for Mr. O'Keefe, would not allow anything to be altered—I mean to say that—that was after the depositions were read over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, after you learned that Mr. O'Keefe was married, make any appointment or seek any interview with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me that he was regularly divorced from his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bid you after that make any appointment with him? (<hi rend="italic">The witness did not answer). Witness.</hi> This is my signature to this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he wished to make use of certain letters written by the witness to Mr. O'Keefe, and would take the opinion of the Court, whether he could comment upon them in his speech without having them read in the first instance. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that such a course would be irregular, at the circumstance of her being a witness for the prosecution would not make her letters evidence; but that if she denied facts put to her, the letters could then be put in.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he was quite willing that the letters should be read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you continued as lovers up to the conversation you had in Vine-street, Regent-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but he made me promise that I would wait a twelvemonth, and said that his wife could not possibly live a year, and that they were really divorced—I mean to represent that we continued as lovers during the whole of the time, till that conversation in Vine-street, Regent-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At Christmas, 1853, had you not entered into an engagement of marriage with a gentleman named Nott? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for a short time, at my sister's request, because Mr. O'Keefe had not written to me for some weeks—that is the Mr. Nott on whose account I advanced a lady 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I met him at Mrs. Cox's boarding-house in Southampton-street—I never met any other gentleman in Southampton-street to whom I was engaged to be married—I kept the engagement with Mr. Nott about three weeks, and then Mr. O'Keefe returned—I had known Mr. Nott some time, but not before I knew Mr. O'Keefe; I cannot say exactly how long afterwards, I do not recollect—it was after I returned from Calais that I became acquainted with Mr. Nott—that was in Oct., 1853: I then became acquainted with him—that was just after I had lent the money to O'Keefe—I was acquainted with him very nearly three months before there was a promise of marriage between us—we were not lovers during that time—he proposed to me four times, and the fourth time I accepted him—he first proposed marriage to me I dare say about two months after he knew me—I used not to go about with him in the way of courtship—he proposed to me in Southampton-street, and he spoke to my married sister, who came over and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180114"></xptr>
               <p>was stopping with me; it was at her instance that I accepted him, because she never approved of my acquaintance with Mr. O'Keefe—I told her that I was engaged to Mr. O'Keefe; he came as an accepted lover to her house—I told her I was engaged to him, and she was very much annoyed at my telling her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you, in the hearing of the Jury a short time ago, swear that your sister Martha was the only person who knew it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at that time, but I told my sister, Mrs. Danger field, afterwards—no one knew of it at that time except my sister Martha—when Mr. O'Keefe returned in January we were to be married, and as the marriage was so near, I thought I had better tell him everything, and I told him all about Mr. Nott, every single thing—O'Keefe was in France during the period I was engaged to Mr. Nott—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one handed to her by Mr. Parry</hi>) is my writing, and so is this other; it is addressed to Mr. O'Keefe, but it does not refer to him at all—this other letter is in my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have spoken of a conversation of a very extraordinary character between you and Mr. O'Keefe; up to the time of that conversation, do you represent that you had been on terms such as lovers are? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I men<lb></lb>tioned that conversation to Mr. Morgan before any steps were taken in this prosecution—I swear that—MR. Morgan examined me before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your deposition that does not appear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Morgan said that there was a great deal which need not appear in my depositions, because it would all come out on the examination—I cannot say how many times I was examined—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing.</p>

Doled, Wednesday</hi>, 12<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1854)—Miss East made several objections to only receiving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, interest, and said that he had agreed to give her an annuity of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I said, that in that case the principal sum would be lost—she started several objections, which I answered—she objected to the promissory note not being negotiated, and Mr. O'Keefe explained that the reason he made that stipulation was, that it might injure his son's name if she discounted it—she finally agreed to it—this is the bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this was an arrangement made in good faith, to the best of my knowledge, and was satisfactory to both parties—I am almost sure that a copy of the marriage settlement of Mr. O'Keefe was produced—I had a copy of it in my possession either then or shortly afterwards—that was produced to Miss East during the proceedings—that copy shows that the prisoner Turenne is entitled to about 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., between him and his brother, subject to the mother's power of appointment—I showed this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced, for</hi> 509<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) to Miss East after it was executed, after she came up from Brighton—in the account that was given</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180116"></xptr>
               <p>there were some payments of interest, reducing the amount—there had been about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid in reduction by Mr. O'Keefe—this was not finally the balance between them, but I took the promissory note on my own responsibility, because I was anxious to get the security for her—she wrote to me from Brighton—this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">part of this letter was read, as follows:</hi>—"Dear Sir, I was so flurried when I saw you in town with Mr., O'Keefe, that I dare say I did not make my wishes quite intelligible, and have to request that you will send me the document signed by Mr. O'Keefe, reserving a copy for yourself. Respecting the bill, I still feel that the date is too long; cannot you make it six months? failing in which, as my adviser, I think you should obtain some security beyond Mr. O'Keefe's name, and I trust you will do anything in your power to serve me," etc., etc)—on receiving this note, I did not delay at all in getting young O'Keefe's signature—this letter is dated 12th July, and the bill is dated on the 13th, so I must have got it instantly—Miss East understood what she was about.</p>

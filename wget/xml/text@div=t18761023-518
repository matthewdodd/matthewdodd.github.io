                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 21st September, about 8.40, the prosecutor came to the station, and I went with him, to a public-house at Poplar, and found the prisoner, who said that he had pawned the clothes, and got them from Baldock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>. "On Wednesday evening last me and the prisoner went to the Albion Theatre together; he there picked up with a prostitute; we waited there till it was all over and then went into a public-house and had some beer. He. then wanted to know if she would accompany him home for the night, she said she would not, because he had no money. He then said "I can get you some money in the morning, "but she would not go with him. He told her then to meet me at 9 o'clock next morning at the top of Robin Hood Lane, that I should take his things to pawn and take her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so as she and her son could get some things to go and live with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. If I had stolen his clothes it is not likely I should have pledged them in my right name in a place where I was known, and I should not have gone to a beer-house where the prosecutor would come and find me. If he did not want me to take the things, why did he take me to his house. I acknowledge taking them to pledge, but it was with his consent.</p>

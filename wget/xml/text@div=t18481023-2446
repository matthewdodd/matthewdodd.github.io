                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, Union-square, Tooley-street. Eliza Moynyon lodged with me fifteen months; the prisoner has been in the habit of visiting her for a year—on Tuesday morning, 10th Oct., they both went out about six o'clock, and returned about one, both intoxicated—they went into the room—I heard some quarrelling, I jumped out of bed, and went to try and quiet them—I parted them as well as I could—the woman was un<lb></lb>dressed and the prisoner was near her—I saw him give her a blow on her head with his fist—she fell on the bed and he kicked her in the head while she was lying there—she was bleeding from the head—I sent for a policeman—two came, and the prisoner was taken in custody, and Moynehan went to the hospital—I cannot be positive how many times he kicked her—he kept kick<lb></lb>ing her on the head.</p>

               <p>himself by the left hand, by the washhand-stand, and kicking Moynehan with the heel of his boot, as she was lying on the bed undressed, with her head towards the bottom—I saw him kick her violently with the heel of his boot twice—she was covered with blood—I seized him, and pulled him away into the next room—I told another constable to take charge of him, for I did not know whether he had killed the woman or not—I then went back, lifted her up, and in about a quarter of an hour she came to herself—I counted seven wounds on her head—I took her to the hospital, and after a week she was let out, to go before the Magistrate, but she never came, and the Magistrate granted a warrant to apprehend her—I found her in Tooley-street, not in the same house—I took her on the warrant, and she gave evidence before the Magistrate, and was bound over to prosecute—I have not seen her since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital. Eliza Moynehan was brought there—I examined her head, and found seven incised wounds, which seemed to have been bleeding profusely—blood was still oozing from some of them, and there was a great deal of contusion round some of them—she appeared very much excited—I have seen the pri<lb></lb>soner's boots—they are mounted with iron, and might make the wounds—a person leaning on a washhand-stand and kicking behind him, would be capable of kicking with considerable force—the woman was in the hospital seven or eight days, and attended twice afterwards as an out-patient—I did not examine the depth of all the wounds; I do not think the bone was reached—she went on very well indeed—she was in a very healthy state of body—erysipelas might have followed—when she first came she was quite insensible, and had the appearance of being drunk—that might be caused by the blows she had received—she complained of headache.</p>

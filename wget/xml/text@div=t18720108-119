                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, in the employ of Adolph Frankien and others, of 72, Wood Street, Cheapside, foreign importers—on the afternoon of 21st December, my trap was standing in Fenchurch Street, and also in Cannon Street—I left a boy in charge of the horse and trap—there was a box in front of the trap, under the driving-box, containing about twenty-seven dozen brier pipes, worth about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I returned to my employers, about 5 o'clock, the box was gone—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a por<lb></lb>tion of the pipes I lost.</p>

I was with last witness when I left Fenchurch Street—I saw the box containing the pipes under the driving-seat—we stopped again in Cannon Street twice—I saw a man, very like the prisoner, walking up and down in Cannon Street, with a cigar in his mouth—I could not swear to him—the box was not missed till the trap was unloaded.</p>

On 22nd December, in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I went to Mr. Alton's, a pawnbroker's, in Bishops<lb></lb>gate, and saw the prisoner there—the manager gave me three pipes, and said that the prisoner had offered them in pledge—I told the prisoner I was a police officer, and asked him how he came possessed of the pipes—he said "A man outside gave them to me; he did not know who he was"—I asked if he could point out the man—he said "Yes"—I went outside with him, and asked if he could see the man—he said "No"—he was carrying this box on his arm—I told him he must go to the station—in crossing the road he threw down the box, and ran away—I gave an alarm, and he was stopped and brought back—I searched him at the station, and found fifteen pipes, in cases, and one without a case, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in small money, and this duplicate of Mr. Roberts'—he refused his name and address.</p>

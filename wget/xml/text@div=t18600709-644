I am a shipwright, and live in Abingdon-road, Deptford—I was going home at half-past 11 o'clock at night, on 4th June—I was going up Dock-street and saw the prisoners; they stood in the way—I passed them, and they came behind us, and struck my mate—we went on to the Dock-gate to inform the guard, and they told us to go back and find them I out, and we did go back, and met them—I told them I knew them, and I should give them in charge in the morning, and they took off their belts I and struck me with them on the head, and on the left ear—they gave me I very deep cuts; my left ear was cut, and I had two cuts on my head—I did I not do anything; my mate called out for help—the people came and the I soldiers ran away—I went to the Dock-gates with the policeman, and the I prisoners came up; I am sure they are the men—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Leach about half-past 11 o'clock on the evening of 4th June; we were going along Dock-street—we saw three soldiers—they followed us, and knocked my cap off—I did not know any of the soldiers before—I went to the guard to see if we could get their names, and we could not—we went back to the bottom of the street, and the soldiers were all three there—Leach told them we should report them in the morning when we went in to work, and they stripped off their belts, and all three struck him—I did not go near them, I cried for help to the neighbour—they came out, and the soldiers ran away—Leach was hurt—his head was cut severely—he had cuts on his head and his ear—he bled—the blood ran down to his boots—I went with him to the station.</p>

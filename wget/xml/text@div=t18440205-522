The prisoner Brown entered my service a few days previous to Christmas last, as housekeeper and cook—she had lived with me in 1830, and then conducted herself with propriety—on the 26th of Dec., about half-past six o'clock, I left her in charge of my house—there was also a male, and a female (named Harriet) servants in the house, whom she had hired for me—I returned about eight, and found Brown gone—in consequence of suspicion, I exa<lb></lb>mined my plate-chest—I had left the key of the plate-chest on a bunch on the mantel-shelf of the common parlour—she had no charge of the keys—the key of my tea-chest was on the same bunch—I missed a silver teapot and biggin, two silver butter-boats and two gravy-spoons, a gold watch, chain and guard, a gold watch, seal and ring, a gold breast-pin, and some 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes and sovereigns, which were in a brown-holland sample-bag in the plate-chest; I also missed a cashmere shawl and scarf, and fourteen yards of velvet—I have since seen some of the jewellery, plate, and shawls in the policeman's hands—one of the rings cost me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and the other 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—the total value of he property was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;</p>

On the night of the 26th of Dec., about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Chapman-street, St. George's—Brown was tipsy—Maller asked me if I could direct them to Providence-street—I said, "Where is it near?"—she said, "Close to the railroad"—I asked what railroad—she turned to Brown, and asked what railroad she meant—she said, "Close by Euston-square"—they were about four miles and a half from there—I asked where they came from—Brown then dropped a bag at my feet, and took no notice—I said, "You have dropped something"—Maller took it up—I said, "There appears something like money in this bag"—Maller said, "It is only a little money and some things we have bought; this is my sister, and a married woman"—she said it being boxing-day, she had taken a little drop too much, and she was quite ashamed of her; could I direct her where to get a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I directed them towards the Commercial-road—after they were gone a short distance I went after them, and stopped them again—they had gone towards the Commercial-road—taking the bag from Brown, I said to her, "What money have you got in this bag?"—she made no answer, but Maller said, "About 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;"—I asked her if there were any notes—she said, "None"—I said, "I think it is not all right; you must go to the station"—Maller said, if I went to No. 5, Duke-street, the lady there would satisfy me that all was right—I took them to the station, and in the bag I found on Brown were three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and eight 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes, thirty sovereigns, twelve half-sovereigns, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper; a gold watch, a gold guard and chain, three gold pins, three gold rings, a seal, and three silver cruet-labels—I asked where she got them—she said they belonged to her, and her grandmother had given them to her—Maller had got a band-box, and in it a silver coffee-pot, coffee-biggin, two butter-boats, and two gravy-spoons, and she was carrying a bundle of velvet—I asked what money she had about her—she said a half-sovereign—I found on her two sovereigns, twenty-five shillings, and threepence-halfpenny—she said, "All these things belong to my sister"—I asked both where they got the plate from—they both refused to answer—they said they had not given their right names, and refused to give their address—I made inquiry—Mr. Savage came forward next morning, and claimed the property.</p>

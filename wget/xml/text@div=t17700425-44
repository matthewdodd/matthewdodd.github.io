As they came near me, I went to give them the way; one came upon my right shoulder, the other fronting me; just by the four cross roads, between two ditches, one of them said, I want your money; give me your money; stand: that I believe to be Green. I saw a pistol. He was fronting me: the other put his hand to my breeches pocket, and took out four-pence halfpenny; and took hold of the string of my watch and pulled it out. The inside case was gold; the outside was metal. The other asked me whether I had any more money; I told him, No, and desired they would not use me ill.</p>

(The watch produced and deposed to). It had a green silk string to it when I lost it. We took Green up that same afternoon in Tooly-street. A Jew had told me he had seen the watch in the hands of Clark. He described it. He directed me to a waterman that carried the prisoner's box, who told me where to find the prisoners. We went to where they lodged. I took Green first; Clark tumbled out of bed at our going into the room. We secured him, and charged the constable with them both. After that Clark owned where the watch was; but said he bought it of a sailor; then I went to Mr. Gregg's where he said the watch was, and there I found it.

He began to blast his eyes and limbs, and said, Would you have me go and search all Wapping, among all the thieves? I said, That is doing yourself no good. He asked us to go up stairs: we went up; there was Clark in bed. He got out of bed. The prosecutor said that was the other: then we laid hold of him.

When I came near them, I thought they were old men going arm in arm, with their hats flapped. I did not much like it; I did not know whether it would be best to run back again; I was within two or three yards of them. I thought if I did they might run back after me; it was very dark. I went past them, with my cane in my hand. When I was two or three yards before them, I heard them whisper something: one of them came up to me, and took me by the collar with his right hand, and pitched me against the rails, and put a pistol to my breast, and bid me stop. I asked them what they wanted; they told me to put my hand into my pocket, and give them my money. I desired them not to use me ill, and they were welcome to my money: I pulled out two half guineas, a five and-three-penny piece, and two shillings, and gave him; then the other searched the lining of my coat: he that had hold of me said, Look for his watch; they took it: then they turned round towards White-chapel, and wished me a good night.

            , and had some hand-bills dispersed about. I heard no more of it till the 11th of March. One of the people that belonged to the prison in the Borough, came and asked me if I had been robbed. I said, Yes, of a watch. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250038"></xptr> desired me to take a pen and ink and describe it. I did. He said he had seen it, and it was in the hands of Justice Spencer, and desired I would come over on the Monday, and I might see it and the people. I went on Tuesday, the 13th, and saw it and the prisoners at Margaret's-hill; I believe the prisoners to be the two men that robbed me, but I cannot swear to them, it was so dark. (The watch produced and deposed to). It was made for me; there was a very fine steel chain to it, and two gold seals; one of them my coat of arms.</p>

            . I was sent for, being constable, on the 9th, to take the prisoners in charge. When we were before Justice Spencer, I told him one of them had a very fine watch in his pocket (he had shewed me the watch and seals before); that was Green; who said he bought it of a Jew in Wapping, for two guineas and a half. I took the watch from him when before the Justice.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Strange, the keeper of the New-Gaol in the Borough. On the 9th of March, the prisoners were brought to our gaol; I locked them both up; one in one place, the other in another. One of them, upon unlocking in the morning, said, I have something to disclose to you. I said, What is that? Said he, I cannot tell you here, because I may get myself killed. He gave me an account of these five pistols being loaded, in the very room where they lived. I told Mr. Spencer of it: he said, Mr. Reynolds will be here presently; I will order him to see after them.</p>

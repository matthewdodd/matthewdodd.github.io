I am sure the prisoner is the man. Then he got down and went to the other side of the coach, as if to see if all was clear, then he went round again, and got up and took a box out of the basket; I immediately jumped off my box, upon which the prisoner dropped the box and ran away; I pursued him and brought him back; I called Walker to my assistance, for the prisoner behaved with violence; he d - d and swore at me, and threatened me; I put him into the coach, and brought him and the box to the New Inn, in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Did not you say before the justice, that I threw the box towards your head? - Yes, he did so.</p>

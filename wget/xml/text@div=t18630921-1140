                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in the Brick-fields, North Hythe—on 24th August, about half-past 9 at night, I was in a beer-house—I did not see any of the prisoners there—I left about five minutes past 11, and went with Patey straight on my road to Hayes'-bridge, which is the high-road to Uxbridge—when I had gone about 150 yards I was struck a blow which knocked me down insensible—there was more than one blow-struck—I recovered my senses, got up again, wiped the blood from my eyes, and saw John and George Allum and New, five or six feet from me—I did not see Hall, but his wife came to me and gave me my hat—I saw no sticks in their hands, but I heard one of their wives say, "Come away, George, or</p>

               <p>you will kill him"—I had had part of three pints of ale, but was as sober as I am at this moment—I do not know who struck the blow which knocked me down—I was a great deal injured; my left ear was knocked round, and I have been laid up for three weeks.</p>

I am a labourer at Southall—I was with Wellman at the Boston Arms, and left and walked with him towards Uxbridge—after we had got about 150 yards, Thomas New came up behind him and knocked him down with a stick—there was no one with New but James Allum and his wife: and Thomas New's wife and George Hall's wife were coming up behind—I did not see Hall—I did not see any of the other prisoners do anything to Welmar when he was on the ground—I swear that—I never saw George Allum at all, but I had seen him drinking with New at Baxter's house—I did not see him leave the house—Welmar and me went in by our<lb></lb>selves—Hall came up with his wife after it was done, but I did not see him strike him.</p>

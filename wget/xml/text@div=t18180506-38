               <p>Q. Did your Lordship observe who fired the pistol - A. I did not. I felt that I was wounded in the back - I went up to the office, and sent for a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your Lordship know the prisoner - A. I know him by seeing him at Queen-square, when I was examined on this charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRIB. Q. Did not your Lordship know that he was returned in a state of insanity - A. A lieutenant of that name in the 62d. regiment, was returned to me as insane in the beginning of the year 1816. I saw no pistol presented at me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060017"></xptr>Q. If the pistol had been loaded with powder and ball must it not have gone through your Lordship's body - A. If it had taken a right direction. The distance between me and the person who fired must have been very inconsiderable. It struck about the middle of my back-it only grazed my back. It depended upon the direction in which the pistol was presented whether it would go through my body. I continued to ascend the steps, without assistance. When the surgeon came I was engaged, and desired him to stop a short time before he examined the wound. I received a severe confusion, from which I recovered in about a week.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Can your Lordship ascertain what direction the ball took - A. I believe it was fired obliquely, as it did not go through my body; it only perforated my clothes and grazed the skin. I did not see in what direction the pistol was fired. It made a considerable hole in my coat, a smaller in my waistcoat, and penetrated my braces and shirt.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Can your Lordship say whether the pistol was loaded with a bullet - A. From the appearance of my clothes I conceive it must have been.</p>

             was with me. I saw Lord Palmerstone come in. There is a door with a glass window, which looks on the staircase. I went out of the room to look after his Lordship, and immediately saw a flash of fire on the wall of the stairs, and heard the report of a pistol. I heard Lord Palmerstone give a heavy groan. I rushed forward, and caught the prisoner in the back part of his arms - He was retreating, apparently from the second step of the stairs from the ground, and exclaimed with an air,"I have killed him!" He had a sort of grin on his countenance-the pistol was in his right hand. I caught his arm; he turned round with an air, and said, "You know me, and know my wrongs." I told him I did not, and asked him who he was, and what he had done? he immediately exclaimed,"Is not that Lord Palmerstone?" pointing towards the stairs, in the direction his Lordship had gone. I told him it was him. He immediately exclaimed,"I have shot him!" or "I have killed him!" I do not know which - I sent for a surgeon. I held the prisoner, sat him on a bench in the passage, and kept hold of his arms; he let the pistol fall at my feet, and I took it up-the barrel was then very warm, as if it had been recently fired. I took him into the next room, and asked him if he had another pistol? he said,"No, upon my honour" - He was sent to Tothil-fields. I produce the pistol-it is a screw one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was talking to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18180506-38-person382">Bird</persName>
            . The window in the door is about two feet six inches wide. I did not see the prisoner until immediately after the flash. There was no other person near - He was then near enough to touch him. His Lordship goes up stairs very quick - He might have turned round. I do not remember seeing the prisoner before. I believe there was no other person on the stairs. He did not endeavour to escape - I was so near him he could not.</p>

On the 8th of April I went to Lord Palmerstone's office, and waited to see him-his Lordship entered soon after me; I stood immediately opposite the window, and saw the shadow of some person pass, just as his Lordship entered; at that moment I heard the report of a pistol. Owens rushed out, and I after him-Lord Palmerstone had then got to the top of the stairs - I heard him on the stairs, I did not see him; I heard his Lordship call out. I left the prisoner in Owens' custody, ran up, saw his Lordship enter his room, and order a surgeon to be sent for. I ran down and said to the prisoner, "How could you commit such an act?" he said, "He has killed me."</p>

            , ESQ. I was called in to see his Lordship. I arrived there at twenty minutes after one o'clock, and found his Lordship writing - He begged me to take a chair till he had finished; he sealed and directed the letter. I then proceeded to examine. There was a hole in his coat, a smaller one in his waistcoat, one of his braces and his shirt were torn. There was a bruise on the right side of his back-bone, about as large as the extremity of my little finger; it was surrounded by the appearance of a larger bruise, about the size of a half-crown. I could not at first positively decide whether there was a wound or a severe contusion, or whether the ball had entered or not. Upon further examination I found it was only a contusion.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you suppose occasioned it - A. I am decidedly of opinion that the smaller bruise proceeded from a ball.</p>

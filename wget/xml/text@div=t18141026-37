On the 26th of August last, at past twelve o'clock, the factory was safe, and on the 27th, early in the morning, it was broken open, and robbed of oil cloth. - The factory is in King's Head Court, James-street, Westminster. I found the oil cloth at Mr. Read's shop, a broker, London-wall, On the 15th of September last. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of September Mr. Bulmer informed me, that his floor cloth was exposed for sale at Mr. Read's, London-wall, which had been stolen from his premises at Westminster. I went with Mr. Bulmer and his two men; I found seven pieces of oil cloth; I now pro duce that Mr. Bulmer said was his property. Mr. Read was at home? I asked him how he became possessed of it? He said he bought it of Mr. Levi; he had given three pounds ten shillings for it; afterwards he corrected that, and said, it was two pounds ten shillings. I took the floor-cloth, and desired Mr. Read to accompany me to the Lord Mayor. We then went in search of Levi. We could not find

             was there, whom we call Struttering Jack. In short, he said he could get some floor-cloth, about twelve or thirteen yards, and some of it was two yards wide, at four shillings a yard. I said if it was two yards wide, it was cheap of the money. I did not ask him if it was new or old, and on the Monday following I went out. I had a fowling piece to sell, which I sold in the Strand for eight guineas, to Mr. Ashman, a pawnbroker, facing Hungerford Market, and I bought a lot of brokery of him for six pounds ten shillings. I called a coach, and took them home. About four o'clock in the afternoon, when I came home, my wife said. Jack has left here some floor-cloth for you; I found it lying on my chair. I then went to Wallis's public house. Jack was sitting there; he said he had left some goods at home for me. He went home with me to my house. I looked at the floor-cloth; I said, here is none two yards wide, they are odd remnants, we call them wasters I then said to

He said it cost him three shillings and sixpence a yard; he told me to sell it, and what was got by it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260027"></xptr>I should have half profit. He told me to advance him the money, he had not paid for it. I paid him two pounds five shillings and sixpence. I then sent for Mr. Read, Mr. Read came. I sold him four pounds worth of the goods, I brought home in the coach, and seeing the floor-cloth, he said, Levi, what will you have for the floor-cloth; I said, I will have two pounds ten shillings. He gave me that for it. That is the same floor-cloth I bought of the prisoner.</p>

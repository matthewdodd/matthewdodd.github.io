I am an agent, carrying on business at 60, Wood-street—among other persons, I am an agent for Hicks and Son, of Birmingham—in consequence of a communication from them I sent for the prisoner, with a view to his purchasing certain goods in which I dealt—he gave me an order amounting to about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I asked him for references—he gave me the names of two, and was to come for an answer on the</p>

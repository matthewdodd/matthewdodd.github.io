On the 28th of August, between nine and ten o'clock, I fastened my house, and went to bed, got up at six o'clock next morning, and found my window open, and the things stated in the indictment gone. I saw them at Eaton on the Tuesday after the prisoners were in custody.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MONTAGUE. I am an officer. On the 29th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning, I took the prisoners into custody at Ditton-green, Bucks., about eight miles from Harlington, and found the property on them - They were in company together. Part of the property was in a basket which one of them had. I asked them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090017"></xptr>where they got the property from? they both said they bought them the day before for 4s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BUCKLAND. I am a farmer, and live at Langley. I found the prisoners sitting down in a bye-lane, at Ditton-green. Suspecting them, I asked them where they came from? they said they came out of Kent, and were going to Reading. I said that as a robbery had been committed the night before, I should take the liberty of examining their bundles. I got off my horse, and told them I should look into all the bundles, and desired them, if they were going to Reading, to go with me. Nokes made off; while I was securing him Webb ran away, but was stopped about a mile from the place - I sent a boy, who was with me, after him. I am sure he is the man who got away. One of them said they bought the canister at Kingston, the other said they bought it on the road.</p>

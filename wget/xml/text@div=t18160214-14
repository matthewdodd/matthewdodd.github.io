            , and there was nobody else in the shop. The prisoner at the bar came to the shop, she came first by herself, and bought a small medallion, for which she paid me fourpence; it was a printed cotton medallion; whilst she was paying me for that, two other women came in, and each with a child in their arms. The prisoner went out, and I shewed one of the other women some goods; the other one, to whom I was not attending, said, if I could not wait on her immediately she must go out. Whilst I was shewing the other woman some goods, the prisoner at the bar came back, and asked for something for a child's frock; she asked for a particular pattern, she asked for a brown with a yellow spot; I had a green brown with a yellow spot, which I shewed to her. Then, the woman to whom I had been shewing some goods, went out, saying they would not suit her. The prisoner said, the patterns which I had been shewing to her, were pretty; but it was a bad light by candle light, and she said she would call and look at them by day-light; she then went out. The young man who was in the shop, called to me, and said, sir, that woman's pocket sticks up; I told him I thought so too. I got my hat, and followed her; at the end of New-street, next St. Martin's-lane, I saw her join the two other woman who had been in my son's shop; they had not appeared at all acquainted in the shop. They went up St. Martin's-lane, and turned into Long Acre, talking and laughing as if they were pleased. In Long Acre, just before they got to the chapel, I got near enough to them to hear the prisoner say, d n the old fellow, I did him, for I slipped in off the counter; at the same instant, she was taking it out of her pocket, and was shewing it to them under her coat; I immediately caught her in my arms, with the property; I called stop thief; for the other two women ran away. She had eleven yards of gingham, part in her hand, and part under her cloak; she had partly drawn it from her pocket, to shew the other women. I took her to St. Martin's watchhouse, and delivered to Pike, the constable; I delivered the gingham to the constable also.</p>

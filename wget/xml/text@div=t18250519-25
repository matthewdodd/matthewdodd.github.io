On Saturday evening last, at eight o'clock, I was at the back of the shop, serving a customer - I heard an alarm, ran out, and pursued the prisoner to the corner of Stevens-street - he had the prints in his apron; he took them out, and threw them at me; they were in the shop, near the door. I took them up, and took him back. Another shopman had gone after him, but as he walked he passed him without having suspicion of him.</p>

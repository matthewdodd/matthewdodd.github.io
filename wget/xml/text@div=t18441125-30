                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Selby-street, Waterloo-town, Bethnal-green, and am a tailoress. On Saturday night, 16th Nov., I was in Whitechapel-road, nearly oposite the London Hospital, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and saw the prisoner on the same side of the way as myself, and Ann Neale near him—the prisoner had a trowel in his hand, and struck her with it on the left cheek—she had a bonnet on—it cut through her bonnet, and cut her cheek—he then ran away, and Neale was taken to the hospital—she was a mere passenger, and not in his com<lb></lb>pany—he was rather running in the same direction as she was going—she fell from the blow—the prisoner was not sober.</p>

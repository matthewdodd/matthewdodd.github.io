I lost my property in the room that I went to along with the girl; I met the prisoner at the foot of Long Acre, near twelve at night, on the 7th of July, I went with her to her lodging</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the house - A. A man of the man of Smith, I understand keeps the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there what happened - A. We went to bed together. When I went to bed I had the property with me. I saw the notes when I gave her the money out of my pocket-book, two or three minutes before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What property had you - A. Six one-pound notes, and some silver. I was quite sober; I had not been drinking any where. I had been upon business with a gentleman, and I was going home when I met this girl; I went to bed, and went to sleep. I awoke between one and two o'clock; when I awoke, the prisoner was gone. I found my pocket-book, but the notes had been taken out of it. I did not see the prisoner afterwards until the 11th of August and then I saw her in St. Andrew's watchhouse. None of my notes have never been found. I am certain she is the same person.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL CUTHBERT. I am a watchman. The prosecutor informed me he had lost six one-pound notes; he shewed me the prisoner's room; I knew her person. On the 10th of August, I apprehended her in Drury-lane; I searched her; the money was gone then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all of the man; I was not in his company. I had left the lodgings before this man had lost his money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of Dean's-place, Vauxhall-road. On 3rd Feb., I was at the Besborough Arms, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner and the deceased—I only knew her by sight, by seeing her with him—they were sitting together about half an hour; they were both sober—I heard no angry words, but I saw him get up and go out; she followed him out, and he said to her, "I don't want you to follow me about, and I don't want to have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to do with you any more"—he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his arm, and struck her a blow on the pit of the stomach—I cannot say what sort of a blow it was—she did not fall—she went and sat down, laid her head on the table, and began groaning—I spoke to the girl, she seemed very bad, and asked me to fetch her two-pennyworth of brandy—I got it, and she drank it neat—I</p>

               <p>remained there an hour and a half—she seemed to be in pain—I asked her whether I should take her home, she said, "No; I feel very bad"—I went up to the prisoner, and said, "Richard, take her home;" he said, "I will"—he caught hold of her arm, and they walked home together—I walked behind them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 4th Feb., I was called to the deceased at her father's house, at a few minutes after ten in the evening—I found her quite dead—by the Coroner's direction I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was no external marks of violence—there was an ulceration of the coats of the stomach—there was a perforation in the coat of the stomach, about the size of a sixpence, through which about three pints of the contents of the stomach had escaped into the cavity of the abdomen—I also found a cancerous disease of the pancreas—death was caused by the escape of the contents of the stomach into the abdominal cavity—I think a blow given on the stomach might have caused it—there was no bruise, or extravasation of blood, but it was in a soft part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> As far as the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination went, you would have thought she died from natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I had not heard any of the other facts—her body was in such a state, and the tissues were so slight, that this might have happened at almost any time—very slight activity, or the slightest push, might have caused it—a dote of neat brandy was an injurious thing on such a stomach.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could the brandy have acted in any way so as to cause that perforation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not—the disease of the stomach would account for it—it was what is called a perforating ulcer, which would have progressed and made such a perforation as I found—I do not think it had existed for twenty-four hours—she died in a state of collapse—death would ensue in about twenty-four hours from the contents of the stomach escaping into the abdomen.</p>

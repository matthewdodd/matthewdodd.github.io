                  </hi> I am a lucifer-match maker, at Durham-place, Lambeth-road. Pitts was in my service—I dismissed him on Saturday, 23rd Oct., but told him to be back on Monday or Tuesday—Davidson had been in my service, but had left me about two months—these boxes of lucifer-matches are mine—they were in a loft up stairs at my factory, 7, Duke-street, Red Cross-street—they were all packed up in paper parcels, a dozen boxes in each—I saw them safe on Saturday 23rd, when I paid my hands, probably about four o'clock, when I left the premises—I did not miss these till my boxmaker sent me work—I had been to the premises, and seen the place appear all right—it was locked up and the lock had been taken off—I found on the Wednesday that it had been broken—but these had been taken out on Monday night—the lock had been broken, but not the door.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Duke-street, Southwark—the prisoners lodged at my house—on Wednesday morning, 27th Oct., they came home at twenty minutes past one o'clock—they had not been at home all night—I let them in—they did not go into the room up stairs—they stopped and went out again in five or ten minutes, leaving the door open from that time till day-light—I was called up into their room about a quarter before nine, and found between eleven and twelve gross of boxes of matches, some in a white cloth, and some thrown about—I gave information to the police, and they took the matches and the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carter, in the employ of Mr. William Jenner. On the 26th of Jan. I was out with his wagon, and flour and sacks in it—I had a quantity of copper money, wrapped up in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packages—it was in two flour-sacks there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one ack, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in another—I placed them behind the sacks of flour, in the middle of the wagon, and a trapanlin over them—I had received it myself in payment for flour, and was to take it back to my master—on my way back I stopped at a public-house, kept by Mr. Howe, in Elizabeth-street, Hackney-road—I had a boy with me—I left him at the head of my team, while I wnet in to get some beer—I went to fetch the boy afterwards, and I returned to the head of the wagon—I then saw a man in the wagon, and another on the ground behind it—the man in the wagon got out and ran away—the man who stood on the ground at the back took the coppers and ran away—he carried them about a dozen yards—I cried, "Stop thief!"—he dropped them on the foot-path, and ran after the other man—I ran after them—Rogers pointed to a court—I ran in there, and found the pri<lb></lb>soner standing half-way down—I charged him with robbing my wagon—he said, "Master, I have not robbed your wagon"—I sized him by the collar, and took him to the spot where the sack and money were dropped—they were still lying on the pavement—Mr. Howes took it up, and carried it into his house—I followed him in with the prisoner—the prisoner did not say any<lb></lb>thing—I went for a policeman—we all went to the station-house—I undid</p>

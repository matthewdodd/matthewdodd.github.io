I said,"What money, child?" he said, "Here is a 40l. and a 20l. note, a sovereign, and two sixpences; I said, "It is a great deal of money for a boy like you to have - I should advise you to take it home;" he said, "It is all right, you need not be frightened;" I said, "Well, I will take care of it for you;" he rolled the notes, sovereign, and sixpences up together, and I put them into a little place in the till - I felt a little timid, and put it into the hands of a gentleman in the bar - Kay had then gone into the parlour; the gentleman looked at it, and from what he said, I called Kay out of the parlour immediately, and gave him the money; I said, "This is a great deal of money for a little boy like you to have, and I think you are in low company - you had better go home with it;" he took the money, and put it into his pocket; he said it was his brother-in-law's money: I had put it into the till as I took it out of his hand -I immediately after gave it to the gentleman; I did not look at it myself - it was rolled up; Kay took the money, put it into his fob-pocket, and then I sent for Clements, the Policeman, who came in about five minutes; I paid no attention to what passed - Kay had gone into the parlour, where Barrett was; Clements went in there - he rang the bell, and told the waiter to tell me to call Kay out, which I did; I did not hear what passed between him and Clements.</p>

On Thursday, the 8th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was fetched to the Crown public-house, Eden-street, and found the prisoners in the back parlour, with a young man and two females - I was in plain clothes; I called for something to drink, and listened to their conversation - they were talking about paying for some brandy and water; there was a little dispute about who should pay - I rang the bell, and told the waiter to desire the landlady to call Kay out - neither of the prisoners could hear that; Kay was called out - I followed, and went with him into the bar-parlour; a gentleman sat there: I told Kay, I understood he had some money about him - he said it was nothing to me what the had about him, but what he had belonged to his brother-in-law; I asked him what his brother-in-law was - he said he was a General Postman, and that he was in the next parlour; I told him I should like to see the money he had in his pocket - he at first refused; I told him I was an officer, and would search him - I commenced searching him, and found in his fob-pocket these two Bank post-bills, (looking at them), they have my mark on them; they are what I produced - he said they were his brother-in-law's, and he had given them to him the night before, at a public-house, to take care of; I said I suspected he had not come honestly by them, and should take him into custody; I also found a sovereign and sixpence on him - he said that was his own; I then called out Barrett, and asked what money he had given into his brother-in-law's hands to take care of - (Kay was not present, I had called in one of my men, and given him to him;) he answered that he had not given him any money to take care of - I said, "Have you not given him two Bank post-bills to take care of?" he said No, he had not; I told him I suspected he was concerned in some robbery, and I must search him, and asked what he was - he said he was a General Postman; I took him to an up stairs room, and commenced searching him - I spread a handkerchief on the table, which I took from his pocket, and every thing I took from his pocket I laid on the handkerchief; while I was pulling some papers out of his pocket, and laying them on the table, he immediately snatched at one of the papers, and I had an immense struggle to get it out of his hand - it was torn in the struggle; here is the greater part of it - there is a post-mark on part of it.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Princes-street, Lisson-grove. I have known the two prisoners above two years; they both called on me on the 7th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, in a cabriolet - Barrett had a bundle under his arm; they did not lodge with me then: Kay came in first - he presented a sovereign to me, and requested me to give it to his mother, as she was coming to work for me next day - she is a washer and ironer; Barrett was present then - Barrett said he was very unwell, and could not attend the office that night - he wanted my son-in-law, Marlow, to take a note down to the Post-office for him; I gave him a pen and ink - he wrote it in my presence, and Marlow took it; he left my house a little after four o'clock, and said, "Take care of this bundle for me - I will call for it by and by;" he said it was his red coat - I knew he was a letter-carrier; he requested me to send Marlow to the sign of the George the Fourth, Duke-street, Lisson-grove, on his return, which I did; I placed the bundle on the floor in my back parlour, and about half-past ten o'clock I wished to go to bed - I went down to Duke-street, which is not far, to beg him to fetch the bundle - he requested me to take a small glass of brandy, which I did; I saw there, my son-in-law, the two prisoners, and two other persons - they were standing at the bar when I went in: they said if I would wait a bit they would come with me - they had two bottles of sherry while I staid there - they stood and drank it; Kay paid for them - the two prisoner and Marlow came home with me, Barrett seemed unwilling to go away - I said I could not accommodate them with a bed, and he and Kay remained in my front parlour all night - they had no candle; I fetched the bundle out to Barrett, and he laid his head on it: on the following morning, at five o'clock, I called him to go to the office, as he desired; Kay said Barrett was unwell, and could not go - I did not see them; I had locked them in the room, and unlocked it to call them - I then went up stairs, and finished dressing myself; I came down again, and lighted the fires: Barrett said he was very cold - I made him some breakfast; Barrett then requested Marlow to take some letters and five sovereigns to the Post-office, and to say he could not attend - the five sovereigns were to be given to any of the inspectors; I believe there are four inspectors: after that he washed himself, and quitted the house - he gave me the bundle, saying, "Take care of this, it is my red coat - mind, it is Government property;" I put it into my back parlour - this was on the 8th of December - it remained there till Sunday, the 11th; when I went out I took the bundle up to my bed-room, which is the second floor back room - I put it on the floor, and cantered it under the bed with my foot; I returned about half-past nine o'clock at night, found my bed-room door had been forced open, and the bundle taken away - it was tied in a dirty blue handkerchief, with while spots; I had not other bundle under the bed, nor any other of that size and description in my house; I saw it again at Marlborough-street, and knew it to be the same: I have two lodgers; I left my son-in-law and daughter in the house - they have an apartment up stairs, but are generally with me below.</p>

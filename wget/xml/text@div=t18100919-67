I let the back room on the first floor furnished, to the prisoner on the 12th of July; there were two sheets on the bed, he slept there that night, he went out the next morning and locked the door, he never returned at all, about 10 o'clock the same evening, I opened the door and found the sheets gone from the bed, I have never seen the sheets since.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON, I am an officer, I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday, the 26th of July, in Hoxton town the woman had hold of him, she said she had followed him from Smithfield, and nobody would assist her; she charged him with stealing two sheets, he denied it, he said he had never seen her nor her house, she said it was him and three men were obliged to lay in one bed, to make room for him, he then said he never saw three men in the bed, he only saw one man in the bed, he had several duplicates, but none for sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. You did not tell us any thing about this - A. I saw him that day fortnight in Smithfield, I took hold of him, and tore his coat because I could not hold him; I followed him to Hoxton, because I could not get any body to assist me.</p>

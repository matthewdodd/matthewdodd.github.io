                  </hi>. I am a dealer in coal and coke, at 15, Maiden-lane, Covent-garden. I know the prisoner by the name of Cruise and other names—on 2nd Jan. I was at the Blue Posts, Newman-street, Oxford-street—the prisoner was there, and a man named Burnell—Cruise showed me a book in Burnell's presence, which he said was a list of houses he had indicted—he said they were in the habit of taking houses and opening there—he said, "I get my living by it"—he wished me to join them, and said, "I shall make hatfulls of money; it is our living, we have done so for years"—in the list was the name of a person I knew, Joseph Gillham—I asked him what sort of a man he was—he described him, and I said, "I know the man, he gave my wife away when I was married in 1833, and I am sure he never did any<lb></lb>thing of the kind"—I meant, keeping a brothel—I said, "You must make a mistake, and I will see you again"—he said, "Very well"—I declined seeing him again, knowing he was wrong—he said Gillbam was one of the gang who kept the brothels in James-street, Oxendon-street—they said, "We have in<lb></lb>dicted eighteen, and shall make lots of money by it"—they said they prosecuted Gillham merely to make money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Cowley-street, Westminster, and am a law-writer; I was twenty years in Gilby and Allen's service, of Carlisle-street, Soho, and acted as clerk at the Westminster Sessions. About a year and a half ago, I took the house, 15, Melton-crescent, for my own occupation—my wife is an embroidress, and has apprentices—I did not go to live there because there was a brothel next door—I let it to a man named Allen, for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; the rest I was to pay. On 25th Nov., Burnell called on me, and wished me to assist him in getting up some prosecutions, which I declined; and on 29th I attended at Westminster Hall, and found out that I was indicted—I saw Cruise and Burnell sworn, and saw them go before the Grand Jury—I afterwards met Burnell in Coventry-street, and he said I was a scamp for not assisting him, and he would give me a dose for it—here is the indictment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prosecutor is Frederick Cruise, of 51, Mount-street, Gros<lb></lb>venor-square, paper-hanger and decorator—I went to that address, and saw Cruise's mother—I met him on 30th Nov. by Westminster Hall, and asked him to give me his correct address, as I wished to serve him with notice of bail—he said if the notices were ready, he would accept them; but as they required signing and dating, I asked him to go into the Exchequer coffee-house while I did them—I signed my name, Joseph Gillham, to the notices—Cruise said, "Is your name Gillham, for if it is, Burnell has deceived me, for I took you for Twigg, and Twigg for you"—we have both been indicted since—he said he wished to God he had had nothing to do with it, he saw that Burnell was misleading him, and it would end in his being <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>—I asked him where he indicted me for—he said, for Euston-square, and that he did not know where the house was situated until a few nights before, when Burnell pointed it out to him—a couple of days after, Twigg and Allen called on me, and in consequence of what they said I went to Whitcomb-street, Haymarket, and found Cruise and a man named Merritt—Cruise called me out, and said, "I will not say anything in the presence of those persons" (Twigg and Allen)—he said, "I am afraid I have got into a <hi rend="italic">mess"</hi>—I said it was his own doing, and I could not help it—he said he would rather stop the matter if he could; if I would give him the money it would cost to put in bail, instead of paying it to the Judge's clerk, he would get the warrant and burn it—he offered to go with me to the Crown-office to get the certificate and warrant—that would have come to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we went into the public-house, and got into conversation—I told him, in the presence of the other two who were indicted with me, that I</p>

               <p>declined doing anything of the kind, and that I should indict him for what he had done—he has since preferred some indictments against me at Clerkenwell for the same house—I have never been in the house since—I offered to give it up to the agent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Twigg? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five or six years, and Allen about eighteen years; I left Allen and Gilby's office because I did not feel disposed to stop—I was not charged with receiving money and not accounting for it—I was behindhand 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my accounts—it was not more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave them an "I O U" for it—I am not able to make it up—there was no complaint against me when I left—I received this written testimonial, in Mr. Allen's writing—when Cruise told me he had indicted me, I was in the employ of Mr. Thorney, of Carey-street, as copying-clerk.</p>

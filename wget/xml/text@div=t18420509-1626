                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mr. William Marshall, and live in Devonshire Mews South, Marylebone. I have known the prisoner three years—he came to the stable about three weeks ago, and said he had just left his place, and wanted work—I employed him to help me for two days—he asked me if I would allow him to sleep there, as his father had turned him out, and he did sleep there—on Monday afternoon, the 2nd of May, I went away about four o'clock—the prisoner locked the door and gave me the key—there are two keys to the stable—he gave me one and kept the other—I returned next day about one o'clock—the prisoner was not there then—he did not come there that night to sleep—I went to the stable on Wednesday, the 4th—I had a. trunk in that stable, looked, before I went away—I found it forced open, and a small box, containing three sovereigns, gone from it—I also missed a pair of trowsers and a silk handkerchief of my own, and a livery hat belonging to Mr. Marshall—I had a pair of shoes in the cupboard in the room, which I cleaned just before I left, and when I returned I found them in the cupboard dirty—I</p>

               <p>had been to my box about three o'clock on the previous Sunday afternoon—the prisoner was present, and saw me go to it—I afterwards found the prisoner at the Plasterers' Arms in Little Marylebone-street, not a quarter of a mile from the stable, and gave him into custody—I saw a black handkerchief on his neck at the station, which I can swear to as having left in my room—I never gave him permission to wear it—this now produced is it—I have had it a year and a half—I do not think the prisoner had any money when he went away, for he had asked me for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get half a pint of beer, and sometimes I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On Monday or Tuesday morning, the 3rd or 4th of May, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to me for change for a sovereign, which I gave him—I saw him again in the afternoon—he had been drinking—I saw half-a-sovereign in his hand, with some silver—I asked him to let me take care of it for him, which he did, and I gave it him again in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Devonshire-mews, next door to the prosecutor's stable. On Monday afternoon, the 2nd of May—soon after the prosecutor went out, I saw the prisoner at the stable where I was at work—he had nearly a new hat on, and nearly a new pair of shoes—I know the shoes by seeing the prosecutor wear them since—the prisoner complained of the shoes pinching his feet, and said he could not wear any stockings with them—he generally wore a light cap—I do not know that I ever spoke to him before that day, but I had seen him with the prosecutor several times.</p>

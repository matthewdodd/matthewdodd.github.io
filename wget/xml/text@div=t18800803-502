                  </hi>. I was a City detective, but am superannuated—in December, 1876, complaints were made to me in reference to fish Street Hill—I set Oldhampstead, Simmons, and others to watch—on the 9th December, 1876, Simmons spoke to me, and I went with him to the European public-house—he pointed out the prisoner to me, who was sitting in a chair talking to another man also sitting down—on 15th December, 1876, between 8 and 9 a.m., I went to 1 and 2, Fish Street Hill, to a room on the third floor—I there found 32 letters, delivered by that morning's post—I marked 14 of them—I took them away—some of them contained cheques and post-office orders; others were applications for the pamphlet, others asking for remittances—I marked the remaining 18 letters with my initials and took them back to the office. (<hi rend="italic">An extract from the pamphlet was read to the effect that the office possessed a special telegraph wire, and that hundreds of testimonials could be seen there.</hi>) The office was a room on the third floor; there was no telegraphic communication with it—I did not see any testimonials—I saw 200 or 300 provincial newspapers; they contained similar advertisements to the one produced (<hi rend="italic">advertising the pamphlet of "advice to investors</hi>")—there were two books only, with no entries—I found the letter from Mr. Manstead as to the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw Riches the same day; upon him were the 18 letters I had marked—I also saw the two persons who were discharged; I read a letter found upon one of them—on the 31st December, 1876, I went with Sergeant Mitchell to 9, Porteous Road—we searched some rooms pointed out to us by Mrs. Lane; I found 500 envelopes in the back bedroom similar to this, with "Unitas et vis" and the device on them of two boys holding a purse—in a capboard I found some clothes hanging up—out of one of the pockets Mitchell in my presence took these five documents. (<hi rend="italic">These were receipts for registered letters, one having been sent to Manstead, and another to the Manager of the London and South-Western Bank, Shepherd's Bush.</hi>) I also produce the die.</p>

On Saturday, 26th Jane, I appre<lb></lb>hended the prisoner at No. 1, Albert Villas, Harlesden, Middlesex, upon a warrant-issued on 2nd January, 1877—the prisoner opened the door to me—I said "I believe your name is Robert Collier"—he said "No, it is Brewer," and then walked back into the back room—I followed him—I said "I believe your name is Robert Collier, and you formerly resided at Witney Villa, at Shepherd's Bush, and for whose arrest I hold a warrant; I will read you the warrant"—I read it—he said "Read it again"—I read it again—he said "Well, my name is Robert Collier, and I did reside at Witney Villa, Shepherd's Bush; but you say Robert Collier <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> George Riches; how can my name be George Riches if it is Robert Collier? the only George Riches I ever knew was sentenced to 18 months' imprison<lb></lb>ment for a fraud in the City, and he was a printer at Shepherd's Bush"—I then took him to Seething Lane Police-station—the charge was read over to him—in answer to it he said "I know nothing about such rubbish."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the police-court four year ago—I saw Riches once before the arrest of Chapman—Riches was tried and convicted at this Court in December, 1877—I was looking after Collier then—Riches was not examined at Chapman's trial—I am speaking from memory—I think I saw him outside the police-court—I said "How do you do?—that is all—I did not take his evidence—I had no conversation with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JOHN THOMAS SAFFWELL</hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at New Brentford. On the afternoon of 23rd Dec, between four and five o'clock, I was at Mr. Pi<lb></lb>per's public-house, the Six Bells, New Brentford, and saw the prisoner, the de<lb></lb>ceased Thomas Hipson, and several others, there—Hipson was intoxicated, and very quarrelsome—Robert Winter wanted to fight; the landlord would not allow him, and took him to another room—the deceased said he would fight a person named Brown who was there—Brown held up his right arm, but I cannot say whether he struck or pushed him—Hipson rolled back a step or two, but did not fall—he then went up to Brown again, and swore he would fight him, and Brown pushed him away a second time—the prisoner, who was sitting in the opposite corner, said to Brown, "If you touch him again, I will serve you a d—d sight worse than you served him"—Brown then drank his beer and left—previous to that, the prisoner had got Hipson to sit in a corner between him and a man named Jordan—Hipson could not sit upright, and seemed overpowered with drink, and we thought it advisable to lay him in a corner on the settle to sleep—he appeared to be asleep, and a young man, named Maddox, a boatman, came in, who was just out of his apprenticeship, and they wanted him to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> some gin—he <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> some, and his father offered some to Hall, who refused having any, as he had had enough—old Maddox said, "You must have some, in or out"—he had a little, and Maddox <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> the remainder into his eyes—Hall got up in a violent pas<lb></lb>sion, and struck all round—some one spoke, I cannot say who—Hall</p>

               <p>thought it was the next to him, and said, "Can you fight?"—while this talk was going on, the deceased, Hipson, arose, and said he could fight, and Hall struck him a blow on each side of his face with his clenched hand—Hipson then laid his head on the table, and cried a few minutes, and occasionally rose up and talked about fighting—he seemed to aggravate Hall very much, who said he could fight him and his mate too (that was a boatman), if he had fair play in a field—Hipson appeared to be aggravated, and said if he had fair play he could beat him—Hall, who at the time was in his original seat on the opposite side of the fire, about eight feet off, jumped up again, went across the room, and struck him on the right side of the head—Hipson laid his bead on the table, and appeared to be snoring very loud—I heard no more, and it was generally believed he was asleep—he snored very loud about half a minute—in about twenty minutes, two men went and rose him up, and found he was dead.</p>

I went to the Six Bells, and saw the deceased taken out of the tap-room; he was dead—I apprehended Hall—when Saffwell made the charge, he did not attempt to deny it—before the Magistrate, the next morning, he said he struck him once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at New Brentford. On Sunday evening, 23rd Dec, I was called to Mr. Piper's, and saw the deceased—he was quite dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinaionon 27th, and found two very slight scars on the right side, of the face, and one on the left ear, exceedingly slight, but no external bruises about the head—they appeared quite recent, and very slight—upon opening the head, I found the vessels on the brain in an extremely con<lb></lb>gested state; I never saw any so full of blood; the membranes were all very much congested—there was a small vessel upon the face of the brain rup<lb></lb>tured, which threw out a great deal of blood: there was a small quantity of blood in each of the lateral ventricles—the liver was perfectly healthy, but rather large—I attribute the cause of death to this, I think the man was lying down on a bench and had been drinking, and got his head exceedingly con<lb></lb>gested or full of blood, and a very slight blow in that state would produce death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The whole of the congestion may have been occa<lb></lb>sioned by drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it required no violence of any kind to occasion it—everybody who gets thoroughly drunk is in a state very nearly approach<lb></lb>ing apoplexy every moment he lives—the least stimulant is likely to cause it, they are always subject to it—if, instead of having good strong healthy vessels, they have vessels naturally weak, the apoplexy is more violent—it was one of the ventricle arteries that was broken; it is not a very large ves<lb></lb>sel—it lies at the base of the brain—it is a part of a main artery—I should not say it is more easily ruptured than the main one—I think the mere rais<lb></lb>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185001070071"></xptr>
               <p>of his head suddenly, joined to considerable excitement and anger, would not have caused the rupture—if a man gets drunk and is angry, the blood is thrown up more quickly into the brain, and it goes back more slowly, the vessels are congested—if he raised his head in violent anger, it may have caused a rupture—it is within my experience that it has been caused over and over again in that way—I think, under the circumstances, a blow on the side of the face which left no external mark would not rupture the blood-vessels.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you knew a blow had been given, to what should you attribute the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To both together; the blow would not have caused it without that state of the brain.</p>

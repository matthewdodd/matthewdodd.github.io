We saw a Maid washing a House there , and she went down Stairs for a pail of Water, and left the Door open. Flack, seeing the Door open , said, there was a Chance , and thought there had been no body in the Room: They bid me go in; so I went through the parlour into the Kitchen, where there were 2 Children at play by the Fire-side . There was no Candle in the Room, and I happened to put my Hand up just at the Corner of the Room, and felt a Bundle of Linen, which I took away; and the Maid coming up with the Water, we all ran away, as fast as we could to the Prisoner Bunce's, in Green's Rents by Fleet-Ditch . As I was coming through Bride's-Alley , I dropped some of the Linen, and met Bunce ; she said, I was in a great Hurry, not to stay to pick it up, and so she took it up herself, and followed me to her House. When we came there, we went up into her one pair of Stairs Room, and looked over the Things; there were laced Caps, laced Handkerchiefs, Shirts, Caps and Aprons, and she said, they were all Rags, and worth but a Trifle ; so she gave us 7 s. 6 d. for them, and we shared it amongst us.</p>

Upon this, I printed some Bills, but heard nothing 'till I saw Lowther's Information , in which was this Robbery. I went to him in Bridewe , and he gave me exactly the same Account of it as he has now.</p>

             . I know that the Prisoner Bunce bought this Linen of Lupton , Lowther, and Flack, at her House in Green's Rents. When Lowther brought the Bundle up Stairs, it was opened , and there were two ruffled Shirts in it, a laced Pinner and Coif, and a laced Handkerchief about two Fingers bread . There were a great many other Things, and she gave them 7 s. 6 d. for them all; but I believe they were worth at least between 4 and 5 l. She told me, she had bought a great many Things of them, but this was the best Bargain that she ever had.</p>

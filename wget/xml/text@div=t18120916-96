            . I live in Mile-End Road. On the 22d of August I lost my watch and key, it was between eight and nine o'clock at night; I was going to the further end of Paul's Chain, and just between the post and the corner of the house, the prisoner came up to me and looked me full in the face; he put his hand to my pocket and pulled my watch out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of his person - A. I am quite sure of his person. I called out stop thief, and the prisoner was taken in Sermon Lane. Baily, the officer, took him in custody; when the prisoner was I came up to him; I was quite sure he was the person that took my watch out of my pocket. It was a moon-light night; I saw the prisoner's person plain.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the cry of, stop thief, the prisoner was stopped; I came up and took him to the watch-house; the prisoner, at the watch-house, said he knew nothing of the charge. I searched him and found nothing. The watch was picked up by a boy, his name is Harrowsmith.</p>

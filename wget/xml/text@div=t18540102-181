                  </hi>. I am the son of Sarah Larman; she is a farmer, at Enfield-highway. The prisoner was in her employ for about two years and a half—on 13th Dec. I was watching on her premises, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner outside of the barn—there was a donkey and cart in the road, outside—the driver of that cart was William Dukes—he has absconded—I saw the prisoner go towards the pales where the cart was standing, with a sack not quite full—I did not know what was in the sack—I did not stop to see whether he brought back the sack—I saw him go with the sack near the pales—I went round in the road and saw William Dukes with his cart—he was at the hind part of the cart—I took the sack out of the cart—I carried it twenty or thirty yards, and gave it to my uncle—I then ran and got a police constable; he came and I gave the prisoner into custody—he said he knew nothing about it—I am certain that I saw him that morning carrying the sack towards Duke's cart—the sack I found in the cart was the same size and appearance as the one the prisoner was carrying—it contained these oats; worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were you, when you saw this man carrying the sack towards the pales? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a, back pantry of my uncle's house, looking through a wire window—it was about twenty-five yards from the pales—it was between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning, on Tuesday, 13th Dec.—my uncle was watching before me; I went and took his place while he finished his breakfast—I was not above five minutes in the pantry—the donkey cart was about five yards from the pales—there was a ditch between—the prisoner was the only man who had been threshing in that barn—there was no other person threshing at the same time—I merely saw a sack; I did not see where it was put, and I found a sack with some oats in it in the donkey cart—there was no mark on the sack.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the uncle of the last witness. I know the prisoner very well; he has been in Mrs. Larman's service about two years and a half—I was watching that morning—soon after the prisoner went into the barn I saw him uncover the sack of oats, and he brought them along the floor and put a bit of loose straw over them—he then came towards my pantry window—I drew myself aside, and he came and peeped in the window—my nephew then came and told me to go and get my break-fast, and he would watch—I went in the room, and he stayed there—I had seen the donkey cart with Dukes that morning—I went past it and noticed it, and I am quite confident there was no sack in it—I saw the prisoner uncover the sack, and leave it near the barn door—I did not see him carry it to the donkey cart—when I saw my nephew run out of the house I followed him—he had got the sack out of the cart before I got to him—the donkey man ran away after we got the oats out—I had seen him and the prisoner together several times—I know the prisoner should have been threshing in the barn that morning—I am quite positive these oats belong to Mrs. Larman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 342). I apprehended the prisoner. I told him I took him for stealing the quantity of oats which Mr. Larman charged him with—he denied it, and said, "I know nothing about it"—I am a judge of oats—these oats correspond with the oats in Mrs. Larman's barn.</p>

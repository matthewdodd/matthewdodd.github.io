               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Howgrave, a haberdasher, in Bishopsgate-street. I know Brown; she came to our shop on the 3d of August, and asked for a piece of ribbon, for a watch string; it came to two-pence; she offered me a bad half crown; I returned it to her again; I had a suspicion, and a constable was sent for, and she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150154"></xptr>fetched back; the constable took the half crown from her, and gave it to Mr. Howgrave: I was not present when she was searched.</p>
               <p>- HOWGRAVE sworn.</p>
               <p>I have a half crown a servant of mine gave to me on the 3d of August; I think I had it from Bevil; I am not sure whether from him, or another of my young men; it was given to me before the constable came.</p>
               <p>(The half crown shewn to the court.)</p>
               <p>Sandys. This is not the half crown she tendered to me.</p>

               <p>I am constable. I searched Brown, and found nothing on her: in consequence of information I took Kay; she was about three hundred yards off; Mr. Sandys gave me information; I searched her, and found five half crowns in her bosom; I have four of them; Mr. Sandys has the other: I found eight shillings good money, and ten-pence in halfpence.</p>
               <p>(The half crown produced by Sandys.)</p>
               <p>Sandys. This is the half crown Brown offered to me, and this was found on Kay.</p>

               <p>I leave it to my counsel. My attorney was with me last night, at nine o'clock, and told me he had employed counsel. I am a misfortunate woman; I had the money of a man that slept with me; I had six, and I paid Mrs. Kay five for lodging.</p>

               <p>I was coming from the Borough, and I met the prisoner Brown, and she paid me five half crowns for five weeks lodging.</p>

               <p>Is it a part of the house? - We go through it into the house; there is a way out of the house into it, and a way out of the street into it; it is directly under the door-way that goes into the dwelling-house. I put them there between five and six o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Was the way out of the street into that place fastened? - I cannot say. I was informed on Monday that there had been a man in the house; I went down stairs, got a candle, and went into the tackle-house; I found the door open that goes into it, which I had fastened on Saturday night. I missed this shovel, the first thing. One of the men went after the prisoner and took him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the place where the shovel was fastened up on Saturday night? - I am certain it was.</p>
               <p>Has it a communication with the dwelling-house, is there a door out of the dwelling-house into it? - No.</p>
               <p>I thought you said there was? - No, there is no door out of the house into it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Have you known him long Mr. Adkins, - A. Three years,</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I am entirely innocent of the crime imputed to me. I received the notes at a gaming table where I lost some of my own. I believe it was in Oxendon street, or some of the streets at the west end of the town; being lately out at sea. I am not perfectly acquainted with the streets; I was ignorant that they were dishonestly come by; I took them for payment I trust that your lordship and the gentleman of the jury must be satisfied of my innocence. Had I stolen the notes, or known them to have been stolen, is it possible to suppose that I should go and offer them at the very bankers where they were advertised to be stopped, surely no guilty man could not act so; he must have known they would not be paid, and that himself must be brought into trouble. I have recently returned from abroad, I have no witnesses.</p>

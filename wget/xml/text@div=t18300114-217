On Sunday morning, the 20th of December, about nine o'clock, when I got up, a person rang my bell, and said my house was broken open; I found the bar of the shutter forced, and a large square of glass broken out of the window - there was room for a person to go through; it was fast the night before; I found the things turned over one another in the shop, and missed nine cheeses - my house is at the corner of Pell-street; I had heard a noise about seven o'clock, but did not think my house could be broken open at that hour, and took no notice; the glass was jagged, as if a hand had been forced through, and blood on it. Captain 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1438">Williams</persName>
            , of Pell-street, gave me two cheeses, which were left at his door.</p>
               <p>ROBERT YOUNG. I string shoes, and am nearly fourteen years old - I live in Thomas-place, Pell-street. On Sunday morning, the 20th of December, between seven and half-past seven o'clock, I was sweeping the snow from the door, and heard a disturbance in the street; I ran to the bottom of the court, and saw two men in Pell-street, carrying cheeses - they were so heavily loaded that they rested, and left two cheeses at Captain 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1439">Williams</persName>
            ' door, which is nearly opposite; they carried the rest up the street, rested, and changed arms by the pump - they turned to the right; I watched them half way up Christian-street, and lost sight of them - I first saw them about a dozen doors from Brown's, and coming in a direction from there; they came back in a quarter of an hour for the other two cheeses, and knocked at Captain 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1440">Williams</persName>
            ' door three times, but he would not let them have them - I had seen him take the cheeses in five minutes after they left them there; they both went up the street together, and I saw no more of them - I had seen them before, but did not know their names; about a quarter of an hour after they had gone, a man came up, and asked if I had seen two men go along with some cheeses - I said No; he ran up the street, met one of them, and said, "Halloo! how get you on?" the other said,"Oh, very well," and both went up the street together; Welch was the third man - Walker and Lewis are the men I saw in the street with the cheeses; I saw 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1441">Lewis</persName>
             that night at the Sweedish Flag, Princes-street, and saw Welch there on Monday morning; I had only seen Walker once before, but Lewis three or four times - they were in my sight about ten minutes; I am sure of all three.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was it not rather foggy? A. No, it was snowy; the disturbance was they kept saying, "I will go and fetch a knot;" I was asked at the office to point out who had the cheeses - I do not think I touched all three, but cannot be certain; I had seen Walker once; it might be a year before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long after you saw them with the cheeses did you see Welch? A. A quarter of an hour; he came from Ratcliff-highway - that was in a direction from Brown's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Did the officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140097"></xptr>tell you you were going to see somebody suspected of the robbery? A. Yes, he told me he was going to take me to see if I knew the men - I went into the tap-room to see them; I had seen 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1442">Lewis</persName>
             a week or a fortnight before - I told the Magistrate he had a dark dirty blue coat on; I recollect having said it was black.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why do you now say it was dirty blue? A.Because the gentleman told me to think; I did not call it to mind just at that moment - at first I thought it was blue; now I recollect it was a dirty black - Welch was in a rough white coat, and Walker in a sailor's jacket; I heard Mr. Brown had been robbed, and went and told him- Lewis' mother lives in Betsey-street; I believe he lives with her.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live in Pennington-street; I was going by Pell-street about seven o'clock, and saw two men standing up by Mr. Brown's shutters, in Pell-street; Lewis stood by the door, as if he was drunk; he said to me, "Little boy, can you tell me where Wellclose-square is?" he had his clothes down almost - he said, "If you do I will give you a halfpenny;" I said, "Yes, Sir," and he gave me a halfpenny; I showed him the square, but he did not go on, and I noticed him, seeing him drunk, and the two men by the shutter - I thought something was the matter; a sailor came by, and he asked him the same question, and in two or three minutes I thought I heard a smash - I would not go back, as I thought something was the matter, and they would do something to me; I was coming down Rosemary-lane, about half-past eight o'clock, and saw the three prisoners and a lot more men; I turned to look at them, and Walker up with his foot and kicked me - I could not move for about two minutes; I then went home; I said nothing to any body, but on Monday morning, when I went out for coals, I went and told Mr. Brown's son what I had seen - he asked me to come over presently; I did not like, but on Tuesday Brown and Prendergass fetched me to Lambeth-street, but I was not examined till the next time -Lewis was dressed in a blue coat; I did not see Walker and Welch so particularly then, but I saw their dress -Walker had a blue jacket and trousers, and a light waistcoat; Welch had a white coat, gaiters, and boots, like a carman - when the glass broke Lewis went off; I did not see what became of the others - I had not seen either of them before; I speak to them by their dress, and looking at them; the man who gave me the halfpenny said, "Go up to No. 47, in that alley, and I will come and give you such a tuck out" - the alley is in the square; this was a little before I heard the glass break - I did not go to the alley; there are not above twenty houses in it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you have no great kindness towards Walker for kicking you? A. No; I know he is the man that did the robbery - I saw him up the street; I would not wish to do him any harm or good; Prendergass took me to the watch-house - they told all the men to stand up, but I could not see exactly; there were about fourteen - I told the officer directly I came out that black-eyed Billy, which was the name I understand he goes by, was the man who kicked me; I did not know them exactly in a moment, and said I did not know them - the three were afterwards brought into the office by themselves; I was told they were the men suspected; I am not certain who said so - it was one of the officers, but I knew them by their dress; I could see them better then - the Magistrate did not ask me any questions the first time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. After saying you could not speak to them exactly, did not one of the officers say, "We have got the wrong men?" A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you quite sure it was a blue coat? A. Yes, I am sure two were in blue, and one like a carman; I did not go to Brown on Sunday, as his shop is never open - I was never in trouble.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was the first examination after the second? A. I went first on Tuesday - I was examined, I believe, on the Thursday week after.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRENDERGASS. I belong to Lambeth-street office. I saw MR. Brown on Sunday night, and about six o'clock went to Young's - in consequence of what I heard from him I apprehended 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1444">Lewis</persName>
             that evening, and Welch next morning, and Walker on Tuesday, in consequence of Young's description; he identified Lewis at the Swedish Flag, Welch next morning, and Walker at night - on Wednesday morning the prosecutor sent 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1445">Walker</persName>
             a pint of porter - he held out his left hand to take it; I asked him to put out his right hand - he did so, and the middle knuckle was cut; I asked how it was done - he said with striking his old woman: I saw her on Wednesday, and she had no visible marks of violence - the first examination was on Wednesday, the next on Monday, and the third on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Walker tell you he had hit the wall in trying to strike the woman? A. He did not; I took Whowell to the lock - up place, but did not talk to him about the prisoners; I know a suspicious character, called Gipsy - he wears sailor's clothes, and every kind of dress; I did not tell 
               <persName id="t18300114-217-person1446">Walker</persName>
             I was looking for Gipsy, and if I had found him I would not have taken him (Walker) - I told Whowell I was taking him to the lock-up place, to see if he could identify the men; Gipsy is taller than either of the prisoners - I have not been looking for him; he was in the house when I took Lewis, if I had wanted him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you mean to say you have not been looking after other persons? A. Not about this robbery, but in consequence of information which came from the prisoners in Newgate; I took Whowell to the lock-up place - we had about nine people there; I desired them all to stand up, and immediately he looked round he said, "None of the men are here;" as such we paid no more attention to him, but when they were coming out to be examined, he said,"Why, I can identify all these three men, they were in Mr. Brown's robbery" - that was immediately they were brought in; he was sworn, but what he said was not taken down then - I have heard him say he was not examined, but he was; he was fully examined the second day - Welch was in bed when I took him; he put on a pair of cord breeches, and a long fustian coat.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. The cheeses were delivered to me by Captain Williams, who went to sea the next day; I have had them ever since - I lost seven more.</p>

               <p>Welch's Defence. I can prove I was in bed at the time; when I was taken, the boy said he did not know me, except seeing me in the highway with two girls, on Sunday morning - Prendergass took him aside, then came to me, and said, "You are identified; the boy says you had top boots on, a long jacket, and was carrying four cheeses;" the boy could not be off knowing me, for I have stood in Princes-street four years - Prendergass said he was satisfied it was not me, and if he could have seen Gipsy, he should not have taken me.</p>

               <p>ANN MARTIN. My husband is a labourer at the London-docks.

               <p>COURT. Q. What took you to a public-house at five o'clock on Sunday morning? A.

               <p>Q.When did you attend here for the first time? A.

On the Sunday before Christmas day, Walker came there about five o'clock in the morning, with the intention of going to Woolwich - I went to the Windmill with him and Martin, and staid there from half-past five o'clock till nine o'clock, I suppose; I do not wear a watch - we then returned to Martin's - there was a child ill there; I believe Walker did not go to Woolwich.</p>

No; our house is about five minutes walk from Brown's - nobody could come in or out without my hearing them; I got up about seven o'clock - my father got up about six o'clock, and went out; the prisoner is always at home on Sunday morning - I did not notice this more than any other Sunday, but I heard his father talking to him; my father is ill, and not able to attend - my sisters were up, but neither of them are here.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WELCH. The prisoner Welch is my son, and lodged at the house of Morris - he slept with me the Saturday night before Christmas; he was in bed all night, got up at half-past eight o'clock, and left the house at a quarter-past nine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where did he breakfast that morning? A. I believe at Allen's, in the highway - he is a carman; he came home at half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday night - I was in bed then; I have been here every day since the Session began.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA WHITE. My husband is a coal-whipper, we live at Shadwell - I know Lewis. On Saturday night, the 19th of December, at twelve o'clock, he came up with John, (our landlord's boy) to bed, at the house I lodge at - he lodges at the same house, on the same stairhead; I asked John if I should take down some things which I had hung in his room? He said No, it was only George Lewis; Lewis said, "Don't go away in the morning without me, I am going down the river with you in the boat" - I saw him again on the Sunday morning, at two minutes past seven o'clock, and went to call the boy up to open the shutters; I did not see him after that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How was Lewis dressed that morning? A. In a black coat.</p>

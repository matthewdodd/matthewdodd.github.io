                  </hi>. I am assistant to a jeweller; I live in Tennison-street, York-road, Lambeth. On Wednesday night last I was on the London side of Blackfriars-bridge about a quarter past 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoner—he walked by my side for about two yards—he was so close that I could see him—I then felt something at my pocket—I had my watch in my waistcoat pocket, and this Albert chain on, as I have now; and at the instant I saw my watch in his hand—I instantly took my Albert chain with one hand, and the prisoner with the other, and called out, Police!"—there were other persons about—the prisoner got from me, but not above a yard or a yard and a half—he passed a female, and I saw him hold his hand out to her; but whether he had the watch in that hand, I would not swear; but just before he had my watch in his hand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 367). I stopped the prisoner last Wednesday evening—as soon as he was stopped the prosecutor came up, and said that was the man that stole his watch.</p>

               <p>JOHN JENKINS. On Monday, the 27th of March, I was at <placeName id="t18260622-50-crimeloc246">Teddington</placeName>

I said, "No, I have had enough of you - you can go on" - he said, "D-n your eyes, lay there," and ran away. I got up in three or four minutes; I heard a noise a head of me, near Hampton-wick, while I was laying down - I ran as fast as I could to Hampton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220028"></xptr>wick for a constable - he was not at home; I passed the prisoner and three or four more as I went over Kingston-bridge; I said nothing, but went and told Mr. Walter, the gaoler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. Where had you been? A. I was working at Teddington; I left work at eight o'clock, then went to a public-house with some shopmates; I drank a pint or a pint and a half of beer; I was in and out there. I was perfectly sober. I walked about the fair part of the time. I said what I did to the prisoner because I knew he had been tried a few days before. When I overtook him on the bridge he was going towards Kingston - if I had attempted to take my money from him 4there he would have sworn a robbery against me; I am certain of his person. When I told the gaoler, he said I had better let it alone, and he should be taken to-morrow- I told him he was then coming over the bridge; he did not laugh at me.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutor gave me information; I looked for the prisoner, and took him on the 30th of May, at the New Inn, at Ham; I said I wanted him for a highway robbery - he said he knew bl-y well what I wanted, and he came on purpose to be taken; as I brought him to town he said if he had known he was going to be taken at Ham he would not have been in the way. I had received orders to take him two days after it happened, but could not find him.</p>

I was going home to Wandsworth - it was a very wet night; he said "You seem very wet," I said I was wet, cold and tired, and asked if he knew where I could go to dry myself, and get some refreshment; he took me to Tattersall's-yard, about twenty yards off; the house was not open, and I sat down under the arch of the door till half-past four o'clock, because I was so very tired, I could go on no further, and expected the house to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250019"></xptr>open every minute, he came to me at half-past four o'clock, and said I could go to his own house with him.

I asked why he could not take me to his own house; he said he lodged at a public-house, and I should be more comfortable there, if it had been an open shed, I should have been glad to stop, I was so wet and extremely tired. I sat down on a bed, and in a about five minutes fell asleep, I cannot say whether he was then in the room or not; he said he was going to stop. I took off my gown, but nothing else, I had eaten or drank nothing since ten o'clock, and was perfectly collected. I awoke about seven, and my watch was gone from my pocket, where I had put it, when I pulled my gown off. I went to the watch-house about eight o'clock - he was brought to me about six that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you take me to a public-house, when I came off duty - A. We went into one, he had a glass of gin and I drank a little. I did not ask him for a lodging; he said he would take me to his own house, where I could have a comfortable breakfast. I told him to ask the landlady of the house for some water, to wash the tail of my gown, and he hung it up to dry; he saw that I had a watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutrix came to the watch-house, to complain about eight o'clock, and took me to shew me the prisoner's beat - he lives in Rochester-row, Westminster, (not at a public-house.) I went there about half-past eleven o'clock; he was out - we walked about there, and met him at half-past five o'clock, and asked if his name was Macintosh, he said "Yes, I suppose you have come about the woman and the watch," I said Yes; he said "Well then it is up stairs."

I took her to a shelter and when I left duty, she asked me to get her a lodging, and said she was not married, but afterwards that she was. I got her this lodging, and told her I lived next door to a public-house - she fell asleep, leaving the watch on the bed - a third person came into the room, and finding no lock on the door, and I took the watch to take care of it. I could find nobody in the house, or I meant to apprise the landlady of my intention.</p>

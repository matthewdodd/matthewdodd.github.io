On the morning after the rob<lb></lb>bery I was sent for to Mr. Goss's—I examined the premises carefully, and, in my judgment, the robbery must have been committed by some person well acquainted with the premises, and from within—there were no marks of violence outside—I examined the coal-cellar, and found several pieces of wood placed in the corners, and the angles of the corner formed a sort of closet large enough to hide one or two persons—a person coming into the cellar even in the broad day light would have no opportunity of seeing any person concealed behind there—I received a description of Elliott and Hicks from Mr. Goss, and made enquiries in the neighbourhood where they had been in the habit of frequenting, and I could not meet with them—on 28th March, a week after the robbery, I went to the prisoner Nicholl's who keeps a beer-shop in Goswell-street—I asked if he knew of the robbery at Dr. Goss's—he said he did not—I asked if he had any knowledge of the two lads Hicks and Elliott. who had lived with Mr. Goss, and gave him a description of them—he said that two lads of that description had been at his house on the 21st; they remained there about a quarter of an hour; he knew nothing at all about them; he had never seen them before or since—on the Thursday following, the 31st, in consequence 4 of information, I went to West Coker, near Yeovil, in Somersetshire—I there saw a man named Randall, and re<lb></lb>ceived from him these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bearing the London post-mark—I was in plain clothes, and wore a cap while at West Coker—Nicholls afterwards saw the letters, at the post-office—I had sent my brother officer, Elsom, to Nicholl's house, for the purpose of procuring his writing, and, in consequence of what he showed me, I went to the house on Wednesday, 5th April, saw Nicholl's, and told him that I took him into custody on suspicion of being concerned, with others, in the robbery at Dr. Goss's—he said, "Very well"—I searched the house, and found this portion of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertise</hi> newspaper of 27th March—I took him to the station, and on the road I told him I could show that he had written to Elliott—he said he had never written to one of them in his life—on the Friday following, in conse<lb></lb>quence of information I received from Mrs. Hatswell, I went the same night to Dartmouth, in Devonshire, and at the house of Mr. Fall, a boatman there,</p>

Elliott, Mr. Randall, clerk, West Coker, near Yeovil, Somerset, 29th March. Dear Friends,—This comes with my best respects to you both, and to inform you that there is a terrible row in London, and they want both you;they are looking everywhere, but they can do nothing; the pump is good and the sucker is dry; your friends beg of you both to keep your own counsels; they cannot find out <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, and they cannot do anything with you, and be sure to keep as I tell you; if money should run short your mother will send your some, and you will have your things down; but keep from London, and let nobody know what is what; send <hi rend="italic">no</hi> letters to <hi rend="italic">nobody, barring you know.</hi> I remain, yours, J.

                  </hi> I am a printer's pressman, and live at 21, Eagle-court, St. John's-lane. I heard of the robbery at Mr. Goss's—I was in the habit of going to Nicholls's beer-shop, both before and after that—I knew Nicholls, and I know the other three prisoners; I have seen them there day after day—I think I first saw Murphy there on 24th March; that was after the robbery—Nicholls told me that Murphy had got a coat and hat; that was not said in Murphy's presence—I heard Murphy say that a man named <hi rend="italic">Andy</hi> had pledged the coat—I had seen it; it was a dark cloth coat—I did not take any notice of it—I think it had pockets in front—Murphy said he had sent a</p>

               <p>woman and got it out again—Nicholls, in my presence, showed a man names Richards two gold watches in front of the bar—he and Murphy were quar<lb></lb>relling about the price of them, and Murphy wanted them back or the money for them, and Nicholls said he had not got them in his possession; they were gone—I saw all the prisoners together after the robbery, in Nicholls's bar; I think it was on the Tuesday evening, as the robbery had been done on the Sunday—the robbery has been a common subject of conversation is Nicholls's house—I heard Murphy and Nicholls say that Elliott went to the place and asked for his shirt—Elliott was not present then—the boys had then been sent into the country by Nicholls—Murphy said they were sent away—I cannot say that he said so in Nicholls's presence, but I have heard it from them both—I have heard Nicholls say that the boys were in the country, not that he had sent them—Murphy told me they were in the country—I have heard Nicholls speaking about Murphy, and how the robbery took place; but that is all—he was not speaking to Murphy, but to me—I cannot say that anybody was present then—I know mr. Pearce, of St. John's street—I heard Murphy say (I do not know who else was present at the time) that he and the two boys went to Mr. pearce's house on the morning after the robbery, knocked him up, went inside, and stopped there all day, or nearly so—I do not remember hearing Murphy say anything to Nicholls about the two boys.</p>

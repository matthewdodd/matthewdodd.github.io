                  </hi>. I am captain of the <hi rend="italic">Red Rover,</hi> which was lying in the London Dock. The prisoner was a custom-house officer on board—I had some ale there, which came in casks—I never authorized the prisoner to take any of it—he had no right to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the London Docks. About nine o'clock in the morning of the 3rd of March, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Red Rover,</hi> looked down the after-hatchway, and saw the prisoner and another man with this poker, break open a cask and take from it a bottle—I called out to him "Below"—he looked up, but made no answer—I went for Mr. Clements, my superior officer, and when we came back, the man on deck and the man who had been below were both gone, but the prisoner was there—we found three bottles in the prisoner's berth—we tasted this one—it contained ale—he made a rambling statement, we could get no direct answer from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you mean by a rambling statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He asked Clements who he was, and what his. business was, and so on—it was neither the steward or cook that was with the prisoner—they were both strangers, and did not belong to the ship—they were dressed like seamen—there are seven belonging to the ship, but there was no one on board but the prisoner and those two men.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday morning I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Red Rover,</hi> and saw the prisoner in the steerage—I asked if he had the charge of the ship—he said he had—there was then no one belonging to the crew on board—Godfrey pointed out a cask—the head was then secure, but there were marks of violence on it a if it had been broken—I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, "The watchman charges you with breaking open this cask"—he made no direct answer—he did not appear sober—he invited me to search his cabin, which I did, and underneath, his bed I found one entire bottle, and in a corner of the cabin I found this bottle full of ale, with the neck broken off—the remaining part of the neck was on the floor—he said he did not know how it came there, he knew nothing about them—on taking off the head of the cask, I found a vacancy of one bottle—there were three short in the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I called your attention to it, and said, "You come and exa<lb></lb>mine this berth, I have not slept in it for the last three weeks, as Captain</p>

               <p>Smith let me sleep in the cuddy"—there had been carpenters, joiners, and plumbers on board, and the cook told me he put one bottle of ale in there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that place open to the entire crew? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the prisoner had the key of it—when I first saw it, the door was open, and the prisoner inside—the bottle was not locked up, but standing, so that any body could have seen it—it is a very dark cabin—it was in a corner, but not concealed.</p>

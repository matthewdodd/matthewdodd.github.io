                  </hi>. I live at 23, James-street, North Woolwich—on the night of 15th September, about twenty minutes past 9, I was in London-street going to the Fenchurch-street Station—I had a bag on my shoulder—the prisoner came up and asked me if I wanted a light porter—I said, "No"—she asked me again, and wished to take my bag from my umbrella—I said I did not want any light porter or anything of the sort—she then asked me if I would treat her; and I said, "No, get away; I shall lose my train; I have only five minutes"—she was on the pavement in front of me; she then left me in a very suspicious manner—I turned round, saw her running away, felt, and my watch was gone—I saw it safe, I think, some minutes before; as I was going up Fenchurch-street—I did not feel it going from me—when I turned round to follow her, a man put his hand up and said, "What is your game?" or something like that, and knocked my bag off my umbrella, and tried to stop me, and then a second man tried to stop me—I pushed by both of them—I never lost sight of the prisoner; she ran down London-street, crossed Fenchurch-street into Billiter-street, and I caught her there, between the first and second lamp, on the right-hand side, and brought her back to a policeman who was coming towards me—I have not seen my watch since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is false; I was coming down Fenchurch-street, and two women ran past me. I looked round at them, and the prosecutor came and took hold of me and said, "You are the woman who robbed me." I said, "I never saw you before," and asked him what he had lost.</p>

On 16th September the last witness gave the prisoner into my custody in London-street—she was searched but the property was not found—she said at the station that she did not know the prosecutor, she never saw him, and that she was proceeding direct from London-bridge—on going to Bow-lane station, she said that she hoped the chain or chains would hang the b—r—the prosecutor was perfectly sober, and so was the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not say that; I said I hoped the chain was broken, and that he would break his neck for taking a false oath.</p>

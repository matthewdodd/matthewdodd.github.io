I lost many things out of my house; I lost a tea spoon the beginning of January, and about the 23d I lost a silk handkerchief; about the 31st, a shirt, and half a yard of cloth, a child's pin cloth, and the two jams and two tea spoons were missed on the 6th of February. I serve milk in the city, and we leave milk to serve at home by a little child; she informed me that she saw a woman in the room, upon which I set this man to watch.</p>

            . I was set to watch the prisoner. She came for a farthings-worth of milk, and gave the little child a halfpenny; she gave the prisoner a farthing, but she scrupled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190020"></xptr> it, and said it was not a good one. It was behind the stair-foot, and there was a hole cut through the door that I might see; she asked the child to get her a better farthing, and in the mean time advanced farther into the room, and took these metal buckles (producing them) from a shelf at the further side of the room; she took them into her left hand, and put them under her apron; she then went to the child, and took the farthing and milk, and went out of the house directly. I pursued her, and caught her at about twenty yards off; she was just by the constable's door; I gave her in charge of the constable.</p>

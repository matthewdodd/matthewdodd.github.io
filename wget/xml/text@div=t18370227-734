                  </hi>. I am an errand-boy at the "Age" office, in Drury-lane. On the 22nd of February, about nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop of Mr. Croft, a butcher—I heard a person say, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," (alluding to a boy in the shop,) "sup<lb></lb>pose that boy had taken it?"—the prisoner came out of the shop, and turned toward Blackmoor-street, where she joined another female, and a man—I followed them, and the other female said to the prisoner, "There is a kid after you"—I followed them to the end of Blackmoor-street—they turned to the right, and stopped there about two minutes—they then walked down Clare-street to the shop of Mr. Lindsey—the prisoner went in—I watched till she came out, and I went into the shop—I saw Hibner—I then went with North to seek after the prisoner—I saw her in company with the same female—North took her back to the shop.</p>

The prisoner came to his house on the 22nd of February, at a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, for three mutton chops, which came to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a half-crown—I gave her change—she went out—I picked up the half-crown, and put it into the bowl—I thought it was good—there was no other there—Hosling came in, and from what he said, I looked at the half-crown, and found it had—I sent North after her—he brought her back, and she was taken into custody—I gave the half-crown to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. (This witness being deaf and dumb, his evidence was communicated by an interpreter.) I am a shoemaker. This happened at Greenwhich, on the 9th of August, at half-past eleven o'clock at night—I first saw the prisoner in a cook-shop—I treated he with a basin of soup—we came out and walked together—I had a watch and each in my fob—the prisoner took it from me, and gave it to another female, who ran away with it—I took hold of the prisoner, and never let her go till the policeman took her in charge—I have not seen the watch since.</p>

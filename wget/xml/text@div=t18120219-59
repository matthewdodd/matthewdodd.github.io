               <p>Q. What time on the 4th did you miss it - A. About half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it afterwards - A. I saw a can at the watchhouse; it might be at eleven that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that can you saw at the watchhouse was the can you saw in the shop - A. It corresponded, and the oil corresponded.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he is one of our porters, and we are in the constant habit of selling cans of the same make, and oil of the same quality continually; it was sold, and set aside for delivery on the 4th; it was going to Queen Elms, it was too far to go that evening.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 3d of February, before nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner bring this cann down and hide it in the dunghill in Grosvenor Mews; after he had planted it there, my fellow servant asked him where he had been too, and directly after he was gone, I went to the dunghill, and found a can of oil; I covered it up again, the same as he left it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the mews from Mr. Smethurst - A. About fifty yards. He came again and took the can from the dung-heap, and then I seized him, when it was in his possession; I took him to the watchhouse with the can of oil.</p>

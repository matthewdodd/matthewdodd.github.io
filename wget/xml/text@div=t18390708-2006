                  </hi>. I am a Magistrate of Worship-street office—St. Matthew, Bethnal-green, is in our district—Mr. Grove is a brother Magistrate—I produce a summons issued from our office—I made on the back of the summons a few rough notes, merely calculated to fix my own attention—it was a summons in place of an information agianst Mr. James Standley—I can tell the Court the evidence the prisoner gave on that occasion—I think it right to mention that without the help of these notes, I could not have spoken to this case with any degree of correctness, it went from my mind entirely, but when I was spoken to, on looking at the notes, the whole was brought to my recollection—I recollect the prisoner perfectly—he was the witness to support the summons—I remember he said he went to the house in question at about five minutes before twelve o'clock on Sunday—the allegation was that Standley kept this house open on Sunday the 7th of April, during the hours of Divine service—I remember asking him what time he went by—he stated that he went by Shoreditch clock—that he found in the house ten men and three women in the tap-room drinking and smoking—some of them were a little fresh—that in about five minutes after ten o'clock, more men came in—they had some beer, and he said in answer to a question as to the mode in which they came in, that the last ten rushed in all together, making twenty-four persons in all, including himself—he described that shortly after there came a knock at the door—and upon this knock all these persons he described were all put out into the skittle-ground—he described the knock to have been from the visitation of the officers—he said, "After the officers left, a man came and called us all in again—I stopped there about twenty minutes, and then went away, leaving the greatest part of them there"—after that there was a cross-examination by a counsel or attorney and in that cross-examined he said the door was open when he came to it, but closed when the knock came of the officers—that is the substance of what he said, with the exception of an answer to a question I asked him, he said that the man who called them in was some servant of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Red Cow public-house, Castle-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. I remember being summoned at the instance of Rawlings, the informer—I at<lb></lb>tended before Messrs. Broughton and Grove—I remember Sunday, the 7th of April—I think the examination Was on the Thursday after—it is not true that on Sunday, the 7th of April, there were in my house ten men and three women drinking and smoking; nor that between that time and the hours of divine service finishing, ten more came in; nor that, between the hours of twelve and one, there were twenty four persons in my skittle-ground—there were no one except the carpenter, who is here—we know when the church service is ended in our parish, by the tolling of Shoreditch church bell—I did not let in any persons between eleven o'clock and the time the bell tolled—the doors were not opened at all—I was in the house or skittle-ground all the time—there is not one word of truth in twenty-four persons having been there—the carpenter was backwards and forwards into the house ail fine time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long hare you kept this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nine mouths—the skittle-ground is at the back—you go along an open court-yard to it, about twenty yards—the carpenter was altering the skittle-frames, as it was more convenient to have it done" at that time—my family consists of my wife and niece, a young child—they were there at the time—neither my wife or niece are here—they were backwards and forwards in the tap—that is where we cook oar meat generally—while I was in the skittle-ground they were at the bar, and tap, no doubt—I was never away for five minutes—they had the power of opening the door—I think the carpenter came about a quarter before eleven o'clock—he went out just at his dinner time, before one o'clock—my niece is at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's pot-boy. I remember Sunday the 7th of April—I appeared before the Magistrates on my master's summons—I was examined there for the defence—the Magistrate went at great length, and heard both sides—the church service finishes about a quarter to one o'clock—we know the ending of the church service by the striking up of the bell—between eleven o'clock and the bell striking out, no persons were admitted into the house to drink—I was in long-room cleaning it out—that is right in front of the street door—no person could have been let in without my seeing it—there is not one word of truth in ten persons coming in in a body during those hours—there were no persons in the skittle-ground except the carpenter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was after eleven o'clock you went to work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to work before eleven o'clock—none of the family went to church—the Magistrate went through, all the evidence on both sides—I was the last that was examined—I was outside before that—I did not hear any one of the witnesses examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 71, Drury Lane; that is a hosier's shop—about a week or ten days before July 8, I think it was on a Friday, I sold the prisoner a pair of socks, price 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he tendered a half-crown; I put it in the till where there were no other half-crowns, and gave him the change and he left—Mr. Jackson went to the till a few minutes afterwards, took it, out and said that it was bad; it sounded very dull; I did not see him destroy it—the prisoner came again a week or ten days afterwards for a pair of socks, it was on a Tuesday; I recognised him before he tendered any money; he gave me a half-crown—I gave it to Mr. Jackson, who gave him in custody as it was bad.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this shop in Drury Lane—I came in on the first occasion shortly after the prisoner left, and found a half-crown in the till, it was the only one there—it was, as near as I can tell, Friday, 27th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050011"></xptr>
               <p>June—I tried the half-crown with my teeth, they sank in it, and I hammered it in two; it was rather brittle and it had a white look—I was rather annoyed and vented my rage on it—I flattened it together and destroyed it—I was in the shop on the 8th when the prisoner came in; the last witness spoke to me and handed me a half-crown like the first—I said to the prisoner. "This is the second time you have tried this on, young man; have you any more about you?"—he said "No," and that he did not know it was bad or he would not have given it—I gave him in custody—I doubled it in two, but did not break it—I was so satisfied that it was bad that I threw it away.</p>

                  </hi>. I have heard the description of the way Mr. Jackson treated the first half-crown, and have no doubt it was bad—silver will usually double over without breaking—if you hit it hard it will get jagged.</p>

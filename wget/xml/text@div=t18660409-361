                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the service of the Great Western Railway Company, and reside at 28, Woodfield-place—on the night of 19th February, I was returning home, and on arriving at the lockbridge in the Harrow-road, I saw a quantity of people looking over—I looked over, and saw a man on the towing-path, and a woman on a boat using abusive language to each other, and calling each other filthy names—the man went on to the boat—he and the woman went into the cabin, where I heard them quarrelling—the man came out of the cabin; his feelings appeared to be very much cut up, and he said, "If ever a poor fellow was bothered with such a thing as you are, I am"—he did not appear to be addressing anyone, but apparently giving vent to his own thoughts—he also said, "You have been getting drunk all day, and I have been hard at work"—some one on the bridge spoke to him, and he said, "Hold your noise; if you don't, I will soon fetch something that will reach you a long way off"—another person on the bridge said, "If you have got fire-arms, you have no right to make use of them"—the prisoner said, "Put your b—head over, and see how soon I will do for you"—at that moment a crowd of men and boys were coming over the bridge, and they commenced jeering—the prisoner darted down into the cabin, came out again, stepped on to the towing-path, and about a minute and a half afterwards, I saw a flash, and heard the report of a gun—I then saw the boy Lefley drop down on his face, about three yards from me—I put my hand to his head, and found it was covered with blood—I raised an alarm, and a constable and I ran down Brindley-street,</p>

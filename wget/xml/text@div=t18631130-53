                  </hi>. On 10th June last, I was the officiating minister at St. Peter's Church, Pimlico—I am the curate—the entry in the register, of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy, is in my writing—the original is here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the whole of this entry is my writing—I do not at all know from whom I got the information—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Baptisms solemnized in St. Peter's Church, Pimlico. When baptized, "10th June, 1863"; child's Christian name, "Ada Augusta Mary"; parents' Christian names, "Richard and Augusta"; surname, "Dodd"; abode, "14, Little Chester-street;" when born, "May 24th, 1863"; quality, trade, or profession of father, "publican." That entry was made in the vestry, immediately after the baptism, from information supplied by some one present at the christening.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell what number of persons were present at the christening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could hardly swear to that—there were two females acting as godmothers, and one male as godfather, and in the usual way I called on one of them to name the child—the expression is, "Name this child"—that is addressed to all the persons present, either as godfathers or godmothers; any one gives the name.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you get the further information in the vestry from one of the persons present at the baptism? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did so in this case—I feel quite sure I got that information from a female—I asked the person who gave me that information, some particulars about a boy named Dodd, who I was acquainted with, and who I got a situation—I asked if he was still in that situation—I quite forget what answer I got.</p>

I am a cordwainer, and live at 15, Little Chester-street, Pimlico—I remember going to a christening at St. Peter's Church, Pimlico—I cannot at all remember the date; it was about June—I did not go there with the prisoner and Augusta Tibble, I met them there—I was the godfather on that occasion—I knew Tibble; she lived at No. 14, Mr. Dodd's, next door to me; she was a single woman as far as I knew—I do not remember who named the child at the christening; I did not stand near enough to hear, being deaf; in fact, I did not pay any attention—all of us went into the vestry after the christening; at least, I went in just against the door, in case I should be wanted; I did not know whether or not I should be wanted to sign my name—I stood just by the door; the prisoner and Tibble went just inside with me—it is rather a large vestry—</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">REV. MR. SNOWDEN</hi>. It is rather a large vestry—there is a large table in it which stands a very few feet from the door—the book would be on the table at the time of my making the entry—it is my strong impression that two women were opposite me at the table at the time I made the entry)—I saw the clergyman make the entry in the book—I could not speak positively as to where the prisoner stood when the entry was made, but I think she went to the table—I did not hear what was said, I did not pay sufficient attention to it—Tibble stood by me some part of the time.</p>

This point, however, was worthy of consideration, viz., that it appeared doubtful upon the evidence whether or no the name of "Dodd" was given at the font; he was prepared to rule that even if that were so, it would not prevent the prisoner being liable, because she was not charged with anything that occurred in the act of' christening, but with wilfully and knowingly permitting a false entry to be made in the register; now the register went on to describe the father, his residence and occupation, and the question would be whether, if in any of those matters the prisoner gave false information, that—would be the causing of a false entry to be made in any matter relating to the baptism.</hi>

               <p>to show for a week's holiday—I am provided with a home by the Royal family at the Soldiers' Widows' Institution—I was up in town for a week visiting my relations—I have not got my certificate with me—we generally come out When we are paid, on a Thursday—I can't say whether this was the beginning or end of the week—there was no one present but the girl and me when we had this conversation—I did not wish to bring it up before anybody else—it was as we were going along—she came to put me in the right way as far as St. Saviour's Church, as I was a stranger there and did not know my way—I was going to my daughter's in Walton-street—it was not the day I came to town, or the day I went back, it was about the middle of the week—I come out once a month on a week's leave—I believe I have not seen Augusta to talk to her since 14th June—I did not like to go to Mr. Dodd's house—I came here to-day to speak the truth in my family—I came from Kingston yesterday week—I went to Mr. Hutchinson's to give my evidence—I have had no summons to come here, nor any money, I came at my own expense—the first time I saw Mr. Hutchinson was a week last night, at his office—of course he wrote down what I had to say—I went there to speak the truth—my son, came and told me what he had seen in the paper and brought the paper, and I told him the truth as I have now stated, and I said I would go up and speak the truth—my son said, "If you know about it, mother, you had better go and speak the truth"—when I came to London, I went to Mrs. Blackburn's house to be a little time with her—I told her what her brother had said, but she has never persuaded me to tell anything—she is my daughter, and I am not ashamed to own it—I told Mrs. Blackburn what I had come to town for—she knew that I knew all about it—I always stay a week with her when I come—I was not a week with her before I went to Mr. Hutchinson—she did not take me there; I went with Mrs. Hills, another daughter—I had not seen Mrs. Blackburn then; it was when I first came up—she was at Mr. Hutchinson's office when we went there—before 14th June, I never went to see Mr. Dodd, I went there last Monday to speak to my daughter—I saw Mr. Cooper at the Westminster Police-court on the Saturday, when Mrs. Blackburn was charged before the Magistrate—I was not examined—I went to Mr. Hutchinson's office last Wednesday week; I think it must have been on a Saturday a month ago that I was at the police-court, and it was put off then, and I have never been since—I can't recollect whether Mrs. Blackburn and I went there together—I was staying with her at Walton Cottage, Walton-street, Brompton—I came up on the Friday evening, and went to the Court on the Saturday with Mrs. Hills, I recollect now—Mrs. Blackburn has a husband, but Mr. Dodd has <hi rend="italic">cohabited</hi> him there, and he has left my daughter for weeks and weeks, and she has never had a farthing from him, and been obliged to make away with property—she has no children—she does not reside with her husband, he has left her; Mr. Dodd has got him away from her, and got him to put his name up on his sign, on purpose to turn his wife out of doors.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 136, Warwick-street, Pim<lb></lb>lico—I have had charge of the prisoner's case—I remember the examination before Mr. Selfe at Westminster—I appeared for the prisoner—seven witnesses were there for the prisoner; the same that are here to-day, and one besides—on the first occasion Mr. Selfe suggested that from the line of cross-examination of Mr. Dodd I had better take time to consider whether I would cross-examine Tibble, and the case was adjourned for that purpose—on the next occasion I cross-examined Tibble, and then I said the witnesses</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Samuel Hills, of 33. Lant-street, Borough—I am the sister of Mrs. Blackburn, and aunt to Tibble—I heard of Tibble's confinement on 24th May last—she was then at Mr. Dodd's at Pimlico—I had been there before her confinement, and I went there two days after it—my brother-in-law, George Blackburn, the prisoner's husband, came to tell us she was confined that same night; he was not living at Mr. Dodd's house then; he was living with his wife—since Tibble's confinement, he has gone to Dodd's, and separated from his wife—two days after I heard of the confinement I went to Mr. Dodd's; I saw Mr. Dodd at the door—the bagatelle-room door was open, and there I saw my brother-in-law—Tibble was upstairs—Mr. Dodd asked me to go up stairs—Mrs. Blackburn and the baby were there, and Augusta and her mother—I said, "Oh dear, what a dreadful trouble for your poor mother"—she said, "Aunt, there is no occa<lb></lb>sion for you to fret about mother; it will make no difference to her what<lb></lb>ever"—I did not like to say that my brother-in-law had told me who the father was, and I said, "Who is the father?" and she said, "Aunt, Mr. Dodd is the father; he meant to have married me before now, that the child should have been born in wedlock"—Mrs. Blackburn said, "Why the old fool, how can he do that when he has a wife living; he had better leave that alone"—some time after I went, and saw her again—she gave me a muslin dress to make for her—I said, "This will do very nicely for out-doors, but you must not wear it in-doors"—"No," she said, "I must keep it on purpose to go out in with Dodd"—at the same time she said, "Mr. Dodd is going to buy me a wedding-ring"—I said, "I have two, perhaps he will buy one of mine for you"—she said, "I shall not want my dress next week; the week after will do, and when you bring that, bring the ring"—I afterwards went over with the dress and the ring—we went into the bagatelle-room, and I tried the dress on, and I gave her the ring; she put it on her finger, and said, "It fits me exactly"—we went into the parlour to Mr. Dodd and my brother-in-law, and she said, "How shall I do now," and she held her hand out at the same time with the ring on—Mr. Dodd smiled, and said, "My eye, Emma; we must put that on one side, for if the missus sees it she will make a fine to-do"—she was called Emma there, though her name is Augusta—Mr. Dodd was smiling at the size of the dress, and she said, "It is not all crinoline, Aunt has made me a muslin skirt under it"—Mr. Dodd looked at me, and said, "You will think me a little bit of a quiz, Mrs. Hills, but I can see a little fault"—I said, "Where?"—he went to my niece, and put each hand under her arms, and said, "Don't you see it is rather loose there! I could see it now before you could"—this is all quite true upon my oath; I should be grieved to come here to toll a lie—my mother came to stay with me when she came to see about my sister's trouble at Westminster—she very often comes to me, and perhaps stays till Friday or Saturday, and then goes to Mrs. Blackburn, and stays a day, and goes to another sister at Kentish Town—she has a week when she comes up—I can't say whether it was the first to go to Mr. Hutchinson to give my evidence—I think I went the first week after the inquiry—some weeks elapsed between the first and the second—I was at the police-court with my mother and the rest, ready to give evidence if called—the day that Mr. Dodd charged my sister with the assault, I was going to Brompton, and called at Mr. Dodd's house, and saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186311300076"></xptr>
               <p>my niece, and she said, "If Aunt Jemima comes, I know she will murder me," and that was the first I heard of the bother between them—that was a fortnight before he made this charge—at the same time I said to my niece, I hoped there would be no bother while I was there, for I was not well, and had had a sore throat for months—she said, "Aunt, my throat has been dreadful, and Mr. Dodd took me to Margate to see if the change would do me good"—I said, "Have you been to the sea-side?"—she said, "Yes, and as so ill while we were there, when the waitress asked if we should want the bed again that night, Mr. Dodd said, 'No,' he must make the best of his way home to get some help, for he was afraid his <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> would be choked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I live at 53, Mare Street, Hackney—about 5 o'clock on the morning of 10th June—I was aroused by the police, and I observed my front drawing-room window open and one pane broken; it was closed when I went to bed—I went to the police-station and there saw the articles produced, which are mine—O'Neil was at the station when I identified them.</p>

I was going towards Mare Street, at about 4.15 on Sunday morning, with the last witness, when I saw the two prisoners coming from the front garden gate of the prosecutor—a short boy of about twenty was with them; he beckoned to the prisoners and walked away—I called out to a sergeant who was coming up the road to stop Goffee, as he looked rather bulky—when they saw two constables in front of them they turned round and faced me, and I let Goffeerun by, but caught O'Neil and we had a little struggle in the road—he said "God blind me, you havn't got me to the station yet"—with the assistance of the sergeant I got him to the station—on the way he said to the last witness he would have his b-y liver out, or words to that effect—when he got to the station he made a rush at the last witness, which was prevented by the sergeant and myself—Goffee was apprehended four days afterwards—at the station be said "You have got the cheese, but you have not bit it yet."</p>

About 4.15 on the morning in question I was near the prosecutor's house when I saw both the prisoners—O'Neil was standing with his back towards the garden and Goffee standing opposite him—I saw a short person beckoning towards the prisoners and they made towards the last witness—I followed and sung out to Goffee and I fell and Goffee got away—at the station this petticoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on O'Neil; he had his arms through it and his coat and trowsers but<lb></lb>toned over it—he made use of threats—I afterwards took Goffee; he went quietly, but his friends tried all they could to baffle us.</p>

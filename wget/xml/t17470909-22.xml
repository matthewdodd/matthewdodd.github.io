             was a Servant-Maid that liv'd some where near Clare-Market. Mrs Watts, and two other young Women, coming from Hampstead, the Prisoner at the Bar insinuated himself into their Company, as they were going into a Publick-house to drink a Glass of Cyder. He desired afterwards to wait upon her Home, and then begg'd Leave to make her a second Visit, pretending to maintain her in a reputable Manner. By this means he insinuated himself so far into her Affections as to marry her. The first Marriage was on the 9th of February at May-Fair Chapel; the second Marriage the 21st of August, at the Anchor and Crown at Fleet-ditch, by one Prichard a Fleet Parson. We will call our several Witnesses to prove the Identity of the two Marriages.</p>

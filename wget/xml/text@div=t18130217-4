I had sent my daughter for them at the bank to get a draft paid of twenty pounds; she brought three five-pound notes, and five small notes. My daughter brought them to me in the pocket-book from Kingston. When my daughter delivered me the pocketbook I saw what it contained; it contained three five-pound notes, and I took the five small notes out of the pocket-book, and left the others in. I went to fetch the pocket-book in as I generally do of a night, and it was gone.

            . I am a constable. I know no more than I had the note delivered to me. I searched the prisoner. I only found a knife, a purse, and a ring upon him. I asked him if he knew anything about the rest of the notes. He told me that he bought the ring at Kingston, which I found in his possession, with one of the five-pound notes he found. He found two five-pound notes together on Hampton Court Green. I think he said he found them on Wednesday evening, after his parade. He told me that he found them in a piece of paper, or that they were wrapped up in paper, I do not know which. I went to the jeweller's shop at Kingston, and got that note. The number of that note is 6736.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. On the 21st of September I sent the prisoner with some brass-dust to exchange for new metal; he returned with a correct account of that. An officer came next morning with a bag of brass, which I examined, and believe to be my father's.</p>

            . I live in Eagle-court, Clerkenwell. On the evening of the 21st of September I was in the street, hearing a song; the prisoner came up. and asked me to sell some brass for him; he took me to Sutton-street, and said if I would go and sell it he would give me 6d. I went, by his direction, to Harcourt's - he went round the corner while I knocked and asked what they gave for brass - they said they would not buy it by candle-light - I went and told him; he then went to the house himself: I waited about five minutes - he did not come out - I went home, and put the brass behind a water-butt; I told nobody about it - my mother got up at half-past five o'clock; I got up, and was going out at the same time. I took the brass out, not knowing what to do with it; the watchman took hold of me, and asked what I was going to do with it; I was going to tell him, but he took me to the watch-house; and I there told all about it, and showed where he had told me to sell it; we went in there, and they gave us a direction; we went near Oxford-street, and found the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Nobody interrupted you when you went to sell it? A. No. I hid the brass because my mother would ask where I got it, and beat me perhaps. I told the watchman I was going to my master's, in Red Lion-street; I have no master there, but the prisoner told me to say so if any one spoke to me - I did not suspect any thing.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I stopped Tyrrell with the bag of brass - I knew him, but know nothing against him; he said he was going to Red Lion-street, but I said he was going from there; he then said, "I mean Red Lion-street, Holborn." I took hold of it - he fell on his knees, and said he would tell me all; I then said, "Come along" - he said a man asked him to sell it, as he was now stated. I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody, and heard Tyrrell say he was the man who delivered it to him; the prisoner looked at him, winked, and said, "Was it me?" he said, "Yes - I will swear to you?"</p>

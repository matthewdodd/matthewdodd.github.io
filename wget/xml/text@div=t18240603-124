On the 1st of April I addressed a letter to Mr. Cox, Portman-street, Portman-square, and enclosed a 5 l. note in it; I have a memorandum of the number which I made before I sent it off; (reads) it was No. 15,774, dated Jan. 8, 1824; I sealed the letter with wax, and put it into the letter-bag in which letters are conveyed from the Governor to the receiving-house - I locked the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How many persons have a key of that bag - A. The Governor, myself, and the letter-sergeant have each one; the Governor was not at Sandhurst at the time, and took his key away with him, I suppose, as he generally does; he was in Scotland; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Look at this note (handing one) - A. This is the note, it has the same number and date.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. These entries appear all in the same ink, and to be taken at the same time - A. It is an entry of the notes made when I receive them, and I write against each note the person to whom I pay it. I have written the name of Cox against this one. I have not placed his name to the wrong number; I received the notes in Feb., and at this time had only one other left, which was 15,775; I remember that number in my hands afterwards. Here is a copy of the number, made at the time I inclosed it; at the time I sent it, I was not in the room in which the original memorandum was, and so I took the number on this paper, and entered it off on the original one when I went into the room; these notes were my private property, and did not belong to Government.</p>

            . I am letter-sergeant of the Millitary College, Sandhurst. On the 1st of April I opened the Governor's letter-bag before I sent the letters off to the post, in order to take the letters out and put them into the College-bag. I remember one letter being in it directed to Mr. Cox; I put it into the College-bag with the other letters, and delivered it to Hammond, who carries it from the College to Bagshot; the postmaster at Bagshot has a key of the College-bag; I have one, and Hammond has another, but nobody else has one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The Governor has a key - A. I believe so; he was not at the College, and is not here; I do not know what had become of his key - I generally look at all the letters - there were only four in the Governor's bag, and I read the directions of them all - I am not positive whether two were not addressed to the Horse Guards - I took a copy of the address of one.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Which did you take a copy of - A. One that was going to the Governor, as I intended to write to one of his servants, and wanted to know where to address it; I heard of the loss of this letter some days after. The Governor has a key of his own bag, but not of the College-bag. I delivered the bag to Hammond directly after I had locked it. I keep my own key hanging on a nail in the Post-office of the College; nobody but myself has access to the Post-office. I always lock the door when I leave.</p>

            . I keep the Cambridge Coffee-house in Newman-street, Oxford-street, and know the prisoner as a postman. He applied to me on a Saturday to change a five pound note from him, which I did, and wrote on the front of it at the time (looking at a note) - this is it. I have written</p>
               <p>"Postman 3 - 4 - 24 on it." Part of the word postman is torn off by cancelling the note, but I know my writing which is left.</p>

            How long have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030043"></xptr>you known the prisoner - A. I cannot say; I have known him many weeks as a postman. I can swear, from what remains of my writing, that it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. There is the letters Po and an, 3 - 4 - 24; now might that not be the name of Portman - A. I know nobody of that name. I never change a note for persons whom I do not know, and always write the person's name on it when I know it. I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you distinctly recollect receiving this, and writing that upon it with the date - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is your house in his district - A. No; I wrote postman on it, because I knew him as a postman - if the postman of my district had paid it to me. I should have written the same; but I have no doubt of the prisoner being the man I took it from - he had his red coat on at the time. I did not change a note for any other postman.</p>

            . I am wife of the last witness. I know the prisoner - he used our house. I remember his coming on a Saturday to get change for a note. I saw my husband give him the change, and was present when he wrote on the note, but did not see what he wrote. It was a 5 l. note, for I had it in my hand; the prisoner gave it into my hand, saying,</p>
               <p>"Can you oblige me with change for a 5 l. note." I gave it to my husband. I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime I assure you. The gentleman must be mistaken in my person. I have borne an excellent character through life.</p>

               <p>Four persons gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

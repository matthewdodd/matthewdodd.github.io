                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Oily Policeman</hi> 757). On the 15th May, about 4.30, I was on duty at Fenchurch Street Station, and saw the prisoner leaning against some iron railings in front of the fire-place—a lady came out of the ladies' waiting-room and went towards the Tilbury Booking Office, which was not open, and she stopped—as soon as the booking office was open he went to her side and then left and went towards the back, putting his hand into his right hand pocket, and passed into the lavatory—I went to meet him the other way, and found him with the purse in his left hand and the money in his right—I seized him—he said "What are you doing?"—I said "I think I want this"—he said "You have made a mistake, it is my money"—I took him back to the waiting-room and sent for the lady, who came and said that she had lost her purse—I said "What does it contain?"—she said about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said "Is this yours?"—she said "If it is, there is-a piece of pencil and a button of a dress in it," and so there was—the prisoner then said that he picked it up.</p>

I live at 3, Pilgrim-street, Kennington Lane—on the 15th May I was at Fenchurch Street Station—I took sixpence out of my purse to take a ticket, and put my purse back again—I then put my hand down, and missed it instantly—I said "Oh, my God, my purse is gone"—I turned to look, and saw the prisoner in the policeman's hands—I told the policeman that my purse contained about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a button off my dress, an almanack, and a piece of pencil—the edges of the almanack were cut to make it fit the purse—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my purse and this is the almanack.</p>

I told her I was going home. She walked down to the corner of the street with me, and I got a few yards off, and she asked me if I would give her sixpence to get something to drink? I put my hand into my right hand waistcoat pocket, where I had four guineas and a half in gold, and three shillings and sixpence in silver. I put my hand into my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160134"></xptr>pocket and felt for the sixpence, and when I had found it among the other money, I put it into her hand; I staid with her about a minute or two minutes and a half, in the street; and all of a sudden she began to abuse me, and told me I might have the sixpence again; I was induced to think from such an extraordinary circumstance, and from her having her hand round my waist, that she had been picking my pocket; on feeling in my pocket I found my suspicion was confirmed, for out of four guineas and a half, I had but one guinea and two shillings and sixpence left; she went off, I pursued her, and overtook her opposite the Pantheon.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner came up to you, are you certain you had four guineas and a half in you pocket? - I am very sure; I had been playing at whist, and I had marked with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any body else near you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand that there was nobody near you from the time you felt your money, to the time you missed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you overtake her? - It might be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her? - I did; and desired the watchman to feel in her pockets, and he only found some halfpence, and a sixpence; I believe there was a shilling, but I did not take much notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched after, at the watch-house? - Yes, she was a great distance, near a mile off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other girl with her when you overtook her? - Yes, and I think it was the same that was with her when I first met her, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You had her committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No property found at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been to Mary-le-bone, to speak to my sister, and that gentleman met me, and said I had robbed him, and charged the watchman with me. I never see him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did I understand you to say there were two girls when she came up to you? - Yes; she left the other; the other stood three quarters of the width of the pavement off; the pavement was very wide.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say there was no other person in the street but her, at first? - No, at the time I felt for my money and found it was gone.</p>

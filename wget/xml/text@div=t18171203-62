On the 30th of October, about four o'clock, the prisoner came in and had a glass of porter in a rummer; he had the newspaper over an empty rummer which was on the table; I took it away - He got up, and went to another table, where there was another empty rummer, and was reading the paper over that; I waited at the door till he came out, and seeing that the glass was gone, I went after him, stopped him, and charged him with taking it; he denied it - I insisted on his coming back - He then took it out of his pocket, and gave it to me, saying he had made a mistake. I took him back to my master's, where he took two more glasses out of his pocket, which were not ours.</p>

                  </hi> I am a farmer and milkman, of Rushey Green, Lewisham—the prisoner has been in my service twenty months—it was his duty to carry out milk to customers, and account for it daily, when he returned—on 22nd May he took out milk in the morning and never returned—he did not account to me on 13th May for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 14th May, or for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 18th, from Mr. Hall—he did not account for a shilling received from Mr. Hall that month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you got a book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we book the number of quarts he receives—if it was paid the money would be put down in the ledger—I have not got the ledger here, but it would be crossed out here as well if it was paid—Mr. Hall had dealt with me months before 17th March—he paid up to 9th March—it has been paid generally daily—the prisoner has served Mr. Hall all the time he has dealt with me—there was an old account of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd on 9th March, which the prisoner told me Mr. Hall had not paid; but the prisoner has paid it since, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, and told me that Mr. Hall paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—he said, "Mr. Hall has given me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off the bill," but no bill had been delivered then—I believe Webb cannot read or write—a little over the exact sum has been paid, nearly two days' milk, since the bill—I would not answer that the quantities marked to Mr. Hall are correct, because he had out fifteen gallons in the morning, and he would bring back so much—he would not give me the names of the people who had paid, only of those who had not—I find, from the prisoner's statement, that on 13th May Mr. Hall had milk to the value of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the 14th of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on the 15th of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my entries are from the prisoner's book, but he might book more to one and less to another.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 105). On 1st December I was in Lion-street near the Kent-road, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, and saw I both the prisoners running down Lion-street towards New-street—they crossed New-street and went into No. 7, which is a harbour for thieves and prostitutes—I stopped there and listened about two minutes, and heard Gray say, "Anne, is there a lucifer down here?"—I afterwards went into Lion-street and saw the prosecutrix and Clark at the door of No. 30—from what she said to me examined the front window and found a pane of glass broken and fresh blood upon it, the latch was pushed right back, it was right underneath the broken pane and could be easily pushed back—I went over the house, and in the front room found a considerable lot of towels, brushes, and sheeting, all strewed about the room—I afterwards went with Serjeant Bell to 7, New-street, and found both the prisoners in one bed—Gray had his drawers, stockings, and shirt on, and Skews was entirely un<lb></lb>dressed, except his shirt—while we were at the door I had heard Gray say, "They saw us come in; they have found out the job"—I asked them how long they had been in bed—they said, "About half an hour"—I examined Gray's hands, they were not cut—we had great difficulty in getting Skews right hand from under him—I then found the top of his middle finger cut off by a pane of glass; and bleeding, just a little bit of the flesh was cut off and the skin—Gray said that there had been a row up at the Elephant and Castle, and that he had protected his friend—Skews said that a female shoved an umbrella in his eye, then drew a knife to stab him and that was the <hi rend="italic">in<lb></lb>stigation</hi> of having his finger cut—I took them to the station with the assis<lb></lb>tance of Sergeant Bell, and found on them these two knives; this one has paint on it of the same colour as that on the window sash, and the other has marks of putty on it, with which it had been picked out—I was present when Sergeant Bell found some alpaca in the corner of a box under the bed<lb></lb>stead where they were sleeping.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 39). I went with the last witness to the house of the prosecutrix—I examined the place—it was all in confusion; the cup<lb></lb>boards and boxes all ransacked, and spots of blood all over the articles—I found a pane of glass broken and the putty all cut away; the catch had been forced back—the paint on this knife and the paint on the window sash cor<lb></lb>responded—I afterwards went to New-street, where I saw the prisoners—they both appeared to be asleep—I had heard one of them say only aboutthree minutes before, "They have seen us come home, and they have found out the job"—after I was admitted they roused up and appeared to me as if they had been drinking—Gray said, "What do you want?"—I said, "I want you for that job"—I did not exactly mention the job then—he did not make any answer to that—I asked him to let me look at his hands—he showed me both his hands—I could not t perceive any marks of blood upon them—I then pulled Skews over, and asked him to let me look at his hands—he put his left hand out—I examined that and found no blood; he then put his right hand out—I found that that was cut at the top, and there was blood on the sheets—there was a handkerchief by the side of the bed, saturated with blood—there was a box under the bed, which Gray said was a dog's box—I examined it, and found in it a piece of alpaca with marks of blood on it—there was no dog in the box, or in the house.</p>

I am the wife of William Henry Clark, of Lion-street, painter and glazier—I recollect having fastened the window of my parlour about 8 o'clock on the evening of 1st December.—I went to bed about ten o'clock—during the night the barking of a little dog aroused me, and, hear<lb></lb>ing some one rushing down stairs, I got up—we sleep in the back room; that leads into the passage—the door leading into the street was open—I had not left it in that condition the evening before—the parlour door was wide open, I had shut it the night before—I found the room all in confusion, things turned from the cupboard on to the floor, and likewise spotted with blood—this</p>

            , imported by the ship Isabella; they could obtain possession of it by an order signed by them (looking at the document in question) this is the order on which wine is delivered or transferred at the dock - it is the only authority required by the dock company; if genuine it would entitle the party named in it to take the wine away at once, or to transfer it into his own name: if he chose it to remain he would have a warrant enabling him to transfer the wine by endorsement to any party he chose, or to deliver it to any one - he could take it away by giving an order to deliver to bearer; I saw the order in question presented by the prisoner, on the 29th of December, but whether to me or to Blackwood, I cannot say - he stood just by; I know that five pipes of wine have been delivered to that order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know who lodged these wines in the dock? A. They were regularly entered by Donaldson, and arrived in November, 1827 - were then entered in the name of Donaldson, and on the 18th of December, 1828, were entered by Donaldson to George and Thomas Cussons; three pipes of the wine were delivered on the 18th of March last, one on the 30th, and one on the 12th of May - one still remains in the docks; Cussons lodged a caveat against the delivery after four pipes had been delivered - the fifth was delivered to C. Pamenter, to whom it had been transferred by Field, to whom the sale had been made; they could exchange hands by endorsing the transfer on the warrant - it is a power which transfers property by endorsement, like a bill of exchange.</p>

            . I am an agent, and carry on a cotton spinning and manufacturing business at Manchester, in partnership with my brother George. The prisoner was in our employ up to December last as agent; I was on the continent, and knew nothing of this wine (looking at the order) my name is written here, but it is not my writing - my brother's name is not here; I never authorized the prisoner to sign it, or to use my signature, nor did my brother, to my knowledge: I never gave him authority, directly or indirectly, to take these wines out of the docks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew nothing of the transfer? A. No - it took place after my departure for the continent;(looking at a paper) this has my signature, and my brother's; the prisoner carried on our town business, and was to be paid 5 per cent. on goods sold, and not to be answerable for bad debts - he had carried on business for us about thirteen months; he has not been obliged to raise money for that purpose, to my knowledge - I do not know one way or the other; my brother sent Jones up in January last to look into our affairs - I was in Flanders at the time: I have not detained the prisoner in custody for the amount of these wines.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you leave for the continent in December? A. Yes - on the 14th; when I left there was a balance in the prisoner's favour, of upwards of 100l. - I left a bill for 135l. in his hands, also a balance of 100l., which I told him he must cash out.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain what you mean by a balance - was it due to you or the prisoner? A. Due to us; he was indebted to us 100l. - money collected, and due to us.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then why did you leave the bill in his hands? A. In case he should want it, besides the 100l.</p>

            . I am in partnership with my brother. The signature to this order is not my hand-writing; I never authorized any person to sign it for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in England? A. Yes, at Manchester; the prisoner corresponded with us from time to time on business; I do not know of his borrowing money of Picton - I had a note which was given to Picton, but cannot find it; I had a note signed Picton - it was a copy, not the original; I cannot find it - I had it last January, it was signed by Picton as a promissory note to the prisoner for 19l. - I had it from Jones, my brother-in-law; I first spoke to the prisoner respecting this wine about February; I had sent Jones up to watch his conduct - I came to town myself on the 11th of January, and knew nothing about the transfer of the wine till that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not then apprised that the warrants for the wine had been deposited with Picton as security for the 19l.? A.Jones told me Trueman had deposited the order with Picton for 19l. - he knew of the prisoner doing it - when I came to town the prisoner was arrested for debt; I lodged a detainer against him the beginning of January for 200l. - this wine was included in that 200l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you never taken off that detainer? Never; because he owes us the amount in addition to the wines - I did not lodge a detainer for the whole amount he owed us - I included the wine; but have since ascertained that he owed us more money - we took the wine into the account for which we detained him; the value of the wine alone is 270l. - I knew he owed us 200l. independent of the wine, at the time the detainer was lodged; I had no knowledge of the forgery then - I knew he had dealt improperly with the wine on the 11th of January, and lodged the detainer after that.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. At the time you lodged the detainer, did you know whether your brother might not have authorised him to make the order? A. I did not know the order had been made.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You meant in your detainer to include the value of it, or part of it? A. I did; I knew it was in the name of Trueman at that time; I got a detainer for the criminal charge in September - I ascertained the order to be a forgery at the end of February, on my brother's return, and gave the business into my attorney's hand to proceed against the dock company - when I found out the forgery I did not go to the docks, as Trueman had told Jones my brother had transferred them to him before he went on the continent; I did not treat the wine as a civil suit in June -I included the wine in the detainer.*</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any transactions with the prisoner for goods sold and delivered except this wine? A. Yes; there was 48l. deficient in stock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any demand against him for goods sold and delivered? A. For 48l. deficient in stock, and he had overdrawn his commission; the 48l. was for goods he had from us.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean that you had sold them to him? A. He had taken them and sold them of his own accord, and overdrawn us for them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you lodged the detainer, you had no positive certainty of the exact amount of your debt? A. I knew it was 200l. besides the wine - but the wine was included by my solicitor - I did include the wine.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Cussons. About the 20th of December I was at their place of business in town, which is in Basing-lane, and saw the prisoner - there were a number of work people in the place; I asked what they were - he said they were cottonwinders in the prosecutors' employ, and were waiting for their wages; I asked why he did not pay them - he said he could not, Thomas Cussons having gone on the continent on the Sunday previous, and he had only a bill of exchange - he asked me to cash the bill, which I declined, and asked why he did not sell the wines? he said he could not without the signature of the firm.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you that, in order to raise money to pay the work people, he had been obliged to raise 19l. through Picton on these wines? A. He did; and that if I would repay the 19l. the wines would be my brother's again - but he specified no time; he said in a few days the money would be returned - I went with him in the course of the week to Picton; Picton told me he would go with me to the person who he (Picton) had transferred the warrant to, if I would call on him in a few days; he would not tell me who it was.</p>

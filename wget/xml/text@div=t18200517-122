            . I lived in Portland-place; I was waiting till the French Ambassador returned - I had been in his service. On the 4th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was returning home from the City, and went into a public-house in Cheapside; I saw Judd there, he asked me where I was going to? I said to the west end of the town. He said he was going to Covent-garden, and if I liked to ride he would take me there. I accepted his offer, and called for a pot of ale to treat him. He wanted me to get inside his coach, but I got on the box, and drove myself as far as Catherine-street, my watch was then safe. He then said the people were coming from the play, and I had better give him the reins; he drove to Charles-street, and stopped just before we came to the <placeName id="t18200517-122-crimeloc716">Marquis of Granby</placeName>

I asked what I should pay him? he said nothing but what I chose to treat him with. I went into the house, and at that time another coachman came in, he asked me to treat himself and his friend. I treated them with a glass of rum each, and I had a glass of gin and peppermint. I did not stop long, as I came outside, and stopped on the cill of the door. I was surrounded by a parcel of people; Taylor, who was convicted, drew the watch from my fob and ran away with it - I went after him, and they held me to prevent my running.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether they had hold of you while your watch was taken - A. No, I did not. I turned round directly and saw Judd behind me; I said,</p>
               <p>"Now, you let go of me, or it will be worse for you." I tried to get away again - I turned round and saw three more, they were Randal, Allger, and another, whom I should know if I saw him. I knocked them back clean from me, ran after Taylor, and saw him throw the watch into a hackney-coach. I described him to Bethell, who followed me outside the watch-house. I saw him at the public-house about three-quarters of an hour after, Randall and Allger were then there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What countryman are you - A. Wiltshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the gentleman who sat by me just now - A. I do not remember seeing him till Allger's father brought him to ask me questions. The night before the robbery I slept in the Compter as I was drunk. I did not know Judd before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have pipes of tobacco at the Granby - A. I did not, that I recollect - we drank at the bar. I did not see Allger or Judd before they robbed me. I am sure I did not smoke there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was going away had you paid your reckoning - A. I had four half-crowns and a 1 l. note in my pocket - I will not swear that I paid, but I know by the money I had in my pocket I must have paid, or it would have been impossible for me to have given the boy a shilling, which he said I did. I will be upon my oath that I put a half-crown down on the bar before I attempted to go away. It appeared to me that the person who snatched my watch came from the street. I was at the door when they held me behind, and prevented my following him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge any one else with robbing you - A. Yes, two men. They came up the first time that I took Taylor, and got him from me. Taylor had a light snuff-coloured coat. I did not see that he left his coat behind when he escaped.</p>

            . I am beadle of Covent-garden. On the 4th of April, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, Hughes came to the watch-house and said he had been robbed, and after we went out he described the features of the person. He appeared to have his senses about him -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170059"></xptr>he walked very steadily. I went to Charles-street with him. The first public-house we came to was the Coach and Horses, he said the house was further down; we went into the Granby, four or five houses further down; I told him to go in and take no notice of me - he fixed on Taylor; he had told me the man had a rise on his nose, which Taylor had; he gave him in charge, and I took him to the watch-house. When we got outside the door we were surrounded by coachmen, who obstructed us. I called the watchmen to assist me - we were interrupted once or twice in going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was Bartlett at the watch-house - A. He was. Hughes said he had had the man in custody and had a full view of his face, and he had a rise on his nose. Mrs. Weedon keeps the public-house, she was in the bar. I could see what Hughes did.</p>
               <p>Q. A person in the bar can see distinctly what passes in the taproom - A. I do not think they can. There is a wainscot between her and the taproom. I cannot say that I saw either of the prisoners there - I do not say they were not there. The first attempt to rescue Taylor was by the Hummums, and then by Tavistock-row; Fitzgerald and Sullivan were with me then, they might have seen the interruption. There were no blows given. I told them that if they came near me again I would knock them down. Hughes had charged two men with rescuing Taylor before this; I heard they were discharged for want of prosecution. He told me his watch was worth 7 l. or seven guineas.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Charles-street. I was standing at the end of Charles-street, near Russell-street, and heard the cry of Watch! a little after twelve o'clock - the voice came from the lower part of Charles-street. I ran up, and saw Hughes standing with a crowd about him - he had hold of a man. I rushed in among the crowd, and he gave charge of the man - he was rescued from me, and got away. Hughes went towards a coach, and said his watch was thrown into it. I afterwards assisted in conveying Taylor to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Hughes sober - A. He was capable of walking and speaking well - he had taken liquor, but was quite sensible; two men were quarrelling with him, and he gave charge of them. I had to hinder him several times from making a noise in the street. He went to the watch-house, and then he and Bethell went to the public-house; they brought Taylor out, and called me to assist - I took hold of his right side and Sullivan was on his left; Bethell was pushing him behind to make him go forward. I did not notice any attempt to rescue him - I heard some talk behind, but took no notice. Just as we had passed the Hummums I heard him talk about people tripping him up, or coming too close to him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Great Russell-street. I assisted in taking Taylor to the watch-house from the door of the public-house. Bethell pushed him behind, as he did not wish to go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. There was no attempt to rescue him - A. A quantity of people followed us, I do not know that any attempt was made to rescue him.</p>
               <p>RANDALL'S Defence. Every word the man has said is false. When he came into the house he said Taylor had a light-coloured coat on, and he thought he was the man. I said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, if you know yourself innocent, go into the parlour and be searched." They shoved him out of the door; I did not follow him out directly. I was going to the watch-house, but they said they would not allow any one to speak. He has sworn to five men besides me.</p>
               <p>ALLGER's Defence. I was at the house when Hughes came in. He put his hand on Taylor's head, and said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man who took my watch." He said he had not been out of the house; nor was I out of the house until Taylor was taken out.</p>
               <p>JUDD'S Defence. He drove my coach as far as Catherine-street. We went into a wine-vaults, he had some peppermint, and I had some rum. I then drove to the Granby, we had sixpenny worth of rum and water, and some tobacco. We all three had a pipe each.</p>

            . I keep the Marquis of Granby, public-house; my bar is on the left of the lobby, and the taproom on the right. I can see through the bar window into the taproom. I know the prisoners very well. I remember Hughes coming to the house about twelve o'clock, with two coachmen - he called for a glass of rum and water, and three pipes of tobacco; I served him, then a man named Nicholls came in, and asked Hughes if he might not have a pipe too - Hughes said he was one of the party, and he should have one. All four had a pipe of tobacco each in the lobby. Hughes asked me to let him go into another room; I said I could not, as it was a late hour, and it is for the accommodation of the coachmen - he was very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your reason - A. Yes; we are not allowed to let them in, but I do not say I never do. He then went out at the door - all three went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all three go out without going into the taproom - A. They did; I had observed Taylor, Randall, and Allger in the tap-room, before eleven o'clock; Hughes did not pay his reckoning before he went out. I am perfectly sure he did not lay a half-crown on the bar; I sent the boy after him for his money, and he brought me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Hughes left your house with the three coachmen, did you hear the cry of Watch! - A. I heard no cry at all, nor any alarm. I know when the boy came back Taylor, Randall, and Allger were all three in the taproom - Taylor was asleep with his head on the table. Bethell and the prosecutor came in in about three-quarters of an hour. I am certain Taylor, Randall, and Allger, had not quitted the house all that time. They took poor Taylor out - it is my firm opinion that Taylor is innocent. I then went into the taproom, Hughes looked round for a moment or two, then went up and touched Taylor on the shoulder - he had just awoke, and was rubbing his eyes - he asked him if he had not had a drab-coloured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170060"></xptr>coat on that evening? Taylor said</p>
               <p>"No, I had no other coat on than that I have on now." Hughes then said,</p>
               <p>"I think, by your side-face, you are the man who robbed me of my watch." Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"You think very wrong, for I have never been out of this place." Hughes said to the beadle,</p>
               <p>"Take him away, be it as it may."</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was Bethell a little distance from you - A. He was. I did not think he was come in with Hughes. I thought he was come in to order me to shut up. Randall and Allger said, take him into the parlour and search him, if you think he has got anything. I cannot say who said so. Taylor went away very willingly, and was not searched. He said he was sure he should not be kept.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you appear on Taylor's trial - A. No; I was not subpoened - they said they knew he was innocent, and it would not be necessary for me to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send your boy here - A. He was subpoened, and I gave him leave to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you never heard the least alarm of robbery, till your boy came back with the shilling - A. I do; I heard no rattle sprung. Hughes was smoking in my lobby for a quarter of an hour. Neither Randall, Taylor, nor Allger, came out of the taproom while Hughes was there. I think I had seen Taylor once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have known him if you met him in the street - A. I think I should, for he had assisted me to get a drunken man out that night, between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the potboy help - A. Yes; we all persuaded him to go, and put him into a coach. His name was Titness.</p>
               <p>GEO. WATSON. I am waiter to the last witness. Hughes came into the lobby with Cole and Judd. He ordered six-penny-worth of rum and water, and they had four pipes of tobacco - one each. Nicholl's came in and asked Hughes if he would like to hear a song, and said,</p>

               <p>"I dare say Mrs. Weedon will not be against our going into the taproom." I was drawing a pint of porter in the bar at the time. I took the beer into the taproom to Randall, and heard no more.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the beer into the taproom to Randall, who was there - A. Taylor was asleep, Allger sat by him, and Randall sat at the end of the box. I stopped there till my mistress came in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is not that gentleman come in here."</p>
               <p>Q. Meaning into the taproom - A. Yes; at that time nobody had moved from their places. My mistress said,</p>
               <p>"He has not paid his reckoning." She said it was 10 d. I went out over against the York Hotel, and asked him for it. He said,</p>
               <p>"Do you dispute my word?" The watchman staid by the side of him. Mr. Stannard was at his door. He said,</p>
               <p>"My name is

            , of Portland-place." I said,</p>
               <p>"Let you be what you will, you must not go without paying your reckoning." He pulled four shillings out of his pocket, and gave me one. At that time he was giving charge of two young men. I was by the taproom fire when he returned with Bethell. The three men I mentioned were still there. My mistress stood at the bar-door. Taylor was just rising himself up, and wiping his eyes. He directly looked at him, and said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man that had a drab coat on a little while ago."</p>
               <p>Q. Was Titness there then - A. He was just gone home with his coach. He was tipsy. My mistress advised him to go. Hughes said nothing about his face, as I heard. Randall said,</p>
               <p>"If you think he has got your watch, take him into the parlour and search him;" but they took him out. Allger sat next to Taylor, and Randall on the other side of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hughes say,</p>
               <p>"Why, you are one of the men that held me" - A. No; he said nothing of the kind. I did not hear the rattle sprung.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Pray, what song was it that was sung - A. I heard no song. My mistress stood at the bar when Nicholls proposed to sing a song, close by, and must have heard the proposal. It is a small house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to come here last Sessions - A. A gentleman brought me a written order to attend, and said I must come. She knew I came to say, Taylor was in our house; and she knew he was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress asked you whether they had come into the taproom - A. Yes; and said he had not paid his reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no noise or bustle about the door - A. No; I took no notice. I heard no rattle sprung; if one had sprung, I should have heard it.</p>

            . I am a coachman. I was at Mrs. Weedon's when Hughes came in, in company with Randall and Allger. Taylor was there. I got there about half-past eleven o'clock. Taylor laid with his head on the table, asleep. I did not see Hughes till he came in with the beadle. He asked Taylor what he had done with his light-coloured coat. He said,</p>
               <p>"What makes you ask that question?" Hughes said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man that looked me in the face, and took my watch."</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said,</p>
               <p>"I think" - A. I am. Randall advised him to go into the parlour and be searched. They went out at the door. Randall, Allger, and Taylor, were not out of the house from the time I went in till Taylor was taken away. I did not expect he would be detained. I had heard the cry of</p>
               <p>"Thief!" very distinctly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, or any one, go out to see what was the matter - A. No. Mrs. Weedon was in the bar at the time. I cannot say whether she heard it - they might be heard as well at the bar as the taproom.</p>

            . I am a coachman. I saw Hughes in the street. He had hold of a coachman with a drab coat on - he got away. I know Taylor, it was not him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the man like Taylor - A. I do not think he was. I went directly to Weedon's, and saw Taylor there, sitting by Allger; he had a brown great-coat on. I had seen him there that night before. I never saw him in a drab coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he struggling with the man about - A. He said he had lost his watch. I was led to the spot by a very great noise - I was sitting in the taproom in Weedon's house and ran out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170061"></xptr>Q. Do you think any one in the taproom or lobby must have heard it - A. I should think they must. Hughes was struggling with the man close to the York hotel, nearly opposite the house.</p>
               <p>CAMPBELL. I am a watchman of Tavistock-street. About twenty minutes past twelve o'clock I saw Hughes by the coach-stand, with his hand on the coach-door; he said he had been robbed of his watch, and would insist on the coach being taken to the watch-house. I said</p>
               <p>"What can you do with the coach or the horses? you had better take the number, and summons the coachman tomorrow." He was rather obstinate. I said I must not have a disturbance. Weedon's waiter came and asked him for the money for his liquor; he said he had paid it, the waiter said he had not. He pulled out 4 s. and gave him 1 s. He stood talking to the people, and said he would charge somebody.</p>
               <p>Q. Charge somebody with what - A. Robbing him, I suppose. I said,</p>
               <p>"What use is that, unless you pitch on the right man? let me see him, and I will take him." He looked about, saw nobody he could charge, and I returned to my beat. I am confident he was quite intoxicated - he certainly was not sober enough to know a man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He could not speak plain, I suppose - A. No; he could walk, but he staggered about. I took the number of the coach, it was 1127.</p>

            . I keep the York hotel, Covent-garden. On the night of the robbery I heard a noise, went to my door, and saw Hughes give the waiter some money. Before that he had charged two or three people with robbing him, and seemed so intoxicated that the watchman did not know how to act. I considered him a drunken Irishman. He said he would have the coach taken to the watch-house - then two young men came up and said something about the Greenyard; he challenged one of them to fight, and told the watchman to take one to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that he charged any one with robbing him, or with rescuing a man from him - A. That I cannot say.</p>

            . I live with my father in Flying Horse-yard. I was out of employ, and now work with my brother in the leather-trade. I was in Charles-street between eleven and twelve o'clock on the night of the robbery, and saw Hughes in York-street, at the corner of Charles-street - a crowd was opposite the York hotel. Hughes had hold of a coach-door, and insisted on the coach and horses going to the watch-house. I thought it a curious thing, and my friend said,</p>
               <p>"You had better send it to the Greenyard" - he was going to strike my friend. He gave charge of us, we went half-way to the watch-house, he turned back - the watchman said,</p>
               <p>"Unless you go we will not take them;" he did not go, and we were liberated. I came back, and stood at the corner of Charles-street, by the York hotel, for five minutes; Hughes came, and said to Fitzgerald,</p>
               <p>"Take these men, they shall go to the watch-house" - I said,</p>
               <p>"We are innocent, and will go." When we got there he said we had rescued a person from him, and that 50 l. would not fetch his watch, chain and seals. We were sent to Tothil-fields, and discharged without any indictment. The prosecutor came to me at the Sessions House, Clerkenwell, and said he was sorry I was sent to Tothil-fields, and said,</p>
               <p>"You ought to have let me know you was there." I said that it was not my place. He said,</p>
               <p>"If I had known it you should not have been kept there," and that the beadle had told him it was not necessary to bring an indictment against any but the man who committed the robbery. After that he asked me to drink; I went to the Crown - he said he was sorry I had been in confinement, and wished to know where my brother lived. He told me to bring him to No. 54, Portland-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything about your coming on this trial - A. He asked me if I could not keep out of the way during the trial? I said I could not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As regards these transfers, has the secretary ever endorsed them according to the instructions of this Act of Parliament to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—he has never written his name on them—when a transfer is made, it is generally sent to the company, either by the broker of the vendor, or of the purchaser—as soon as it is received in the office, it is entered in the transfer receipt book—all these transfers are undoubtedly entered in the transfer receipt book, otherwise they would not have that number—there are no other books in which they are entered, only the ledgers—the transfer is entered in the transfer receipt book by whoever attends to the post—it is not the duty of the party who receives a transfer of stock, to see that there is that stock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell me that you conduct business so loosely that if a transfer of 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock comes to your office, to the proper office, that you do not verify, and see whether that stock is in existence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly we do; but you asked me if the party who received the transfer did so—somebody does undoubtedly verify—all these transfers are entered in the transfer receipt book, and it is the duty of some person to verify the stock—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of the Great Northern Railway Company, and have been so about eight years. I have had oppor<lb></lb>tunities of observing Redpath's handwriting, and seeing him write, a great many times—I believe the signature of Morriss to these transfers to be Mr. Redpath's writing—I have looked at the whole of them—I believe the sig<lb></lb>nature of Morriss to this No. 3623 to be Mr. Redpath's, and the signature of Timothy Shaw, the attesting witness, is the same handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you aware, at any time, of mistakes having been made, in the omission sometimes of the vendor's name, and the purchaser's, when transfers have taken place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I am not—I believe that the names of Morriss and Shaw are written by one and the same person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at the stamp on the transfer; is that the stamp <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Mr. Clark, who was the registrar at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a brand; that is the brand that was used in the office—it is stamped before it is entered in the receipt book—the seller, or his broker, sends the stock into the office, and leaves it there, and then the brand is used, to satisfy the buyer that the stock is there—I do not mean the transfer is left, but the stock, very likely William Henry Dixon is not satisfied, that the stock is in the office, and then we represent on the stock exchange that the stock is there—I am speaking with regard to the transfer—the seller sends the transfer to the office, and we stamp it to satisfy the buyer that the stock is there—the broker generally sends it—we then issue a certificate to the buyer—that is not signed by the secretary; there is a brand with the secretary's name that is used, and that is signed by the registrar—it does not go to the secretary's office; I mean that a brand is put on, with the signature of the secretary; it does not go into the secretary's office—that has never been the practice—the brand containing the secretary's name was not in the secretary's office, nor under his control—any one in the registration department might put the brand—a certificate is not available unless it has the secretary's name on it—I believe it has no value without the secretary's name—the name of the secretary is stamped with a brand, the secretary himself not doing anything to verify the stock or the transfer—I have never speculated in stock—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">stated that, by the 11th section of the company's Act, it did not appear that the signature of the secretary was requisite, except for the purposes of the office; he was merely an attesting witness to the common seal</hi>)—the transfer is not endorsed by the secretary.</p>

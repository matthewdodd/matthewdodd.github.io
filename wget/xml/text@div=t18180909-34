               wilful murder of a certain new-born female child
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>MARGRET MAYGER. I live in Baltic-street, City Road. The prisoner is <rs id="t18180909-34-deflabel191" type="occupation">married</rs>

               <p>Q. Relate what occured towards the latter end of August - A. I asked her if she was not in the family way; she said she did not know that she was, nor did she know that she was not. I said, I thought her forward. On the 20th of August, she went to Camberwell fair. On the 21st her husband said she was poorly. I saw her in the afternoon - She said she had caught cold; she then appeared very big. Next night, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw her go into the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a light with her - A. To the best of my knowledge she had not; she staid there about ten minutes. On her return she stopped at the butt drawing water in a saucepan - I desired her to come off the cold stones as she did not know what injury it might do her. I finished drawing the water, and I carried it up stairs for her; I noticed she was very thin and poorly - I did not go into her room. Next morning, the 23d, her mother told me she thought her daughter had miscarried. A day or two after she came down and asked me to send my boy to the mangler's. I then thought she looked very ill, and told her husband she was lost for want of proper nourishment; he went for some beer. While he was gone, I asked her how far she thought herself advanced in her pregnancy before she miscarried - She said about five months. I advised her to keep her bed; on the Monday following she went out with her mother. On the 1st of September my little boy gave me information - I went to the privy and saw something lying on its right side. Mr. Wyatt afterwards moved it-it was a child; the beadle was fetched. We sent for her husband - He declared he knew nothing of it. The prisoner was then in bed in her clothes; we asked if she knew anything of it - She said no, it was nothing of her's; I said I would get medical assistance to see her whether it was her's or not. She then said it was her's, and that she put it down the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say whether it was alive - A. I asked if it cried - She said no.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not fall down stairs about a week before - A. Yes, she said she had hurt her head, but did not complain of any thing else. She said she felt a beating at her heart in the night.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS HALE. I was called in to see the child at St. Luke's workhouse, it was in a high state of putrifaction and swelled so that I did not open it, as it would have been be useless. I examined the external parts and could find no marks of violence; it appeared to have arrived at its full period. I cannot take upon myself to say whether it was born alive or not-the mother falling down stairs might probaby have killed it. It would in that case produce premature labour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor at 43, George Street—on 5th De<lb></lb>cember my wife and I went to bed in the second floor front room as usual at twelve o'clock, and fastened the tailor's shop at the bottom—the win<lb></lb>dows were fastened and the doors locked—I was called up by my servant about half-past six in the morning, who told me that we had been robbed—I flew down stairs and found they had taken seven locks off, five on the chest of drawers, one in the cheffonier, and one other lock—I found this hat—I have seen it on the prisoner, who was employed on the premises—I saw him a week before the robbery—after the robbery I saw him, on the Tuesday following—he wore then a cap with a peak—I stopped him and asked him how it was he was looking so badly—he said he had lost his hat at the Reform Meeting on the Monday—I said, "A friend of mine has found a hat, and if it is your hat you shall have it"—I did not tell him where I found it.</p>

Q.</hi> You found a hat you say when you went down<lb></lb>stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the same room as the robbery—he was working for me before between four and five weeks—then he had the same hat—I never saw him with any other—I did not examine the hat when I saw it on the first occasion—I took it to the station-house when I went to give information—when the prisoner saw the hat he said, "I'll put you down a piece of wood if you give me that"—no one told me to offer to give him the hat if he would put a piece of board down—I found him a very dili<lb></lb>gent boy while he worked for me—I have no boys in my place at all, only females.</p>

               <p>three men coming along—one was a little before the others—he had not got anything—the other two were carrying a bundle of clothing—I stopped one of them—the other dropped the bundle and rushed past—I caught one of them and took him to the station, and the bundle too—I cannot swear that the prisoner was one of them.</p>

On 6th December, about half-past ten in the evening, I went to the prosecutor's house and found there had been a robbery there—the prosecutor had been to the station on the morning of the same day—he brought with him the hat which has been produced—I retained it in my possession till the morning of 17th Decem<lb></lb>ber, when I sent it back to the prosecutor, with some instructions as to what he was to do.</p>

We missed a number of articles, and not having any persons coming to the house, suspicion fell on the prisoner. I requested each of my servants to have their boxes searched; a fortnight ago I searched them. As I was searching the box of the upper servant I observed the prisoner take something out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130026"></xptr> one of her boxes and throw it under the bed; I requested to know what it was, she said immediately, it was only a bit of brown Holland, she crept under the bed, snatched it up and unpinned it. I saw some things fall from it as she did so; I called Mr. Harrison up stairs, the other servant was present; my husband saw her secrete the things under the bed. The bedstead was then lifted up by the other servant, and from under the bedstead was produced a table-cloth and a bit of India muslin, and a small piece of brown Holland. These are the articles, they are all cut off different pieces.</p>

            . I am a servant of Mr. Harrison's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you present in the room when the prisoner's box was searched - A. Yes; my mistress requested to look in our boxes, and while she was looking in my box I saw my mistress observed something, and after she had done looking in my box she looked in hers; she found nothing of consequence. She asked her what she had throwed under the bed, the prisoner said it was only a bit of brown Holland; she then called master up. The prisoner crept under the bed and tried to conceal them, and master brought out a table-cloth from under the bed; mistress said, good God! here is my table cloth. The prisoner said it was her mother's, and the piece of sprigged muslin, she said she bought in Bishopsgate-street, but she could not tell what shop she bought it at.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I should suppose that the things were taken into the room by some of the children, who were frequently making dolls.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

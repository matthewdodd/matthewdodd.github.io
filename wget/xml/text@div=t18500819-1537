                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Lewisham. The prisoner was in my employ four or five months—in June and July he was employed cutting tares, which were sold in the field to different customers—I first directed him to obtain 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a rod for them—he charged that a little time, and as he gave me his account he said, "Master, I cannot get 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the tares, they are so <hi rend="italic">rubbishy"</hi>—I said, "If you cannot get 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., you must get 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I know there are some you can get 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for"—he afterwards came to me, and said he could not get 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then on 20th June it came to 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and at last I said he had better come out of the field, and shut the gate—this is the account I kept (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they began to be sold on 9th June—on 1st July the price he returned to me as having sold them at, was 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had told him he was to sell for the best price he could—after the beginning of July he never returned more than 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he brought me every day an account of the tares he had sold, and the prices received, and I put it down in writing, in this book—on 5th July here is an entry I made from his statement, "27 rods, at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10th July,</p>

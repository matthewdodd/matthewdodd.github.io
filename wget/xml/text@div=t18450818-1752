                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house in High-street, Woolwich. On Sunday, the 13th of July, Thomas Banks came to my house—he was tipsy and quarrelling—he said he would knock any person about that came before him—I begged him to be quiet, and said I would have nothing there but quietness, and if he wanted to fight he must go out into the street—I was sitting in my kitchen, and Edward Pickett alongside of me—Banks hit him a slap on the side of the face, then closed his fist and hit me in the face—he then pulled Pickett up and hit him with his fist—William Elford happened to come to the door, and Banks said to him, "Now, Wil<lb></lb>liam, this is the time; go to work, my boy"—with that, William Elford hit me, and his wife, Elizabeth Elford, also hit me with the pitchfork—I fell, and while down, William Elford kicked me in the eye, and I do not know what happened after—I have lost the sight of it—I had done nothing but beg of them to be quiet—pretty-well all that were there made their escape out of the place when they saw them behaving in such a rude man-ner—I saw Sarah Banks in the place when the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> happened, when Banks hit me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Woolwich. On Sunday, the 13th of July, between one and two o'clock, Driscoll came to me—he was bleeding from a wound in the temple—(I found no other wound about him)—it was from a blow—it had injured the eye, and round about the margin of the eye was bruised—I think it very probable to have hap<lb></lb>pened from a kick—I should call it an injury dangerous to life—the result of it was very alarming—he had inflammation of the eye, and that com<lb></lb>municated itself to the brain for a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did you graduate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Free Hos-pital—I took my diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons, and I am a licentiate apothecary—I never had Driscoll under my treatment before—he was under my care very nearly three weeks—there was deep seated inflam-mation—the wound was about one-eighth of an inch deep—it is very indistinct now—I swear there was danger to life from that wound—he was suffering from concussion of the brain—he was partially insensible—he answered questions, and then relapsed again into a partial state of insensi-bility for four or five hours—I gave him small doses of calomel—I did not consider it necessary to bleed him—bleeding is recommended in some cases of concussion—it depends on circumstances—I have read works in which it is not recommended—I cannot give the name of a work, but there are plenty—I never read "Cooper's Surgery"—I gave him calomel and antimonials, and such treatment as I considered necessary—I did not use a hot bath—I considered him in danger until reaction took place—by rea-ction, I mean returning sensation or animation—that was about five hours—during those five hours I had serious apprehensions of his death—I am</p>

               <p>a general practitioner—I did not call in any aid—I expressed no alarm, but I felt it—he remained in my shop about a quarter of an hour, and then I went home with him—he came to fetch me to something quite as serious—I treated Pickett before I treated him—I gave him calomel every three or four hours—I continued giving it to him for more than twenty-one hours—when reaction took place, inflammation of the eye came on, and I gave him calomel for that, to reduce the inflammation, which it does by preventing effusion and absorbing the liquids—the blow on the temple was recent—the wound was open—his eye was very much inflamed and full of blood when he first came to me—he had not then lost the sight—he lost it subsequently entirely, but I believe it was from the blow he had received.</p>

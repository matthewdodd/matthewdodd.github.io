I stood waiting and looking for his return; till I saw a Man coming into the Field, and supposing it might be my Husband I turned about and went forward slowly. I had not gone far before I was overtaken by two Men in light Colour'd Stockings. They past by me without speaking. I was afraid they were Thieves, because of their white Stockings - For it seems white Stockings is a mighty Fashion among Thieves - One of these Men was the Prisoner. They walked a little before me, and coming into a small puddle of Water, the Prisoner offer'd me his Hand. I thank'd him, and so we went on to the End of the Field; where the path divides in two; one goes to a Gate, and one to the Gap. I went towards the Gate, and they the other way: But presently they turn'd towards me - And one of them, not the Prisoner, came up and said, What Money have you got young Woman? I told him none. Upon which he pull'd a Pistol out of his Pocket, and took away my Bundle, and gave it to the Prisoner. Then he took off my Cloak and Apron, and put his Hand down my Bosom; and asked if I had got any thing there. I said - No - Don't frighten me, for I am with Child, Damn your blood, says he, stand still and I won't hurt you - The Prisoner at the same laid his Hand upon my Shoulder, and ask'd me why I made such a Noise, and said they would do me no Harm, if I would be quiet. Then the other took my Ring off, and ask'd me again what Money I had in my Pocket; I said a little; and was going to take it out, but he thrust his Hand in and broke my Pocket off. There was 5 s. a Cypher-ring, and my Wedding-Ring, and some other Things in my Pocket. I begg'd them to return me my Wedding-ring, and promised to send them twice the value of it to any Place that they would appoint, and never complain of them. But they jump'd over the Ditch and went off with that and the rest of the Things - The Prisoner had dark Clothes, white Stockings, and a blue Linsey Woolsey Apron. I turn'd back and met my Husband about the middle of the Field, and told him how I had been robb'd.</p>

I gave him a Shilling which was all the Money I had, and then he made me strip off my Coat and Waistcoat, which he took away. My Violin was in my lining of my Coat, and was Pawn'd by the Prisoner's Wife to John Gay who was my Acquaintance, and told me of it.</p>

PATER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you saw Marshall on 2nd March, and spoke to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had received information of this robbery from the printed form that is sent from the Commissioner's office—it was at the horse repository in St. Martin's Lane where I spoke to him—I said to him, "Mark, I think you are wanted along with <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Hosborn, or <hi rend="italic">Curly Bill</hi>, for a job at Blackheath"—I took off his cap and said, "Let me look at your head," as it was described in our information that it was supposed he had received a blow—I allowed him to go—that was about two p.m., and at night one of the Lee officers came to me and I took him to the Australian Stores, in Little Wind<lb></lb>mill Street, Haymarket—the prisoner was there, with a number of others—I beckoned him and he came out, and we went down stairs; I said, "Mark, I want you," and there was a man there who had been drinking with a constable of the R division, who said, "Yes, that is the <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi>; that is him, I know; turn round and let me look at your neck; that is him, I know"—he was a labouring man—he said to Marshall, "Did not you meet me so-and-so?" and the prisoner made some answer; which I cannot recollect—the man then said, "I won't swear, I should not like to swear to him," so I allowed the prisoner to go back—I cannot say that that man was the husband of Mrs. Covill—a few minutes, afterwards I directed a constable to take Marshall on suspicion.</p>

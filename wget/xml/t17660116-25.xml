            . I was going to Goldsmiths-hall last Friday; the prisoner called to me, and told me she had left some things up in the garret; the watch, and she signified there was a spoon, and other things; but did not mention particularly what they were. I came home and acquainted my mistress with what she had said, my mistress and I went up into the garret, and in the part of the garret where the prisoner had said, behind some lumber, I found the watch, tablespoon, a tea-spoon, a mustard-spoon, the bowl of a ladle, and some shirt-buttons, all silver, (produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-street Clerkenwell. Mrs. Bickerton sent for me, to let me know she had lost some things; I went to her, she told me she had lost a silver watch: she suspected her maid (the prisoner.) I advised her to search her box: she was searched, I only saw the linen which was found in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When my master died, my mistress gave me the old stockings herself; I found some of the linen in an old rag-box in the garret, as to the rest of the things I know nothing at all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holder. How came the prisoner to tell you she had secreted the things in the garret?</p>
               <p>Holder. She called to me as I was going along the street, and asked me some questions about the family; we talked some little time about things indifferent, and afterwards we entered upon this subject; she acknowledged to me that she had left some things in the garret, that she was concerned about; she was afraid to tell my mistress, for fear she should get her displeasure: I told her she need not fear that, for if she would acknowledge the watch, my mistress had told her she would forgive her, and upon this expostulation, she told me where the watch was: I told her if she would not tell me where the watch was, my mistress would get a warrant and take her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she at that time in your mistress's service?</p>
               <p>Holder. She had been gone a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. How came you not to indict her upon having found the linen in her box?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I was quite unacquainted with these sort of things, and did not know how to do it. <rs id="t17660116-25-verdict162" type="verdictDescription">

            . I was at the Earl of Delawar, public-house when Mitchell came in; he was a stranger to me: he appeared a little intoxicated, but got completely so after he sat down; a man came in with him, who is not here: he sat on the same side of the table, but another person sat between them; two persons came in with him, but one went away, and the other stopped. I was at the same table, but on the other side. I saw Mitchell pay for a pot of beer and a quartern of gin, and then the person who came in with him bade him good night, and left him; he then went and sat at the other end of the room; I removed, and sat opposite him: a young man whom I knew came in, and sat at another table - I saw the prosecutor then go to pay for a pot of beer for the prisoner and another to drink with him, but he could not get his money out of his pocket; I heard it chink: the landlord said,</p>
               <p>"I shall take the beer back, you do not want it" - he took it away. A man of the name of Thomas then got up, and attempted to get the money from the prosecutor's pocket, but did not put his hand in - the prisoner then got up, and put his hand in, and when he pulled it out his hand was closed; he then went out of the room, and Thomas went after him; the prisoner then returned, and brought 1 s. - they ordered the beer to come in again, and said there was the money to pay for it. He then went away: I never saw the money.</p>

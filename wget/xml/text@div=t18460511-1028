                  </hi>. I am eighty-five years old. Between eight and nine o'clock on the night of the 29th of April I was going along the Cambridge Heath-road, and saw the prisoner outside a public-house with a pipe—I heard him say he had been asleep all his lifetime—I said softly to myself, "And so have I," but he heard me—I had my hand in my pocket—he turned round upon me and said, "What, have you been asleep?" and he took and held me down by the arms, put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took my money—I called out for help, "The fellow is robbing me"—he said, "Hold your tongue, you old fool; I won't hurt you"—he attempted to run away—I put my stick in the collar of his coat—he got away from me, and ran across the Mile-end-road—he put the money on a cask-a boy going by took it up, and said, "I have got your money, he has put it down here"—I had said to the prisoner, "You rascal, you have robbed me of half-a-crown and three shillings."</p>

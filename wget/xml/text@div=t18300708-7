On Thursday, the 27th of May, between nine and ten o'clock, I recollect a person coming into Mr. Kilbeck's shop; it was a soldier, but I will not swear the prisoner is the man - I saw the prisoner in custody a week or ten days after, and had a doubt whether he was the man; I saw him twice on the 27th of May - he asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco, and gave me sixpence: I put it into the till, and gave him 5d. in change - there were one or two other sixpences in the till at the time, but not more than two; I remarked that the sixpence he gave me was exceedingly black, very dirty, and the two in the till were perfectly clean and good, quite distinguishable from the one he gave me - I afterwards saw James Davidson: he went out, and returned in five or ten minutes, with a soldier, who I believe to be the prisoner, and had no doubt of his being the man who had given me the bad sixpence; Davidson said, in the prisoner's presence, "Here is the soldier that passed the bad sixpence on you" - the prisoner said, "Was it a bad one? I was not aware of it;" Davidson said he had followed him from place to place, and witnessed his passing bad sixpences, prior to his coming into that shop; the prisoner then said, "If I have given you a bad sixpence where is it?" I replied,"Not expecting to see you again I destroyed it;" I had thrown it into the fire - he immediately drew from his pocket 5 1/2d., which he laid on the counter, and said,"There, that will do I suppose?" Davidson said, "No, not exactly - you have passed other bad money, and must change it;" he then demanded the prisoner's name, and he very indistinctly gave Highland or Ireland; we could not make out which - Davidson said, "You must now go with me," and he quitted the shop with him.</p>

On the 27th of May, between half-past ten o'clock and a quarter to eleven, I saw him on the opposite side of my street, making a stand; he came over, and asked for three halfpenny worth of peppermint, which is an unusual quantity, but seeing he was a soldier I gave him three halfpenny worth - he put me over a sixpence, which I saw was very dirty and black, but I believed it to be good; I had other people at the bar, and did not examine it so accurately as I might - I observed two or three dents in it, as if it had been bruised- I put it into the till with other money; there were other sixpences there at the time - I gave him 4 1/2d. on change, and just after he went away I emptied the money out of the till into my pocket; I paid no money out of my pocket till after I had seen the officer, who came, and made inquiries of me - I gave him information: the prisoner was not present; I took out my money and looked at it, saying I had taken a black sixpence of a soldier, which I could distinctly point out - I did so; we rubbed the dirt off, and found it to be a very bad one - I am quite satisfied it was the one he gave me; I had no other like it in my pocket: I marked it, and gave it to Morris, the Policeman.</p>

            . I am turnkey of the County gaol of Surrey. I know the prisoner; he was convicted in October, 1828, by the name of John Ireland, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment in the County gaol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I stand before your Lordship's bar charged with an offence, of which I am entirely innocent. I understand one of the witnesses for the prosecution has sworn that I went into her house on the day mentioned in the indictment and had a glass of peppermint in payment, for which she says I gave her a counterfeit sixpence, which she put into her till among a quantity of other money: among which were nineteen other sixpences, and that it was after it had been in the till she found that it was a bad one. I most positively declare my innocence of this charge, and the witnesses must be mistaken in the person. - Another witness swears that I went into his shop for half an ounce of tobacco, for which he says I gave him sixpence and received the change, which sixpence he afterwards found to be bad; and he immediately burned it - he also says that I was brought back to his shop by some person who asked him if I had not given him a bad sixpence; he said Yes, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080014"></xptr>immediately gave him back the change. In answer to this I do most positively declare that I did not know that I had a bad sixpence in my possession, or I should not have given it. - A publican has sworn that I passed a counterfeit sixpence at his house on the same day; this witness, as well as the first, must be mistaken in my person: for I do most solemnly declare my innocence of these two charges, never having been in either of the witnesses' houses. I have been in his Majesty's service for upwards of twenty-three years, and in the event of the Jury finding me guilty, I throw myself upon the Mercy of the Court: who, I hope, will take into consideration the length of time I have been in his Majesty's service, and that I have a wife and three helpless children.[Monday, July 12.] <rs id="t18300708-7-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

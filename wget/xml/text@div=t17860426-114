            ; the prisoner came into our shop about five in the afternoon, she came and asked to see some remnants of cloth, I shewed her several pieces; I could not find any that would please her, at last I found a remnant that suited her, and she bought it; when I went to look for some more, there was some muslin lay near where the cloths were, and she took up four of them, says she, this is not cloth, this is callico; she carried them to the light, where the cloths were, and she laid them amongst the cloths; they laid there a quarter of an hour amongst the cloths, and I sold her a remnant of cloth; she went out; I went to see if I could find the muslin handkerchiefs, and I could not find four; then I pursued her, I overtook her about half a dozen yards from the shop, and she came with me back to the shop, I asked her to let me see what she had in her apron, and I found the handkerchiefs there with the cloth; she begged I would not send for a constable, and she would pay me for it; so I immediately sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>Did she take that article she bought? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did she stay after she bought the cloth? - Ten minutes or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>When you found this in her apron, were they folded up, or separate? - They were separate; I put a paper about the cloth, and it was taken off, I am sure I put a paper on; it was not tied, it was only a small remnant.</p>
               <p>Was the muslin handkerchief rolled up in paper in the shop? - No.</p>

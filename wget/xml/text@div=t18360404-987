               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say here to-day that he was along with Webber when he carried it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said that he said to Jewell. "It was him that carried the lead, and sold it to your brother Sam, was not it?"—I have told you his exact words—he did not say at that time that he was along with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Frost. Q.</hi> When did you see me first? Witness <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eleven o'clock that morning, at Shadwell—you were drunk—I did not drink with you to make you drunker, to my knowledge—I did not go into a public-house, and call for a not of beer—I did not know Tite till after I had been to Jewell's I took Webber with me—he had then got sober—he was with me from eleven o'clock in the morning till three in the afternoon—he had 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I allowed him to have some beer—he begged very hard.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the public-house he had it at? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I rather think it was at the corner of Grove-street—upon my oath I did not drink with either of the prisoners after taking them into custody—they offered me the pot, but I did not drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did you go to the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was about three o'clock, after I had taken Tite—Webber was sober then; as far as a man could be that had been tipsy—I suppose 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid for the liquor—I did not see it paid—9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was taken from him at the King David-land station—I cannot tell the sign of the public-house—it was the first time I ever was in it—I was not on duty at the time—the man begged hard to have a drop of beer, and I allowed him to have it—there were three of them—there was a friend of Tite's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Frost</hi>. You paid for a pot of beer, and drank with me before you had Tite—you drank, and offered me the pot, and said, "Drink"—I said, "You have been a rascal, you have made me drunker"—I would not drink with you. Witness. I never saw you till you was drunk—I did not make him more drunk than he was—I did not allow him to drink till three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

I went with Malley to ap<lb></lb>prehend Tite—he said, "I should like to know what I am charged with before I go"—he had been previously charged with lead, but this was while Malley was down stairs—Tite was sitting on the side of the bed, dressing himself—I said it was for some lead taken from shadwell-market—he said, "As far as regards the robbery, I know nothing at all about it; but I met Frost in Ratcliff-highway."</p>

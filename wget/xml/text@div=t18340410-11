            , pawnbroker, Farringdon-street. On the 18th of March, the prisoner came and produced a silver sauce-ladle, broken in halves - I asked if it was her own - she said it was - I doubted it; but she still said it was, and equivocated very much - I suspected her, and asked where she lived - she refused to tell me - I threatened to give her in charge if she did not, and then she attempted to run away - she would not tell where she lived - I took her to the station-house - the value of the ladle is 10s., in the broken state, as old silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was something about her manner made you suspect all was not right? A. Yes: she seemed agitated, confused, and unwell.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had she been long in your employ? A. Nearly three years - I had a most excellent character with her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."My mistress's plate, which was not in common use, was kept in a drawer of a press - I was putting the drawer in order, to do which I had taken out some of the articles which lay on the top, and put them on the ground, and amongst them was the ladle in question - the drawer is exceedingly heavy - I drew it too far out, and it fell on its edge upon the handle of the ladle, by which accident the ladle was bent up and bruised - I attempted to straighten the ladle, but in doing so I broke it - I became alarmed, and in my fright put it in the fire, but instantly took it out again; and the next morning I thought, if I could sell it, I could, with the money, and a sovereign which my excellent mistress had given me some time before, buy a new ladle, and prevent discovery - I went to the shop to sell it; and upon being questioned, I was still afraid of the accident I had had being discovered, and told an untruth about my residence; but when I was taken to the watch-house, I said what my name was, and where I lived - when before the Justice, I was anxious to speak to my mistress, and explain to her; but the persons there said I could not; and I was unable, when I found myself standing as a criminal at the bar of justice, to say anything - although my mistress is a witness against me, it would be ungrateful if I did not acknowledge that she has been the most kind and tender mistress possible."</p>
               <p>ROBERT JOHNSTON. I have plate much more valuable than this ladle - it appears bent, certainly - it was kept in a drawer in the upper part of the house - my wife has been rather delicate in her health - I do not know of anything else being missed - Mrs. Johnston had made the prisoner a present of a sovereign, in addition to her wages, about a month before - when she paid her her wages, she gave her a sovereign for her good conduct.</p>

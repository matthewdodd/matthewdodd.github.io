            . I am a broker, and live at Battle-bridge. On the 29th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was returning from Stamford-hill, and saw Woodroffe, Sayers, and Jacobs, near the Regency Canal, City-road, following several gentlemen. Woodroffe knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170017"></xptr>me, and I sent my apprentice to watch them. They then came into the City-road, near Brick-lane. I then saw 
               <persName id="t18200517-38-person410">Johnson</persName>
             the officer, and told him my suspicious. I kept back but never lost sight of them. About seven o'clock, they went down Bath-street and Bunhill-row, towards Chiswell-street - there were only the three at that time. I saw Woodroffe try a gentleman's pocket in <placeName id="t18200517-38-crimeloc230">Bunhill-row</placeName>

Then Walkingham joined them and made the fourth. Jacobs was following a gentleman who had two ladies with him, and the other three joined him. I saw the handkerchief taken from the gentleman's pocket by one of them, I do not know which, they were close together - he had a lady on each arm. I stopped him and told him his pocket was picked. I went after the prisoners and met with them going into Bridgewater-square, I took Jacobs and Sayers, Walkingham got away and threw down the handkerchief. Johnson followed Walkingham and brought him back. Woodroffe was taken on the Monday, I knew him, he was one of the party - my apprentice was not with me when the pocket was picked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The gentleman did not give you his card or his name - A. No. I did not stop, I went after the prisoners. There is two letters on the handkerchief, and I saw it taken from the pocket.</p>

            . I am an headborough. I was in the City-road on business between four and five o'clock, and was accosted by Mr. Colton, in consequence of which I watched three persons following a gentleman. I only recollect the persons of two, Jacobs and Sayers, I cannot recollect the features of the others, and was induced to follow them. They turned round and went into the City-road, I followed them - they were playing about some time on and near the Bridge. They then went towards Bunhill-row, I followed them, it was then dusk. They tried a gentleman's pocket in Bunhill-row, one tried first, then a second, and a third tried, but without success, he was taller than the other two. They then went to the lower end of Bunhill-row (there was a mob there), they staid there some time, and afterwards went down Chiswell-street, they were joined by Walkingham. They went down one side of the way, crossed over, and followed very close to a gentleman with two ladies. I did not perceive them take the handkerchief. Colton said they had got it, and three of them instantly crossed the way. I did not see Woodroffe, I could not swear to him. Colton spoke to the gentleman, and then went after the prisoners, I followed him, and we tried to secure them all. Walkingham threw down a handkerchief and ran away, I pursued him and brought him back, and never lost sight of him. I went to Colton, he had got the other two, and the handkerchief. We went on Monday into the City-road and apprehended Woodroffe. I do not know who the gentleman was, I never heard his name.</p>

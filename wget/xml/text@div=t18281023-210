The watch was hanging up in my father's window on the Wednesday night, and I was sitting in the back-room with my mother; we have a little bitch, and she would not go into the shop; I got up, and saw the prisoner just round by the counter - I went and took hold of him; he put up his finger, and said "What is the price of that knife?" I held him tight; he wanted to get away - he got to the window, and broke it - he then stood quiet; I got him in the room - the constable came and searched him, but nothing was found; I then went to the window, and found this watch, with the case off, just inside the window - down by the window; I had seen it safe in the window nearly all the evening; I was not looking into the shop when he came in - I was sitting by the fire, and we could not see the shop - we were on the listen; my brother and father were in and out that evening; I think we were near enough to have heard if any one had come in; I think this watch had been hanging on a hook, which I saw shaking when the prisoner was there.</p>

A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230086"></xptr>About half-way up the window; he might have knocked it down in the scuffle; he broke the pane of glass where it was hanging; if a watch comes violently on the ground, the case might come off - this key, which the witness found, was to it, and is broken off; I went to the cage when the prisoner was there; I said to the constable "If I were to speak perhaps he would answer" - I went, and whistled; he said "Jem, is that you?" I said Yes; he said "Have you brought the screws?" I said Yes, and then he would not answer again.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took up the prisoner, and found a sixpence, a knife, a had farthing, two needle-cases, and a tobacco-box, on him; I put him into the cage, and saw Cooper go and whistle; the prisoner said"Jem, have you got the screws," which I understood meant picklock-keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the shop, and saw a knife; I am a butcher; I went to ask the price - there was no one in the shop; I went up to the room-door, and said "What do you ask for that knife?" the witness came and collared me - I resisted to get out of his arms - another man and a woman came and took hold of me; I got round to the window, and either hit my head against it, or knocked something against it, and broke it.</p>
               <p>JURY to GEORGE COOPER. Q. Did you know him before? A. No - I did not know what I had lost; when I went to the cage, there were two others outside the door, and I do not think the prisoner was the worst of them.</p>

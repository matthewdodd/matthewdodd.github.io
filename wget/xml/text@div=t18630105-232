I am a coffee house-keeper, of 3, New Church-street West, Edgeware-road—the prisoner and prosecutrix came to my house on Sunday evening of 16th November—they had been there several times before—I admitted them, gave them a candle, and told them which room to go into—they had been there before, and I heard them go in and lock the door—shortly afterwards I heard them quarrel—she said, "Will you go with me to-morrow?"—she repeated that several times, and at last the prisoner said, "Yes, I will"—she said, "Very well, you shall"—I waited a few minutes on the stairs, and heard them quarrelling, but do not know what they said—I went back again, and a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards I beard something fall on the floor heavily—I got out of bed, opened my room door, and heard the prisoner call "Murder" several times—I went up as fast as I could—the woman appealed as if she was trying to open the door and could not—at last I heard it unlocked by a key, but do not know</p>

               <p>which of them did it—I first saw the prisoner standing just inside the door, covered with blood—I think he had hold of the door with one hand, and his wife was by his left side, bleeding very furiously—she appeared to be trying to get out of the room, and he was preventing her—I asked him who did it—he said, "My wife has cut her throat"—the wife pointed to him, and nodded her head several times—she repeated that several times, and when be said that she had cut her own throat, she pointed to him again—there was no light in the room—the prisoner said, "Do get some help"—I said "I will go for a doctor as quick as I can"—I went down stairs—there was a lodger in the house who had come in that evening, and I asked him to get up and go up stairs and remain there while I fetched a doctor or a constable—I met a constable outside the gate immediately—I went back with him and the lodger was watching on the landing—the prosecutrix was in a leaning position, and he was still standing over her, saying, "Oh, my Annie"—I fetched Dr. Groves, and they were still in the same position when I came back.</p>

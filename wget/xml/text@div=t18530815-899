                  </hi>. I am a farmer and live at Kidwell-lodge, Black-heath; I occupy 160 acres of land, and I have a good number of meadows. On 4th of Aug., I had a bay mare and a black mare—I saw them safe about 8 o'clock in the evening in my meadow, at 7 o'clock the next morning I went round my farm and missed them—I sent to the police, and gave information—I came to Smithfield about 2 o'clock—I saw the two mares, they were led in together, the two prisoners were in possession of them—I went and told them I should put them in charge of the police the moment I could see them, for the mares were stolen from my premises—the black mare was taken away—I kept sight of the bay one remaining there—a gentleman sent me an officer, the mares were left in my care about a fortnight before—I saw the man who I supposed brought the mares, it was neither of the prisoners—I did not take the mares in; my man has left.</p>

At twenty minutes past 2 o'clock on 5th Aug., I was sent for to Mr. Niccolls in Smithfield-market—he pointed my attention to a bay mare, which was in the possession of Harris—I asked Harris where he got it—he said, "I bought it last night of a man of the name of Robinson, a greengrocer at Deptford"—I asked what part of Deptford, and he could not tell me—I took Harris to the station—there was another man present at the station, and he said, in Harris's presence, that Harris bought it of a man of the name of Emerson, of Blackheath-hill—Mr. Niccolls asked Harris where the black mare was, and he said Crutch had it in the market—I went back to the market and saw the black mare, and Crutch was with it—Mr. Niccolls claimed it, and I took Crutch into custody—I asked him in the presence of Harris, if he knew where Harris bought the mare—he said he bought it of Perkins, a butcher at Greenwich, and Crutch said he had had the black mare since October last.</p>

               <p>20 minutes to 10 o'clock, I was in Kid well-lane, I saw the two prisoners, they had a black and a bay horse with them—a third man was with them, who was riding one—I asked where they came from; Harris told me they had bought the horses and came that way the near way from Eltham, as it was getting late—I asked them how they got through the gate, knowing the gate to be always locked—it stands at the extreme point of Mr. Niccolls's farm—the meadow is on this side the gate—I had known the prisoners some time, and I let them go, knowing them to be dealing in horses—I have seen them about Blackheath these six years—I went to the gate and found it locked, and all safe—I saw the horses grazing in the field last Monday week.</p>

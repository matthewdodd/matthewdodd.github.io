                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Suckling, of Henry-street, Back Church-lane. On Saturday night, the 23rd of March, I was in a shop in Eagle-street, Whitechapel—I had six shillings, a sixpence, a half-crown, and some halfpence loose in my right hand pocket—I saw it while I was in the shop—the prisoner was in the shop—I felt her close to me for a few minutes—I bought some butter and cheese, and was waiting to be served—as soon as the prisoner left the shop, I went to feel in my pocket for my money, and it was gone—the prisoner had stood on my right hand—nobody else had been near enough to take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman at the shop—the prisoner came in and called for some butter—when she left the shop I thought something was wrong, and asked master if he missed any thing—the prosecutrix directly said she had been robbed—she did not exactly know what she had lost, but</p>

               <p>she thought it was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had seen nobody but the prisoner near her—I went after her, told the policeman, and she was brought back—she was asked where she had been—she said, "Only to a print, shop"—I told the policeman what had occurred, and said I was sure she had been in our shop—she declared she had not been to any butter-shop—the policeman searched her, and found 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some halfpence on her—there was another person with her, who was discharged at Lambeth-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went after the prisoner, and took her into custody—I told her she was accused of stealing money out of a woman's pocket in a butter-shop—she said she did not—I asked if she had been in any butter-shop that night—she said not—I said, "Have you been into any shop at all to-night?"—she said, "No, not a shop"—I took her to the shop, and she said she had purchased a quartern of butter, and had sent it home by her little girl—she gave six shillings, a half-crown, four sixpences, and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece out of her bosom—on the Monday morning she said, "What do you think will be done to me?"—I said, "I don't know"—she said, "Well, the butter I purchased I dropped in the shop."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not she say at Lambeth-street that she was perfectly innocent of any theft? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I heard her say to the clerk that she knew nothing about it—the prosecutrix said at first she had lost two half-crowns—she said altogether she had lost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am quite sure of that—she counted what she had in her pocket, and had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some halfpence left—she said she was sure she had lost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but she could not be sure to any more—there was no other sum mentioned by her in my presence—she said there were two half-crowns among it—the prisoner then produced her money, and there was only one half-crown—the prosecutrix did not change her story then—she did afterwards, on our way to the station-house—the prisoner said she had saved the money up to buy some things when she went to the workhouse to be confined—she appeared near her confinement.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was called, and assisted in taking the prisoner; I saw her throw this purse away, about one hundred yards from the house where she had been with the gentleman; when we got back to the house I saw her shake a sovereign from her bosom, and this other sovereign was found on the bed; she said, as the sovereigns were given up, she hoped the gentleman would not persevere in it, but he said she should go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman agreed to give me 10s., and I was going to get change when the watchman stopped me; I can only account for the other being on my bed, by supposing it must have fallen from the prosecutor's pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Birmingham, but was at the Spread Eagle, in Gracechurch-street. On Thursday evening, the 23rd of Feb., I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in Farringdon-street—he made some observation about the cattle—I went with him to Cyrus Davis's public-house—I called for a pot of porter, I drank some of it, and fell asleep—I suppose I had been asleep about a quarter of an hour, when the policeman awoke me and asked if I had lost my watch—I put my band to my pocket, and my watch was gone—I know I had it safe before I went to sleep—I felt it when I put my hand into my waistcoat-pocket, to pay for the porter—there was a guard-chain and a gold chain to it—this is my watch and chain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You told me you had been to see a fight, and then asked me to drink out of a bottle you had in your side-pocket; you had four glasses of brandy-and-milk, and about a quartern of raw brandy. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not recollect what you drank; what I drank was principally rum-and-milk—I do not recollect having any old ale—you did not awake me—I was never awoke but by the policeman—if you said you had my watch, I did not hear you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. I was in the public-house—I saw the prisoner take the watch from the prosecutor's pocket while he was asleep—he took it openly—I said, "Deliver that watch back; I will have no such doings in my presence"—the prisoner, with a good deal of reluctance, went to the prosecutor, and tried to awake him, and said, "I have got your watch"—the prosecutor was neither asleep nor awake, and he said, "All right"—the pri<lb></lb>soner then put it into his own pocket, and sat there, I should say, twenty minutes, and was full of conversation and life—he then walked out, and forgot to come back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman. I was at the public-house—I saw the prisoner take the watch from the prosecutor's right-hand waistcoat pocket—I said, "Don't do that; let his watch alone"—he said, "It is all right; I know him, he is a friend of mine"—he then sat down by the side of the pro<lb></lb>secutor for a time, and then he shook him, to try to wake him—he appeared to be drowsy, neither asleep nor awake—the prisoner said, "Look what I have got; I have got your property"—the prosecutor said, "All right"—the prisoner then put the watch in his trowsers' pocket—he then walked out, stopped out a while, then came in and sat down by the prosecutor; then went out with the intention to get a pipe of tobacco—he walked off, and I never saw him any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and am in the employ of James Lowden, of Addle-street. On the day before I was before the Magistrate, about half past 2 o'clock, I was resting in London-wall, with a bag containing tapes, needles, and worsted, and the prisoner Brown came up and asked me if he should carry the bag—I said, "No," because I had not got any money; he said that he would carry it without money—I let him carry it, and when we got to Camomile-street, I asked him if I should carry it—he said, "Yes"—I did so, and missed him—he came up to me again at the corner of the Minories, and asked me if he should take it—I said, "Yes"—Clarkson was then with him, and a little way the first time—when we got to the archway Clarkson took out his tobacco box, and Brown said, "Is that all the tobacco you have got?"—he said, "Yes"—Brown said, "Here is a little tobacco shop here"—they sent me in for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco—I came out before I was served, as I had a good deal of suspicion, and saw Brown with the bag on his shoulder; he said that it was all right, he was only waiting for me—I went into the shop, got the tobacco, and gave it to Clarkson—Brown was gone—I asked Clarkson where he had gone—he said, "Down that way," and I took the first turning to the right, then another turning to the right, and saw him with the bag on his shoulder—I ran up, and caught hold of the bag—he was not going the way that Clarkson told me; he told me to go towards the Tower, but I turned the contrary way—I said, "Give me my goods;" he said, "Oh, you young fool! I was going round to the tobacco shop again"—he set it down, three or four people came round, and a gentleman called a policeman—I did not see Clarkson again till he was in custody—I am sure he is the person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Clarkson. Q.</hi> Did I interfere with the bag in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Brown asked you for a penny for the tobacco—I saw the bag as Brown turned the second corner.</p>

               <p>pointed out to me, coming into the Minories from the Tower; I took him back to the boy, and then to the station—he said that he did not mean to take it—I found on him a pocket book and a harmonic card—on the next day, while waiting to go before the Magistrate, he said that he had known Clarkson three weeks or a month—I took Clarkson on the following evening, the 21st, at No. 21, Great Mitchell-street, St. Luke's, where he was living with his father-in-law—he came to the door, and I asked if those were Clarkson's apartments—he said that they were not—I said, "I am sure you are the man I want, I charge you with being concerned with a boy in stealing haberdashery in the Minories"—he said that he knew nothing of it—I said, "You have no need to state anything unless you choose"—he said that he supposed it was through a boy who he was with the day before in the Minories, who had lent him a penny—I took this tobacco box from him, and found on him this harmonic card, corresponding with that found on Brown.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Clarkson produced a written defence, stating, that he met Brown carrying the bag, who went round the corner, stating that it was for a certain purpose, while the boy was in the tobacco shop.</hi>)</p>

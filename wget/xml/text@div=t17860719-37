               <p>Were not you drunk? - I was not drunk; he and the other prisoner came to see me safe home; I believe it was as late as twelve, I cannot say justly the hour; they came quite home, and after I came home we had a pot of beer at the Red-lion, I believe we had one pot, I suppose we were there half an hour or three quarters, I cannot say exactly; when I sat in the box, the man that was on the right hand side of me, that is the prisoner Crawford, cut my pocket and took my money out, I stopped him immediately, and had him searched, and it was found upon him, he wanted to go out, and I perceived his hand upon my thing, and I stopped him and said, you have robbed me, he said, he had no money about him, and would stand search, and the landlord searched him, and he had no money, and two beadles came in and made him strip, and found it all upon him, they found three guineas in gold, and seven shillings and sixpence in silver, and three halfpence farthing; I lost three guineas and some silver.</p>

               <p>Was there any other person near you besides the prisoner? - Only this man in the box, while he was doing it I felt him; my pocket was cut out.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say when the money was found upon him? - He said at first he had no money, but when it was found upon him, he said no more; they took him away to the watch-house; the money had no mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Macnally, prisoners counsel. You have been frequently before at this house, the sign of the Red-lion? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do not you recollect when you was at the Running-horse, that you fell asleep on the table? - I was not asleep at all at the house.</p>

               <p>How came these men to go with you, to see you home? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not the woman of the house say, that you was in such a state of drukeness that you were incapable of going home, and the servant should see you home? - She did not.</p>
               <p>Is not the prisoner servant to the woman of that house? - I do not know, I thought he had been the landlord.</p>
               <p>Did not he go home for the purpose of protecting you, by the desire of the landlady of the house, did not he assist to awake you? - The woman might say so, but I was not asleep in the house at all.</p>
               <p>When she gave you this advice, if you sleep here you certainly will be robbed; did not you answer, there is no danger of that, for I have been in company with two women of the town all the morning, and I am perfectly secure? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was not you in company with women of the town that day you was robbed? - As to women of the town, I do not know what they were.</p>
               <p>But before you came to the Running-horse, was not you in company with women of the town? - I might, but that is nothing, I was robbed in this house, I have nothing further to say at all.</p>
               <p>But you shall answer; did not Mrs. Butler tell you if you slept there you would certainly be robbed? - She might say so.</p>
               <p>Do you admit she did say so or not? - Well, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Did not you in answer to that, say to her I am not affraid of being robbed, for I have been in company with two women of the town, and I am perfectly secure? - No, I did not, I will take my oath of that I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you had been in company with women of the town, and that they had got all the money you had about you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>I ask you on your oath, did not the prisoner Duncan go home with you, at the request of his mistress to see you safe? - Yes, and I thought it had been the landlord of the house.</p>
               <p>Have you any charge against the prisoner Duncan respecting the robbing of you? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Was Duncan searched? - Yes, there was only a knife found upon him; no money.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice HEATH.</p>
               <p>Court. Let it be known to the Westminster justices what a very bad house this woman keeps.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Butler. You appear in a very bad light here? - It is not the walls of a house that makes it bad, it had been a bad house before I took it.</p>

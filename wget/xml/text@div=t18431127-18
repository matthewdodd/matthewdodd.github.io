                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Baker, and live at 17, Old-street-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On Monday morning, the 30th of October, about half-past two or three o'clock, I was awoke by my brother and a young man who lives with us, who told me something, in consequence of which I went to the front window over the shop, and threw up the sash, but could see no one—I waited till the police<lb></lb>man came by, directed his attention to the shutters, and told him to wait till I came down—I came down, and found a large hole cut right through between two shutters—the wire behind was broken away, the glass smashed, and several watches knocked down inside the window—I missed one—I had locked up the house about twelve over-night—the house was then safe—this is the watch I lost—it is the property of the firm—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 169.) About half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 30th I was on duty in Old Street-road, and heard the drop of a bar or piece of iron on the pavement, and, on looking, saw two men run<lb></lb>ning away from the shutters—I crossed over to them, and the prisoner threw something away (I could not tell what) into the middle of the road—I pursued him, and, with another constable's assistance, took him into custody, I took him back to the spot where he had thrown something away, and there found the works of the watch—I then took him to the station—returned with a light, and found the case on the same spot—I should think he must have been about two hundred yards from the shutters when he threw this away—I was within about thirty yards of the shutters when I first saw him—he was run<lb></lb>ning—I lost sight of him in turning the corner—I was about ten yards behind him—it was at the corner of Willow-walk—another constable was standing at the end of Bath-street, and as he turned the corner I lost sight of them both—the other constable had got him round the corner—I searched the prisoner, and found on him five lucifer matches.</p>

I was on duty in Tabernacle-square, about half-past two o'clock—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," ran to the spot, and saw the prisoner running very fast, and Bicknell in pursuit of him—on seeing me he turned down Wil<lb></lb>low-walk—I ran after him, caught him, and asked what he was running for—he denied running—he was very much out of breath—he was taken to Old-street-road, and I saw Bicknell pick up these works—after we took the pri<lb></lb>soner to the station, we came back and found the case—it might be about 150 yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>

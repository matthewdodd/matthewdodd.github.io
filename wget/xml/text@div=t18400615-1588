                  </hi>I am a widow, and live in Windmill-street, West<lb></lb>minster, and deal in ladies' wardrobes—the prisoner has occasionally dealt with me. On Sunday afternoon, the 17th of May, the shop was closely shut up—my daughter was gone out—the prisoner came and asked for a piece of silk or merino, to make her sister a bonnet—I told her to come on the morrow and I would see, but I could not attend to her then—on the Monday afternoon I missed a gown, but the cape was left, and I went to some pawnbrokers, and gave notice of it—on the Wednesday I was told that the prisoner was opposite the house with the gown on—I went, and found she had got it on—I brought her in, and she offered to pay double the value, if I would not expose her—nothing was said on the Sunday about a gown—this is the gown—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>I am a widow. I have known the prisoner the last four or five years—she has had an uncommon good character—I went to the prosecutrix, and asked her what she meant to do with the girl—she said what she meant to do she had done at the station-house, and that the gown was worth six times the money she got from the girl.</p>

I went to her on my own account to ask her a few questions, and to know what she meant to do—I went to the prisoner to take her breakfast, and as I went back I called on the prosecutrix—I called on her again, and she asked if the girl would acknowledge that she told a lie as to her being intoxicated on the Sunday evening, as it would disgrace her.</p>
               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">QUIN.</hi>I am single. I work for myself. I had been to the prosecutrix's shop, and bought a pair of boots—I had not the money to pay for them, but said I would call on the Saturday night or Sunday—I called on the Sunday, and the prisoner was there, making a bargain with the prosecutrix for the gown, and I saw her lay down 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I stood there all the time.</p>

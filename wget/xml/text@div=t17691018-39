She came again, between three and four the same day, to fetch it out again. My mother was in the shop. She came out to call me, to come and give the prisoner change. I went into the parlour again. My mother presently called to me, and said the woman had taken a gown. I went out, and ran after her. She ran so fast, I could not overtake her. I was about two or three yards from her once, and called, Stop thief! but she got away. I saw about half a yard of the gown hang down on her left side, under an old red cloak she had on.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a gown was it?</p>
               <p>E. Trooper. It was a flowered long lawn, red and white. It was taken from off a box on the other side the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you meet with the prisoner again?</p>
               <p>E. Trooper. On the 14th of October, she came into my shop again; then I stopped her. I knew her, by having seen her a great many times before.</p>
               <p>E. Trooper Sen. I was in the shop when the prisoner came in, in the afternoon. She asked me for a neckcloth. I gave it her. She wanted change. I could not give it her; and while I went out of the shop to call my daughter, I suppose the prisoner took the gown. When I came back into the shop, she was in a great confusion, wanting to go. As she was going out, I saw half a yard of the gown hanging down. She got out of the shop, and I being behind the counter, could not get out soon enough. I called to my daughter, and told her; she ran after her, but could not overtake her. We never got the gown again.</p>

               <p>I went for the neckcloth, and had a basket in my hand full of shavings. The man that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180038"></xptr> neckcloth belonged to was waiting in the street, which made me be in a hurry. When I went into the shop, there was a woman came out. I went afterwards, and they stopped me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am registrar at the Westminster County Court. On 27th Jan. this summons (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) came on to be heard before Mr. Bailey—Mary Simpson was the plaintiff, and Mr. Cregreen was the defendant—Mary Simpson was sworn—I heard her give evidence—there was only one particular point that made much impression on my mind; I remember her swearing that she had lent sums of money to the defendant—she was asked on cross-examination whether the defendant had ever been surety for her to a loan society, and she said he had not—I have no parti<lb></lb>cular recollection of anything else—after she had given evidence, the case was adjourned till 4th Feb.—I was not present when the documents were produced, but I was when she was ordered into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to my father, who is the attorney in this case—I was present when the case was tried—Mary Simpson was sworn—I recollect my attention being called more particularly to the fact regarding a certain loan—after she had been warned, she stated, in answer to a question put by my father, that she never had a loan—that Mr. Cregreen was not security for the payment of that loan, and Mr. Tomsett was not joint security with Mr. Cregreen—my father then cautioned her to be careful how she answered—he had these two notes in his hand, and he read from them, and said, "Have you not had money from the Brunswick</p>

               <p>Street branch office?"—she said, "No; never—she also swore that she had lent Mr. Cregreen money in July, and several other months in 1856, and that Mr. Cregreen never advanced her any money at all—she was asked whether Mr. Cregreen had lent her money; she said, no, he had put his name down to certain papers as subscriptions for her, but never paid her any money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not your father ask her who was present at any time when the money was advanced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she said that Mr. Cregreen's wife was present on some occasions—and she said that the servant had borrowed money of her on Mr. Cregreen's account—Mr. Ore<lb></lb>green was then the defendant—11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the amount that she said she had lent—there was money on both sides struck off—the defendant pleaded a set off—this is the set off—it is my writing—a portion was struck off because they were transactions with the husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant engineer. This defendant's husband was foreman to Mr. Jay, the contractor, but under my direction—in con<lb></lb>sequence of that, I became acquainted with the prisoner and her husband—Mary Simpson never lent me any money—I have lent money to her on repeated occasions; and, amongst other matters, I am sorry to say, I became security for her. to a loan society—this is my signature to this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—she signed it also, and William Tomsett was the other surety—this is dated 21st July, 1856, and is a promissory note to pay 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at twenty days after date for value received; it is signed Mary Simpson, William Tomsett, (a boot and shoe maker,) and Daniel Cregreen—I did not receive the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you not on very friendly terms with the late Mr. Simpson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as friendship was concerned, I was on amicable terms with him, because he was foreman under my superintendence—we were on friendly and intimate terms—I have lent money to him on several occasions—I may have borrowed of him to meet contingencies—at the time of his death, I continued on friendly terms with the widow—I did her all the service that laid in my power, for the sake of her family—I got up more than one, two, or three subscriptions for her—I think the first was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. subscribed—I do not know the exact amount—I headed it with a sum, and I paid the sums over to the prisoner—I put my name down half a sovereign—I swear that—I did not get up a couple of raffles, but I instructed the foreman who took the place of her deceased husband to get up the raffles as a mere assistant to her—I took no part, except instructing him to exercise all the influence he could amongst the men (about 100) to get up money for a brother foreman's widow—I never threw at these raffles—I heard her husband say that he belonged to a benefit society—I do not know that his widow received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she might or might not—she did not receive it to my knowledge—I am aware that there was some money due from the employer of her late husband that she was entitled to receive—I believe Mr. Jones, the engineer, said 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all she was entitled to, but on my representation, she received a greater amount—about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it might be: and out of that she bought a mangle—I have got the receipt of it—I did not say at the Westminster County Court that I bought the mangle—I said I held the receipt for the mangle—I went about it—a certain portion of it was paid for with her money—I paid the rest out of my own benevolence—I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I forget which—it cost 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. alto<lb></lb>gether—it broke down, and they had to have it repaired, and there was a board to notify that mangling was done, and altogether amounted to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I</p>

I claimed as advanced by me on the 13th was not got from the society—I believe I did not say at the County Court that I never had been sued—I could not swear that I have not been sued, because I know I have—I believe I can swear that the question was never asked me—I should not like to swear that I did not swear I had never been sued—if you wish to know, I have been sued—I believe I did not swear I had not—I could not swear I had not.</p>

               <p>subscriptions, and got the workmen to join in subscribing—I did that because she was the widow of a fellow workman—it was to assist her—her husband was ill for a considerable period of time, and during that period he was out of work—I believe 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was about the amount of wages that Mr. Jones paid him—when the branch bank declined to advance the loan on one security, I, in consequence, obtained the signature of Tomsett—that was to the knowledge of Simpson—she called on Tomsett.</p>

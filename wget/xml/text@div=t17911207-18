On the 22d of November, about half past four in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our stables, and called hostler; he asked whether Mr. Richardson had not a horse stood there at livery? I replied, yes; he said, Mr. Richardson have recommended me for a horse at any time; I told him I knew Mr. Richardson, but that he was out of town; yes, the prisoner said, he went out of town on the Sunday before; he said, he wanted a horse to go to Low Layton; and on his saying he came from Mr. Richardson, I let him have a horse; he again said he wanted a horse to go to Low Layton, on particular business; he should return about eight o'clock in the evening; nothing was said about the price; I lent him a bit of stick; when he got on to the horse, he said he was clerk and rider to some great shop in Cheapside, and that his name was Brown: he mentioned the name of the shop, but I do not remember: it was a black gelding; I saw nothing more of him that evening; I saw the horse again on the 25th, at Mr. Hopkins's stables, in Holborn; it is a repository; my master bought him in spring. My reason for being particular about the time of his going, was, having a gentleman to go out about the same time, an old customer; it was half past four, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. It was half past four, on the 22d of November, rather duskish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was upon the faith of Mr. Richardson's name, that you let him have a horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you the first person that spoke to the person that came from Richardson? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that he is the person? - Yes; the yard is very light, and it is lighted between five and six; the horse was not hired generally, but to return that evening.</p>

On the 19th of November, I was paying the men; the prisoner knocked at the compting-house door, when I was paying the men; I had seen him before; he put his head just in the door, and said, I ask your pardon for disturbing you; I shall be glad to speak with you; I stepped out, and said, well, Sir, what is your pleasure? says he, I will thank you to lend me a guinea; I replied I could not spare one, having a number of men to pay; he then asked me if I had seen Mr. Wise? I said, I will tell you what, Mr. Robins, I have some money to take to morrow; if I succeed, I will lend you a guinea; he came on the morrow; I told him I did not succeed, and could not lend him a guinea; about a fortnight before this, he told me he had a horse or two to sell; I told him, if he brought them, I would endeavour to sell them for him, as for other gentlemen; he said he had one, and that he should bring him; this was on the 20th of November; on the 22d, Tuesday, about half past five o'clock, a few minutes under or over, he brought a black gelding; he told me that was it he spoke about; I said, Sir, says I, what do you want for this; he rode it into the yard with a saddle and bridle on it; says he, this is a better than the other; and he booked it at eight guineas; he then said he wanted some money on it; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070018"></xptr>I had but a guinea in my pocket; he said that would do for the present, but he must have some more in the evening; I told him I was going to Park-lane to receive some; if I succeeded, I would let him have some more; I told him I lent him the guinea; I did not lend it as a pawn-broker; I did not consider the horse a pawn for it; he asked me when I should return? I said, in an hour; he asked me if I should ride that horse he brought in? I said, no, I had a hack of my own; I made it eleven o'clock before I came home; and not expecting to see him that night, as I could not see the aforesaid Mr. Wise; and he was waiting under the window of my bed-chamber, behind a pheaton; he said I had kept him waiting a long while; I said I was sorry for it; he asked me if I had succeeded? and I told him no; he pressed me very hard again, and said he did not know what to do for money; I then told him I would endeavour to get him another guinea; I went to Mrs. Blick, who keeps the Bull and Gate, and borrowed the second guinea; but in the mean time he left this letter; I have seen him write, and am certain this is his hand-writing; Mr. Hopkins gave me the letter the next morning; I gave him the second guinea; he then asked me where he should settle the business; the time was fixed on the next evening at five; I was to give him eight guineas for the horse for myself; at five he came; I told him I would settle in half an hour; he came, and I asked him to go to the public-house, as there were some gentlemen in the compting-house: Wise was there, and said how do you do, Mr. Bean? this convinced me he had done wrong, as he entered his name Robins, and gave me that name always; he called Mr. Wise out of the public house, and they went out together; I kept close to him; he kept drawing out of the yard, as it were, a little at a time; and I said, Mr. Robins, I must know how you came by this horse? I rather suspect you; he then said it belonged to some foreign gentleman, whose name he mentioned, but I do not recollect, who is gone abroad; and I asked him if he knew any body that did know the horse? he made no other answer, but that the gentleman was gone to France; then I asked him for his address? he pulled a pencil and a bit of paper out of his pocket, and wrote No. 4, or some other number, in St. Martin's-le-grand; I told him that was not a plain direction for me; if he would go into the compting-house, and write it with pen and ink, I would endeavour to be convinced if it was right; he then said he had a lady waiting for him at the gateway end; that he would go and speak to her, and return immediately; I then told him I should be plain with him; I would not let him go from me; he then went with me into the compting-house, and owned his address was fictitious; I then told him I would hesitate no longer, but he should give a satisfactory account at Bow-street; he told me he thought it might be settled without going there; if he repaid me the two guineas, would I be then satisfied; I then told him it was a serious business, and ought to be brought to light; and nothing but going to Bow-street would satisfy me; I sent for a coach, and took him there; going along, he pressed me very hard to settle it; hoped I would take it into consideration, and not be the ruin of a young man; I told him it was not my intention to injure him, only to have a satisfactory account to the justice; for had I not taken him, it might have been a serious thing to myself: before the justice, he owned the horse belonged to Mr. Taylor, of Chiswell-street: Mott came and saw the horse; it was the same horse; the letter I received on the 23d, about ten o'clock; it was left the 22d.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Humphries, what sort of a stable-yard is this of Mr. Hopkins's? - It is a place for sale and a livery-yard.</p>
               <p>It is a repository, is not it? - By private contract; we do not sell by public auction, nor have not done for these four years.</p>
               <p>The custom then of the repository is, to take in horses from any body that comes, without enquiring any thing at all about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070019"></xptr>them? - Not with us; we always take the address.</p>
               <p>What capacity might you be in? - Foreman to the salesman, about twelve years.</p>
               <p>Anything you did in the yard, was on Mr. Hopkins's account? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - From the 10th of November; I saw him again the 19th, by bringing a horse of Mr. Jocelyn's of London-wall.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of November, there was some conversation about a horse, which horse was not owned till Monday last, after the prisoner was apprehended? - He brought no horse before the 22d.</p>
               <p>Was not there a horse that he was charged with before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of that charge? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it was discharged? - I do not; Mr. Jocelyn did swear to his horse; and on Monday last he was to have done something in the business.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner on that other warrant? - I bought that horse and had a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Let us look at the receipt; (produces it); I see by this receipt you gave him seven guineas? - I did.</p>
               <p>I see it is received of Mr. Humphries, seven guineas for a black gelding? - This was in my own name: but it never was unknown to Mr. Hopkins; we never hinder any body bringing horses to us for sale, especially if we have any suspicion; I certainly had suspicions, or would not let him have had one guinea; I made no enquiries, because I thought he would come again; the first enquiry I made, was of Mr. Wise; and if he had come to me for fifty shillings, without a horse, I should have let him have it on his name. Mr. Wise did come; the prisoner and he were acquainted.</p>
               <p>When he first brought the horse, what did he particularly say? - He brought a black horse, and said this is the black horse I told you of; and that that was one of the pair that he drove in his curricle; I then asked him whether it was a sound one or not; he said, yes; there was nothing ailed him, only a little hair was rubbed off the side with the harness, which he pointed to me, but I did not see it; and he compared it with the other horse, and I then thought they were a pair.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you when he left them, that he left them for sale? - No doubt of it; for sale for eight guineas.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say that he would not sell him, but would pay for his keep; did not he tell you that he would not sell him, but would pay for his keep? - I did not hear any such thing mentioned; he said he was distressed or would not sell it.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of this last horse? - Yes, I believe it was an intire black one, only a single star in the forehead; it was not material for me to take particular notice.</p>
               <p>You have been used to a great many horses, and have seen a great many? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of course you know that a white leg before or behind is a particular mark? - When people take particular notice of it it is, there is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>How long had you the horse in your custody? - Six nights.</p>
               <p>Of course you had an opportunity of seeing him many times? - I had and I had not; he was put by in a corner stall till an owner came; I saw him stand in the stable, and went to see whether the horse was fed.</p>
               <p>If the horse had had a white leg, should not you have taken notice of it? - If I had had any particular reason; I remember the horse; but I could not swear to that other horse; nor I do not know that I could swear to this.</p>
               <p>Which horse was chopped away? - The other horse was in my custody about two days.</p>
               <p>Court. You frequently saw this horse fed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to swear that that was the horse brought by the prisoner, and seen by Mott? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. How often have you seen this man write? - Only once.</p>

With respect to the horse being booked for sale, Mr. Humphries has an undoubted right to write what he pleases in his own book: it was never my intention to sell him, nor to leave him as a pledge: the second time I called, I wrote that night requesting him to lend me eight guineas: I never conceived it to be lent on the horse; and I am sure Mr. Humphries does not: I am sure he cannot; I called again after I had left the note, and Mr. Humphries was not at home: but he presently after came home, and I then asked him to oblige me with the money? he said, no, he had been disappointed: he had been after a Mr. Allingham, a sheriff's officer, to arrest a Mr.

               <p>Where did he live? - He lodged in the Old Bailey, and different parts of the town.</p>
               <p>Court to Humphries. He had talked to you of having two stone colts? - Yes: it was not when he brought this horse; it was when he brought the first horse: I did not take this to be one of these two stone colts.</p>
               <p>What did you sell the first horse he brought you for? - I did not sell him: we in general keep an errand-poney for one of our lads to ride on. A man that buys post chaises had a horse, and I exchanged with Perkins: he gave me two guineas and the poney, which I considered as six guineas, at a fair valuation.</p>

            , otherwise Brown, Mr. Knapp moved in arrest of judgment, on the ground, that the addition of the prisoner was put to the alias dictus, and not to the substantive name; and that therefore it did not appear on the face of the record, from whence the jury were to be collected, which by right it ought; and therefore that there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070021"></xptr>was uncertainty apparent on the record: the Court, upon hearing the objection, thought there was weight in it, and <rs id="t17911207-18-verdict96" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I saw the property taken by the prisoner on the 18th of November, the nails were in the cellar under the warehouse; at near three o'clock in the afternoon, I was secreted there to watch him, I saw him come down and take a thousand nails; they are kept, some in bags, and some in papers, upon shelves in the cellar; he took them from the shelf, they were threepenny fine clasp, he put them into the waistband of his breeches, then he went up stairs; I met

             on the stairs, I did not follow him till I supposed he was gone, I told Crosley that he had taken something; the prisoner was called back upon suspicion of being a thief; I then desired him to produce the nails that I saw him secrete; he produced them, and said, he had taken them because his wife desired him to bring some to mend the coalhole; a constable was then sent for, who took charge of the prisoner, and the nails, and he was taken to the Poultry-compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you a partner in this house? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. He said his wife had desired him to bring these nails to mend the coal-hole? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the worth of them? - A. They are valued at two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. These nails were some in papers, and some in bags, and some loose? - A. I do not think there were any loose; they are kept in different ways; it is at the option of the persons who look after them.</p>
               <p>Q. But some persons may not be so careful of property as others; there might be some loose you know? - A.There might.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons do you employ in your business? - A. A shopman, two porters, and an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. They do not live in your house? - A. The porters do not, nor the shopman.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean to say it is a proper thing, but if the porter wanted a few nails to knock up a coalhole you would not think it a very bad thing? - A. We should expect to be asked for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it never happen? - A.Not to my knowledge.</p>

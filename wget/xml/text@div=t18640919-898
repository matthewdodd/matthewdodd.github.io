                  </hi>. I occupy the shop and back parlour in the house of Charles Morgan—on Saturday night, on concluding business, I shut up the shop, safely, and left it secure—I returned to it about 9 in the morning and found the shutters out of place, and I could see from the outside that all the goods were gone—I called a policeman, and he went in with me—I missed coats, trousers, hats, stockings, flannels, shirts, and everything to the value of about 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of it—I saw these on the following Saturday—these are my property and a very small portion of whit I lost.</p>

               <p>about 200 yards from Petticoat-lane—I saw the prisoner there—he had these seven pairs of trousers—he was standing leaning against a wall—I went and asked what he had in his bundle—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said, "They are not mine"—I said, "How did you come by them?"—he said, "A Jew gave them to me to mind for him, and he said he should be back again in a few minutes"—I said, "It is very curious he should give them to you to mind; do you know him?"—he said, "No"—I waited a few minutes; no one came, and I took the prisoner to the station—on the way he wanted to get away and leave me with the trousers, while he went to find the Jew—he gave the name of Samuel Jones.</p>

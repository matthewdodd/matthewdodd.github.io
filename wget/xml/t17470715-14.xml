I little thought that you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174707150011"></xptr> was the Man! We mist the Plate in the Morning, we looked at it, and there was Vinegar upon it; I carried two Plates of my Master's with me, and I found one in particular with my Master's Mark, and he could hardly deny it.</p>

             . I keep a Broker's Shop in Moorfields, and the Prisoner at the Bar, one Day brought me 8 Plates for Sale, marked with 3 single Letters, and he told me a very plausible Story, that his Wife was dead, and they were pawned ; I gave him 7 d. a Pound; the next Day he brought me 7 more, my Wife is but a young Shopkeeper, and she bought them and never turn'd them up: when I came home I looked at them, I was deadly mad about them, I saw they were stole ; one had the Name of Shaw, another Abell, another Mr Eames at the Bee-hive; I saw they were stole; my Wife said don't be angry, he will be here with 12 more to-night; so I said, he is a good Hand to make 18 of a Day; the next Day he came to me again , and I sent my Wife out for the Constable, and sent to some of the Owners of the Plates. The Facts were plainly proved upon the Prisoner. In his Defence he told a dark improbable Story, of his receiving them from a Person over the Water, that had formerly known him, and met in the Street.</p>

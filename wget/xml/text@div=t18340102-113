I was crying, "Old clothes," on the 1st of January, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, near Gray's-inn-lane - the prisoner Johnson came to me, and said she had an old coat and waistcoat to sell - I asked her where, and she took me to a one-pair of stairs room, in <placeName id="t18340102-113-crimeloc631">Bell-court</placeName>

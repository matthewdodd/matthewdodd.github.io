On the 18th of August I was at the door - the prisoner came, and made herself known to me; I had not seen her for some years - she said she had been about the neighbourhood, and was faint and hungry, and had no bonnet or shawl on: she wished me to let her come up stairs and sit down - she stopped to dinner and tea; we had the saltcellar at dinner - she stopped till after dark; I missed the carpet and salt-cellar the next morning - I met her two or three weeks afterwards, and had her taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you in the habit of drinking gin together? A. We drank some that day - we had only one quartern; it was an old glass salt-cellar, but one I did not wish to lose - I am quite sure it was not pawned to get the gin; she left my apartment about eight o'clock in the evening - my husband was not at home; I swear she did not dine with me the day afterwards - she called, but I did not see her.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old; I live with my mother - the prosecutor lodges there. On Sunday morning, the 19th of August, the prisoner came and asked for Mrs. Robertson - she went up stairs; she had nothing with her then; I went into our shop, and in a short time saw her coming down with a carpet under her arm - she went into the street; I thought she went to shake it - I told her not to shut the door, as I was going down stairs, and should not hear her knock to let her in again - she did not return.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen her there before? A. No, not before the 18th; I did not call Mrs.

On Saturday, the 18th of August, I was going by a shop in King-street, next to St. Andrew-street - Mrs. Adams keeps it; the prisoner went and asked her if she would buy a salt-cellar; Mrs. Adams offered her 2d. for it - it was in the evening.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 75). On 22nd April, about 10.30 p.m., I was on duty in Rodney Row, and saw the prisoner making a great disturbance, knocking at a door, and demanding to be admitted—he was drunk—I advised him to go away—he said he should not go, his wife was inside, and he should knock till he got admittance—he left for about five minutes, and returned and commented knocking again for about three-quarters of an hour, and then the woman came out—I advised her to go away with him, and said I thought he would be all right when he was sober—they went away about 100 yards—he kept pressing her to go home with him, and she said she would have nothing to do with him, and applied to me for protection—I said "You had better go home"—she walked about twenty yards, and he followed her into Cottage Row—the prisoner waited for a few minutes, and said "If you don't go home with me I will do for you"—I saw him draw something from his pocket and put his arm forward, and the woman screamed out that she was stabbed—I was about ten yards away—another constable came up, and the prisoner walked away ten yards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060078"></xptr>
               <p>—I pursued him, and he turned round, held the knife out, and said "Here is the knife, I have done nothing"—I had got hold of him then—I gave it to the other constable—it was open, and there was blood on it—he said at the station that he was very sorry for what he had done; not for the woman's sake, but the child's—he took it to heart very much, and cried—I saw the woman with blood running from her bosom—she was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I have lived with the prisoner fourteen or fifteen years—he was kind to me when sober, but when drunk he was not—latterly he has given way to excessive drinking, but about six months ago he made an effort at reform—I came home from work on this night at 9.30, and he was in the place, drunk: there were some dreadful words and he went out—he returned drunk, and I did not want to let him in, but my landlord asked me to go down and pacify him—I was wounded in my breast—I am quite well now.</p>

                  </hi>. I found an incised wound in the prosecutrix's right breast, about an inch deep—it was in a dangerous situation, but it was not a dangerous wound; she was about a week in the hospital—she is quite out of danger, but very weak—she will be some time recovering the loss of blood, the hemorrhage was very free.</p>

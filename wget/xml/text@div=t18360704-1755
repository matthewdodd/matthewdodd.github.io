Weston's Bank, and received the money—I was then going back to the Magpie and Stump. and the prisoner called to me in the Poultry, as I was running up—I offered him the money in the street, but he would not accept of it—he said, "Wait a <hi rend="italic">bil</hi>"—we went round the back of the Poultry, and into a small public-house—I there gave him the money, and he gave me a pint of beer—he drank out of it—he then came out in the street, and gave me a shilling—he told me to go to the Elephant and Castle, and wait till he came—I went, a waited till half-past six o'clock in the evening, and he never came—it was between twelve and one o'clock when I left him—I never saw him again till he was taken into custody at Northampton, about a month ago—I then found him in a shop, in Abingdon-street—Mr. Kelly took me there.</p>

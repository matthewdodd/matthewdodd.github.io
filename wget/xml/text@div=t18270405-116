On the morning of the 18th of March I heard some words between my son and another person; I got up, came down in my shirt, and found the prisoner in my passage; I asked what he had done, he said, "Nothing at all;" I said, "You are my prisoner," and I took hold of him; he resisted, and wanted to go into the taproom - I saw some money in his mouth, and saw him put his hand to his mouth, and then he shuffled about, and I saw a shilling fall from the back of his trowsers; I sent for an officer, who came in about ten minutes, and was going to search him, but 2s. 6d. more fell from him which made 3s. 6d.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. On the 18th of March I got up pretty early, and opened the street-door - I then went into the bar; the prisoner came between six and seven o'clock, he stood by the fire a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I went up stairs to ask my father a question, and as I was coming down, I saw the prisoner coming from the bar-door; I saw the till half way out - I went and looked at it, and there was only 2s. in it; there was 5s. 6d. there when I went up stairs - I went to the prisoner, and asked what he had done with the money - he denied having any; I told him to give me what he had taken from the till, and he might go about his business - I saw some money fall from him.</p>

            . I lodge at the Horse and Groom. On the morning of the 18th of March I remember Osborne going up stairs; the prisoner was then standing with his back to the fire-place; he directly went into the bar, and stood near the till with his face towards it - Osborne came down in about a minute, and the prisoner went into the back yard; Osborne went into the bar, and then he went after the prisoner, and accused him of robbing the till.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see him open the till? A. No; I saw him pushing it too; I was in the tap-room; there was no one went into the bar but the prisoner; there is a passage between the bar and the tap-room. I saw some money fall from the prisoner.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner in the bar; Osborne had been gone up stairs about two minutes; the prisoner went out of the bar as soon as he heard him step on the stairs; he came down and went into the bar; he then ran to the prisoner, and I heard him tell him if he would give him the money again he might go about his business - I saw the money drop from the back part of his trousers when the officer came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in to call for half a pint of porter, and was talking to the lad about the ticket of a watch seal; he said he would buy it of me, and get it out unknown to his father - I said he was welcome to the ticket, as no doubt it was stopped; I then went to the bar to give it him, and he was not there; I did not go in at all.</p>
               <p>J. OSBORNE re-examined. Q. Did You say that you would accept of the ticket, or have it unknown to your father? A. No; there was 3s. in the till the night before, left to give change; the other was taken that morning. He had a pennyworth of beer after he was taken into custody; he had not called for any thing before that; he said he had no other money but the penny that he paid for the beer.</p>

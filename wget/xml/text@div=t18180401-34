            ; I had given up business on the 29th of September, and removed the whole of my property to his house, and it continued there until the 19th of February - I lodged there before I went to Pimlico; the articles stated in the indictment were in his house on that day. I went to Wheatley's house at half-past twelve o'clock on that day - I was going to Islington with my daughter - We left the prisoner in charge of the house, and begged of him not to leave it until I returned. I left him with my grand-daughter, who is thirteen years of age. As I was going out I wanted a 5l. note, and sent my grand-daughter up for it. I then went out with my daughter, and told the prisoner not to leave the house, as I should return to dinner at three o'clock. I returned about a quarter before three, the girl said the prisoner had left the house about three-quarters of an hour after we left. One of the lodgers asked me to lend her two table-spoons, I sent the girl up to my trunk for them, she called her mother; I went up myself, and met her - She said that two notes were gone; I found my pocketbook open, and a 20l. and a 1l. note gone, and the rest of the articles stated in the indictment. The prisoner was my <rs id="t18180401-34-deflabel197" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

In the evening I went to Bow-street and got an officer, we went to several houses in search of him-the last house we went to, when I was in the passage I saw him in the back room with his arms round a girl's neck-it was about a quarter past ten o'clock. I collared him, brought him out, and took him to the watch-house. I saw the constable of the night untie his neck-handkerchief, and between his stiffner and handkerchief, he found the 20l. and 1l. notes; we also found some silver money on him, but nothing else of mine. We found an instrument in the water-closet, which appeared to have been used to pick the lock. The plate and money were taken from a basket which was locked in my trunk; the girl found the box locked when she went to it. I do not know how they were got at. The 20l. note was mine, I had received it from Mr. Warner; the 1l. note was not mine, but he told the magistrate he had received it for part of the plate. I have not seen the property since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not seen the 20l. note that morning, but I had seen it two days before. The prisoner has lived with his parents lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember charging him with an offence similar to this sometime ago - A. I do. I never charged any other person with it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's granddaughter. On the 19th of February I was in my father's house, and was sent up for a 5l. note. There was a 20l. note and a 1l. note with it; I brought the 5l. note down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010013"></xptr>to Mr. Dean. I left the other two notes there, and locked the trunk. At dinner-time I was sent up for some spoons, I unlocked it, found the pocket-book open, and the notes gone. I called my mother, and Mr. Dean came up. The prisoner was left in the house with me while my mother and Mr. Dean went out - He was desired to stay there; he went up stairs, as he said, to sharpen a razor. When he came down he asked if he should go out, I said, No. He went out.</p>

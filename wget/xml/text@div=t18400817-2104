                  </hi>. I met the prisoner on the 16th of August quite drunk—I took him home out of charity—he went away, and about two hours after two strange men had the prisoner between them—his shipmate requested me to take him into the house for the night—I laid him on his own bed in the passage—he made a disagreeable noise, and I took him into my own room—in the morning my wife awoke me, and he was fum<lb></lb>bling about the room—he said he wanted to go away—he asked my wife to get him a light, which she did—he put on his jacket, and went out with his bed under his arm—in about half an hour my wife missed a half-sovereign and a crown-piece, which I had given her—I went and found him in New Gravel-lane, in a bad house—I asked if he had any know<lb></lb>ledge of the money, he said not—I asked how he came by the handker<lb></lb>chief on his neck, which was mine—he said my wife tied it on his neck—I gave him in charge.</p>

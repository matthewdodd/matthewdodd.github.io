               <p>I am a lamp-lighter. I was in this public-house; and these two prisoners were in at the same time, and had been an hour or two before: when the alarm was given about this money, the prisoners were gone for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I took notice of their both going towards the bar; I thought he wanted to pay his reckoning: before that he wanted to quarrel with me, upon an old grudge; I believe we had been out together and had a pint of beer, and I would pay for it, and I thought he took a huff at it. When Mrs. Beckman found the till gone she came into the tap room, and said, her till was gone, and asked if any one had played tricks with it, as she had lost her till, and all that was in it together: in about five or ten minutes the prisoners came in with some sausages for their supper; immediately the landlady charged them on suspicion: on searching them at the watch-house we found the keys. The constable charged me to assist him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you pack them up with your own hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they were intended for India—the num<lb></lb>bers of the watches were entered in a day-book—I know them to be the same watches, by comparing them with the day-book—I have the day-book here—the name of "A. B. Savory, and Sons," is on the gold watch, and two of the silver ones, as the makers—that name is on all the watches we make—we sell some that we do not make—there it one Ge<lb></lb>neva watch—I only know the numbers by reference to our book—I made the entry in the book myself, at the time of the transaction—the two silver lever-watches are entered on 27th of April—they were at that time brought in from the manufactory—the entry is made when we receive them from the workman—here is "No. 9"—that is No. 9, Cornhill—we send there for them—this entry does not strictly show the time that the watches came into our stock—this is a charge I make when I am going to send them to a customer—they were at the manufactory, No. 9, at the time I made the entry—our shop is No. 14—it is the same concern—I will swear that I had seen these watches at the time I made the entry—I went to No. 9, and saw them both finished—I did not bring them away then, because we did not want them—we always leave them till the last moment, to give time for further regulation—I looked at this entry at the time I packed up the watches—I swear that—I cannot say who was with me at the time—I cannot recollect whether anybody read it to me—I make it a rule in pack-ing up goods for an order, to have my book by me to see that the numbers correspond with what I am packing up—I have no doubt I compared these watches with this book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have no mark in your book which shows that these particular watches went in that particular package to India? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ouly what is put down here—the charge of the watches, and the numbers here is entered "A. B. S., 3 numbers. No. 1, contains two clocks and five watches"—that is another entry which I made some time after the 27th of April—I make no mark in my book to show that I have compared them—I judge from my general practice the numbers are inserted at the time of delivery, at the time I make the charge, which is generally after the goods are finished—I did so here—I put down the numbers after they were completed, and while they remained at No. 9—all this entry is my writing—I cannot say when it was made—I should suppose it was written on the 23rd of June—the latter part has been written at some other time, after the watches were gone—I am not positive that any part of it was written on the 23rd—this entry does not contain the numbers of the missing watches—it con<lb></lb>tains the number of a watch which was shipped in the same ship for a different party—I entered three cases, and made a memorandum that all three were shipped by this ship.</p>

               <p>at all there, which you can undertake to say was made at the time the package left your premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not—I did not go down to the Dock myself—I delivered the package to Mr. Faris, I believe in our shop, No. 14—I do not know that I could swear to delivering it to him—I have no doubt that I did—I have no distinct recollection of that iden<lb></lb>tical thing—we have a great business both at home and abroad, and ex<lb></lb>port a considerable number of packages to India, and all places abroad—it is a thing of very rare occurrence, for anything intended for shipment, to be left behind—I have known such a thing occur, not left at the Custom-house, but at our shop—I never knew a case of five watches left behind.</p>

               <p>account of its number and its characteristics, as to its being jewelled, and so on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and if such an article is ordered, before it is packed up I refer to the entry made when it came in, in order to see that I am correct in what I send out, and to see that I have got the number properly down in my book—this gold watch was the subject of one of the orders produced—the object of taking the number of foreign watches is that I may have the proper description of them, and see that they are the watches charged out to the customer—that appears by the entry I have read—I had received the order at the time I wrote that—I should not have entered it in the book if we had not received an order for it—it is done on receiving the order—I generally put the price to it at the time I make the first entry, not always—the foreign watches would, no doubt, be selected from out of the stock we have by us—this is, no doubt, the entry of watches we had already—this is not a stock book—it contains the general business of the day, purchases and orders, an account of what we buy and sell, and general business at the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. In June, 1842, I was in the employment of Messrs.

Remington and Co., Bom<lb></lb>bay—I do not recollect whether it said by what vessel it waa to go—I attended the examination by the custom-house officers—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber the name of any other officer that was there but Mr. Scanlan—the box was opened and unsoldered in my presence, by the application of the tinman's irons—I cannot say who was present when that was done—I took out the brown paper parcel, and gave it into the hands of Mr. Lowe, Mr. Savory's assistant, for Mr. Scanlan's inspection—I saw it opened, it con<lb></lb>tained one gold watch, and four silver—I saw them replaced in the brown paper—the case was resoldered while I staid, and the wooden cover put on and screwed down—I then came away.</p>

In June, 1842, I was stationed at the West India dock—on the 23rd of that month, I received a case of watches—I do not remember the case, but it appean from the official documents that it was examined—my handwriting is upon the documents—they were delivered into the searcher's office by the per<lb></lb>sons who brought the case—here are the shipping bills, with the date 23rd of June, in my own handwriting—the case was marked A. B. S., and a diamond, and appears to have been directed to Messrs. Remington and Co., by the <hi rend="italic">Coromandal</hi>, proceeding to Bombay—there is no number here—I always see that the case corresponds with the marks on the shipping bills—that is my duty, and also to examine the contents of the case—I did so on that occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what it contained except from these documents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I have no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you prepared to swear you took down the particulars correctly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am prepared to swear that when I examined the case there were two clocks and five watches in it, on com<lb></lb>paring the contents of the package with the endorsement on these docu<lb></lb>ments—I should certainly not have passed them had they not corresponded</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180059"></xptr>
               <p>—it appears by them, that there was one gold watch, and two silver of English manufacture, and two other silver watches purporting to be Geneva, made by Stauffer—I cannot remember whether the box was re-soldered after I had made the examination—(<hi rend="italic">reading one of the papers</hi>)—"A. B. S., and a diamond, Messrs. Remington and Co., No. 1, case contain-ing two clocks by A. B. Savory and Sons, 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; one gold watch by ditto, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; two silver ditto, by ditto, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. N.B. In this case are two French watches by Stauffer, Geneva, entered by another cocket of the same date. No. 2, one case, one clock, by A. B. Savory and Sons. No. 3, one case, one gold watch, by ditto, ditto; three cases shipped, endorsed in the <hi rend="italic">Coromandel</hi>, J. B. Harwood, from Bombay," June 23rd, 1842, signed Thos. Cull, "shipped S.S." The words "three cases shipped" are in the handwriting of the exporter, or his representatives—J. B. Harwood was the master of the vessel—(<hi rend="italic">reading the other paper</hi>)—"A. B. 8., and a diamond, Messrs. Remington and Co., two silver watches, by Stauffer, of Geneva. N.B. These watches are contained in a case of clocks and watches of British manufacture, and are cleared by a cocket of the same date. In the <hi rend="italic">Coromandel</hi>, J. B. Harwood, for Bombay, 22nd June, 1842, Thomas Cull, cleared out West India Dock, 23rd of June, 1842, shipped S.S." The examination took place in one of the sheds—I cannot possibly say which—if it was a tin case I should say in No. 1—the sheds are closed at four o'clock—they are occupied for the purposes of business during the day—after the examination had taken place, and I had ascertained the correctness of it, the box would be resoldered, and would be left in the regular course of business in the custody of the weighers in the shed, to be taken into the charge of the Dock Company for shipping—it is part of my duty to certify the names of the persons employed as weighers on particular days—here is my signature to each of these certificates—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two</hi>)—this enables me to say that the persons referred to were employed on particular days—one of these refers to Bonham—I cannot say whether he was employed at shed No. 1, but it appears that he was employed by the searchers on the 23rd of June, as a searcher's cooper—I cannot speak to any of the other prisoners—the other appears to be a certificate that a man named Turner was employed on the 23rd as a searcher's cooper—I should not have certified that he was so employed had he not been—they are the persons with whom in the course of business a box of this kind would be left to be delivered to the Dock Company.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whereabouts was the key of No. 1 shed hung when the door was locked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is given up to the weighers after four o'clock—it would be open between ten and four for any person to go in—there are a good many persons in and out all day—this certificate referring to Bonham, is dated Thursday, 30th of June, and is for a certain number of days marked at the bottom with the date of each day—that was done by the weigher when it was presented to me—the weigher makes the certificate—the coopers are appointed at the dock for the month, and if they are absent any working day we take a memorandum of it in the office, and when the certificate is produced to us for signature we look to see if he has been absent, and if not we sign the certificate, including all the working days of that month—it appears by this that he attended all this month—I sign a certificate for each man employed—I cannot say how many are employed—I should say about</p>

               <p>eight or ten—I merely speak from this document—it appears from this that Bonham was employed as searcher's cooper, and his duty would be to open and✗ close packages all round the dock, including No. 1 shed—it does not appear on the face of this document that he was at No. 1 but it was his business to be there, as well as at any other shed where his services might be required—I signed no certificate with regard to Lewis—that was done by another searcher.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner Strickland, I believe, was a shipper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A shipping officer—it was not his business to undo these parcels—he was not a necessary person present—when a parcel is put on board a vessel, if it contains bonded goods, he would go on board, and take a receipt from the mate, as having received the package, but in this case he would not have to take a receipt—the whole search might be conducted without his being there at all—he had nothing to do with this case—whatever goods get into his hands go afterwards into the hands of the Dock wharfingers—I do not remember his being present when anything was done to this case—I do not remember the examination of the case at all—a great number of persons would go into No. 1 shed in the course of the day—there are two doors, which are generally left open, and people walk in and through, merchants and others—I should imagine it very unlikely that during the hours of business a person could break open the chest, unsolder the case, take the watches out, and solder it up again—in my opinion I conceive it could not be done during the hours of business—business is over at four o'clock—Strickland is not now in the employment of the Custom-house—he has left about two months—up to the time of his leaving he had always borne with me a character for regu-larity and propriety—he was under me for about a year—I have used shrimps in the Docks for fishing—the West India Dock is a great place for fishing—I have fished there—I do not know whether the officers were in the habit of keeping bait for their friends—I have had bait there—if shrimps cannot be had, white bait is used—we prefer live shrimps when we can get them—brandy is not got from the vessels for the purpose of tasting—searchers are required to examine packages of brandy at times—a sample of about half a pint is drawn to try the strength of it, but that is put back again—I have always understood it to be put back—I do not know that I have ever seen brandy and water drunk at the Docks—wine is more usually drank—there are three searchers—Strickland would be under the joint inspection of the three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Lewis been in the employment of the Customs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I have been there since 1835—I do not remember having seen him till 1843, at the London Docks—I do not know how long Bonham has been in the Customs—he has served under me—he has borne a good character, as an honest man—I can say the same of Lewis—there were three persons at the West India Docks at the time in question, who gave similar certificates to those produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect Strickland leaving the service of the Customs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not recollect what he left for—I have heard from common rumour—it would not be the duty of the searchers to be present at all places where cases are opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you sign as many as eight or ten certificates in a month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were about eight or ten men employed in the Docks at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180061"></xptr>
               <p>that time, and if I signed all their certificates I should sign about that number—all those men could not have been about this shed—there are four stations in the Dock for shipping-officers—there were only three searcher's coopers during that month it appears—there must be a searcher's cooper present ut an examination of this kind, to open the package for the searcher—I have had cases opened by one cooper—their duty is to open the package and expose the goods for the inspection of the searcher—that may be done by one—I should say one of the three searcher's coopers must have been present when the package was opened—Turner was one of the three.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Albert Savory. In 1842 we had an order for two clocks and five watches, which we executed—we afterwards received a communication from India, in consequence of which we sent out five other watches in place of the five which had been pre<lb></lb>viously sent—we required no payment for the last five, and had none.</p>

Remington are our agents in India—they do not order the watches, but another party through them—if the vessel in which the watches were sent was lost we should recover from the parties with whom we insure them—we should keep the money, and supply other watches—the person ordering the watches would not bear any part of the loss—the gold watch was charged seventeen guineas—that is the price the purchaser would have to pay for it exclusive of the insurances—that would be the selling price to a customer in London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Customhouse weigher. I was on duty at the West India Dock in June, 1842, as searcher's cooper—a cer-tain number of the weighers are appointed as searchers' coopers on the 1st of the month—Bonham and Lewis were also appointed as searchers' coopers for June, 1842, and Strickland as the shipping-officer—a portion of the shed No. 1 is divided off for the express use of the searchers and their men, the searchers' coopers—that is their regular station, but they go about the Docks to various places—it is a place appointed for the coopers to remain in attendance, to wait any orders that may be issued by the searchers—they are obliged to be there till they are wanted—it is their duty to open any packages, by direction of the searchers, for their examination, and to fasten them up again when they have been examined—in June, 1842, I remember a case being brought to the West India Dock, said to contain plate, to be examined by the searchers—I did not attend the examination of it myself—I do not know who did—there were other searchers' coopers, and most likely, in fact, one or more of us would be sure to attend—Bonham, Lewis, and myself, were the three searchers' coopers for that month—I was in and out of the shed at the time this case was there for the purpose of examination—I remember on one occasion coming into the shed and seeing the case open—Lewis and Bonham were in the shed by the case—I should say they were about to put the lid on again—I think that was it, as near as I could tell—I cannot give a description of the case—it was rather a largish one—the outer case was made of fir, or deal, I should say, and a tin case was inside—one of them, I cannot say which, made an ob-servation, "Lend us a hand," or "Come on, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, lend us a hand"—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180062"></xptr>
               <p>was no one but Lewis and Bonham in the shed at that time—Strick-land was outside—he was the shipping-officer—he was to see that woods were shipped, and sign the bills for the searchers—I assisted Lewis and Bonham in putting on the lid—there were screws in the lid to fasten it down—we drove the screws in as we should nails, not regularly screwed them in—the case was then turned out of the shed, and delivered over to the Dock Company for shipment—the shipping-officer would go on board the ship, and get the mate's receipt for the goods, after they were shipped by the Dock Company—he would deliver the goods at any one of the stations where the ship laid—ships lie at various stations—I cannot men<lb></lb>tion the name of any person to whom it was delivered—I think it was handed over to some of the Dock Company's people, who ought to receive it—sometimes they fetch them away from the shed, but that is not the usual case—whether we put this case outside No. 1 shed, or took it down to No. 3 shed, I cannot say—the Dock Company's people receive it for the purpose of putting it on board, and put it on board when it suits them—I think Lewis and myself were the two that put the case outside No 1. shed, or took it down to No. 3, or wherever it was we took it to—I rather think there was only us two—on returning to No. 1 shed we were all four together, Strickland, Bonham, Lewis, and myself, and I saw in the hands of Strickland a package containing some watches—it was open, but I think it was a brown paper package—I thought at first it contained only four watches, but I found afterwards there were five—there was one gold and two silver watches alike, and two other silver watches I believe somewhat larger than the others—they were looked at, and a consultation was entered into as to the disposal of them—one of us, I cannot say which, proposed to sell them—Strickland said he should like to keep the gold one himself, and also one of the silver ones for his son, and he would make good the difference to us—that was I suppose the value of what they would be sold for—that was not agreed to, and it was determined to sell them—I believe Lewis and myself went that night to a Jew named Moss to ask him if he would purchase them—he lived in Elizabeth-street, No. 3, I think, the corner house—I am not positive whether Lewis had any of the watches with him on that night or not—in consequence of my going there, Moss came to the Dock on the following day—I rather think the watches were left with Strickland that day—some of them were—I am not positive whether Lewis had any then or not in his custody—I think Strickland left them in the place that night—I am not positive, but I believe he left them in his own desk—they were in his desk at one time—he had a desk in No. 1 shed, in the place that was parted off for the searchers—it was the shipping-officer's station entirely—whether all the watches were put in that desk that night or not I cannot say—I saw Lewis with a package two or three days afterwards, which he represented to be the watches, and they appeared to me to be so, there was something like two or three lumps in the package, but I did not see the inside of it—when Moss came down to the Docks I believe we were all four present—the watches were produced to him, I cannot say positively by whom—I believe he offered 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them to the best of my recollection—we did not consent to sell them for that price—we said, who said it I cannot tell, but we agreed if we could get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them to let them go—Moss would not give 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said if we would let him take them away he would see what he could get for them, but we objected to that, and eventually Lewis went to some place with him—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180063"></xptr>
               <p>had not the whole of the watches—I am not positive, but I think he had part—he went with Moss—he told me so three or four days afterwards—he said he took him to a palace of a place, but he went up a court to it, be described it as a very large mansion, but that he would not let him go entirely in; he left him in a place, and he left him so long that he feared whether he should be <hi rend="italic">burked</hi> or not—that was all he told me at that time that I know of, only that Moss's answer was that he would not give the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who at last had the watches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the course of a few days, per<lb></lb>haps nearly a week, Strickland produced I should say 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would give the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deducting his own share—he would take the watches, at all events, he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1 saw him give the other two sovereigns, but how many he gave I could not swear—I believed it to bo 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I never saw the watches again—I cannot say that I knew what had become of them—I heard from Lewis that they had been re-christened and sold among his own friends in the Lale of Wight, by a relation of his in the trade—I do not recollect whether we had anything in the shed after I came back and found Strickland with the watches—it was not an unfrequent occurrence for us to do so—we frequently had eatables and drinkables there—I do not know whether we had or not.</p>

In June, 1842, I was apprentice to Mr. Wales, a tin<lb></lb>plate worker—he was in the habit of attending at the Docks, for the purpose of unsoldering and soldering cases—I quitted his employment on the 2nd of July—about a week or ten days before I left I was sent by him to the West India Dock—I went to shed No. 1—I took my soldering tools with me—I cannot recollect what time in the day it was—I unsol-dered a case, and saw some watches and clocks taken from it—I do not know what day it was—I cannot remember seeing Mr. Scanlan there—I do not remember who was present—I know Strickland was there—I know Lewis and Bonham by sight—I think Bon ham was in the shed that day, and I think Lewis must have been there, for I seldom or ever went to any other shed—I cannot say whether he was there on that very day—there were about four or five there altogether—five with myself, I think—I cannot say whether I saw Turner there on that particular day—I have been him there—I know his face very well—the things were replaced, and I soldered the case up again—before I did so one of them, I cannot re-member which, took up one of the watches, placed it outside his waistcoat-pocket, and said, "That would look very well," or, "That would look well," or something of that sort—after I had soldered the case, Strickland asked me if I would go and get him some shrimps at Blackwall, which is more than half a mile from the Dock, I should think nearly three-quarters—I refused at first—he said he would give me two glasses of brandy and water if I went, and I consented to go—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get them—they were to be live shrimps—I went, but could not get any live shrimps—I did not apply at more than one place—I got whitebait instead—I left my soldering tools in shed No. 1, while I went to Blackwall—I cannot say whether I left all the persons there that were present when I unsoldered the box, but I left some of them there—I saw an examining officer, but I do not know his name—I cannot say whether he staid—I brought the whitebait back to shed No. 1—I should think I was gone nearly three quarters of an hour, or quite.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the detective police. I have been employed since last Feb., by the Custom House, for the purpose of endeavouring to discover some of the watches supposed to have been taken. On the 8th of Aug., in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation I had received, I went to the prisoner Osborne's house—I had seen Mr. Yeoman before I went, he showed me a watch, and told me where he got it from—I took the number and name, and desired him to keep it—Osborne keeps the Crooked Billet on Tower-hill—he was not at home when I first went, but I waited till he came in—I told him I wished to speak with him privately—I went into the bar parlour with him—I then told him I had come upon very unpleasant business, that I had a search warrant, which I showed him—after telling him who and what I was (in fact I gave him my card) I told him I did not want to make things more unpleasant than there was a necessity for, as I understood hit wife was very ill in bed—I then cautioned him as to any answers he might make to the questions I was about to put to him—I said, "I hope you will be very particular in answering the questions I am about to put to you, because it may be of great importance, the answers you give"—I then asked, whether he had not sold a watch about three years ago, to a person named Yeoman, who kept a livery-stable in Lamb's Conduit--street—he said he had—I said, "You have the fellow watch to it in your pocket"—he said he had—I told him I must have it, and he produced it, took it from his guard and gave it to me—I then said, "Now I don't wish, as a matter of course, to go into your wife's bed-room; will you fetch me the gold watch which she has?"—he went and fetched the gold watch which I have produced, and gave it to me—I then said, "I hope you will be able to give me a satisfactory account of how you came into possession of these, watches"—he said, "I bought five of them"—I said, "Whom did you buy them of?"—he said he bought them of a man who occasionally used his house, when he kept the Lamb, in Lamb's Conduit-street—I said, "What is the man's name?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Will you give me a description of him?"—he said he would consider about that to<lb></lb>morrow—I said, "Where are the other two watches?"—he said, "I sold one to my solicitor, Mr. Taylor, No. 2, Castle-street, Holborn"—I said, "Well, where is the other?"—he said he did not think he had more than four—I said, "It is rather an extraordinary thing, is it not, for a publican to buy watches worth between 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not to be able to say whom he bought them of"—he said they were brought to his house to be raffled—he said when he kept the Lamb, he had a great many raffles at bis bouse—I said, "Well, at all events you can give me a description of the man"—he said he dare say he should be able to find him for me in a day or two—I think that was nearly the whole of the conversation at that time—I then left the house, and went down to Strickland's, which is a public-house in Anthony-street, close by Rosemary-lane—I went in front of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180073"></xptr>
               <p>bar, and had a long conversation with him on general topics—nothing con<lb></lb>nected with this—I was in the house about twenty minutes perhaps before I apprehended him—as I was going out at the door with him, he said to his wife, "Send to Osborne to look after the cellars"—I took him to the station, and he was locked up—I immediately went back to Osborne's—he was not at home—I then went back to Strickland's, and found Osborne there and apprehended him—he said Mrs. Strickland had sent for him in a very great hurry—he said nothing more about the watches.</p>

               <p>as to the answers he gave, as it might be important to him—I did not tell him I had come to take him into custody—I told him I had a search war-rant—I told him it was confined to the watches, and then he produced them—I found his initials on the watch he had, and his wife's on the gold watch, but I had told him that was the case, because I had been to Mr. Webster, who put them—I also found Mr. Yeoman's initials on the watch he had—I did know Osborne when he kept the Lamb—I did not suggest to Strickland, when I took him, that perhaps Osborne would be bail for him if he sent for him—I did not mention Osbome's name to him at all—Strickland's house may be about half a mile from Osborne's, or nearly so—the Crooked Billet is at the top of Rosemary-lane, on Tower-hill, and Strickland's house is at the other end of Rosemary-lane—the Crooked Billet is a very large establishment—I believe Osborne has been there twelve months or more—I took him into custody immediately on meeting him again at Strickland's—that was perhaps twenty minutes after I had taken Strickland, for as soon as I left him I went as fast as I could to Oiborne's, and then took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> back to Strickland's, because I expected to find him there, from what I had heard Strickland say to his wife, and from something else that I was in possession of.</p>

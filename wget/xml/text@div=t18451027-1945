                  </hi>. I am a wholesale clothier, in partnership with Henry and Eleazer Moses at Aldgate. The prisoner was some time in our ser<lb></lb>vice as a cutter—on Tuesday morning, the 16th of Sept., I sent for a policeman, and called the prisoner into the counting-house, having had information—after charging him with having given us an address where he was not residing, and to which he made some shuffling answer, I said, "Well, I now want to ask you a more serious thing; what did you do with the twelve or thirteen yards of silk serge that you stole over night?"—he made no reply—I said, "Perhaps I have not been explicit enough; I mean that serge that you sold in Duke-street"—he then made answer, "To tell you the truth I pawned it"—I had made him no threat or pro<lb></lb>mise—I think he mentioned the name of Corden, or some such name, as the pawnbroker's, in Whitechapel—I immediately gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody—he was searched, and taken to the station—I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodging, and saw him find a whole sack full of property belonging to us, and fifty or sixty duplicates—he had given his address after I charged him with giving a false one, and he also gave it at the station—these produced are the articles we found at his lodging—I cannot swear to these shears—here is some woollen cloth and some calico—some of the things have our private mark upon them—the prisoner was em<lb></lb>ployed as a cutter—he had such things as these to cut, and of almost every article given him to cut he has purloined something—I find in his cutting-book an account of things similar to these which he had to cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutors' employ—I know these shears; I believe them to be the property of my employers—I know them by a mark on each side the blade and handle—I have used them on the premises—the prisoner had no authority to take them away for any work to be done at home.</p>

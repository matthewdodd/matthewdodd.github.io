I pursued him from Edward-street, and came up to him in Barfield-street; I did not come up quite to him, he made a step back with the knife; after some little way farther, then Harris turns round to Ryan, and says damn you, why don't you do the bugger; I followed them then up into George-street, where they ran into Kendall's-mews; there Harris stooped down, and pretended to ease himself; and there they were apprehended; the stays are in court.</p>

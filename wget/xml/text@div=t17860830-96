            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For what offence? - For robbing my grounds of a piece of callico; I saw it since at Bow-street, about a month ago; I think this to be the same I lost; because there never was any but that one piece in that state, it was unfinished when it was taken; it was a pattern peculiar to myself, it was without blue or green in it, there was enough to make four gowns.</p>
               <p>Was you present when this prisoner was examined in Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say there?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was she sworn? - She was.</p>
               <p>I submit we cannot hear what she said.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot receive in evidence any thing she has said on oath.</p>
               <p>Philpot. Her examination was taken in writing, she did not sign it, she denied it all; as she was going in the coach, she said she new Venner, and would tell the whole in Bow-street; she said the piece was brought to her in her own dwelling; I made her no promise, she said she bought two pieces of him; I cannot say the sum; I took out the pattern and she said that was it; what she said she gave, was not above a third of the value.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you remember any conversation about a person of the name of Fiddle? - Yes, she was bound over to prosecute this woman; but we cannot find her; the prisoner said she did not know it to be stolen.</p>

               <p>I went to the prisoner's house to get a piece of sattin, to seat a pair of breeches, and whilst I was there, Bet Fiddle came in with a black silk handkerchief, and she asked the daughter to buy a remnant of cotton, and it happened to be callico; she pressed her to buy it, and says the daughter, where did you get it? says she, I bought it of a fair hair'd man, from on board a ship; then the mother came in, and she asked her to buy it, and offered it her worth her money; says the old woman in answer, where did you get it? I have bought it, says she, of a fair hair'd man that duffs on board a ship; it measured nine yards and three quarters, and she asked her, what she asked for it, and she gave her eighteen shillings, and sixpence was spent in a quartern of brandy; she paid seven shillings and sixpence in silver, and half a guinea; I did not drink a spoonful of brandy; I would not give above half a crown, or two shillings and four-pence a yard for it; I thought it a fair price as a smuggled remnant; I never saw her wear it but once; I do not know what became of the rest; I think there might be four yards left, after she had a gown made; one colour is red, and the other purple, and it is grounded with pepper and salt colour; I could tell it without seeing it; I am sure that is the pattern, upon my oath, if I was never to be delivered of what I am carrying; I would have bought it myself if I had the money.</p>

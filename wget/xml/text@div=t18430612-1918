                  </hi>. I live in Waterloo-place, Church-street, Chelsea, and am single. On the 26th of February last, I was present at the parish-church of St. Luke, Chelsea, when my brother, John Richard Cox, was there married to the prisoner—he was a single man—the prisoner was married to him by the name of Elizabeth Burrows—she described herself as single—they were mar<lb></lb>ried by banns, by Mr. Kingsley the clergyman of Chelsea—my brother is now living—he was at the time he was married a servant in Charles-street, Gros<lb></lb>venor-square—I had seen the prisoner before that day, but I had no acquaint<lb></lb>ance with her—I have heard she had been a nurse-maid at Mrs. Pugh's, in Regent-street—when they were married they went home to No. 17, Manor-street, King's-road, Chelsea—I went and remained there that day, but did not stay that night—they had apartments there—I saw them there the next morn<lb></lb>ing—my brother was not out of a situation then—he returned to his situation the next morning, and the prisoner stopped at home at Manor-street—my brother was porter at a large milliner's—he slept there and had charge of the premies at night.</p>

I am at present out of employ—on Tuesday, the 30th of May, I was at the parish church of St. Mary Abbot's, Kensing<lb></lb>ton—that is the name of the parish as it was taken down by the deputy-registrar, who granted me the license—I left the license at the church—the clerk of the parish is not here—I married the prisoner there—I was married</p>

               <p>in the name of Arthur Williams, and she in the name of Elizabeth Eleanore Burrows—I had been acquainted with her about nine months—about three months before this she told me that the had been to Henley-on-Thames, and had gone through a kind of ceremony in a private house where her aunt and another person was present and no more, independent of the person who re<lb></lb>presented himself as a clergyman, and the man named Cox who represented himself as her husband—she said there was nothing took place—she declared to me over and over again that there was no marriage ceremony repeated, but a ring placed on her finger, which she thought was a joke, and she instantly threw it in the fire—she stated nothing else that I am aware of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you seen her in company with the man that she described herself to have gone through this ceremony of the ring with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, but on one occasion, when I visited her at No. 17, Manor-street—before we were married a person came in and described himself to be her husband—but she met me the same evening and declared to me that the ceremony that was gone through was what I have described, and on the faith of that I kept com<lb></lb>pany with her—she declared that there had only been the ceremony of the ring and that had taken place at Henley-upon-Thames—she absconded from me the day week after our marriage—I had been living in the same house with her up to that time—I produce a certificate of the marriage—I have not examined it with the register—I was present when it was drawn in the vestry, and I have not the smallest doubt of its being faithfully copied—I am acquainted with the parish—it is the parish church where people go on Sundays—I have heard it called by the name of St. Mary Abbot's, Kensington.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Windsor-street, Bermondsey. On Christmas eve about half-past 11 o'clock, I was in Leadenhall market—I had an apron on with a pocket in it on the right-hand side, containing a purse with 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—there was a very great crowd—the prisoner was on my right, and his woman or wife on my left—I had my hand in my pocket and my purse was there—the prisoner got his left hand under my pocket, and his right was digging into my pocket to get the purse out—my pocket opens outside—he caught hold of the mouth of it and I missed my purse—I found my pocket torn—there was a hole at the bottom of it which was not there before—I caught hold of the prisoner's left hand before it left my pocket but the purse was gone—the woman said that it was not her husband who did it and <hi rend="italic">blowed me up</hi> all the way to the station-house—I have not found my purse—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I had felt my purse five minutes before—it was in my hand in my pocket, but I had taken my hand away from my pocket because the crowd was too tight for me to keep it there, as one party was going through one way and one another way—this was a piece of a dress which I was using as an apron—the mouth of the pocket opened outside the apron, but the pocket was inside—the prisoner and his wife were going in the same direction as I was—I held the prisoner by the collar two or three minutes till a policeman came up—he declared that he had not got it, and that he</p>

               <p>and his wife were going to market for a piece of pork for their Christmas dinner—I was alone—I have been a widow 12 years, and take in washing and go out washing—this was an old black leather glove made into a purse with a piece of white tape through it—there was no hole in my pocket till the prisoner made it—the apron was tied to my waist, and hung down in front of my dress.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 570). I was in Leadenhall market, and saw the prosecutrix holding the prisoner by the collar—she said, "This man has picked my pocket"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence, a pipe, some tobacco, and a latch key—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he gave me his right address—the female was searched by the female searcher—nothing was found on her, and she was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

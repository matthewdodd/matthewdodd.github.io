               <p>Q. Did you observe him go from your house. - A. Yes, about half past nine at night he came through the door of the shop to go out; I followed him to a wine vault the corner of New street, Covent Garden; I saw him come out again; I followed him down St. Martin's lane, down Bedfordbury; I had a person with me; I sent the person up one of the courts, and I met the prisoner in a dark passage; I touched his pockets, I was sure he had the property; I took him by his coat and took him into the wine vaults in Chandos street; there were two young men present; I took five pair of shoes from behind his waistcoat, about his body, and one pair of soles. The watchman came, I sent the person that was watching with me to Bow street for an officer; the officer took from him three pair of shoes and one pair of boots; he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>

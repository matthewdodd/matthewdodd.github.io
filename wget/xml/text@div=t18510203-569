                  </hi>. I am a cooper, and live at Garlick-hill. On 1st Feb. I was in Aldgate coming home—I met the prisoner—he asked me if I wanted any tobacco—I told him no—he then said he and his mate were just come on shore, and they were <hi rend="italic">drawed up</hi> for money, and had got some articles they had brought with them, I think he said from China—he asked me to go with him a few doors—I went to the Hope public-house, in Jewry-street, he took me in a parlour—I saw his mate there,</p>

               <p>who he told to show me the articles—the other man produced a shawl—I told him I did not want it—the prisoner had then gone out, but he came in again, and asked his mate to show me some waistcoat-pieces—he showed me two pieces, which he said was enough to make four waist-coats—the prisoner said one was silk velvet, the other was satin—they both said that, and they said they were worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they had brought them home with them from China—they asked 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I said I did not want them, and was coming away, when the prisoner said I should have them for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would give them 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I took them, and gave the other man a half-sovereign, which he took in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence—I went away with the waistcoat-pieces—I was induced to give the half-sovereign for the two pieces because I thought they were what they represented them to be, silk velvet and satin—before I left, they asked me to treat them with two glasses of gin-and-water, which I declined—when I left, I had some misgivings, and showed the waistcoat-pieces to a tailor, and in consequence of what he said I went in search of the prisoner—I found him at the corner of George-street, Minories, looking in a shop-window—I went to him and told him I would give him in charge for defrauding me of my money—he said he had not seen me—while we were talking, a policeman came, and I gave him in charge—I handed the waistcoat-pieces to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a silk and velvet weaver in Spital<lb></lb>fields for nineteen years—I am well acquainted with silk and velvet—this figured piece is embossed cotton velvet, and is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it might make a waistcoat, but it is not the length we should cut—this satin is a lavatina, a very inferior description; it is shot with silk; it is barely half silk; it is worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard; here is not quite three-quarters of a yard; it would only be worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if it were three-quarters; it is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in its present state; part of this must be wasted—it would not make a man a waistcoat at all—they are British manufacture.</p>

I was on duty in George-street, Minories on 1st Feb.—Allen said, "I give this man in charge for robbing me of money, selling me these articles, representing them to be what they are not"—he said he had seen the prosecutor, and asked him to come and look at some handkerchiefs, and when he went he did not find the man he expected to find, but another man—that he went out to look for him, and while he was gone, the prosecutor bought these pieces, of the man that was there, who he knew nothing about.</p>

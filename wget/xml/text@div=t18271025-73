            . I am a cordwainer, and live next door to Marchant. On the 8th of October, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, my wife alarmed me, and I heard a noise in the back premises; I looked out of the window, and heard somebody trying to get up some place - I heard the noise of somebody getting up; I looked towards Marchant's yard, and asked who was there, but received no answer; I asked again, but got no answer; I presently saw a man getting up Marchant's water cistern; I asked what business he had there; he said he was looking after his dog; I told him that was not the place to look after his dog, he ought to go into the front place to look for it; he then got from the cistern to the tiles; he said his dog cost him half a guinea, and he would be d-d if he would not have it; he walked across the tiles, and I saw him trying to get into my house; I ran down stairs to the street door; somebody said he had fallen into the water-butt - I went towards the yard door, and met him in the passage - it was the prisoner; I laid hold of his collar; he asked me to let him go; I said he should not till he had got the dog he was looking after; I took him to the street door, he said, "Let me go, can't you?" I said, "No, not till you have got your dog;" I called Dupuis to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. It was quite dark? A. Yes; I saw no dog - I did not look into any other yard.</p>
               <p>Q. After you called to him he came towards you? A. He came on the tiles; he would have gone into Marchant's yard again if he could; I was on the second floor; he came into my yard, and into my passage.</p>

            . I live next door to Marchant. On the 8th of October I was standing three doors from his house; his son came out, and complained of the house being robbed; I ran into the house, through the passage, and saw the prisoner on the party wall, in the act of dropping into my yard - I ran round to my own door, and saw Richards, my lodger, in the passage with the prisoner; I caught hold of him, and found this cash-box concealed up his back -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250042"></xptr>- I said, "What have you got there?" he said "Nothing."

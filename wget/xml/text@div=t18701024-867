                  </hi>. I was formerly in the Metropolitan Police, and and now frequently employed as a detective by the Mint—on 17th September, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I went, with nine officers, to 4, Orchard Terrace, Battereea—the street-door, which was shut, was forced open by Miller—he at once entered, and proceeded up stairs, to a sort of ante room, on the middle landing, the door of which was opened and immediately closed—it was forced open by Miller, and we found the four prisoners in the room; Sarah Taylor, who was standing close to a table, seized this pair of iron clams, in which was this mould, with two half-crowns in it—it was so hot I could not hold it—after some trouble I got it from her hand; but not till she broke it—on the table was this file, with white metal in its teeth, and a galvanic battery rod, with the screw detatched, and near it also a paper band corresponding in size to the mould, with plaster sticking to it—they all resisted, except Mattock, who stood still and seemed confounded—this ladle, containing white metal, nearly fluid, was on the grate, and on a trivet, hanging on the grate, was a double plaster of Pahs mould for making half-crowns, which Copeland seized, and she and Miller had a struggle—it had not been used; it was hot, and put there to dry—I found several finger-stalls for holding the hot moulds, and Inspector Aspenshaw handed me two good half-crowns, from which the mould appears to have been made—this black bag, containing two galvanic battery jars and a porous pot, were near the table—the pot is used for immersing coins in the solution—I also found this board, which is used for drying the coins; placing them on a flat sur<lb></lb>face causes them to be discoloured; but by placing them on these nails, a very small portion touches the flat surface; I also found plaster of Paris, emery powder, white sand, and all the implements necessary for making coating, and colouring coin—as we went in a cab Copeland said "I hope you won't hurt this young woman (Mattock), she knows nothing about it; I cannot say so of myself"—Alfred Taylor said "I" or "We were going out, when we used up all the metal".</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN LORD</hi>. I live in Surrey Villas, Camberwell New-road, in the parish of Camberwell. On Saturday morning, 5th Oct., in consequence of infor<lb></lb>mation, I came down to my back-parlour about eight o'clock, and found the window open, and the forks and spoons were gone—they were mine, and were usually kept in the cupboard in the room—the prisoner was in my service seven or eight years, and for a short time since I have been in that house—he was scarcely doing anything there but looking after the children, and working a little in the garden—that back-parlour window has box shutters inside which lift up; a board goes under the bottom one, which keeps it up, and the sash is fastened by a hasp—it was the duty of one of the servants to fasten that sash—if the sash were open any one could, from the outside, dis<lb></lb>place the wooden fastening and get in—I believe the sash was usually fastened at night—the prisoner entered my service in Van Dieman's Land; he had been a convict.</p>

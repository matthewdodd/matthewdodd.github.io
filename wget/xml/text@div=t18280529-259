               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. On Thursday last, about one o'clock in the day, I was near <placeName id="t18280529-259-crimeloc1424">Holborn-hill</placeName>

            . I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief, and give it to another boy, who ran down Field-lane with it - it was a yellow handkerchief, and I think had some white spots on it; I do not think there was any red or blue in it - I did not tell Mr. Taylor sooner, because I thought they would beat me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. My handkerchief was yellow, with white birds' eyes on it; I have not seen it since; this little boy seemed very much frightened.</p>

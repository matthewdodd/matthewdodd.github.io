                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Post Office. On 13th Aug. I made up this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is addressed to Mr. Charles Gal<lb></lb>loway, King's Head Hotel, Rhys—I inclosed a sovereign in it, in a card—I had previously marked it—I sealed the letter, and posted it in the hall of the General Post Office, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I gave it to Mr. Dixon, who was at the window—I had previously shown it to Mr. Forbes—on the following morning, in consequence of some information I received, I searched for that letter in the circulation department—I found it at the Chester division—it had then been sorted—it was in the same state it is now, with a rent in the corner—there is a slight fracture by the side of the wax, but not an opening—the letter has never been opened—the sove<lb></lb>reign was not in it—besides sorting for divisions, there is also a sorting for particular boxes—this letter had not been sorted into the boxes when I found it—I do not know that it had been sorted for the divisions—when I first received information I saw a number of letters for the division, and I presumed it was there—I found it at the division—it could not have got where 1 found it unless it had undergone the process of divisional sorting—</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in the office of Mr. Hill, the Secretary to the Post Office. On the 4th of this month I opened this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the Post Office, it contained a sovereign—I paid particular attention to it, because I had never seen a test sovereign before, and I remember the marks on it—it is an anonymous letter, addressed to the Postmaster General—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Honourable Sir,—T enclose you the marked sovereign that Clark is charged with on 14th Aug. It is a check on my conscience to have the innocent suffer for the guilty.")</p>

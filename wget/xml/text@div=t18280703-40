On the 19th of January, about half-past eight o'clock, I gave him a basket, containing the articles stated in the indictment -(enumerating them) I gave it to him at No. 90, Lower Thames-street, to take to our house in North-street, Limehouse; I saw them at Lambeth-street Office next morning, in the same basket, and was quite sure of them; they were dirty things to be washed.

            . I am a labourer in the London Docks; in January last I lived in the Commercial-road. on the 19th of January, about nine o'clock at night, I was in North-street, Limehouse, waiting for a young man; the watchman was calling nine o'clock - I heard somebody cry Stop thief! and saw the prisoner at the bar run by me, with a basket under his arm; he was alone - I went after him, keeping very close to him, and about one hundred yards on, when he found I was very close behind him, he chucked the basket from under his arm; I let the basket lay on the ground, and kept in pursuit; I ran as far as Trafalgar-square, Stepney, and as he turned round I caught him, without losing sight of him - he had run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030035"></xptr>about two hundred yards altogether; I brought him back in the way he had run, and met a boy who lived at a public-house - he had picked up the basket, and was bringing it after us; it was him who had been calling Stop thief! the prisoner said nothing, but abused me very much - my friend, whom I was waiting for, heard me crying Stop thief! and followed; he assisted me in conveying him to Mile-end watch-house; he gave no account how he came by the basket: I left it at the watch-house with him. I then met Slater - he stated what he had lost; I took him to the watch-house, and he spoke to the basket; Mrs. Slater claimed the articles at the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I ran by you why did you not stop me? A. I was standing on the pavement, and he was in the road - I was not near enough to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said at the watch-house that you were down another street at the time? A. I was down no street - I stood at the top; there is a watch-box at the corner, and the watchman went out to cry nine o'clock: I never lost sight of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw Slater about half an hour after you took the prisoner? A. Yes - he was all over mud, his face and clothes, and every thing, and his fingers cut; the basket was all over mud, and the handles broken, as if it had been pulled to pieces; the prisoner's hands were dirty, and his fingers cut.</p>
               <p>MRS SLATER. The basket and property were delivered up to me afterwards, and are not here; I am quite sure they were the same - the basket, when I saw it, was broken all to pieces, and all muddy; the things in it were also muddy - they were worth 10s.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. The prisoner was put into our lock-up room at Lambeth-street after he was committed, and somehow or other he broke the door open and got out; I found him in custody at Lynn, in Norfolk, on another charge, and brought him to town last Friday evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to the Ben Johnson public-house, to have a pint of beer; when I came out I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw a man come from the street opposite - I pursued him, calling Stop thief! but it being dark I could not see him; the people, seeing me running, stopped me; I said I was not the person, and before this young man could see me, he said, "Have you got him?" and before he could see me he said, "Oh! that is the young man;" plenty of people, as we went to the watch-house, said I was not the young man; Slater said at the office that he was so intoxicated he could not tell whether he fell down or not.</p>

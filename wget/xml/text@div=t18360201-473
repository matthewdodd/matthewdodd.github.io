The prisoner, who was quite a stranger, came to my shop on the 16th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, about half-past eleven o'clock—he asked the price of some potatoes—I said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per cwt.—he asked me if I could let the boy take a sack to a baker's, in Brick-lane—I said I had some coals to send out first—when my boy came back I put 2 cwt. of potatoes in the baker's sack, which the prisoner had brought—I told the boy, in the presence of the prisoner, (who had come back,) not to leave the potatoes without 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was the price—he returned in half an hour, and me he had given the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with the prosecutor. I recollect the prisoner coming to his shop—my master sent me out with some potatoes—he told me to bring back 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took them, and followed the prisoner to St. John's-road—he stopped three doors from Mr. Harnor's and took them into the shop, and came out—I asked him for the money—he said he was coming for some more, and would pay me for them—as we came along he asked me if I would have a drop of beer—I said, yes—we went into a public-house and had some—he went into the yard—he came in, and then we came out again, and as he was coming along he tried to run down Cherry-tree-alley—I ran after him and told him to come back, or give me the money—he would not—he went on into Bunhill-row—I knocked at the station-house door, and gave charge of him.</p>

               <p>What is the prisoner? - A hair-dresser; I lost five books, here is a list of them; the first is a quarto Queen Elizabeth's Bible, the next is a large folio latin book, the next is the first volume of Seymour's Survey of London, the next is a folio Latin Bible, and the next is a Geographical Dictionary; on the 11th of November the prisoner came into the shop, and sat down on the seat, and the books were behind him, the two first were taken before; I saw him put his hands behind him, and put one of the books down, it was the first volume of Seymour's Survey of London in folio; I was on one side of the counter and he on the other, and he put it down by the side of him, and it was heavier than he thought, and there was a little washing tub just there, and it rolled the tub from one side the shop to the other; he sat a good bit after that, he said the watch had gone ten, and he said, I will go get me a pint of beer, and he run out of the shop immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he carry any thing with him? - He picked the book up, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he carry any thing with him out of the shop? - He took that book out of the shop then.</p>
               <p>You saw him? - I did not see him carry it away, I saw him pick it up, and take it out of the window, but I did not see him take it out of the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the book missing when he was gone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of the book after? - I never knew that, he came home at twelve o'clock, I let him in.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - Not a word, my clothes were off; besides, I did not think of saying any thing to him, nor would if it was to do again, as I was by myself.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him the next morning? - I never saw him from that time till Thursday night; on Thursday night, between six and seven, he came into the shop, and sat down, then I saw him take the books; I said nothing to him about the other book, I was by myself, nor I should not; I saw him take a Latin Bible and Geographical Dictionary, all folio; he took them in the same way.</p>
               <p>Did he go out of the shop? - Yes, he did, and I ran after him, and cried Stop thief! all the way down Shug-lane; it was opera night, and the coaches were so thick I missed him; about one o'clock in the morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040023"></xptr> he came home, and I apprehended him; he said nothing then, but used a great deal of abrupt language at the watch-house; he had lodged with me five or six weeks, and never paid me any thing; I had seen him before running about.</p>

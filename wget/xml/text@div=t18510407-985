                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Ilford. On 19th March, in conse<lb></lb>quence of something I heard, I went to the station—I found a truss of hay there, which I could swear was mine—I then examined my premises, and traced some hay from the stable in my yard, down Great Ilford-lane, I should think it might be a hundred rods, till I came to Mr. Hunsden's gate, where it had been dropped; there was a good deal of hay—Dennis has been in my service from a child almost—I cannot say whether he left me any time; he has been with me almost all his life—neither he nor Page had any business to take my hay—the place where it appeared to have come from was not locked.</p>

PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe Dennis has been in your employ for fifteen years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say bow long; he came to me very young—he has lived in the neighbourhood all his life, and his family—he was a respectable honest man, as far as I know—he has not been in my service while he has been out on bail—the stable was kept unlocked—I was not able to say, on looking at it, how much hay had been removed—I found where one truss had been laid down in the lane, near a gate; another truss of mine was found under Mr. Green's corn<lb></lb>stack, the same morning—Mr. Green's corn-stack is fifty rods from where there had been a truss lying—Dennis lives close by me—in his coming from the Rabbits to where he lives, he could pass by the gate where the truss of hay had been lying, but it would not be the nearest way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 162). I was on duty in Romford-road, on the night of 18th Feb.—I saw the prisoners near the Rabbits, at Ilford—I followed them across the field—they went together in a direction</p>

               <p>towards Mr. Parsons's premises—going along Great Ilford-lane it turns, and I lost sight of them—I then went to Little Ilford-lane, and saw them again together, about two hundred yards from Mr. Parson's premises—Dennis was carrying a truss of hay—it was about twelve, or half-past twelve o'clock—I went round the lane to a shed in the Rabbits' yard—they brought the truss of hay to the shed I was in—they did not see me at all—it was a beautiful moonlight night—Dennis put the hay into the shed—I turned my light on, and asked him where he got it—he said he picked it up in Little Ilford-lane—Page said he would stand some beer if I would let him go—Page ran away—I took Dennis to the station—I asked him what made him bring the hay there—he said if there were no owner for it Mr. Wood would give him some beer for it w the morning—I afterwards went to Page's house, and took him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

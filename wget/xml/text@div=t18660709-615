My dear Sir,—I can assure you I am very thankful to you for answering my letter so quickly. I have enclosed the bill, signed. I hope you will let me have the money by return of post, if possible"—I have never received one farthing on that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I am at this moment being sued upon that bill.</p>

               <p>saw Pugh—I went with him to get it discounted—Pugh did not put his name on it—it was discounted by a man named Morris, of Regent Street—I don't know what Morris is—it was not Mr. Morris the attorney—I also raised money through a Mr. Hyman Davis, of Bruton Street, Bond Street—I raised 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through him, upon three or four acceptances, at several times—that was at the end of 1864 and the beginning of 1865—September or October, 1865, I think was the last—there were three or four bills—I don't know exactly the number—the amount was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Davis—I don't know where he got them dis<lb></lb>counted—I believe he was the principal, he always gave me the money, I am not sure, but I believe he was—he charged me 20 per cent. for three months, not 50—I have also employed Baxter &amp; Co.—they carry on busi<lb></lb>ness in a turning out of Regent Street (I forget the name), St. James's Street, I think—I began to have transactions with them, I think, in January or February this year—they did not get me any money—I was only negotiating with them—I asked them to get me 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they told me they were agents, they would try and get me the money—I don't know how long they were trying to get the money—they had the bills some time in their hands—there were two bills, I think two 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—I have not tried any other persons since—I tried another person before, Percy, of Craig's Court, in the beginning of 1865—I gave him an acceptance—I think the first was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he discounted it himself—I think he calls it a loan agency—he discounted two or three bills—those bills were running when I applied to the prisoner; I think between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no transaction with a person named Thornton—I raised money on one bill from a man named Gorrar—when I applied to the prisoner in November I had not 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of acceptances out; I had about 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got them discounted—they have been paid since—they are all paid—they were paid this year—not after I had instituted this prosecution—arrange<lb></lb>ments were made to pay them before—I believe I am right in saying that some of them were paid before—they were all to be paid before, and all have been paid—it was not a part of the arrangement that my acceptances and liabilities should be taken up if I persisted in this prosecution—there is no reason for-saying that—I did not see the prisoner until about six weeks after I had written to him—I believe the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was dated the same day as the letter, 7th November—I believe the date is the prisoner's writing—I think it was sent to me ready drawn, but I won't be sure—I suppose it arrived on the 7th—I cannot recollect the day—there are two or three deliveries a day at Aldershot—I cannot recollect at what time in the day I sent the letter off—he answered my first letter—I must have sent him a letter before this one—I cannot find his answer—I have tried to do so when I was sued for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I do not remember his saying in that letter, "I can get you a bill discounted for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you will send your acceptance"—he did not say so; as far as I remember, he said he enclosed the bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I accepted it he would give or send me the money for it; I believe those were the words—if he had sent me the money short of discount it was no business of mine where he got it—I should have written to acknowledge it—I should have said nothing more—I think I had a reply to this letter of 7th November a few days after—I can't say for certain how many days; I think two or three days—I have not got any letter except the first and second—I can't be certain whether I got one or two letters before 15th November—I can't say how many letters I received from him, three or four I think about November—I have</p>

               <p>the last letter I received from him—that was after I had found out he had negotiated the bill—that was in February, I think—when I wrote in November, asking for the money by return of post, he answered in a few days that he could not advance me money upon so large an acceptance—it was not that he could not get me the money—on 15th November I received a letter from him stating that I had doubtless been daily expecting to hear from him with reference to my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. acceptance—he did not say, "Much greater difficulty exists than I anticipated when I first addressed you. You are, I have ascertained, involved with Mr. C., and Thornton and Co. refuse to touch your paper upon any terms. There is, however, a channel in the City, and I am now waiting the result of their inquiries of your agents, Messrs. Bryce and Bowstead. If their reply is favourable I believe the bill will be done. I hope to be able to write more satisfactorily in a few days."—I got no letter to that effect about 15th November—I have not the least idea who the Mr. C. is that you allude to—I have heard of Mr. Calisher—I never had any transaction with him—I do not know Thornton and Co.—Bryce and Bowstead are army agents—I had not referred the prisoner to them in any way—he could ascertain that they were my agents by looking at the <hi rend="italic">Army List</hi>—I did not on 20th November receive a letter to this effect: "No direct information can, it appears, be obtained from Messrs. Bryce and Co., but an offer is made to the following effect: namely, if you are disposed to allow your acceptance for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to remain as a collateral security, the party I alluded to in my letter of the 15th will discount two bills for you of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each."—I believe I sent him a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about 22nd November—I don't know the exact date—that was in consequence of a letter I got from him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "November 22nd.

Put on, 'To be called for,' and the other money, if you can get it, please send to Aldershot."—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the bill I enclosed him on 22nd November—there were two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—I cannot tell which was the one I enclosed in that letter—this is dated 21st November—I think I was at the Norfolk Square Hotel, Paddington, about that time—I don't think I found a letter for me there, because I sent a mes<lb></lb>senger to his house—I did not get a letter containing a cheque of a Mr. Lyon for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe not—I never remember receiving a cheque (<hi rend="italic">looking at a cheque</hi>)—I never remember having this—I never remember seeing that cheque—I sent a porter with a letter to the prisoner, asking if he could let me have the money he had promised—I won't be certain whether 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank notes was sent back by the porter or by post—I received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him in bank notes—that was after I had sent him this bill on the 22nd—he had then two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills of mine—I do not remember the day I sent him the first 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I don't remember how long it was before this one—I know he had two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills of mine in his possession—this one was paid by my agents—I have not stated that the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills were in substitution for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—it is not so—I sent him two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills, as he asked me, and he asked me at the same time to allow him to keep the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill as a collateral security—he asked me that by letter, a few days before 22nd November, when he told me he could not cash the large amount—I think it was after I sent him the two bills for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the letter I sent before getting the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I shall be happy to allow my first bill to remain in your hands. When can you let me have the money for the enclosed bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?

Can you name a day to see me at the Queen's Hotel, North Camp? Say Thursday next, and name hour if you can. Please send or bring the rest of the money."—I never saw him at Aldershot—when I saw him at his own house he said he could not let me have the money, because I had so many bills out—when these bills became due I did not find out that they were in the hands of Mr. Lyon—I don't know that he took up one—he presented one at Cox's—that is the only one I know about—I don't know whether this bill of 21st November was taken up at Cox's or not—one 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was paid at Cox's, and only one—I asked him at his house what he was going to do—he did not tell me the bill was coming due, and I should have to pay it or he must take it up—we arranged to renew—he had given me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we arranged to renew a bill for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being the interest on the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for another three months—he did not arrange that I should give two fresh acceptances—I signed an acceptance, which I thought was for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it turns out that he afterwards filled it in for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not give him two other bills for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, not renewals—they were for other money—I did give him two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills at the Great Western Hotel, Paddington—that was about February, I think—when I signed those other two I renewed one bill for the money I had had—I had had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him to renew that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill upon which I had got the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was to have a fresh bill for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him one for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a renewal, and two for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was to get one cashed by a man named Gorrar if he could, and the other was to be kept as a collateral security, but which he negotiated, and I got sued for—I gave him three acceptances—one was to be for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it turned out not to be 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe there are three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills now due—I have not seen the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill since I gave the acceptance—I gave him 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for renewing the bill upon which I had got the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him a cheque on Cox's—he did not say that he would have to contribute 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill upon which I had got the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was renewed—I renewed it, as I thought, for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would cancel the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill if I would give him a bill for 601. for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I got. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you have paid this man 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. clear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very well, but you see these bills would have been retired but for this man's conduct—if you mix them all together it is so—he demanded these bills from me about a fortnight or a month after they became due, after the first bill of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. became due—he gave me into custody for stealing the bill of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he got 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is his receipt—the prosecutor also, Mr. Breakspear, came down and demanded the bills from me, and I promised to return them to him, and should have done so—it was not possible for me to have returned them—everybody knows the state of matters on 22nd February, I had 4100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills, and could not get a shilling on them—I had arrangements made for returning them—they would have been returned but for Potts's conduct—he has ruined me, unquestionably—he gave me into custody for a bill which he got the value for—Mr. Morris, the attorney for Mr. Breakspear, also demanded the bills from me, and I don't know that I had any right to give them up—even now there is 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Potts's bills not paid.</p>

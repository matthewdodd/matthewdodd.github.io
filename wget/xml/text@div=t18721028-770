                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the George and Dragon, High Street, Vauxhall—on Tuesday, 10th September, about quarter to 4, I served the prisoner with a glass of beer—he asked if I would give him change for a half-sovereign which he gave me—I suspected it, tried it, and took it to my mistress, and when I came back the prisoner was gone—I marked it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was sent for to the Vauxhall Tavern the same afternoon—I went into a room there where there were three or four men, one of whom was the prisoner—he was not pointed out to me—I did not express a doubt about his being the man; I said I was certain it was him, but he had a different necktie on—the prisoner did not ask me whether he was wearing the same necktie—he asked me whether it was the same watch-chain, but he had none at all then—he had one when he came to me—Reynolds did not ask me anything about the chain, it was the sergeant—nothing was said about it at the Vauxhall Tavern, but there was a discussion at the station about his indentity—I said at the tavern that the prisoner had a coloured tie on when he came to me, and he had a black one afterwards—I am sure it was at quarter to 4, and I was at the Vauxhall Tavern near upon 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Somebody fetched me to the Vauxhall Tavern—it is about ten minutes' walk, or hardly that if you walk quickly—notwithstanding the different colour of the necktie, I have not the least doubt about his being the man who gave the half-sovereign.</p>

               <p>"No"—said "Of course, you know it is bad—he said "No"—I said "How did you come by it?"—he said that he had got it in change for a sovereign—I said "Where?"—he said "I don't know"—I gave him in custody with the coin—this was at 4.30—he was put in the public parlour, and Ibbetson came to see him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not aware whether I stated the time before the Magistrate—I heard Yeoman give her evidence at the Police Court—I cannot say whether she said that the prisoner came to the house at 3.45—my evidence was read over to me; it was correct, and I signed it, and she did the same—I cannot swear to the time she gave—I told the prisoner I would give him in custody—he made no disturbance or attempt to get away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Isaac Anderton, a grocer in Whitechapel-road. On Thursday, the 24th of November, I was directed to take a truck, containing a half-hundred weight of coffee to Mrs. Tipples, in King-street, Brick-lane—on my way I went to Mr. Owen, in Montague-street, and left a box of candles—Mrs. Owen gave four sovereigns to Hagen, her boy, and told him and me to go to public-house to get change for one of them—we went to the Black Lion in that street, and got one of them changed, and the boy paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the box of candles—I had left the truck at Mrs. Owen's door while I went for the change—after Hagen paid me I took out another bill for Tipples, and showed it to him, and said I was going to Mrs. Tipples with the coffee—the prisoner was present, and left the tap-room directly—and went out, and two or three minutes after we went out I saw him take the coffee off the truck, put it on the rail of the truck, then put it on his shoulder and walk off with it—it was twelve or sixteen yards from the public-house—I ran after him, and caught him turning the corner into Brick-lane—I pulled it off his back, and told him it was mine—he said a man in a surtout coat and white apron gave him sixpence to carry it to Mrs. Tipples—I took the coffee</p>

               <p>back to the truck, and he followed me back—I told him to go on, I did not want him—he would not go on—I said I would give him in charge if he did not—he said I might if I liked—I went into Mrs. Owen's house again, leaving an old man with the truck; and when I came out the prisoner was at the door—I ran up New Montague-street after a policeman, and then he walked away—the policeman ran after him, and when he saw the policeman he ran away—we lost sight of him for four or five minutes, and found him in the George public-house, in Pelham-street he had thrown his paper cap under the table, which he had on when I first saw him, and tied a handkerchief on his head—I gave him in charge—he then pulled his handkerchief off—the policeman picked up his paper cap, and he put it on his head.</p>

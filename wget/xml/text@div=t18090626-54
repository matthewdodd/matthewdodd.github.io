The prisoner was a lodger of mine from the hour of six in the afternoon of the 30th of May, till the hour of the night, or the morning he went off.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come - A. Between the hours of five and six; I was not there when he came; I saw him there about nine o'clock, when I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about the lodging - A. My wife gave him no final answer till I came home; he said he had come from a long voyage. He was to bring his things from out of the dock.</p>
               <p>Q. He proposed to lodge with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he propose to go up to any room for his lodging - A. No; for the first night, as there was no room up stairs, he slept in the kitchen, down stairs, for that night only, as there was no bed ready.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning - A. Before four o'clock. I perceived the door open from between the curtains at the bed foot; then I got up: I said to my wife, both the doors are open; I went and shut the door, I looked in the bed where he slept; I found he had left the bed, and his shoes and stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bed shew that somebody had slept in it that night - A. Yes; it laid open, and he was gone, and his old shoes and stockings lay on the floor by the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he brought any of his things with him at the time that he took possession - A. No. He accosted a porter, he told him he would give him five shillings to bring his things the next morning. He had nothing with him but what he had on him. When I found he was gone I took hold of my breeches which I had left on the table, I found my watch was gone, and my hat from off the same table; my wife got out of bed and missed the pile of clean linen that had been ironed on that day, they were on a table in the kitchen, where he slept, and the shoes and two waistcoats, a pocket handkerchief, and neckcloth; they were clean and ironed; also there was a bundle in a handkerchief that belonged to an Italian, that handkerchief was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been delivered by the Italian to your wife to wash - A. Yes; in the afternoon of the over day, when he came. Among the other things which were in the kitchen four of my shirts lay there, and several other things besides; the rest belonged to other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260047"></xptr>people; the two waistcoats and the shoes belonged to a lodger in the house, I was accountable for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any shoes - A. One pair which hung on a nail, close by where he slept, and the silk hat was on the top of my clothes, the first thing by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of your watch - A. The watch cost seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. To you - A. Not to me; it cost me five.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the house secured when you went to bed - A. The door was locked; I locked the door, and took the key out of the back door that he passed through, and it was bolted.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the rest of the house with respect to the fastenings - A. There were no fastenings on the glass door, between the kitchen and the parlour; the outer doors were both locked; the front door was locked and barred; by that reason I suppose he went out of of the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any fastenings broken - A. No. The first thing I did I applied the key to the lock; the key traversed the lock the same as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. When you locked the door the night before are you sure that you applied the bolt - A. I locked the door as I did nights before, as I always do, and took the key out, and then the bolts went in easy; I hung the key up in its place on the mantle shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the prisoner any where in the house - A. No; he was gone. The rest of the lodgers were within. I enquired after him at the Kettle Drum, in Ratcliffe Highway, there I heard his character in full length.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with him there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not want to hear his character - A. About seven o'clock in the morning I heard of his being seen in Tooley-street with two white bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him yourself - A. No; I had been after him every day. On the Saturday following, about nine o'clock at night, I met him by Salt-petre-bank, in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was the robbery on - A. The Wednesday morning I missed him; this was Saturday evening, June the 3d, I met him in Rosemary-lane; I knew him; he passed by; I turned round and he turned round, he crossed the lane three time, I following of him, that I might be sure he was the same man; he had the same hand in his pocket: I saw my hat on his head; he made a stand by a public house door, I came up to him, spoke to him, and collared him, and took my hat from off his head; he said he would go along with me any where, where I pleased very well, said I, step into here; he went into the public house, the first man I saw there was Densy, I asked his assistance; he knew I had been robbed; I asked him to go for an officer for me, he told me, no. Upon that the prisoner got obstreperous, Densy said let him go, and get a proper officer and take him. Between the prisoner and the landlord of the house I was turned out of the house, he bit me here in the hand, here is the incision of his teeth now in my hand; by him and by the mob I was like to be torn in pieces; in the hustle I lost the hat off my head, but kept hold of the hat I took off the prisoner's head. He made his escape from me then; the next morning I called at Mr. Buston's to know whether I could get any account of my hat; I got no information; he said he would charge me with an officer for disturbing his house. I called again in the afternoon, the landlord very politely gave me the hat out of a closet by the bar. On the 8th of June, in the morning, I got fresh scent of the prisoner; he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the prisoner at the bar is the same man that came to lodge with you, and served you so as you have stated - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered any of the linen - A. No; he had one of the shirts on on Saturday; as I had hold of him by the collar, the shirt was open behind in the collar, and he had on a pair of grey stockings when I had him in my possession until he was rescued from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them stockings - A. I had not much time to observe them, I was all in a hurly burley; I got my leg cut in two places.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOX. Q. You are the beadle of St. George's, you are the person that apprehended the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes; on Thursday the 8th of June I received the silk hat from Mr. Hollywood; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at this hat - A. I know it to be my hat, it always pinched me when I put it on; it is too little, there is the maker's name in the hat; I mentioned the maker's name before I examined the hat; in the felling of the lining there was a knot, I cut that knot off that it should not hurt me; here is the end of the thread where it has been cut.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime; I know nothing of the hat. This man took another black man one night. He took me up in Carey-street, Ratcliffe; I was charged with the robbery; I would not go to the office with the officer because I did not know what I had done.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you take up any other black man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take up any other man upon that charge - A. Never.</p>

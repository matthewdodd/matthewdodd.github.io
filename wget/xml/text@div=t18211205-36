I opened the door and saw Mr. Jackson with a candle, he said there were thieves in the house. I ran to the window, called Watch, and went down and let him in - they searched the house - the prisoner was found in the next house. The things in the back kitchen dresser drawer were taken out but not taken away. Two keys belonging to the first floor rooms were taken out of the doors, brought down, and left in the passage by the front door. Mr. Jackson's candlesticks were found on the stairs. I found the back kitchen window thrown up, which would enable them to get in. I put it down myself the night before, but I cannot say whether it was fastened. All the other doors were safe, I was the last person that was in the back kitchen that night. The candlesticks are worth 19 s.</p>

            . I lodge in the house. I heard a noise in the bed-room, and saw somebody put his head into my room, I made a catch at him but he ran down stairs to the back of the house. I went down stairs with Mr. Read to let the watchman in. We traced the foot marks to the wall of the next house, three watchmen went over. The candlesticks were left in the drawing-room the night before, I found them on the stairs near the bottom. They must have entered through the back window.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went into the adjoining house and found the prisoner behind the door in the attic. I found the back windows of the house open. There was no bed in the room. I asked what business he had there; he said he had no place to sleep, and went in there to rest; it was an empty house. He had attempted to get up the chimney, and had knocked down all the mantle-piece. A knife, one shilling, and some halfpence were found on him. I charged him with having been in the next house - he did not deny it. There were wet foot marks on the stairs before we went up.</p>

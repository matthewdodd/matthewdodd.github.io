            . I live at No. 2, Castle-street, and work for Mr. Walker. Mary Foster lives at No. 3; when I came home I heard an alarm of the robbery; I saw Mary Finch run up stairs to Foster's room - William Close followed her, and said she had been robbing a duffer; he went down again, and when he was gone I went and peeped through the key-hole, I saw Mary Finch tying some linen round her person, under her clothes; I went and told my wife there was something wrong; and while I was gone she went away - the prisoner and Finch lived together.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received a warrant against Finch for this robbery; I went down the next morning, which was Good Friday, and found that the prisoner was accused of being a party in it; I searched her room but found nothing there. Ryan stated that he saw the prisoner open the bundle, and hand the article to Finch, and the key to go up stairs to conceal it - I could not find Finch, but I took the prisoner.</p>

            , but not the prisoner. I was standing at my door in the morning, and saw a person come up and strike Flood in the face - the blow made him stagger; when he recovered himself and came towards the curb stone, a woman who is in attendance caught the person by the collar, (he was then making another blow at him); she turned him round, and said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake have you killed the man," or</p>
               <p>"Will you kill him;" I do not know which. Flood immediately took to his heels, and made a kind of run; the person followed him - the people then came between him, and I could not see what passed; but when I came up they were struggling together, opposite a gateway - I saw Flood down, and the person in a stooping position. Flood bled at the first blow, which was over the left temple; his face was covered with blood. He went himself for a constable - I saw him again about a week afterwards. I saw nothing pass between them before the blow was struck.</p>

            . I am the house surgeon of St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought in on the 14th of October; he had a contused wound over the left eye - it was bleeding at the time. He had repeated haemorrhage from the wound; I examined it and found a coagulation of blood - I removed and stopped the bleeding; he went on favourably for two or three days, and then became rather delirious, and had more bleeding from the wound. On the 20th he became still more delirious, and on the 21st he died. I examined the wound minutely after death, and found the bone denuded - I then examined the brain, and found the membrane inflamed, and a little matter under it, just where he received the blow; the inflamation proceeded from the blow. I did not examine any other parts of his body - his vitals were all sound. I think the blow he received was the cause of his death; but if he had had proper medical assistance at first, he might have been saved.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at Old Brentford. On Monday the 6th of October, I was standing in my shop, and saw Flood bleeding from the face, and the prisoner striking him, they were two or three yards from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150019"></xptr>me, the blood was running from his head. A woman was holding him, trying to prevent his striking him. Flood got away, and ran about twenty yards, the prisoner followed him and threw him down; I afterwards saw the prisoner go after him into a lodging-house; Flood sent for a constable, and he was apprehended; the deceased came into my shop in the course of the day, his face appeared cut in a dreadful manner, I advised him to go home; I saw him again next day walking about; on the Monday morning I accompanied him to the magistrate; the magistrate told the prisoner he must send him to prison, if he could not find bail - he said he could not, the deceased then said,</p>
               <p>" Tom I'll make it up with you." Something was said about what he would give him, and he said he had but 3 s. in the world; the magistrate said the expences would amount to more, it was agreed that if he could make up 10 s. he should not go to prison; his wife went out to fetch the 10 s.; the magistrate told me it was settled, and I need not stop, I afterwards saw the prisoner at large; Flood said he never quarreled with him in his life, and the prisoner said, when they were drinking together, he never would pay any thing; they appeared to know each other very well; they were both pensioners; Flood walked about as usual, he never appeared in health, he was always so very thin; the prisoner appeared to me to strike him with his left arm, (the prisoner's left arm is a stump).</p>

            . I am constable of Old Brentford; Flood came for me, and I apprehended the prisoner; after the examination, the magistrate talked of sending him to prison; Flood took me aside and wished me to intercede, as he did not wish him to go to prison, but to punish him in some other way, by fining him; I spoke to the magistrate, who levied a fine of 10 s., he could not pay it, the magistrate ordered a commitment to be made out, and authorized me to discharge him if the money was brought; it was brought, and he was discharged, I paid the fees of the court, and 5 s. to Flood out of the money; I afterwards saw Flood at the public-house smoking his pipe. Walker was the only person examined before the magistrate.</p>

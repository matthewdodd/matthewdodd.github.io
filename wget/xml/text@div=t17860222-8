W. and the other two plain, I have had them five or six years, I am sure they are all mine, I have observed the marks on those that are marked many times, the pepper-box has no mark upon it particularly, I am sure it is mine; here is the pistol, I have seen it in my bar several times, it was not my own, it was left in my care by another person; this paper box is mine, and within the box is a bit of paper written on; there is a nutmeg in it now, but there was nothing but a slip of paper in it, I am sure it is my box, I am sure of the paper of halfpence, they are tied up in a clumsy manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles Prisoner's Counsel. Whereabouts is this cellar window of yours? - It opens into Court-street.</p>
               <p>How many months before this matter happened had you observed these boards? - No months nor days, I never saw it before the night of this robbery.</p>
               <p>Do you and your husband live alone in this house, or have you any servant? - I have a servant.</p>
               <p>How many lodgers have you? - A man and his wife.</p>
               <p>No more? - I have some people worked up stairs, but they do not lodge in my house.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure they could get their hand in where this bolt was unbolted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that other people have tried since this matter happened, and could not do it? - No.</p>
               <p>Have they not told you that they tried, and that it could not be so? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that all your lodgers were in bed at this time? - They were all up stairs at that time, I always see the doors fastened befo re I go to bed.</p>
               <p>Did you see all your lodgers come in that night? - I cannot say I did, but it is a thing impossible that my lodgers should come into this house that way, my lodgers were all in the house before I went to bed, I was the last person that was within the cellar.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to try the cellar window? - I saw it bolted safe the same night, my husband and me were both in the cellar, and we went to bed immediately.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that this breaking of the boards was a fresh breaking? - I never saw it broke before, if it had been broke before I must have seen it; you cannot go in and out of the parlour without seeing it.</p>
               <p>Court. But however, whether it was broke or not, you are sure that window was bolted just before you went to bed? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if the door was broke before, if any man put in his hand and put back the bolt, it is a burglary.</p>

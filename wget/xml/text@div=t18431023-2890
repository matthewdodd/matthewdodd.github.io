                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Thursday morning, the 28th of Sept., I was called to the prisoner's house, and found his wife dead when I got there—the prisoner was present, and several persons—I tried to bleed her but no blood flowed—I asked the prisoner what she had been taking—he answered, he had given her two ounces of sulphate of potash—I asked what he gave it in—he said, a glass of water—I asked him to produce the glass—he did so—it was perfectly clean, and no ingredients in it—I asked him what caused him to give such a thing—he said it was to make her miscarry—I asked him if she had taken any thing of the kind before—he said, "Yes, she had taken four ounces within a fortnight in small quantities, that she took two ounces on Tuesday, and two ounces on Wednesday night at ten o'clock—I asked him to show me what had been thrown off her stomach—he said it was all washed away, there was nothing remaining—I asked him if any one re<lb></lb>commended him to give her that article—he said he took it from a book which he bought in the Strand—I asked for the book—he produced it—I handed it to the officer—I asked if he was embarrassed, or what was the cause of his doing such a rash act—he said he had such a dislike to children—I have examined the deceased in company with another surgeon—I have been forty years in the profession—on looking at the body I found she was not pregnant—I</p>

               <p>examined the brain, and the dura-mater which covers the brain was per<lb></lb>fectly healthy—on removing that membrane I found about two ounces of blood flowed from a ruptured blood vessel on the brain, which was the cause of her death—I opened the abdomen—the stomach was found empty, and very much inflamed—the uterus was healthy and unimpregnated—all the stomach and intestines were highly inflamed, which must have arisen from some irritable substance—it was a state of high inflammation from irrita<lb></lb>bility, from the preparation that was introduced into the stomach—a person taking two ounces of sulphate of potash on Tuesday night, followed by sickness and vomiting, and the same quantity on Wednesday night, which produced sickness, would cause the appearance I found the stomach in—the vessels of the brain were very much distended and full of blood—supposing the sulphate of potash to have been taken, and producing sick<lb></lb>ness and vomiting, I consider that the exciting cause the stomach and intes<lb></lb>tines being in such a high state of recent inflammation—I think the ap<lb></lb>pearance of the brain was produced by the irritation of the stomach, causing sickness, which produced a rupture of the blood vessel, the vio<lb></lb>lent exertion in retching—I could trace all the symptoms to have been occasioned by the administration of sulphate of potash—he stated that she laboured under great sickness, and vomited to a great degree in the course of the night—that on Tuesday she vomited excessively, and was very sick—sulphate of potash is sometimes administered in small quantities, and is then a mild cathartic—a dose is about a drachm—there are eight drachms to an ounce—two ounces would be attended with great danger—so large a quantity administered two following days would be attended with very great danger.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Steven's-place, New North-road, Hoxton. I was called on to examine the deceased on Thursday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 28th of September, in company with Mr. Pickering—I found a piece of paper in the room the body lay, which I produce—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-morten</hi> examination of the body—I should suppose her to have had perfect health generally—she was short-necked, rather robust, and very fat, which would induce me to suppose she had a predisposition to apoplexy—I examined the body—there was inflammation of the whole lining-membrane, the stomach, and intestines, throughout the whole lining were very much inflamed, in a state of active inflammation—I found, on opening the head, extravasation of blood had taken place from the rupture of a vessel—I believe that to be the imme<lb></lb>diate cause of death—two ounces of sulphate of potash, given on Tuesday, and two ounces on Wednesday, was likely to cause great inflammation of the stomach, great retching, and perhaps a rupture of this vessel—I think that probable from the circumstances—I was sent for by the police to go there—the vessels were much gorged and distended with blood—the brain was other<lb></lb>wise in a healthy state—the gorging of the vessels, and the rupture, would probably proceed from this irritation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

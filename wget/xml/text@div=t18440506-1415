The prisoner promised to show me where I could purchase some things that I wanted—I called on him about ten o'clock in the morning of the 13th of April to go to town, and he went with me to show me where I could get some candles which I wanted—after we got outside the turnpike he said, "Thomas, you walk on slowly, I will overtake you"—I waited—he was away about half an hour—I had locked my door when I went away, and left no one in the room—I had three sovereigns and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in a little cupboard with some clean clothes—he had often been in the habit of coming to my lodgings before—he did not know where my money was that I know of—I am sure that I left the money safe when I left—I came home at half-past three o'clock and went to the prisoner's house—he said, "I am going backwards, I will be with you directly"—I waited three quarters of an hour and he did not come—I went home to get some money to pay my lodgings, and the purse and money were gone—I returned to the prisoner's and his wife gave me a key—it fitted my room door exactly.</p>

            . I am a tinman and brazier, and live in Playhouse-yard, St. Luke's, and I am headborough of St. Luke's. On the 19th of June, the prisoner came to me about ten minutes before nine - he put this brass standard into my hand rolled up in paper - he said, "Will you buy this?" - he offered it for 2s. - I said I would not - he said he would throw it away - he went off, and I ran after him- he went to Gibson's foundry - I saw the policeman, and we went in and took the prisoner to the station-house - he said he had bought it in the Borough for 1s. - it is worth 14s. or 15s.</p>

             (police-constable G 140). I took the prisoner - I asked him where he got the gas tube - he said he bought it for 1s. - I said that would not do, and took him to the station-house - he then said he picked it up - the next day he said he took the tube, and did not care what might happen to him - it was wrapped up in this posting-bill belonging to Mr. Clemmitt, and that led me there.</p>

            . I am a brass worker - I lacquered two gas standards for that office twice - to the best of my belief, these are the two - this is the one that was fixed, and this is the one produced by the officer - I fixed one up, and put the other on the shelf.</p>

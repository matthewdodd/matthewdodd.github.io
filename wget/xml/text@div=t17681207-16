            . On the 12th of last month, I was in liquor, having been drinking at the Castle inn, by Carnaby market. I met the prisoner, either in Monmouth street, or the top of Long Acre, I am not sure which. She took me to a house. I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go to bed with you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No, I went to bed by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was it?</p>
               <p>Thomas. It was a private house.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are not certain where you met the woman, can you be sure the prisoner is the woman?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I knew her again when I saw her the next morning. There was a soldier, named Piggot, in the room, when I went in; he and I had a pot of beer together.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of her when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I know not where she went.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she did not go to bed to you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No, she did not. Piggot was in the room when I went to bed; when I awaked, about 5 o'clock in the morning, I missed three guineas out of my breeches pocket; the soldier saw it before I went to bed. I took it out and gave him a five and three penny piece, to go for a pot of beer, and to bring the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your breeches?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I put them under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I lodge in the city. I was hardly capable of going home. Piggot, the soldier, awaked me. I had some silver in my waistcoat pocket: then the soldier and I went to a public house. The prisoner came in, while we were there. I asked her for my money. She said she knew nothing of it. I sent for a constable. She was taken to the round house, and upon searching her, two guineas were found upon her, in a private pocket, but I cannot swear they were mine, but she owned they were mine. We found another guinea at a public house, where she had left it. She owned they were all my property, before Justice Welsh.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the soldier to awake you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I had ordered him to call me, that I might go home.</p>

            . I am the constable, I was sent for to take the prisoner in charge, I carried her to the watch house. I found two guineas upon her. When I began to search her, she said she had no gold about her. The other guinea I got at a public house, she had left in pledge for 4 s. 6 d. When the money was found, the prisoner said the prosecutor was very much in liquor, and he had given her two guineas for her to take care of.</p>

            . I hire that room. I was in it when the prisoner brought the prosecutor in. She lives up one pair of stairs above me. They came in about seven o'clock in the evening. He complained he was cold; he asked me if I would drink, and gave me a five-and-three-penny piece, to go and get a pot of beer, hot. I brought it, and gave him the change. She said she should be obliged to me, if I would let the gentleman lay in my room all night, as her room windows were broke. I saw three guineas in his hand, when he gave me the five-and-three-penny piece. I believe I might stay in the room with them about an hour. They were both going to bed when I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lodged in that house?</p>
               <p>Piggot. She had been there about five or six days. He desired me to call him about five o'clock in the morning, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lay?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070015"></xptr>Piggot. I lay in a room over his head. He was in bed, alone, when I went to call him, fast asleep. He went to put on his things, and said he had lost his money. Then we went to a public house. He treated me with a pint of purl. The prisoner came in. He asked her if she had his money. She said she had not a farthing of it, and that if he was robbed, I must have taken it. She was searched, and two guineas found upon her, and before Justice Welsh she said it was his property; that he gave it her to keep for him till morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>About five o'clock that Saturday evening. I met that gentleman in Long Acre. His face was very much scratched. He took hold of me, and said, he had been very ill used, and had lost all his money. He asked me where I was going, and said, he would go with me; I took him home, and went into Piggot's room, to light a candle; the gentleman said, he would go in there; I said, that was not my room. He went in and sat down, and bid us look at his arm, he had a hurt on it. He would have some supper. He gave Piggot money, to get two rabbits, for the Sunday's dinner; he asked me if I liked a duck, and said he would stay all the next day. He was much in liquor. About two o'clock he went to bed, and I with him. He gave me three guineas, in a paper, and bid me take care of them. He said he was about taking a public house, and asked me if I would live with him, saying, he had no wife. I said I should like it very well: the soldier's wife came in the night, and said, her husband would not let her live there any longer; after I got out of bed, the soldier went to bed to him: in the morning, I went to the public house, the gentleman was there, said he, I want the woman; I said, I am she; said he, I have lost five guineas; I said, I took none; he sent for a constable, and I was taken to the round-house. They took two guineas from me. I thought as he gave it me, I might do what I pleased with it.</p>

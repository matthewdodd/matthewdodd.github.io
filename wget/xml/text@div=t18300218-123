On Thursday evening, the 27th of January, at nine o'clock, I saw the prisoners; Hulbock was up in the hay-loft, over the shed, and Hunt down in the stable - the loft belongs to John Boddy; Hulbock was lifting some hay down out of the loft - Hunt had got a candle, lighting him to do it; Hulbock was throwing the hay down into the shed where he was - I was at master's stable door, watching them; I went and looked into the place - they heard me, and put the light out - I went and told Boddy, and went to the premises with him; we went to Hunt's premises, which are opposite Boddy's - he has a shed there, and we found the hay in his shed which had been taken from the loft; it was clover and bets hay, and that in Boddy's stabe was the same sort.</p>

This loft belongs to me - I had some clover and bets hay there; I bought it that day - Trinder gave me information; I went and missed some: I had but one truss - I saw some in Hunt's shed of the same kind; it agreed with that in my loft, in quality and quantity -Hunt said he had brought it from somewhere else; Hulbock was in the shed, and said he brought it out of the market place.</p>
               <p>Hunt's Defence. I was gathering my tools up ready for the morning; this lad came down with a bit of hay, and told me he had found it in the street - he asked me to let him lay in my shed for the night; I said he could not, as it was full of soot.</p>
               <p>Hulbock's Defence. I brought the hay down to him, and asked him to let me lay there, as I had a quarrel with my father.</p>

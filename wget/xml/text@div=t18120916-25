On Tuesday, the 9th of September, I was alone in the shop; the prisoner and another man came into my shop to purchase a pair of shoes. I gave him a pair of shoes that stood in the window, to try on; he said, take out five or six pair, you have a good many in the window; I said, sir, I will take them out. I was so doing; a person came in for a pair of boots. The moment that he came in, the prisoner went away; he said you have nothing at all to fit me; when I went up to the window to put the shoes in, I missed a pair of shoes that I had made for Mr. Campbell, expecting he would want them in two or three days. My daughter found the prisoner again in about two days; he had the shoes on his feet. Salmon apprehended him. Salmon has got the shoes.</p>
               <p>JOHN SALMON. I produce the shoes. I took them off the prisoner's feet.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear they are my shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I only just come on shore the other day. I had leave of my captain to come on shore. He is at the Isle of Wight. If he was here he would give me a good character. I can have a good character from the officers of the ship. I was wounded. I was in Malta three months; how I came here, I know not. I told the man, if I had done him any harm, I would give him a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. to Salmon. Have you any thing with you that you found upon him - A. I had his absent ticket; it extended to the 8th of next October.</p>

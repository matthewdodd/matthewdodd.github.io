I went round the Dock in company with Jury, a fireman, between eight and nine o'clock. I crossed the spirit quay, and saw the prisoner standing by a cask of brandy, with his small clothes unbuttoned - it was dark, but I had a light. I went up to him, and smelt a strong smell of brandy. I observed that the ground where he stood was very wet. I said "Mitchell, what are you about?" I afterwards saw a common glass bottle, stopped with a piece of hemp, laying by the cask - I took it up, and found it full of brandy. I saw the neck of another bottle sticking out of the inside pocket of his great coat. I took that out, and searched his under coat pocket, and found a brass tube, a gimblet, and a piece of wood, which would serve to stop up a hole made by a gimblet. I asked him how he came to have these things? He said he had had them seven or eight months about him, but had never used them in his life. He afterwards said he had hung his great coat up in the watch-box, and some person had put them into his pocket, and given me information - but I found them in the pocket of his under coat: he said he knew nothing of the bottle on the ground, but of the bottle in his pocket, he said some sailor had given him some liquor in it to drink. While I was searching his under coat I saw him throw this bag from him, with a bladder in it, which is surrounded by a wire, which would compress the bladder, so as to make it lay flat - there was about a gill of brandy in it - there was no stopper in the bladder, it was quite wet. The bottle in his pocket had got a little wine in it. I then gave him into the custody of a watchman and the fireman, while I put the things away. I afterwards examined the cask in his, and M'Donald's presence, and a few inches from the bung hole, I found a hole bored,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170047"></xptr>exactly of the size of the gimblet. We stopped it up, and he was taken to the Office. I tasted the brandy in the bottle, in the bladder, and in the cask, the next morning, and the appeared to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Might not some empty casks contain a little brandy in them, and if so, might not the ground be wet? A. It might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common for watchmen to have a little brandy about them to keep out the cold? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. What was the wet on the ground? A. It was brandy. The cask seemed to be perfectly sound, and the wet was at a distance from it: if it had leaked it would have been more under the cask - the wet was just at the place to which liquor would have spirted from the cask through a spill-hole.</p>

            . I am a fireman, in the employ of the London Docks. On the night of the 20th of January, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, I was on duty, and went round to see that all fires and lights were out. I went with Slater across the spirit quay. I saw the prisoner standing near the head of the cask, upright, and with his face to wards it. I went within about three yards of the cask, and saw some wet, and smelt a strong smell of brandy. The officer said, "Mitchell, what have you been about?" He said, "Nothing." I saw a bottle under the bulge of the cask, which the officer took up, it was stopped with hemp, and was full of brandy. I tasted it some time afterwards. The officer searched him in my presence, and took a bottle from his great coat pocket, and in his body coat pocket he found a brass tube, a gimblet, and a piece of wood, in the form of a spill. Slater then left him in the custody of myself and a watchman. In about half an hour he came back with M'Donald - I saw them examine the cask, and saw a hole in it, a few inches from the bung - it was just such a hole as this gimblet would have made - it was open then. Before Slater went away, I saw him pick up a bag, with a bladder, which had a little brandy in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you came up, was the cask running? A. No. There were no empty casks on the quay that I know of. The bottle was not out of my sight till I tasted it.</p>

            . I am an excise-watchman. I had the charge of some brandy in London Docks, on the 20th of January, from seven o'clock in the morning till five in the evening: I then gave it up to the prisoner. There were fifteen or sixteen casks lying on the brandy-quay, on the south side: they were all safe when I left them, and no appearance of say wet on the ground. If the bungs were up, no brandy could have leaked from them. There had been no racking off for several days before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had fifteen or sixteen casks in charge. They were racking off some casks, and had left a racking-off cask there. I took and rolled it out of the way, which made wet on the ground. Slater came up, and asked me what I was doing: I said, my duty. I had been moving a racking-off cask, and had made a wet. He then took a bottle out of my pocket, which had a little wine in it. He took me to the guard-house. In the morning, he took me to the Magistrate; and there he said, the cask had been guaged and re-guaged, and nothing was found missing. I have a wife and seven children.</p>
               <p>The JURY to SLATER. Q. Was there any racking casks near the cask of brandy in question? A. Not that I know of I had been there all day, and I think I must have seen it - I might not.</p>

            . I am employed particularly at the spirit-quay. There had been no brandy racked off on the 20th of January. The casks, of which the prisoner had charge, had not been racked; nor had there been any racking cask for several days there. When there has been any racking, we empty them completely. If there had been any spilled, it would have been dry in an hour or two.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TALBOT re-examined. Q. Did you see any bottle near the cask? A. I did not see any - there might have been one. There had been no vessel at work that day, in that part of the dock. The bung-hole is on the top of the cask.</p>
               <p>JAMES SLATER. The spill-hole was a little lower on the side of the cask than the bung-hole.</p>

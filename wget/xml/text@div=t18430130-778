I live in Church-street, Lisson-grove, next door to Mr. Miller, who deals in corn and hay—Whitehead has been in his employ for the last month—on Wednesday evening, the 18th of Jan., I saw him take a truss of clover hay out of Mr. Miller's barn, and put it down against Spicer's door, who lives in Duke-mews, next door but one to Miller's stable—Spicer was standing at his door at the time—I made my way towards them—they appeared to be in conversation—I said to Whitehead, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I think I shall go and get a pint of beer"—Whitehead then made his way from Spicer's, and I could neither see the clover, nor Spicer—I did not go to get any beer, but went and stood at the corner—I then saw Whitehead come again out of the barn with a truss of bent hay on his shoulder, which he took to Spicer's door—I then saw Spicer bring the truss of bent hay from the door up into Earl-street—I saw Spicer's man with the truss of clover hay on his back—I went to Mr. Miller's shopman, and told him what I had seen.</p>

I will pay Mr. Miller for them if he will go next door, the money lies there"—I was present when the depo<lb></lb>sitions were taken—that is Mr. Rawlinson's signature to this deposition—they were all signed in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner Spicer says, 'I sever received them, and have not had a truss of hay in my place for three weeks.' <hi rend="smallCaps">J.

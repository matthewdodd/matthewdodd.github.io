            . I live at Hillingdon. On the 10th of September I was in company with the prisoner and Durden, about half-past eleven o'clock at night; we had been to a wedding; Clarke, Cherry, Watts and Beddis were there - Samuel Rutter had been married, and we had been merry-making at his house, which is down by Providence chapel, Uxbridge - I went there about ten o'clock, and found them there; there had not been much drinking; we were all coming home together, going to Hillingdon; we sat out from Uxbridge about half-past eleven o'clock; the prisoner and Durden came with us all the way: nothing happened till we came up to <placeName id="t18270913-63-crimeloc384">Hillingdon-end</placeName>

As soon as Durden recovered himself he got up; the prisoner struck at him with the knife, and cut him in the neck, across the back of his neck, and likewise cut his ear - Beddis came across from the opposite side of the way, and began to pitch into Joseph Durden with his fist - Durden then struck Beddis; they had a bit of a scuffle altogether, and the prisoner cut Joseph Durden in the thigh - Durden had only struck him once: that was after he knocked him down with a stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they got into a fight? A. Yes; Durden, the prisoner, and Beddis - all three had a bit of a fight together - that was before he cut his thigh with the knife. The prisoner was in a great passion, and swung the knife about very much; none of them had drank much while I was at the house; I had not kicked George - I only touched his head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. On your oath, did you not hit the man's hat, and knock it down over his eyes? A. I did not; I thought it no arm to put my finger on his hat; I did not do it to vex him - his wife was not there during any part of the scuffle; I did not throw her down, nor did any one else; I saw her on the ground - she was drunk; that was directly we came out of the house - I was not there when she was picked up. I swear she was not present during the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Beddis, in the first instance, interfere to prevent you and your drunken companions ill-using the prisoner? A. No. I forget whether Beddis knocked him down; I do not think he did, but I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did not some of the party catch hold of this old man by the neck handkerchief, and almost strangle him? A. They did not; Durden did not push him against the wall; the prisoner was going along quietly when I touched his hat; his wife was not ill-used by any body in my presence - it was a moonlight night.</p>

            . I had gone to this merry-making about eight o'clock - there was not much drinking: we left about half-past eleven o'clock, to go to Hillingdon; I was walking some distance before the witnesses; I heard a noise and squabble between them behind; I went back, and met George, with a knife in his hand - he threatened to cut me if I did not go out of the way; he then directly cut my brother Joseph - they both fell down together.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, but did they close together first, or did your brother try to lay hold of him? A. No; after he cut my brother they both fell down - he cut him just down by the thigh; my brother was then standing; they both fell together; I saw nothing before that, nor afterwards. The prisoner's wife was not there; I had not spoken to him before he spoke to me - I got out of his way.</p>
               <p>Q. You turned round, and went up to him - did he miss you and strike your brother by chance? A. Yes - he struck at me, I got out of the way - he missed me and struck my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you going up to secure him, or what? A. No; I did not know what was the matter; I had seen nothing but good will between them before; we were all good friends at the wedding, and came away good friends; my brother had never quarrelled with him; he said he would cut the first person who came up to him, and I went up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear to be defending himself against the persons who were attacking him? A. Not that I saw; I did not hear him say, "Keep off from me;" I saw nobody ill-use his wife. I saw nobody strike Beddis, nor did I see Beddis interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not your brother got the prisoner throttled up by the neck, against the brick wall? A. No. Beddis was walking along the path; he might be a yard before him; I did not see the prisoner's wife on the ground; as we came out of Rutter's house the party broke up altogether - she was tipsy - I saw nobody so tipsy as she was; I did not notice her walk out of the house; if she was laying in the parlour she might have got up before I got to her; I was nearly the last person who came out; I saw her standing in the road when I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, was she not knocked down by some one, and very indecently used? A. I heard of nothing of the kind. Clarke took the prisoner's stick from him, and returned it to him; I cannot tell who had it when I saw him with the knife; we were not going the nearest way home, but we generally go round that way.</p>

            . I am a gardener. I went to Rutter's house about eight o'clock in the evening; there was some drinking: we broke up about half-past eleven o'clock- the prisoner and his wife were there; we had been very sociable, and all left together - the prisoner and I were coming home together; Larkin was behind us; I did not see him do any thing.

             was in the middle of the turnpike-road - he stepped up to the foot-path, and George hit him on the side of the head, and knocked him into the kennel; I instantly went, and took the stick from the prisoner's hand; he said,"D-n his eyes; I will let the g-ts out of the first man that comes near me;" he was in a great passion: I went and put my back against the wall, and did not see what happened afterwards. I saw nothing done with a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you come out of the house with the rest? A. Yes; we came out one after the other; I was on before, and saw nothing done to the prisoner's wife. I saw nobody strike Beddis.</p>

            . I was at this wedding, and came away with the rest; Joseph Durden and I were walking along the road together - I saw the prisoner striking Larkin, who had put his hand on his head; Joseph Durden stepped over, and said, "What is the matter?" George made no more to do, but knocked him down in the gutter - as soon as Durden recovered he got up, and stood in his own defence - he went up to him, and George struck him again, with a stick; Beddis (who was going along on the other side of the way) came over, and began pitching in to Joseph Durden; Durden struck at the prisoner, but hit the wall - George then began upon him with the stick - Clarke took the stick from him; George then drew out his knife, and swore he would let Clarke's g-ts out, for taking his stick away; Joseph Durden, Beddis, and the prisoner were all down together; there was a scuffle between them. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130068"></xptr>George cut Durden on the ear, and then on the back of his neck - and as I was dragging Durden away the point of the knife caught my finger; we were then going home - George was first, and met Samuel Durden coming down to meet us; George said to him, "Get out of the way, or I will let your g-ts out;" he turned round, and cut Joseph Durden in his hand - that cut was not intended for Samuel - he turned round to Joseph, who was behind him, and cut him; the prisoner was not in liquor - I did not tell the Magistrate so; I said he was rather in liquor, and that Beddis was in liquor; Joseph Durden went to strike at him before the knife was drawn - he did not put himself in a fighting attitude - he had one hand in his pocket, and the other by the side of him - that was when Larkin was struck; they were all in good humour at the house, and no quarrelling at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of a touch did Larkin give the prisoner's hat? A. He only put his hand on the crown - the prisoner had done nothing to provoke anybody; he was walking quietly with Clarke and talking - I did not see Joseph Durden knock Beddis down - they were all down together, all in a scramble. I do not know who threw Beddis down - the prisoner's wife was very tipsy; I did not see her till it was all over - I saw her on the ground when we came out of the house - I saw nobody push her down or ill-treat her - she said, Larkin did it; her person was very much exposed as she lay.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner's wife on the ground? A. Yes; Larkin and Watts threw her down; her person was very indecently exposed by them; they threw her clothes up - the prisoner had not said a word to them. When I went to interfere for the prisoner, they began to cry out, "Oh!" I was knocked down twice and received a number of blows. Joseph Durden had got him pushed up against the wall before he cut him - he had him twice against the wall before he struck him with the stick - I saw nothing of the knife; they pushed him twice against the wall before he used the stick - and I suppose, he received ten or a dozen blows - my daughters fetched me away before the stick was taken from him.</p>

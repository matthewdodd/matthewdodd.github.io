               <p>Sturdy. He is a breeches-maker, and lives at Uxbridge; and I knowing the horse, and that he was stole, went to acquaint my lord of him, that I had seen him; my lord not being in the way, I acquainted the steward with the cause of my coming; after that the steward told my lord and he sent for me, and I told his lordship, he sent me to Uxbridge to Mr James's for him; when I came there Mr James was gone out on him; I put up at the three tuns there; I was told the breeches-maker bought him of a blacksmith, named Aldwin.</p>
               <p>Q. to Aldwin. Are you a blacksmith?</p>
               <p>Aldwin. I am.</p>
               <p>Sturdy. I sent for Mr Aldwin, he came, he ask'd me the marks of the horse, he said he had bought such a one of the prisoner, and that he had sold him to the breeches-maker; I said I believed it was the same horse that was stolen from my lord, and that I had seen him at such a place; so he proposed to bring him to my lord, the next day, if he came home, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a warrant with you?</p>

               <p>Q. What colour was he?</p>
               <p>Sturdy. He was of a darkish bay colour.</p>

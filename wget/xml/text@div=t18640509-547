                  </hi>. I keep the Norwich Arms beer-shop, 1, Church-street, Greenwich—on 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. April, the prisoner was standing in front of my, dressed as a marine—he said he had no money, and a man paid for some bread and cheese for him—while he was standing at the bar, I put two half-sovereigns and twenty-nine shillings in a vase on the mantel-piece in the bar-parlour, which is behind the counter—you can see into one part of the bar-parlour—the prisoner went backwards, as I thought, to go to the back place; but he was not gone a minute before he came back, and I saw him have the house suddenly—about two or three minutes after he was gone, I missed the money—I had not seen any one go into the bar-parlour—I went after the prisoner, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> From where you stood at the bar, could you see into the bar-parlour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I believe the prisoner had been into my house once or twice before—I believe he is a marine; a good many marines come in there at times—no one came into the bar between the time the man went to the back, and when he went out—they might have gone into the parlour without my seeing—I can swear that no one passed the bar where I stood to go backwards from the time I put the money there till it was gone—I was standing at the end of the passage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman and waiter to the prosecutor—on this Saturday, in consequence of something my master said to me, I went after the prisoner, and found him in a house at the back of the Beehive, between 5 and 6 o'clock drinking hot rum and water—there were three more marines with him, and three females—I spoke to the landlord, and he called the prisoner out, and said, "You shan't be taken in my house; go into the tap-room of the Beehive, and be taken there"?he did not go into the Beehive; he walked down the street? I overtook him, and said, "Don't go any further that way; you know what you have done, but if you give back the money, I will guarantee that you shall not be locked up"?he said, "All right, Ted." (<hi rend="largeCaps">MR. LAWRENCE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this evidence being given, upon the ground that an inducement was held out by the potman, whom the prisoner might fairly believe had his master's authority to forgive him.</hi>

I am a shoemaker, and live in the Back-lane at the end of Rag-fair; a neighbour of mine used to buy pickpocket's handkerchiefs and other stolen goods; I spoke of it and they served me with a copy of a writ, and the Justice ordered me to stop the first I saw come, and the first I saw was Roberts; he had two shirts and a check apron under his arm; the other prisoner was there, he ran up Chick-lane; I stopped him with a shirt in his hand; he flung it into a barber's shop; he had three more shirts on his back, and about three yards of silver lace in his pocket; they were committed, one to Bridewell, and the other to New Prison, for further examination. After that Mrs. Thompson came and owned the things; Roberts confessed there were three of them, that they got over a wall and into the kitchen, and took the things; he said the other boy whom I knocked down, but he got away, was called Pouch, that he had one shirt and three childrens shifts, and one spoon, when he got away; (nine shirts, a check apron, three yards and a half of silver lace produced and deposed to by the prosecutor's wife.)</p>

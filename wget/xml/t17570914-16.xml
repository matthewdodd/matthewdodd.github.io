               <p>Q. What is that oil worth per quart?</p>
               <p>Richard's. It is worth 7 d. or 8 d. per quart. We have two sorts at those prices. The prisoner was taken up, and carried before justice St. Lawrance, where he beg'd not to be committed to the Gatehouse, and said he would leave a 20 l. note of hand with me to make it up, and said he would never buy any stolen oil any more if I would forgive him that offence, and if he did buy any oil of the boy, he must be drunk; saying, pray Mr. Richards forgive me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the boy committed?</p>
               <p>Richards. He was, to Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue there?</p>
               <p>Richards. No. The justice said if he was kept there till sessions he'd be spoil'd, and not be sit for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175709140010"></xptr> my service, so he pass'd his word for the boy, and let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you give 7 d. per quart for lamp oil?</p>
               <p>Richards. I do, as near as can be calculated.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the 20 l. note offer'd to you, or to the justice, that he might not be committed?</p>
               <p>Richards. He said he would give me a 20 l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the man bail'd ?</p>
               <p>Richards. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you was before the justice, what did you value the oil at?</p>
               <p>Richards. At 7 d. or 8 d. per quart.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it to be put in the commitment 1 s. value?</p>
               <p>Richards. The justice, valued the two quarts at that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to make it 14 d. in the indictment?</p>
               <p>Richards. I told the justice it cost me 14 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it said before the justice that the prisoner gave but 2 d. for the two quarts?</p>
               <p>Richards. It was, by the boy.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Richards. I was employ'd to light the lamps. In the beginning of May last, about noon, the prisoner met me, as I was going into Portland-street, and ask'd me if I had got any oil, he wanted me to lend him some. I told him I had not much to spare. He beg'd I'd let him have some, so I let him have two quarts; he gave me 2 d. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever sold him any before?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, nor since. He was about as I was, putting oil into lamps then.</p>
               <p>Q. Who measured it?</p>
               <p>Morris. He had a measure that I think held rather above half a pint; he himself measured out eight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he desire you to bring him, or to let him have any more after this?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you?</p>
               <p>Morris. He knew who I belong'd to, by seeing me in the street before, doing my master's business; and he had seen me in my master's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with him before this?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you enquire where he lived, or he whose servant you was?</p>
               <p>Morris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him frequently after this?</p>
               <p>Morris. I did, many times; I used to see him almost every day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before you was taken up?</p>
               <p>Morris. It was about a quarter of a year before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Seymore. I am a constable, and was before justice St. Lawrance when the prisoner was charged with buying two quarts of lamp oil of this boy. The prisoner said he was certainly drunk if he bought oil of that boy. The justice wrote his mittimus to the Gatehouse. He beg'd of Mr. Richards to make it up, and he'd give him a 20 l. note of hand, if he ever bought any more of the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention stolen oil?</p>
               <p>Seymore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any thing of his knowing the oil being Mr. Richards's property, or the boy being his servant?</p>
               <p>Seymore. No; he told me he knew the boy, and did not deny buying the oil, and the boy said he never bought any oil of him but that time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the 20 l. note offer'd to pay, on condition he ever bought oil of any of his servants?</p>
               <p>Seymore. He said, '' Mr. Richards, I'll give you '' a note under my hand never to buy any more '' oil of your boy.''</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner lives?</p>
               <p>Seymore. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the time he was bail'd?</p>
               <p>Seymore. I do not; but I have seen him about frequently since he was bail'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he surrender here ?</p>
               <p>Seymore. I met him and his two bail coming from his house here, and he surrender'd to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any attempt to escape?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175709140011"></xptr>Seymore. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sumerset. Lamp oil at present is worth half a crown a gallon, and at the time mention'd in the indictment it was worth 7 d. per quart.</p>

On the 29th of January, master and his family went to the play, and about seven, or a quarter past, I went up stairs - some of the clerks were in the counting-house at the time. There are leads to the house, which lead from our bed-room into Mr. Proctor's garden, in Billiter-square. On getting up stairs I found the lead doors both open - I went to shut them; I was obliged to go out on the leads to shut them; I staid outside for a few minutes, as the bells were ringing, it being the King's accession. I turned my eye round, and saw a candle standing on maser's bed-room table, below where I stood, and saw the prisoner very busy, passing too and fro in the room, but could not see what she was doing, The plate was kept in a closet in that room. She came up stairs to our bedroom to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is that you?" I said, Yes - she took something off her own bed, and immediately went down into master's bed-room again; I then went down to see what she was doing - she came out, and pulled the door too to prevent my going in, and I did not go in, but came down into the kitchen, and felt very uneasy; I did not know what to do. I went up stairs, put on my bonnet and shawl, and went out to watch if anything was taken out; I shut the street door as I went out, and the middle door also, and on getting into the street, I saw a man standing with his back against the India House, looking up the court. I did not know what to do, so I went down the street - the man followed me quickly down the street. I returned to the house, and found both the doors wide open; the prisoner came out of the parlour into the passage. I asked what she did with both the doors open, saying I thought Mr. Kriwen would be angry if he knew it - she said,</p>

               <p>"I expect a friend;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Let him ring the bell;" she shut the parlour door; I passed her, and went into the parlour, and found a bundle standing on a chair there; she stood before the chair sometime, and seemed confused. I said I thought all was not right, and that she had been there a very short time; she said,</p>
               <p>"Then you are a very suspicious woman;" I then caught sight of the bundle, and called in Mr. Barr. the clerk - he came - I said something induced me to think all was not right, and at that instant she left the parlour. I then saw what the bundle was; there was a silver bread basket in it, and the silver which is now in it - Barr immediately locked it up. I did not examine it till master returned. I did not see the prisoner afterwards till she was taken. I am the cook. The plate was usually kept in a closet adjoining the bed-room.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Kirwen; his house is in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft, Aldgate Ward. King called me about five minutes before eight o'clock; I went into the parlour, and the prisoner went up stairs. King was extremely agitated, and pointed to a bundle, which I examined; it contained plate - I immediately locked it up in the counting-house. A bread basket and other plate was in it; but I cannot say what; I kept it till about twelve o'clock, when Mr. and Mrs. Kirwen came home; I took it up to Mr. Kirwen myself. I went up stairs to endeavour to find the prisoner, and found her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180009"></xptr>walking backwards and forwards on the leads, in a very distracted manner; I was afraid she would make away with herself, and persuaded her to come in and stay in the room till Mr. Kirwan came home. She said nothing to me. The bundle contained various articles of plate, a bread basket, silver tray, and other things.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Kirwan. The clerk came to me; I went to the house, and found the prisoner on the leads in great agitation; and after she came in, she desired me to go on the leads with her, to assist her to bring in a basket off the leads, but having the gout, I was not able - she fetched it in herself, and said it was plate. I immediately locked it up, without opening it, and it was not taken out until Mr. Kirwan came home - Lloyd carried it in to Mr. Kirwan. I asked her what was in the basket; she said it was plate, and that she put it there in her confusion, to hide it, and that there was a person at the door, who had induced her to do it, through his poverty - that he was her husband. The basket was on the outside of the leads, fastened round to the railing; it was dark; I could not see it, but I felt it hanging to the railing.</p>

I brought the basket out of the room myself, but did not see it opened.

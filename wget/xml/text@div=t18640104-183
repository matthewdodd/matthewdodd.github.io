I am a warehouseman in Ironmonger-lane, City—on 14th December, about 6 o'clock, I was in Cheapside—the Guards were marching to the Bank, and took up part of the pavement, so that there was little room for passengers to pass along—I noticed two men before me, who obstructed in some measure my way—they came to a standstill, which ex<lb></lb>cited my suspicions—I looked round, and saw the prisoner with my watch in his hand—I took hold of it with ray left hand, and of him with my right—the guard was still round my neck; the watch was not detached—I held the prisoner about three minutes, and gave him in custody.</p>

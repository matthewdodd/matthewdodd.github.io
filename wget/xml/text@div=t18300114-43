On the evening of the 18th of December I went to bed a little before eleven o'clock, and the house was then fastened; at two o'clock in the morning I heard a noise, went down, and found two doors ajar, which had been fastened; I went and found the kitchen window open, and a pair of trousers hanging across the cill of the window - I gave an alarm, and examined the various rooms with the watchman; when I went the third time into the front room I found the prisoner behind the door - I said, "Here is one of the rascals;" he put up his arm, and I gave him a thump on the head with the poker - the watchman then took him; I went back to the kitchen, and on the table I found two table-cloths and atowel, which had been in the drawer when I went to bed; the house must have been entered by crossing two or three yards, getting over a wall, and opening the shutters of a window, which was lifted up - the noise which awoke me was an attempt to break open the cupboard door.</p>

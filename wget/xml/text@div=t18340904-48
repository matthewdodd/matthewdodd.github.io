On the 3rd of July, about half-past seven o'clock, I was on Tower-hill with a bundle containing the articles stated - I saw the prisoner, who said he was an old soldier, and as I am an old sailor, I told him if he would show me the way to Brook-street, I would treat him with something to drink - we went to a public-house, and had three or four pots of beer - I then left, and he dodged me on the road, and at last took my bundle from a house which I did not see him come into.</p>

I met this man at the Crispin - he began to beat the table to imitate a drum - he then sung, and he asked if he could not drink out of that pot of porter - he did so, and then he said he would be a pot - he then said he was going to buy some grindery - he tried to fight every body - he then went to the other public-house, and while he went for a light I went out with the bundle, but did not mean to keep it.</p>

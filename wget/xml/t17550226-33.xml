               <p>Foot. I asked the prisoner a great many questions, he said he lodged with Mr. Finsham a peruke-maker in the neighbourhood, and said he was a taylor, and wanted a little money, to buy some cloth to make a surtout coat, and that I need not be afraid of losing my money, for Mr. Bundock, a Hair-merchant at the next door, and all the gentlemen in the street, that is, King-street, Tower-hill, knew him very well, and said he wanted only two guineas: when I was going to lend it him, he desired half a guinea more, and said that would buy trimmings. On the Thursday it was advertised, I went to Mr. Finsham to know if he had a taylor lodged there? he said he had, I saw him, he is much about the size of the prisoner, but different in his cloaths. Mr. Finsham asked me what was the matter ? I told him a silver tankard had been stolen, and pawned by the name of

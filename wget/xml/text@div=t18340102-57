            . I am a headborough of St. Luke's, Old-street, and live at 129, White Cross-street - on Wednesday evening, the 11th of December, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoner pass my shop-window, in company with two other boys - I suspected them, and followed them to Play House-yard, and passed them about the middle of the yard - when I came up to them, I heard the prisoner say to the other boys, "Look out, while I go in" - he went into the shop, and took something from under his coat and offered to sell it; but the party shook their head and would not buy it - I saw him come out, and stopped him, and asked him what he had got there offering for sale - he said, a pair of shoes which his mother had sent him to sell - I asked him to let me look at them, and saw they were a new pair; I told him I thought he was telling me a falsity, for his mother would not send him to sell new shoes - he asked me if I would be so good as to go to his parents with him, and they would soon satisfy me that they had sent him to sell them - his father lived in Golden-lane - he was not at home, nor his mother - he sent out for his father, who came - I asked if he had sent his son to sell that pair of shoes - the father said no; they never sent him to sell them - the prisoner said, "No; mother sent me to sell them: father, if you will send for her, she will tell you she sent me" - the mother came in at the time, and denied it, the same as the father - she said she knew nothing about them - I did not see that the others had anything with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At this time you had him in custody? A. Yes - I don't know whether the father knew I was an officer; I did not tell him so - I told him I had stopped his boy selling shoes - I certainly appeared to keep him from going away from my grasp, and the father had every opportunity of seeing that - I saw the father and mother here to day - the father did not tell the mother the boy was in custody for stealing the shoes - I do not recollect it - I do not think she was present when I said I had stopped him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you acquainted with the prisoner? A. I cannot be certain that I had ever seen him before - my husband's name is John only - he has no partner in his business - that is the usual way of marking shoes - we have not one mark for all our shoes - I put the number on them - we sell a good many in a year - we only sold a few that month - I should know four or five of the other pairs - they are not all marked in the same way, as my husband marks some - I marked all mine in the same way - I marked this myself - here is the number I marked, No. 4 - I mark only one shoe of each pair - I have sold other shoes with four on them - it is fourth size - a shoe of that size would have four - I cannot say how many I have sold of that size - it is a woman's shoe - I cannot swear I have not sold ten pair within three months before.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Crown-court, Goswell-street - these shoes are a size regularly marked by the maker - it is not put on by the prosecutor, but by the maker - they are the fourth size, of which a considerable number are sold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear Mrs. Davis swear she made that mark herself? A. I was not in court; but am certain it is the maker's mark - shopkeepers will not take them unless we mark the size on them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Davis, by desire of the prisoner's counsel, here wrote the figure of 4 on the shoes.</p>

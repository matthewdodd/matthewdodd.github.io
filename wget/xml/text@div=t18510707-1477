               <p>Rahere-street. The prisoner has had our front parlour as a bed and sitting-room, for a fortnight—my bedroom is the back parlour—on 19th June, about a quarter-past 6 o'clock, I was at tea in the kitchen, and heard my bedroom door shut—I know it was my door, by its peculiar sound—I had been there five minutes before, and noticed my watch safe in the pocket of the bed—when I heard the door shut I sent a little girl up, and while she was going up, I heard footsteps going from my bedroom to the parlour—I went up and missed my watch—I called out, "That man has been in my room, out of the front parlour, and taken my watch" and I sent the girl up to Mrs. Sheppard, who lodges on the first-floor—she came down, and I then went into the prisoner's room, and said to him, "You have been into my bedroom and taken, my watch, I heard you shut the door"—he said, <hi rend="italic">"Me</hi> take no watch; <hi rend="italic">me</hi> not been into your room"—I called Mr. Brown down from the top of the house, who said I had better send for a policeman—I sent, two came, and we went into the prisoner's room—the prisoner denied having the watch, and the policeman said he could hear it ticking in the room—he went towards the fireplace—I had no watch on myself—I took the paper ornament away which was hung in front of the grate, gave it to Mrs. Sheppard, and she threw it on my bed in the back-parlour—the prisoner's room was searched, and nothing found, and we could not then hear the tick<lb></lb>ing—the policemen took the prisoner, and I went with them to the station, locking my bedroom door, and taking the key with me—I came back about 8—I did not go into my room again till about 10, when I took my baby, and as I was laying it on the bed I heard a watch ticking—I looked about, took up the fire paper, shook it, and laid it down again—I listened again, shook the paper again, and then found my watch in it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) and this is the fire-paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,)</p>

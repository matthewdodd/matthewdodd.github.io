                  </hi>. On the 7th of December I was at Staines. I met the prisoner about nine o'clock at night—we went down a bye place by ourselves, and while there, she robbed me—when I met her I had a parse containing three sovereigns and two half-sovereigns—and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in my pocket, and a box, which was not taken—I had two breast<lb></lb>pins in my shirt, which were attached with a chain—I know one sovereign was bent, owing to a coach wheel going over it—I can swear to that one—I had pulled my breeches down—when the prisoner had left me for two or three minutes I missed my purse—I pursued her immediately—I had given her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which had been loose in my waistcoat pocket—the silver had been loose in my pocket—when I overtook her, I told her she had robbed me of my purse—she said she had not robbed me, and had not got the purse—I called the constable—these are the pins, I have no doubt about them, and this sovereign I can swear to—it was bent when the wheel went over it—this is my purse—I was sober.</p>

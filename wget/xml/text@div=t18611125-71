While I was there she came in for the supper beer; we went out together; she offered me some of the beer; I drank some, she drank some, and together we drank the whole of it; she then said,' It is no se living, my friends are always <hi rend="italic">nagging</hi> at me; will you follow me?' I said, 'Yes; anywhere you like to go.' We then went down the Mornington-road to the Surrey Canal; she asked me if I had got a handkerchief I said, "Yes."She said, "That will not be long enough to go round us both;" she said, "I have a piece of tape, but I did not bring it for that purpose;" I said, "I have got some boot laces," she said, "They will do;" we then tied ourselves together"—he did not say how—she said, "I do not think I shall sink; I said, "Why not?" she said, "Because the crinoline will keep me up."She then put her arms round my neck and we got into the canal. We rolled over together several times she soon drowned; but did not very soon sink. The string broke, and I got out on the opposite side. I tried to save her but could not. I hen got into the canal again, swam across, and went home"—I asked him what the young woman's name was; he said, "Margaret Edwards," and that he had been keeping company with her about three years—I proceeded with him to wards the Surrey Canal—I have omitted to say that he said at the tine they tied themselves together, "I was" very bad, and she had to hold me up—when we got near the canal I asked him if he felt better, as he had previously complained of shivering and cold; he said, "Yes; I am all right now; if I had been as well a while ago, I should not have been in this situation," or words to that effect—I sent for some drags; and at the spot which he pointed out in the Surrey Canal, we found the body of the. young woman—he appeared anxious to see the body, and I allowed him to do so—on its being landed he said, "It is not injured," or, "not damaged, is it?"—on obtaining a full view of the face he remarked, "It has made a great difference to her"—I then took him to the station-house, and charged him merely with attempting to commit suicide by throwing himself into the Surrey Canal in company with Margaret Edwards, who was drowned—I said, "I have merely taken your own words;" he said, "Yes; that is the truth—I assisted in taking the body of the girl to the dead-house—I found no handkerchief or boot-lace—the prisoner said nothing to me about any tape.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Physicians, re<lb></lb>siding in High-street, Deptford—I made an examination of the body of the deceased on the Tuesday, the day afterwards—after removing the clothes, I looked for any traces of external injury, and there were two marks: a bruise on the left side of the temple here, and an echymosed spot on the left side of the left arm, a dark spot or bruise—that might have arisen either from a blow or a fall—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—the body internally was perfectly healthy—there was a good deal of frothy mucus from the mouth, and the lungs were gorged; the was drowned in fact—I after<lb></lb>wards attentively examined her clothes—they did not present the least appearance of having any tie round them—there was a depression on the bonnet, which was a black straw one, and the plaits were torn.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you to say that these marks might have arisen either from a blow or a fell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they were both on the same side; they may have been caused by a bruise on the same substance—I think the bruise most have been from a flattened surface—they may both be bruises at the same time from a flattened surface, or else there must have been an abra<lb></lb>sion of the skin—the two marks were about in a straight line from one to the other—the bruise on the outside of the arm might have arisen from a grasp—the bruises were caused before death I think, because in bruising the dead body, we should not have that amount of discoloration under the skin—there are barges going frequently backwards and forwards on the canal—by before death I mean before the circulation had actually stopped—they might have been occasioned after apparent death.</p>

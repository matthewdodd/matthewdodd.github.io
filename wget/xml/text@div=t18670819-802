                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>. I live at Leman Street, White<lb></lb>chapel, and am a tailor, working for Mr. Wolmerhausen, of Conduit Street—I recollect meeting the prisoner and a person named Peterson—Peterson stopped me and asked me if I was a tailor—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Do you work here? "—I said, "Yes"—that was the first time I had work from there—he said, "That is my place here, and there is a strike here; you cannot take any work from here"—I replied that I did not know there was a strike there, and I would not take any more—he said, "I shall not let you go away; you shall not live longer than three days; I will kill you; I will give you a blow"—I said that I would call a police<lb></lb>man—he said, "Well, just when the policeman comes I shall kill you"—I went to Berkeley Street, and the prisoner walked by my side—I did not know he was a tailor—he gave me a blow on the side, which made me fall down—three gentlemen came up and asked what was the matter—I laid, "My dear gentlemen, you must not go away, as these people are going to kill me"—they advised me to call a policeman—I said, "There is no police<lb></lb>man here"—the prisoner ran away after he gave me the blow, but the other one remained—I was much hurt—I could not get up—the gentlemen were obliged to lift me up, and I had to go home in a cab.</p>

I must go to Marlborough Street. It is my fault I know, but I will try everything I can not to get much punishment to the prisoner"—this conversation was in Lawrence's presence, but we spoke in German andLawrence does not understand German—we offered him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said he could not take it, and would give me an answer—he said, "If you could give so much for me and my wife I would leave off," and afterwards he said he would go back to his old shop again (Simpson's) if they would have him back—I saw him coming out from Marlborough Street, and he said to me, "You see I cannot help it, the two gentlemen are after me"—I wished to speak a few words to him, but one of the clerks took him by the arm and said, "Come on," and took him off in a cab.</p>

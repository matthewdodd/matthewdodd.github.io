I cried out, stop thief, upon which he came back again, and struck me three violent blows on the head; he called me bitch, and d - d me, and made use of a deal of ill language. After I recovered the blows, I still kept calling thief, thief; in consequence of which, Mr. Robson took him in Coventry Street, and brought him to me: that was in about ten minutes. I came to the bottom of Oxendon Street, and they immediately told me, the thief was taken. It was a bright moon-light night. I am sure the prisoner is the man: I did not see any body else going by: the street is a public street.</p>

            , I am a wine merchant, in Coventry Street. I heard a cry of, stop thief, about half after ten at night, on the eight of May. I saw two men running up Oxendon Street from Panton Street. Seeing the prisoner, I crossed the road to lay hold of him. The two men were at some distance; the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310028"></xptr> man was pursuing the prisoner; I laid hold of him almost instantly after hearing the cry of stop thief: I felt a black cloak in his breast; I believe this is the cloak, there was a mob came round; I took him down another street, and at the top of the street we met Mrs. Spicer, she said, that is the man, that is him; he was taken to the watch-house and the cloak taken from him by force.</p>

I was going upon duty on the 8th of May about a quarter after ten at night, I saw the prisoner in custody going to the watch-house; I went to the watch-house and demanded the cloak from him; he said he would not give it up, it was his property: it was buttoned in his coat, I was obliged to have a scuffle with him, and threw him down on his back to get it from him.

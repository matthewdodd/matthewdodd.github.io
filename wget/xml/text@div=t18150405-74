            . I live at Twickenham. On Saturday, the 17th of September, I observed a lug boat by the edge of the River Thames, between eight and nine in the evening, it was rather dark; she was laying at a wharf by the Thames side, at Twickenham; I heard some men at work shoveling coals; I went to Mr. Turner, knowing he had a lug boat of that description; I and Mr. Turner went to the wharf; I found the boat fastened to the wharf. I spoke to the men who were at work; I could not distinguish who the men were; I spoke to them about the impropriety of the time they were at work, and whose coals they were. Mr. Turner asked them who they were; they made no answer. Mr. Turner then left me; Rednap came on shore; I went towards him; he went into the boat again, and cut the cord that it was fastened by; Rednap I knew; I cannot say who the others were; one of them cut the hawser, and the boat went off. Mr. Turner came and took a boat, and went after it; we found the boat on the Twickenham side, on the heigth, there were a number of coals in the bottom of the boat; it turned out to be Mr. Turner's boat, the Henry. Moore was taken; he escaped.</p>

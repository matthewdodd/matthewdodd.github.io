                  </hi>. I am an architect and surveyor, of Lewisham—on 26th August I was in London Wall about 2.30, and missed my watch from my outside pocket at my side; it had a chain to it—I had looked at it half a minute before—a constable spoke to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 26th August about 1.15 I saw the prisoner and another man in front of Broad Street Railway Station—they felt several gentlemen's coat-tail pockets—I then saw them in London Wall—the prisoner went on the prosecutor's right side, and placed his right hand under his left arm near the prosecutor's pocket; he remained in that position half a minute, and suddenly left him and touched a man with his elbow who was standing behind him, named Cornelius Lynch—the prisoner walked down London Wall very idly—I spoke to the prosecutor, who detained me some time, and I lost the prisoner—I then proceeded to Spitalfields, and was giving his description to another officer when the prisoner and Lynch crossed the road—I went through Fashion Court and Flower and Dean Street—a metropolitan officer caught Lynch, and I caught hold of the prisoner, but had to let him go again.</p>

I was with Downs, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of what he said I took Lynch—I saw the prisoner at the corner of Fashion Street—some people closed round Downs, and he had to let the prisoner go—on 28th November I met the prisoner again in the Minories, and took him—he said he had been at his sister's all day.</p>

I asked her to pawn my waistcoat, which she did for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Mr. Cathey's, and gave me the ticket, which was in the name of Ann Driscoll. I stopped at her place till 2 o'clock, and then went to Brick Lane. I saw two men running in Fashion Street, one turned up Fashion Court and the other into Brick Lane. When I got into the court I saw one of them in the arms of the policeman; the other officer came up and said, "I believe you were with this man."—I said, "No." I have been at work since that, and was taken on 28th November. I know no more of the watch than the dead. One man has been punished for it already. My sister is very ill and unable to appear.</p>

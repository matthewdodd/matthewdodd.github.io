               <p>Q. You at last found that she was at Rochester. - A. Yes; I followed her to Rochester. I started at two o'clock in the morning, Tuesday the tenth of May, I found her at the Duke's Head at Rochester, where she had slept; she was not then up; it was about eight o'clock in the morning when I found her; I requested the servant maid to knock at the door to say that she wanted the candlestick to clean; she got up to open the door to give the maid the candlestick; I stepped in and kept her in her shift, as she was; she asked what brought me there; I told her she had brought me there, I wanted her and a few of the bank notes; she requested me to let her dress herself; I told her she should not dress herself till I had searched the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You put her in the hands of your brother officer. - A. Yes. She said it was of no use to search the room, to go to the bed; if I would look under the pillow, I should find all I wanted; we did look under the pillow; I found bank notes to the amount of two hundred and fifteen pounds; I found one for thirty pound, one forty pound, five twenty pounds each, two five pound each, one ten pound, and twenty five one pound each; I found in gold, three guineas and a half, thirteen seven shilling pieces, a dollar, four half-crowns, and twenty shillings in sixpences and shillings together, and fourteen pence in copper, making in the whole two hundred and twenty five pound ten shillings and eight pence; I told her that was not all that I wanted, for she had taken two hundred and forty five pound; she said that it was all that she had got left, she had been buying some new things that were under the bed, and the rest she had spent; she said that she should not have taken it from the man, only he had behaved so very mean to her; he had only given her a shilling, she thought she had a right to help herself to more.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Have you seen any of the notes. - A. No, none; but the officer has got them; I know the thirty and the forty; there are no marks on any of them.</p>

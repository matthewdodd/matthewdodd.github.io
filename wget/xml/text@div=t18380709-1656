                  </hi>. I live in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street, and am an oil refiner. On the 16th of June I was at the house of a friend, in white-cross-street—the prisoner lived in the house—I never saw him before—I got intoxicated—he came up into the room, and said he would see me safe home, and so he did—I lost a sovereign and a half, which I had wrapped in a bit of paper in my waistcoat pocket—I missed it when I got home—I gave him a pot of ale on the way, to the best of my recollection—I was very drunk, and did not know what I was doing—I had a basin and hand<lb></lb>kerchief in my hand, in which I took my victuals to the Rosemary Branch,</p>

               <p>where I worked—he brought that back, and broke it—I missed my money as soon as I went home—I pat my hand into my pocket, and had not a farthing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I did not offer to lead him home—Mr. and Mrs. O'Hara requested me to take him home, which I did—we went to three houses, the Jack of Newberry, the Pied Horse, and the last was the Black Dog, at the corner of Long-alley; and between there and Peter-street he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wrapped in one or two pieces of writing paper, with this handker<lb></lb>chief, and a small basin, which I was to deliver back to O'Hara, but I had had a good deal of drink, and I fell in with one or two more in the same line with myself—I went to more houses, and got very drunk, and the money was in my hat and the handkerchief.</p>

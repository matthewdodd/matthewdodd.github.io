                  </hi>. I live at Staines, and keep a brick-field there. On Saturday evening, 18th September, about 7 o'clock, I was on my premises—I saw the prisoner pass me—it is about 200 yards from Mr. South's stacks—I walked round the premises and on to the top of my kiln, and about four or five minutes after the prisoner had passed me I heard some one halloo "fire"—I saw the stacks on fire, and ran towards them and met the prisoner—it was he who cried "fire"—he was coming from the fire towards my premises—he apprised me of the fire and he was hallooing "fire" at the same time—I said to him, "Why, it is not above three or four minutes since that you passed me"—he said "No, it is not"—I said, "Did not you observe it when you went towards the stacks?"—he said no, he did not; that he had got some twenty or thirty yards past when he heard a crackling like fire, and he turned his head round and saw the stacks on fire—I said, "Did you not observe any one run from the stacks?" he said, "I did not"—I went and apprised Mr. South of the fire as early as I could—I then came back to the fire—a police-sergeant came and spoke to me about it, and I gave him information.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, T</hi> 27). On the night of 18th September I saw the prisoner at the fire—he was standing in the road about twenty yards from the ricks; they were then both on fire—he was standing looking on with others, with his hands in his pockets—I asked him if be saw the fire break out—he said he did; that he was passing along the road and heard a crackling noise as of a fire—I asked him if he saw any person near the rick—he said, "No"—I asked him if any person could have been near the rick without his seeing them—he said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185810250032"></xptr>
               <p>no, he did not believe anybody was there—I asked if he had been in the field where the ricks were—he said, no, he was passing along the road and he had passed the ricks about thirty or forty yards—he stated that he had come from Gosport, and had been to Feltham seeking employment—after that he went into the town of Staines—I followed him and told him that I should take him into custody on suspicion of setting fire to the stacks—he hesitated some minutes; I then told him he must go to the station—he said, "Well, I am glad you have taken me, I did it and I should be sorry to see any innocent man taken; I felt as if I could not go away"—I then took him to the station—he stated that he went to lay down under the stacks and in lighting his pipe it ignited the ricks—I searched him and found a pipe in his pocket—I cannot say whether the pipe had been lighted, it had no tobacco in—it was an old pipe—it had been used.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, T</hi> 26). I remember this burning of Mr. South's stacks—I saw the prisoner that evening at the fire—I asked him how long he had passed—he said he had gone about one hundred yards by the rick, he heard a crackling noise and turned round and found it was the ricks on fire, and he then went and gave information to Mr. Catlin in the brick-field—I asked him if he had seen any person near at the time—he said, yes, there was a man in front of him with a blue frock on, and he went on the road towards Staines—I asked him if he had seen him since—he said he had not—on the Monday, as I was taking him to the Sunbury bench of Magistrates, I asked him where he came from, as I should write down to the place to enquire about him—he said he had come from a place called Frater, near Gosport, where he had been working at a barracks; he then told me that he went to lie down under the rick, that there was a hole in the rick, that he had been smoking a pipe previously, that he put the pipe into his waistcoat pocket and set fire to some lucifers which he had in his pocket, and in throwing them out of his pocket he set fire to the rick—I examined his waistcoat pocket; there were no marks of any fire—another constable was present at the time—this was on the 20th—he had been taken on Saturday night, the 18th, by Atter—he is a stranger in the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, at Staines, in Middlesex—I had two ricks of oats on Saturday, the 18th September; they were burnt down on that evening—they were worth 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had that from the County fire<lb></lb>office for them, where I was insured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had walked that day nearly forty miles—I had been at the new Reformatory schools which are building at Staines, where I was told I could get employment—I could not get any—I was very tired and footsore, I had no money, and I thought I would lie down under the stack for a few hours before I started back for Gosport, a distance of sixty miles—I was smoking as I came down the road, a man up at the works had given me a pipe of tobacco—when I got to the rick I thought it would be dangerous to lie down there with my pipe alight, and I shoved it into my waistcoat pocket—I had three or four matches there, and I had hardly shoved the pipe in when they began to <hi rend="italic">fizz</hi>—I turned them out, and there being a lot of loose</p>

               <p>straw there, the matches set the straw alight; I stamped upon it but could not put it out—I then directly ran to give information—if a bucket of water could have been got then it would have been put out—does it appear feasible that an entire stranger as I was should have done it wilfully?—that I did do it is true, and no one can be more sorry for it than I am, but I am as innocent of setting fire to it wilfully as any one of the jury; if I had been guilty I should not have waited about there for four hours and upwards, I could have gone away and no one could have stopped me—I am charged with setting fire to two stacks, but I only set fire to one—I went into the town with the policeman, and I had gone before that to his house on purpose to tell him, and his wife told me that he had gone up the town—he did not take me into custody, I gave myself up, fearing that if I left, some one belonging to Mr. South might be taken up for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOUTH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). There was some loose straw, but it was a distance away from the ricks, I should say five or six yards; there were no holes in the ricks, no pigs had been turned into the field; there was no signs of any person having been sleeping there—the ricks were about ten yards from the road—I last saw them before the fire between 12 and 1 o'clock that same day.</p>

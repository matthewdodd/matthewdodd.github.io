             sworn. - I live opposite the prosecutor; I was going next door to Mr. Moses's shop to buy some paper; it is a single bow-window, and was well lighted; I saw the prisoner go up to the window, and a man, within a few yards of him, standing still; what made me look at the window principally was, to look at some bottle-labels which I meant to cheapen, and I thought I saw something draw from the window, and I went up, and saw the boy in the act of drawing the shoes out; he had one shoe in his hand, and the other in the window; they were fastened together; he was endeavouring to extricate it from the glass; I went up to him; says I, "you rascal, what are you about?" he said, "nothing, sir," and ran away; I followed him, and another person took possession of him before I got up, but he was never above three yards from me; he was never out of my sight from the time I pursued him till he was taken; Mr. Moses's servant took the shoes in, and put them by, and the boy was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him with his hand within the glass? - A. Yes; he had one hand within the glass, and the other outside.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Abraham Moses.) Were there any other shoes lost besides this pair? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mistress in the shop at the time? - A. Yes.</p>

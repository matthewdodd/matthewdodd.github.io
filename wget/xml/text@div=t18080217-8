               <p>Q. How many yards were there. - A. Twenty-one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the price. - A. It is marked with the prime cost; three shillings and three pence a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put it. - A. I cannot say on what part of the counter; when I took it out of the window I placed it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss it. - A. I did not miss it at all till I was applied to by another witness before the prisoner came in; I had seen it half an hour before.</p>

I gave the silk into the hands of Mr. South.</p>

             said when he came near the prosecutor's shop, he saw the prisoner drop the silk on the ground; it came from some part of her clothes; that created a suspicion in his mind; he took it up and asked her how she came by it; she said what is that to you; upon which he very properly gave the alarm to the prosecutor, and immediately she was taken. Mr. South tells you it is his property, it was stolen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170009"></xptr>out of his shop. In order to constitute it a capital offence it must be of the value of five shillings; according to the evidence the prime cost was much more. If you have any doubt about it, you will give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt.</p>

On the evening of the 20th of August, about eight o'clock, while two boys were in the shop - the prisoner came to sell apples - she dropped some apples down and then went out; when she was gone there was a 5 s. paper of copper missed off the counter; I had seen it there just before - it was my father's property; I believe I have seen that parcel since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know what was in the paper? A. No, it was taken for 5 s., worth of copper in change for a sovereign - I had not opened them - she was in the habit of coming to our shop - she had been there to leave a quilt, on which I lent her 3 d., and she said she would give me 4 d. for it, but I said I would only take the 3 d.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Ross's shop, and saw the prisoner take a little parcel off the counter in whitey-brown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150087"></xptr>paper; I cannot tell what was in it; it seemed to be penny-pieces; they were as large and as round, and were in two rolls. I did not say any thing about it then, but I told Harriett Ross afterwards, that I saw the old woman take something off the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did any one tell you that the parcel had penny pieces in it, or any thing like penny pieces? A. I thought they looked like it; I did not hear at the office anything about penny pieces, and was not offered any money; the officer did not tell me to swear, but asked me what I saw her do - I said I saw her take something off the counter and I thought it was penny pieces.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has your father had any conversation with you since you saw the woman in the shop? A. No, but the officer has told me since what he thought was in it.</p>

            . I am constable of Clerkenwell. I went with Miss Ross to the prisoner's lodgings, on the 20th of August, about eight o'clock, in the evening, at No. 8, Woodbridge-street; I found her at home, and told her I wanted her for a felony - and Miss Ross told her, she was suspected of taking some coppers from her room; she then kneeled down at the foot of the bed, and began to pull some Gilberts about, and said, "You see I have got none." I then took her back to the room, and in the very same spot in which she had kneeled down, I found 3 s. in copper-pennies, and 3 d. on her shelf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she say she was saving up 9 s., to pay her rent? A. Not then - but she did on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>HARRIET ROSS re-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you at the office? A. Yes. Dymock's father said, his son had not a right memory, and did not wish him to be examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been with a bushel of apples, and had not sold them all.</p>

On Monday the 2nd of April, about six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar, in company with another woman, came into the shop and asked me to shew them some caps; while the other woman was looking at some caps, I observed the prisoner pulling the things on the counter; the other woman paid for the cap, and they both went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was on the counter - A. There were shawls and other things on the counter; before they had been out two minutes they returned again, and the other woman desired me to shew them some ginghams for frocks; the prisoner took her apron up as soon as she got to the counter and just looked at it, she threw it over some things on the counter; I observed her putting her hand under her apron and pulling some things off the counter; I shewed the gingham to the other person; she bought half a quarter of a yard; she gave me six pence, it came to three pence; when I went to the till for the halfpence, I told Mr. Janeway that I thought the prisoner had been taking some thing off the counter. I laid hold of her immediately; I told her that I thought she had something belonging to us; she asked me what I meaned, and shook herself, and the two shawls dropped from under her clothes; while I got over the counter she ran out; I followed her and took her about an hundred yard off, brought her back and gave charge of her to the constable.</p>

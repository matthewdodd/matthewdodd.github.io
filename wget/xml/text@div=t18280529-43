On the 16th of April I engaged the prisoner and three more as extra waiters; the glasses used were mine - there was a dinner there; the waiters did not leave till between one and two o'clock in the morning - some plate was missing; I asked the prisoner if he had seen it - he said not; I told him to go down stairs, and thinking he looked bulky, I followed, brought him back, and found three wine-glasses in his pocket, which I had not missed; he gave no account of them - he was intoxicated.</p>

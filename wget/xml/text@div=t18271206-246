On Saturday, the 17th of November, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was going out for my milk, I saw Shans' street door open, and two women coming out, with their aprons full of something; I saw two other women go in, within three minutes after - the prisoner was one of those I saw come out; she was the outside woman, and had her apron full; I did not know her before - I am quite sure she is one of them.

In consequence of information, and a description of the person, I and Rigg took the prisoner, and put her in the watch-house; we took another woman with her - Mrs. Holt identified the prisoner at the watch-house.

            . I am a constable of Bethnal-green. The prisoner was brought to me on Friday night, about half-past nine o'clock - I found nothing on her but the key of her lodging.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday night I spoke to Rigg, near the Olive Branch public-house, and he said,"Let me have none of your noise to-night - you are very abusive when in liquor;" and on the Friday night following I went with a young woman to have some drink; he came over, held up his light, and took me to the watch-house - Holt said at first that I had a bundle, which she thought was was broken victuals.</p>
               <p>ANN HOLT re-examined. It did not seem like broken victuals; it was bulky, and more like wearing-apparel than any thing else.</p>
               <p>JAMES GLIBBERY re-examined. The prisoner lives about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutrix's; she gave me a false direction the first night, but next morning she gave me a right direction; I found the place, and searched it, and when I went in I found the bed was warm, though I had the key in my pocket.</p>

            . I am a Leghorn trimming weaver, and live at No. 1, Shepherd's-court, Old Nichols-street, in the adjoining room to the prisoner. On the Friday night she came home very much in liquor, between ten and eleven o'clock - she asked me for a light, which I gave her; and at three in the morning, I was taken very ill, and called out,"Maria Smith, are you in bed?" she said Yes, and asked if she should get up; I said No: I laid awake till seven, when my husband went out, and she asked me what time it was - I went into her room at nine, and she asked me to lend her a few halfpence, to get a breakfast. This was last Friday three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived there? A. She had lived there about a fortnight before the robbery; a young man used to come backwards and forwards to her; he was there that Friday night; they occupied a ready furnished room, up one pair of stairs - I remember the officer searching that room; the young man had slept there the night before the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get in? A. I think he drew the staple of the door. The prisoner keeps good hours - I do not know how she gets her living; she comes home about eleven or ten o'clock; I do not know whether the young man is her husband - I do not know what he is called. I go to bed about half-past nine or ten o'clock; my husband is a cabinet-maker, and has worked for Mr. Wright nearly four years, and I work when I can get any.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so particularly remember the night in question? A. Because she came to my door for a light - she has done so before. I get up about half-past eight o'clock - I did not get up that morning till near nine; the prisoner was not up when I went into her room; I spoke to her about three o'clock, about seven, and again at nine; I have been taken ill before, and called to her. There is no lock to our street door, only a small latch. I do not know how she or the young man get their bread.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living in Teal-street, Bethnal-green—on the morning of 5th July, I was in Cutler-street—I saw the prisoners there, and a third person who was behind—they came towards me; and as I suspected they meant to rob me, I watched them narrowly—Smith came up on my right, and Williams on my left—I caught his hand in my waist<lb></lb>coat pocket—he broke the bow of the watch completely off—I secured his hand, and said, "You have robbed me"—Smith then rushed towards me, and I seized hold of them both—I called to an acquaintance to take one in custody, and I would take the other—Williams dropped the watch—we were struggling about a quarter of an hour—a great many thieves came up—there were about twenty in front—I am an old officer, and know them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Teal-street, a little behind the last witness—I saw him seize the prisoners—there was a struggle, and I held one after he had got away from Rowland—I told him I should not lose sight of him, for he had got the watch—when the policeman came up, he dropped it.</p>

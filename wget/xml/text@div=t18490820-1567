                  </hi>. I have missed a great quantity of buck<lb></lb>ram; the prisoner had access to it—there was an order that he should only give work out between six and eight o'clock in the evening—he was ordered par<lb></lb>ticularly not to give any out before I came down in the morning; that was at eight o'clock—on 29th June, two persons named Smith and Newsom were working on the premises, from whom I received some information—the pri<lb></lb>soner's place was searched on 12th July for this property among other—I give out, perhaps, 200 pieces of buckram in a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter. On 29th June, I and my man Newsom were painting Mr. Osborne's premises—I got there that morning, about half-past six o'clock—a few minutes past seven I saw the prisoner go into the warehouse, and a few minutes afterwards a man came across from the opposite side, and went in also, in a very suspicious way, as I thought; instead of going straight up the steps, he went past, and turned round and came back again—I cannot say whether he was opposite when the prisoner went in—there were two boys on the other side; one of them crossed over, and I saw the man come out and give him three or four pieces of buckram in a bag—the boy walked off—the second boy then came across, and had some in the same way—the bags were big enough to hold a dozen pieces—I swear it was buck-ram, the ends were outside—it was a sort of light colour, not quite white-there were three or four pieces in each bag—the bags were white calico or linen—the man afterwards came out, and followed the boys—I did not see the prisoner come out—I gave information to the prosecutor's mother the same day.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you since seen the man who came out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have pointed him out—I am quite sure it was the 29th and not 30th, because I was not engaged there on 30th—I was standing close to the shutters when I saw it—my man was there; I called his attention to it—I was taken into custody once concerning some things stolen from Messrs. Champions', the distillers, where I was at work—I was let go, and rewarded—after I was examined against the other prisoners, they were acquitted.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in prison a week? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; some of the men at work at Messrs. Champions' had been robbing them of cuttings, and their own men robbed them of pickles and other things—I was at work there at the time, and was taken—I was discharged by the Magistrate, and the prose-cutors gave my father 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a compensation; I was then eighteen years old. <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT NEWSOM</hi>. I was at work at Mr. Osborne's; at a little after seven o'clock I saw a man go into the shop; the prisoner came out immediately, looked up and down the street, went in again, and I then saw him talking to the man—the man then came out with two bags of buckram, and beckoned a boy who was at the corner—he came and fetched them away—he gave both bags to one boy—when the boy got to the corner, another boy took one bag—Mr. Smith said to me, "Do you think that is right?"—I said, "That is no business of mine," and did not stop them.</p>

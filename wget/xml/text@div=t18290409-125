            . I am headborough of Christ-church. -The witness came to me about a quarter past five o'clock, and stated he had been robbed of his watch, spectacles, and 2s.; he did not particularly describe the woman, but described the way in which he had been robbed; he appeared to me to be sober - he talked like a sober man -I did not go any where with him then, but about eight o'clock I went with my partner into Wentworth-street - we were standing at the corner of George-street - the prisoner passed us; the prosecutor said "That is the person who took my watch;" we took her to the watch-house - he said there positively that she was the woman.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he at all describe the person who had robbed him? A. He did not describe her particularly - but in the street he said she was the person: he did not appear to have been drinking; I found nothing on her that the prosecutor claimed.</p>

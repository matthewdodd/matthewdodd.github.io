             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker's servant. On Monday the 17th of November, the prisoner at the bar, about half past three o'clock in the afternoon, came into our house, situated in York-street, Westminster, she offered this sheet to pledge, on taking the sheet, I saw a figure of three on it, and it appeared to me, at first sight, as though a mark had been picked out, and from the fineness of the sheet, I had a very strong suspicion that she had not come honestly by it, she offered it as her own, it is a very large sheet, it is about three yards and half in length, and ellwide linen. In consequence of this I asked her several questions, she gave me several unsatisfactory answers, I perceived something in her apron, and just taking down her apron, I see this other sheet, that confirmed my suspicions, because on one there was the whole initial in full. I. T. A, and the same Number, on which I did not inspect the other sheet any farther, but concluded at once that the mark was picked out of this that she offered, in consequence of this, I sent off immediately to the police office, and got a constable and gave her in charge.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080184"></xptr>Q. Did you see Miss Sharp at the office? - I did, the next day, and she claimed the sheet.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable at the police office, Queen's-square; I took her into custody, I know little further than having charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the goods? - The pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Pawnbroker. I have kept the goods the whole time.</p>
               <p>Miss Sharp. These two sheets I delivered to the prisoner, they are Mr. Jones's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came to my day's work at five o'clock in the morning, at three o'clock my mistress gave me leave to go for these pair of sheets, and I used to go to Mr. Jones's one Monday for the sheets, and carry them clean the next. I went about three o'clock, and after I had been in for the sheets, and come out, I met a woman, that asked me to buy a pair of shoes for one shilling, and I saw a pawnbroker's facing me, and I ran into the door, and asked him for a shilling for that sheet, and he looked at the sheet, and asked me whose it was? - I said, it is mine, and I said I would come as soon as I had done with the day's work, and fetch it out, and he sent to Queen's-square for a constable, and he took me to the justice's, and I never see the justice in my life before. I have had three gentlemen to speak for me here, four days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer at 5, Skinner-place, Leaden<lb></lb>hall-market—on 28th July I employed the prisoner to mend some windows in my bed-room on the second floor—I had a chest of drawers in that room, and in one of the drawers, which was locked, was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the key, which fits all the drawers, was in the lock of the bottom one—I have seen the note here; it is the same I lost; it has the name of Mrs. Tindall upon it, the lady who paid it to me—my little boy was sent up with the prisoner, and afterwards left the room—I saw the prisoner at the window, and afterwards when he came down—my wife came and asked me if I had taken the note out of the drawer—I said "No"—the prisoner must have heard that—she said it was gone—I said I would go and look myself—I went up, and it was missing, and I came down and told the prisoner that a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note had been lost which was there when he went into the room—he said he knew nothing of it, he had not got it—I had only received the note the day before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—on 28th July I told my little boy to go up and show the prisoner where to put the glass in, and I would be there in a few minutes—he afterwards came across to the shop—previous to that I had missed the prisoner from the window some few minutes—I could see the window from the shop, and thought it was very strange he should be so long from the window; I was just going across as he and my little boy came out—the prisoner said, "Will you pay me?"—I said, "No, not till I have been upstairs"—he trembled and changed coun<lb></lb>tenance when I said that, and I said "I shall not be many minutes"—I found all the drawers had been opened, and the things left out of the drawers—the top drawer, where the money was, was locked and the key put back again in the bottom drawer—the key had not been out of my pocket ten minutes previous to his going up into the room—when I came down the prisoner said again, "Will you pay me?"—I said, "No, I must go across to the shop"—I went and told my husband that the note was missing, and he went to look for it and told me to keep my eye on the prisoner—I looked in the house and did not see him there, and then I saw him come up a pas<lb></lb>sage—when my husband came down the prisoner said, "You can search me, and have a policeman; I have not got it; I have not been anywhere"—I said, "Yes, you have, you have been up the passage"—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was found by a lad from the next shop, who was sweeping up some pieces of paper, just where the prisoner was standing.</p>

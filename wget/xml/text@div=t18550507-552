               <p>Friday, 13th—Caddick was taken into custody on the Saturday; the napkin was found on the Sunday; the other three prisoners were taken on the Monday—I did not put down the words that were used by Ryan, but I instantly communicated them to the solicitor—I was down close by the cell at the time Ryan was speaking—that part is light; it is where the prisoners are—they have an opportunity of looking through the doors—I did not stand in a position where I could be seen—there were one or two more females in the cell in which Ryan was; there might hare been more—no names were mentioned in the course of these observations the first time—on the second occasion, Ryan spoke about what Caddick was going to saw—she said, "Caddick is going to say that he was in bed at the time I bought the linen."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure that it was not, "He was in bed, and he did not see me?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I think not—it might be; I will not be positive—I believe the words were, "He is going to say he was in bed, and did not see me."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman.</hi> 225). I remember Caddick being in custody on Sunday, 8th April—I had charge of the prisoners, and it was my duty to visit them—some conversation took place between me and Caddick—I had not said anything to him by way of inducement to him to make that statement, or used any threat—after referring to other matters he said, "There was a box of linen stolen from a waggon in the Saracen's Head-yard, on Good Friday morning, that was taken to No. 3, Holborn-buildings; it was unpacked and sold to a girl they call <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi> Ryan; she fives in Peter-street, at the corner of the first court on the right; the first door on the left"—he said, "She bought the linen"—I went the same Sunday afternoon with Smith to the house—I saw Ryan in the room—I said to her, I have some reason to believe that you have some linen that has been Stolen"—I told her I was a policeman, but she has known me a long time—she said, "I know nothing about it; you can search my place"—on searching, I found this napkin in one of the drawers of a chest of drawers—I examined it, and found it to bear the initials of those that had been stolen—I said, "This is one that has been stolen, where did you get it from?" she said, "I bought it on Good Friday morning, in Petticoat-lane"—I said, "What time?" she said, "At 3 o'clock in the afternoon"—I took the napkin, but I did not take her into custody then—she informed me she had only been confined a fortnight, and I thought it more desirable to let her remain—I knew I could find her at any time—I went on the Friday, and told her I must take her into custody for having that napkin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Caddick.</hi> The officer came to me on Sunday in the cell, and asked if I knew anything about that box of tea; I said, "Yes, I have heard about it," and he asked me if I knew about the box of linen, and I told him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He inquired of me. for Smith, and told me what he wanted him for—he told me he had made a statement to Smith, and he told me what he had told him—he began with stating about the tea—he said, "I am locked up here for stealing a chest"—I did not ask you whether you knew anything about the tea—I asked you no question—I asked you some questions about the tea after you told me—it was through what you said that we found the tea—I did not come to the cell and say that if you made a statement, it might get you off with less time; no, nothing of the kind—you said that you wished to speak the truth—I said I would represent the case to the Magistrate at Guildhall, and if he liked to let you be evidence, you might; there was no promise made.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was after he made the statement; when I came back, after we found the tea and the napkin, I said, "Well, I will represent the case to the Magistrate."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Caddick. Q.</hi> Did you not say, "Don't mention to the Magistrate that I came in to speak to you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not such a word.</p>

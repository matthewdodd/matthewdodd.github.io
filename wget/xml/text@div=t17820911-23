I am myself bred an anatomist, and recollecting the distortion that a man's face must have when he was crying, I could not be certain, as his face was different when I saw him in the compter, I saw he was the same person that had my trunk; I have now no doubt, I had a very good light at ten o'clock, at that time of year it is by no means dark.</p>

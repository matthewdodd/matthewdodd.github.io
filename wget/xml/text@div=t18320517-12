On the 19th of April, about eleven o'clock at night, or a quarter past, there were a few persons drinking in my tap-room - the street-door was not fastened; I went up into my bed-room, which is on the first floor, and as I opened the room door a man stood before me, in the room; I took hold of him by the arm, and screamed out - he did not speak nor struggle with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get away from you? A. Yes; I went part of the way down stairs with him, having hold of his arm; I never recollect seeing him before - I picked up a chisel down stairs, by the side of the bar; I do not know who dropped it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he partly drag you down stairs? A. I held him by the arm as he came part of the way down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pull you down? A. No, he never took hold of me - he appeared to want to get away; he was quite a stranger to me; he did not get out of my hands - I cannot swear to him - he got down stairs before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he given into custody in your house? A. A man was given into custody; nothing was taken out of my bed-room nor removed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The man got away from you, that is, you lost sight of him? A. Yes; I cannot swear to the prisoner's features, but his dress appeared the same - I will not swear he is the man I had hold of in my room, as I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you believe the man who was secured in your house is the man you found in your bed-room? A. I think he is the man; I believe he is, but cannot swear to his face.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before had you closed the door? A. About a quarter of an hour; we had no servant then - my father was out; I was in the bar with my mother - there were not many people in the tap-room; the door has a common lock with a brass handle - I did not tell the Magistrate I was not positive that it was fastened.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the examination the witnesses varied very much in their statements; the prosecutrix always persisted that she knew nothing of me - I had to shift my clothes and put a hat on, but she could not swear to me - the gentleman said I passed him in the passage, which I did, but I wish you to understand the parlour door is right at the foot of the stairs, and if I had come down there is a door leading right out into the street; and as I came down the passage I should come four or five yards out of my way, and run where I was sure to be taken; I came out of the parlour, hearing the cries - there were four or five others in the parlour at the time; it is a night-house - she never said any thing about a struggle before.</p>

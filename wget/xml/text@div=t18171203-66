            . I am a gardener, and live in Mr. Poynton's rents, I am one of his tenants. On the 6th of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went out, and heard somebody over in the garden - I called Lipscombe; we got over my rails into Mr. Poynton's garden; I heard somebody pulling up plants; as I was going towards one of the beds, I saw two men there; one of them gathered up the roses and ran away; I caught the prisoner stooping down in the act of pulling up the roses-i asked him what he did there? he said he wanted half a dozen to put in his garden; I took him out of the garden, I did not take him into custody, I knew him very well. There appeared to be about seventy-five rose trees torn up and taken away, which must be worth 3s. 15s. The prisoner was secured several days after.</p>

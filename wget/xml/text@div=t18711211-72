                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of Messrs. Braun and Co.—on the evening of 24th November, about 8 o'clock, I was in the Whitechapel Road, the prisoner and another man came up to me a short distance from the London Hospital, the prisoner struck me violently in the pit of the stomach, and I felt my watch being removed from my pocket—a constable came up and asked me what I had lost—the prisoner was still there, or within a very short distance—the other ran away—the prisoner was taken into custody—he was walking gently away—I have never seen my watch since—it was a gold one.</p>

On the evening of 24th November, about 8 o'clock, I was in company with Detective Shepherd and Mr. Freedman, a tailor, walking along the Whitechapel Road—I saw the prosecutor standing against the iron palisades by the London Hospital the prisoner standing in front of him and another man standing on left by his side—I saw the prisoner holding the prosecutor's waistcoat</p>

I was with Newman and Freedman on this evening—I and Freedman were walking in advance of Newman—I saw the prosecutor walking towards Bow, and the prisoner and another man walking towards Aldgate—the prisoner stopped the prosecutor; he drew back and gave him a deliberate blow with his fist in the belly, which knocked him against the iron railings—I saw him snatch something from the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket, and hand it over the shoulder to the other man—I followed the man, but he doubled and I lost sight of him—he ran nearly as fast again as I did—the prisoner was taken on the spot.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 7th of January I saw the two prisoners in Norton Falgate. In Downes's pocket I found a knife; we took them to the office that night, and they were examined; the next morning I heard that Mr. Alexander's shop had been robbed; I went to his shop and examined the window that was cut; the hole that was made in the putty in the window frame fitted the knife; there was putty on the knife at the time. I fitted it; I told Mr. Alexander; he sent me to a girl that saw them do it.</p>
               <p>Q We cannot hear that, the girl must tell that. - A. The girl is gone out of the way ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see the knife fitted to the hole in the putty. - A. Yes, it fitted the hole in the putty.</p>
               <p>COURT. These men were found cutting a window at another shop, half a mile distant; they say it fitted the hole in the putty at Mr. Alexander's shop window; a great many knives would fit the hole.</p>

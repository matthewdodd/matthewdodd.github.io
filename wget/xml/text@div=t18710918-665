                  </hi>. I live at 8, Caroline Road, Goswell Road—on Saturday, 12th August, about 8.20 or 8.30 p.m., I saw the prisoner and the deceased—the prisoner asked the deceased if he was a bricklayer—Kenny said "What are you?"—the prisoner said "I am a labourer"—Kenny said "Can you serve a bricklayer?"—the prisoner said "Yes, I can serve two if I like"—Kenny called him a liar—the prisoner left him, and came to speak to the young woman who I was speaking to—Kenny followed him—the prisoner told him to go away; he refused—the prisoner told him to go away three or four times, and Higgins put his hand upon him, and said "Go away; I have told you before what I want; I want eight bricklayers"—Kenny would not go, and the prisoner said "If you do not go away from me, I will <hi rend="italic">slash</hi> you in the b——y roe"—Kenny said "Maybe you would not," and the prisoner pushed him in the chest, and <hi rend="italic">staggered</hi> him back—he hit against another man, and they both fell—I went to pick the other man up, and Kenny got up, and laid hold of Higgins—they struggled, and Higgins brought him down on the flat of his back again—he got up, and made a rush at Higgins—they <hi rend="italic">tussled</hi> together, and Higgins flung Kenny on the ground—I then went away—they were both drunk, and so was the other man who was pushed down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not notice that the deceased was abusive before he was put on his back the first time—the prisoner pushed him away because he followed him—he said "Go away from me," but he would not—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187109180037"></xptr>
               <p>I think he had insulted the other man by asking if he was a bricklayer—I was present till the struggle ended—I saw no blows with the double fist, it was simply putting his hand and pushing him back—even during the struggle I did not see fists used, and I was close, to them and should have seen it if it had taken place—the prisoner being a powerful man to what the deceased was, he gave him a good throw, and he fell very heavily on the ground and twisted himself—I did not see Mrs. Dell there, but she might have been—I went away, and did not wait till it was over.</p>

I live at 114, Golden Lane—I saw a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> outside my shop, and saw the prisoner take Kenny up and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> him down very heavily, twice—they were struggling when I saw them—Kenny got up again, and a little time elapsed—he then went up to Biggins, who laid hold of him and threw him down again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about two yards from them—when Kenny got up after the first throw, he did not seize the prisoner by the dress—the grapple took place as soon as Kenny got up; the prisoner took him up and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> him down again—when a man is off his legs, a man can <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> him over his head—I saw no blow with a fist—this is correct in my depositions: "I saw the prisoner with a man in his arms throwing him over his hip"—it was as a wrestler would do, giving his body a twist—the deceased was full of drink, and his death occurred from rupture of the bladder—I cannot say whether that was caused by the twist—I did not see Mrs. Dell, but there was a great mob there—Callaghan was the other man who was knocked down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Johnson, a shoemaker, of 3, Nag's Head Court, Golden Lane—I saw the prisoner and Kenny talking angry—the prisoner asked Kenny whether he bad carried the had, or did carry it—he said "I can carry it," and they spoke across—the prisoner said "If you don't push away I will dash the front of your face in"—Kenny said "What for I" and the prisoner went towards him, and took him by his flesh, or his jacket, and threw him down flat on his back—Kenny got up and went towards the prisoner, to contest again, and the prisoner threw him down again on his back, and he got up again, crawled up the court, and stood against the wall about five minutes—I went and asked him if he was hurt—I saw him in bed next day, and took him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not there at the first—they both spoke angrily about the had—Kenny was several yards from his own door, it may be forty yards—he lives at the top of the court—he was about ten yards from Callaghan's door, who lives next door to me—Callaghan was in the lane, some yards from his own door—Kenny did not get up and go sharply towards the prisoner, he staggered.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Kenny did not exactly go up angrily, but the prisoner would not give him time to speak before he knocked him down again—he went up to ask him what he struck him for—I was there at the beginning, before any words or blows occurred—I did not hear what took place—I heard the prisoner say "I will throw you in the road"—I expect that Higgins went there to quarrel—I did not hear what he said about labourers—he was outside the barber's shop then, where Nolan came out of; he was not against the court then, he was a few yards further up—I was there when Higgins knocked the deceased down, but heard nothing said about carrying the had—I took Callaghan away, and persuaded him to have nothing to do with it—I do not know the prisoner personally, I have seen him once or twice—he and Kenny were both in liquor—I have seen the deceased drunk before—I had one glass with my husband and him, a share of a pot of beer—that was at 7 o'clock—I can drink a drop of beer, but not to get intoxicated—the police have not seen me intoxicated—I am not noisy and disorderly when I am in drink—I had not been drinking that evening, I was as sober as I am now—I had a share of a pot of beer, and there were four of us to drink it—I had no conversation with Callaghan—he did not tell me I was not there, and did not see it; that was when we came from Bagnigge Wells Police Court on the Monday—he said that I did not see the fight, and I said "If I was not there, how could I take your father away from the quarrel?"—Callaghan did not say that I had only just that minute come out of the Cock public-house—I was never in it.</p>

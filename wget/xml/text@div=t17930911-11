               <p>Q. Had you been drinking any where? - No, I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man or an unmarried man? - Unmarried. She accosted me, and proposed me to go with her to her lodgings in <placeName id="t17930911-11-crimeloc63">Dyott-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Quite sober? - Quite. When I came to her lodgings I had eight guineas in gold in my pocket, in a silk and cotton purse; I changed one and lost the seven, the silver I put loose in my pocket, I lost my purse likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when you lost it? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you drop it on the bed? - I am certain I did not, because I examined the bed, I put it into my pocket the last thing, and buttoned my pocket up in her sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You was on the bed with her I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively that you did not drop it on the bed? - Yes, I will, because I buttoned my pocket up before I went to the bed to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your money again? - No, I dropped one guinea and picked it up, and put it in my purse, and put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you miss it? - Instantly she run out of the chamber, and that gave me a suspicion. I felt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110017"></xptr>and my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you feel any thing? did not you feel any money go from you? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I was from him ten minutes before he missed his money? - I never said such a thing; I missed it immediately as she ran down stairs.</p>

I am a sailor—I joined the <hi rend="italic">Joseph Howe</hi> in Cardiff, about 7th December, 1860—Ritchie was then the master—the ballast was then partly out of her, she was not then ready to load with cargo—two or three days after I joined the ship, Ritchie left, and I then for a few days acted in command of the ship—she was afloat in the East Cardiff Dock when I joined her, and was making a little water, but not a great deal—she made water during the time we were at Cardiff and just about the same thing all the time I was in her—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I posted it to Mr. Ruxton myself—I wrote it at Cardiff—I see an account in it of the water the ship was making—on Friday, at 5 <hi rend="smallCaps">P.M</hi>. she was pumped out—she was then discharging her ballast in the inner dock, which is eighteen or nineteen feet deep, and in the state she was with her ballast half out, she drew twelve or thirteen feet—when we pumped her on Friday night, I see by this refresher here, that she had eleven inches and a half of water—I remember pumping her every night and morning.</p>

               <p>time as Portuguese Vice-Consul—St Paolo de Loando is a Consular port, and was in my jurisdiction—when a ship is to sail for that port, it is neces<lb></lb>sary that the captain should produce a manifest of his cargo to me, and also the bills of lading; and it is my duty to see that they agree—I then take a copy of the manifest, hut not of the bills of lading, as the contents of them are copied into the manifest—I keep one manifest, another is sent to the col<lb></lb>lector of customs at St. Paulo de Loando, and one is given to the captain to take, open; on the arrival of the ship, the cargo is checked by the manifest which I have forwarded—I believe Bertie cleared the ship, <hi rend="italic">Joseph Howe,</hi> before me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the manifest kept by me—it is signed by the captain—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the papers which I gave Bertie—I also sent a copy to St. Paulo de Loando.</p>

In the course of my business as an accountant, I have had great opportunities of learning the mode in which mercantile business is carried on—it is necessary to a certain extent in my business that I should be acquainted with the ruling prices of different com<lb></lb>modities—I was employed in this case to look into Ruxton's papers, and books—I received them from Carlisle—amongst others I received a parcel of papers tied up and ticketed "<hi rend="italic">Joseph Howe</hi>"—I found there a number of invoices, which I produce—I have compacted those invoices with the delivery tickets of the railway porter, and have a statement here showing the small points in which I have not been able to make them correspond—they do correspond, but with some trifling exceptions—I find hers two barrels and one tierce of sundries, four chests, and one trunk, received at car<lb></lb>diff, which I cannot identify with the goods received by the invoices—they are in the railway accounts, and I cannot find corresponding invoices—there are invoices for small goods, which, according to the ordinary course of business, would be packed in barrels and tierces to be sent by the railway—those small articles do not appear in the railway receipts—there are invoices for small articles in the railway accounts, barrels and tierces, otherwise they correspond exactly—among the invoices I find some for beer—I find an in<lb></lb>voice for 200 dozen quarts of pale ale, packed in fifty barrels, of four dozen each; 301 dozen pints of pale ale, packed in forty-three barrels of seven doze each; thirteen barrels marked R in a diamond, containing fifty-two dozen quarts of London stout; that makes ninety-three barrels, besides the thirteen of stout—I find no other invoices for beer—I believe a certain quantity of porter is taken as ship's stores—there is no mark in the invoice to the ninety-three barrels—I have seen the bill of lading which was pre<lb></lb>sented to the company—I have searched all Ruxton's papers, which were delivered to me, for invoices, but did not find any number of invoices which would make up the 800 dozen—there are a number of invoices and small accounts for amounts of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I see on one side an account of the goods, and on the other side the prices are carried out—I see a word here which may be "tons" or "tierces"—assuming it to be "tierces," it is quite impossi<lb></lb>ble that the prices could be the prices of those goods; it would be quite impossible to put one ton of cabin biscuits in a tierce, and supposing it to be "tons" the price could not correct, because the price given, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would be approximating to the price of a ton, it would be rather above the price of a ton of cabin biscuits, rather au excessive price, and the same with the</p>

               <p>other items—they are in the same category—the same remark would apply to the cabin biscuits and navy biscuits, the split peas, rice, and barley—the flour would be about the price, about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a barrel, or rather over—I have found amongst Ruxton's papers the accounts of the repairs done to the ship—there is an account of some repairs done in London before the vessel sailed for Cardiff, of I think 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I believe the vessel was put into the graving<lb></lb>dock—here is an account of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for repairs at Cardiff, from Bachelor Brothers, there—there was also a small account of Mr. Rumbelow's, for re<lb></lb>pairing the pumps:—the account was among the papers that were handed to me—I have not the account here, but I find the amount is ten guineas—I do not think there is any other account besides that:—I produce an account of a payment is Bertie—I find this, "Please pay per Captain Bertie, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and charge the same to same to my account, G. Ruxton"—it is an order on Mr. Car<lb></lb>roll, dated 22d December, 1860—I also find a receipt signed, "James Bertie," "Received of Mr. George Ruxton 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as wages, as master of the barque <hi rend="italic">Joseph Howe"</hi>—those were not pinned together; that was only done for the purpose of convenience—I also find an account of Mr. J. P. Carroll, the broker of the vessel, in which was enclosed an amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid to Bertie as captain of the vessel.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this vessel re-classed In London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe she was—I have had some experience in shipping matters—it depends upon the class whether it takes a good deal of money to re-class a vessel like the <hi rend="italic">Joseph Howe</hi>—(she was put into class A.E. 1, I think)—that is a point upon which I have no practical experience—I do not know what sum would be expended to get her re-classed—whether porter is usual in ship's stores, depends upon the liberality of the owner, and the length of the voyage—I believe this was a voyage of eight months, out and home—she was char<lb></lb>tered for a round voyage—I never heard of St. Paolo de Loando till now, and know nothing of the customs of that port, or of the African trade—I cannot tell you whether the Merthyr steam coal is one of the great things that steam shipping desires—I do not know the nature of the coal at Cardiff, and I have had no experience of the trade to the west coast of Africa—the biscuits I had to value, are called navy biscuits which are usually supplied to vessels.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you do with the papers after you received them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For a considerable time they were in the detective office at Liverpool, not in my custody—it was about 2d or 3d December that I searched the papers tied up and labeled "<hi rend="italic">Joseph Howe</hi>"—they were two or three weeks in the office of the detectives, till the end of September; they were not taken from that office at all—they were handed to me there, and I went backwards and forwards to that office for three weeks; they remained there for the purpose of my examination—an application was made in London for a warrant against the prisoner—the papers were then given into my custody, and I brought them up to London for the purpose of getting that warrant—they remained in my custody, and I returned them to the detective office, in Liverpool, tied up as before—since that they have been in the hands of the attorneys for the prosecution—they have been in my possession ever since, with the single exception of their being at the office for my inspection, and since that in the hands of the attorneys—I can say that when I first re<lb></lb>ceived the papers these documents were among them.</p>

               <p>the policeman to put them where they were before—I was in the habit of getting the key from the chief clerk, Mr. Featherstone, of Liverpool—I can undertake to say that before the papers were removed, these papers were among them—I never saw Ruxton in my life before the inquiry at Liver-pool.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you see that it is carried out thirty-five in the corner in pencil? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is thirty in the corner—I see these words, which are either "tons" or "tierces"—I think the "n" is like the "n" in "cabin"—I should read it "turns"—it is not the best writing, and taking it as bad writing, I take it to be "n"—this little mark below the level of the "n" I take to be a defect in the paper—I am looking at it very carefully with a magnifying glass, because there is a little break—it is not very easy writing to decipher, but to the best of my judgment the word is "tons."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

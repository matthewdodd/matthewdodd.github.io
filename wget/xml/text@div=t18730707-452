My husband keeps the Stafford Hotel, Westbourne Villas—the prisoner was his barman till 31st October, or November lst—I usually go to bed first, and my husband sits up to count the money, but on 18th June we went up together, and at 1.30 I heard a noise under the bed, my husband got up and got a light, and I saw a man under the bed—I went into another room to fetch the barman, and when I returned my husband was holding the prisoner, saying "You vagabond, what do you come here for?"—he said "I have come for money"—he was given in custody.</p>

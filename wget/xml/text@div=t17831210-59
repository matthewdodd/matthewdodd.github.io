               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an indictment for the crime of forgery, and before this offence could be carried into effect, the person committing it must also have been guilty of the crime of perjury, for he must have sworn he was the executor under that will, by which means he obtained the probate. Some time since, a man of the name of Farquharson died; the prisoner by some means heard, that enquiries were making for his executor, for there was a great deal of wages due to him. That gave the prisoner the idea of setting up a will; he immediately went to the Commons, and there produced a will in the name of

               <p>Is it part his hand-writing? - None at all as far as I can judge, it is neither spelt nor wrote like it.</p>

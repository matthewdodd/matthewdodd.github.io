On Thursday the 4th of March I was in my parlour, and saw a person pass before the window very quickly - he was in my garden, where he had no business. I went to the kitchen door at the back of the house, and found a leather bag in the garden outside the house; I had hung it up, with the watch in it, between nine and ten o'clock that morning, by the kitchen door, inside the house. I found the watch was gone - Slatter brought it back to me in about twenty minutes.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 4th of March, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, as I came from Clapton, and was crossing the fields, I met the prisoner running, and presently I heard the lady had lost her watch. I returned and overtook him; he was still running - and just before I got to him I saw him take the watch from his right-hand side and throw it into the shrubbery. Dimond was coming towards him, and I called to him to stop him, while I got the watch. I saw him throw it away - it appeared like a gold watch. Dimond followed and secured him. I had been over the pails and found the watch - (looking at it) - this is it. I am sure he is the man who threw it away. I gave it to Mrs. Davis, and saw the prisoner delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DIMOND. I am a labourer. I met the prisoner running, and Slatter pursuing him. I saw him go to the pailing, and put his hand over as if to throw something over, but I did not see it in his hand. There was a cry of Stop him, when he came up to me, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, nonsense, they do not mean me." I passed him, but afterwards pursued him and saw him getting over a high gate; I followed him across a field, and over a hedge, and took him at last nearly up to his middle in water, in a ditch; he said,</p>
               <p>"Pray do forgive me, pray let me go;" and as we went along, he said voluntarily,</p>
               <p>"I went into the kitchen, and took the watch."</p>
               <p>MRS. DAVIS. The watch is mine; it is gold, and worth 5 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a poor man, have a wife and seven children, and beg for mercy.</p>

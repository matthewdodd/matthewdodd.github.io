A. Yes - I did not owe him any thing; I had lent him money on the 2nd of April, to take his clothes out of pawn, and he had not paid me - his duty was to <rs id="t18310512-14-deflabel99" type="occupation">carry out meat</rs>

On the 12th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, he came to my house - I did not see any horse and cart there; he asked if I knew what an awkward predicament I stood in - I said No; he said there was a man coming to arrest me at twelve o'clock - I did not know what he meant; he told me it was a man, whom he considered I owed money to for rent - I was very much agitated when he told me that, and went out to call on a friend to endeavour to get some money; I called at a place in Market-street, St. James' - I went to endeavour to berrow some money towards paying this man.</p>
               <p>Q.When the prisoner said this, did you not ask him who the man was? A. I knew his name very well; he said a person named Barron was coming to arrest me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe Barron any money? A. I had left him 7l. worth of fixtures, and asked him to let the house, which I occupied of him, before I went to Grosvenor-street - he was the landlord of that house; there was 7l. between us for fixtures - it was not a disputed debt; I left him 7l. worth of fixtures, and asked him to let the house, and make the best he could of the fixtures - I had paid the other quarter's rent, and there was a current quarter running; I was answerable for the ensning quarter, and he was answerable to me for the 7l. worth of fixtures, which would just over the quarter's rent - it was 28l. a year; the prisoner said he had seen Barron, and that he was coming to arrest me; I went to Miss Bunn, a relation by marriage, to borrow the money - she could not accommodate me; I was alarmed, fearing I should be arrested, and went further, but did not get the money that day - I got some lent me the next morning, and went and paid 
               <persName id="t18310512-14-person209">Barron</persName>
             some.</p>

               <p>Q.When you went out, who did you leave in care of your property? A. The prisoner - he was to remain there till I returned; he was in care of my house and furniture, and nothing was to be toueched till I came back - he promised to stay and take care of my house till I returned; I was absent two or three hours, or rather better, and then returned, but my son, who is fifteen years old, had come down to Market-street; when I returned I found all my property gone out of the house - the place was completely stripped of every thing that was there; there was not a thing left.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the prisoner shown you any paper or any thing? A.Nothing at all; he merely said Barron was going to arrest me - the prisoner was gone as well as the property; I went to look for my property immediately - I called on Mr. Eley, in Henry-place, Waterloo-road, about a bill, and there found a pair of sheets; I went there because my son directed me there - Eley's is a private house; I went there again with a Policeman, and found a tea-cannister there, which was mine; I had left the sheets safe at home when I went out - I afterwards found my drawers, my china, blankets, sheets, beds, and almost every thing there; I still miss a number of things; I value all I lost at more than 20l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Eley produce any receipt to you? A. No - I gave him a receipt for 11s. 9d. for meat, because he said he had paid that to the prisoner; the prisoner had no right to take away my property - he was not permitted by me to take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Have you ever gone by the name of Simpson? A. No; I know Wooley - he is an attorney; he was employed by me to recover money from one Hill.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at this, which is Wooley's receipt for the debt and coats in an action, Simpson Q.Hill? A. Yes; it was a debt left to me by the will of

            , and Mrs. Simpson went to the court, and administered for me - the prisoner was four or five weeks in my service, and he had formerly lodged with me; I thought him an honest young man - the house I formerly lived in is in Eaton-lane, Pimlico; it was a green-grocer's shop, not a butcher's - I sent the prisoner to give up the key a few days before quarter-day - my property was removed from there at different times; I began to move about the 21st of January, and finished two or three days before quarter-day - I removed some things in the day time; at any time that was most convenient - some were removed after dark, and some in open day; the only reason for removing as I did was, to save the expence of a cart - the greatest part was moved in the day; one bed was taken at night for them to sleep on - I told Barron, a few days after Christmas, that I was going to leave; I often saw him - I did not tell him I was moving things, but he knew it; I gave him a bill to put up in his window at Christmas, to let the house - Barron did not agree to buy the fixtures; I asked him above six weeks before I left to let the house, and make the best he could of them, and he said he would - the greater part of my property was there then; I paid 7l. odd for the fixtures - they are not sold yet, and the house is still on my hands; Barron had one of my cards before I moved.</p>
               <p>Q.You say when you found your things gone, you went to Eley's? A. Yes; I went there as soon as I possibly could - my son had found out the carman who moved them; I did not know Eley - I never saw him but twice in my life before; he had been to my house on the Saturday night before, and bought a piece of beef.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he not been there taking an account of your property? A. No; he did not come and take an inventory of my furniture - I never knew him take an account of it; the first time I ever saw him was on the Saturday night -I never made over my interest in the furniture to the prisoner; I am quite sure of that - a receipt for 20l. was produced to me before the Magistrate, but I knew nothing about it whatever; I saw it at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not that receipt your name to it? whether you choose to admit it was your writing is another question? A. I do not know, for I did not particularly look at it; I said I knew nothing about it - it was put into my hands; I did not swear it was not my hand-writing; I said I knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q.Eley showed you the things at once when you went? A. No, he did not.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On Tuesday night, the 12th of April, about eight o'clock, the prosecutrix applied to me, and said her property was gone; I went to Eley's with her - Eley was not at home then; I found a pair of sheets there, which she identified; I brought them away; I went again in about an hour, and waited round the house some time; and as Eley was coming home I stopped on the road with the prisoner, and took them both to the station - they were both going together towards Eley's house, and within one hundred yards of it; I searched them, and found some papers on them, in consequence of which I went to Eley's house, and found in three or four different rooms the prosecutrix's property mentioned in the indictment - when I went before there were several girls there, who refused to let me into the rooms, saying the rooms belonged to them; here are the papers - on Dent I found this one, marked A; when he was locked up I searched Eley, and found this one marked B - Dent had told me he had written a paper and given it to Eley; he told me he wrote this paper after he heard I was in search of him - here is another paper which Dent produced before the Magistrate, when asked what he had to say; I was desired to put my name on it, and produce it on the trial.</p>

            . I live at No. 18, Henry-street, Waterloo-road. I wait at different tavern dinners in the City- I rent the house; I have known the prisoner about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q.When did he first speak to you on the subject of these goods? A.About a fortnight before, I think: he showed me a receipt for the goods - he first mentioned about them about ten days or a fortnight before the officer came to my house; he showed me this receipt (looking at it) - he told me they were about to let the shop, and he had got those goods, and did not wish to dispose of them if he could put them somewhere for a short time.</p>
               <p>Q.What shop did you think he meant? A. The butcher's shop; he said he expected a man to give him 15l., and asked if I thought I could take the goods in, and take care of them for him - I told him I did not know whether I should have room, unless I saw what they consisted of; he asked if I would take the trouble to walk up to the house, and look at them - I said I would; he said, "If you go up you had better just set down what there is, and then you will be able to judge whether you can take care of them."</p>
               <p>Q.Could you not have told if he had said, there were so many of such and such things? A. He wished me to go and see; I went to the butcher's shop that evening, and received the goods the day after I went.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it was on the 11th? A. Yes - I never went to look at the property till the night before it was taken; Mrs. Davies was at home - I asked her if George was at home; she said he was not - I asked if he had said any thing about my coming there; she said he had - I had been there before; I asked if George had said any thing about my coming there to look at the things - she said Yes, and she told me what they were as near as she could judge; I just penciled them down in a little book before her.</p>
               <p>Q.And, of course, told her that George was to bring them to you the next day? A. I thought she understood that; she agreed readily to my taking the inventory; I told her that would do - she asked if I would take any thing, and I had some gin; I did not pencil down her wearing-apparel - I put down the shop fixtures, the household goods, beds, and blankets - she quite agreed to it, and told me what they were; she pointed them out herself; they were in the back parlour - I was to take care of the goods for Dent; he had told me he was to dispose of the shop - I saw Dent next morning, and told him what I had done, and in the course of the day Dent sent a note over to me by a lad, and asked me to go and assist to remove the goods - I accordingly went there, and saw Dent; he asked where I could get a van - I said a man lived close by who let vans; the goods were brought to my house - I was at home when they arrived; I have four rooms and a kitchen; Mrs. Davies came to my house about two hours after they arrived, and asked me where George was and the things - I told her I did not know where George was, but part of the things were in my house; I asked her down stairs - she went down and saw a pair of sheets and some little things laying about; I was at home - she said, "These are my sheets;" I said I understood they were Dent's, and all the things - she said,</p>
               <p>"No such thing, they are mine, and I will take them away if you will allow me;" I said, "You had better wait and see Dent, or appoint a time, and when Dent comes in, I will keep him till you call."</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to distribute the property in different rooms? A.I could not put it all into one room - I put some into the yard, some into the back kitchen, and some into the back parlour - I have two lodgers; the things were not found in the girl's room - I have a girl in my house; she is no relation of mine - part of the things were in the back parlour where that young woman was, the rest in the back kitchen and in the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.About the 2nd of April this young man first made a representation to you about the things? A. Yes; he told me where the shop was, and said they were his things - he showed me the receipt when he spoke about them; I cannot say it was the 2nd of April - my shop is two miles from the prosecutrix's; I went there about seven o'clock the evening before the goods were moved.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not heard the woman examined to-day; she has sworn she never saw you but once in her life before they were moved, and that was about the purchase of some meat - now is the representation you have made true; did you go the evening before and look over the things? A. I did - if she has sworn I did no such thing in her presence, it is quite a falsehood - I think the goods were moved about two or three o'clock, and the van was hired close by, of a man, within a hundred yards of her house -I have two female lodgers; it was the prosecutrix's son who brought the note over to me the day they were moved- Dent gave me the paper about returning the wearingapparel - when he heard she had been to me, he said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120022"></xptr>order you to give up nothing, but what I have put here"- when I was looking over the things Mrs. Davies told me what there was; I asked if there was any thing particular in the drawers - she said only the sheets that were worth putting down; I did not look at them - she lives in a populous neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.When you took the inventory, was the son there? A. Yes; I recollect Collison and Mrs. Davies' coming to my house, and claiming the goods - I was taken before the Magistrate; when I came in, my wife said Mrs. Davies had been with an officer and taken the goods- I said she ought not to have done so; I told my wife I should go to the station-house, and inquire about it, which I did, and met Dent as I went - I said, "Do you know Mrs. Davies has been and taken the sheets?" he said,"Has she?" I said I was going to the station - we went together, and asked if they knew she had been and taken the sheets - they said Yes, that she had sworn it was her property; Dent said, "I will let her know it is my property," and as we came back an officer said, "George, you are wanted at the station-house," and we went there.</p>

            . I let out vans. Eley applied to me on the 12th for a van to remove goods, and I went into Little Grosvenor-street, to a butcher's shop - I found the prisoner and Eley at the house; they put the goods into the van, and I loaded them - I considered the things belonged to them; I took them to Eley's house - the prisoner and Eley both followed the van behind I believe; when I got there I unloaded - Eley and Dent were there; the things were taken into Eley's house - I got my money, and went away; I did not see Davies's son when I moved the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near do you live to the butcher's shop? A. About one hundred and fifty yards off; there were not many things certainly - I saw no room but the back parlour; I saw the prosecutrix's son the same day, and told him where I had moved them to - Dent followed the van, as far as I knew; there was not the least attempt at concealment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I suppose your name was on the van? A. Yes, and the prosecutrix's son came to me.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's son, and live with her - I assist in her business. Dent lived servant with her; he went away to Greenwich fair, came back again, and then my mother and him parted - I was at home when he said my mother would be arrested for rent, and mentioned Mr. Barron; he said Barron would come the next day at twelve o'clock, with a writ, and arrest her- this was the night before the goods were removed; he came the next morning, (the day the goods were moved) - he said mother had better go out of the way, and she went out to get the money to make up the rent; she spoke about going to Mr. Barron, but he said she had better not - she went out, and I then went over to the Waterloo-road, to take a loin of veal and a shoulder of mutton to Eley's; he (Eley) had come and ordered it the over night - I cannot say how much it came to; I took it over there, leaving Dent at the house with all the goods - I saw Eley's wife at his house when I took the meat, and she said he was not at home; I had not seen him at our house that morning - I had seen him over night; I delivered the meat to his wife and came away - I was at home when it was ordered the night before; Eley ordered it himself - he was about half an hour in the shop; he did not say he had come to take an inventory of the furniture, or any thing of the kind - he came out of the shop into the parlour, and had some tea; I did not see him taking an account of the furniture with his pencil - he did no such thing in my presence; I found him there when I came home - I was not there when he first came; I was there when he had tea.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you return in the morning before your mother came back? A. I returned first - my mother had been to Whitechapel; when I returned I found Dent there - he said somebody had been there wanting my mother, that she was at St. James' market, and I had better go and fetch her; I went, she was not there, and as I came back I met Dent in Bond-street, and asked him who was minding the shop - he said nobody, adn that he had locked it up; he said they had been and taken the goods for mother's rent, and afterwards he told me that he was arrested for 50l., and he did not owe half the money; he said somebody had been, and said it was his shop, and they had come and arrested him for 50l., and come and taken the goods - then he asked me to go with him; I refused, and asked him to give me the key of the shop - he said he should not give it up to any body but my mother, and said he had chucked my clothes on one side, and that was all he could save; he said the goods could be got back for a little money, and then he gave me up the key - I went home, and found the house stripped, but before that he told me he should go to St. James'-market, and wait till my mother came - I told him if he would wait at the market I would go home, and come to him there; I went home, and found the house stripped - I then went to the market; he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q.Had Eley dealt at your shop before? A. I believe on the Saturday night before he bought some meat, but I did not see him then; when I came from St. James'-market I asked the people who moved the goods, and found out Allen - I waited till my mother came home, and told her what had happened; she said she would go over to Eley, and get what he owed her for the meat, towards paying the rent, and on going over we found the prisoner had drawn the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You are quite sure Eley had bought meat twice at your mother's? A. Yes, on the Saturday, and on the night before the goods were removed- I found him there the evening before the goods were removed; I do not think he had been there long - my mother asked him to have tea, because she was at tea; he was there about half an hour after I came home - he was talking about the meat; Dent came there that evening after Eley had been, and it was then he mentioned about the arrest - what I heard about it was that evening; he spoke of it again in the morning when he came, and told my mother she had better go out - he did not say to get the money; when I came back he told me my mother was gone to St. James'-market - I knew she was in the habit of going there; when I met him in Bond-street, he at first said the landlord had been, and taken the goods for rent - he then said he had been arrested for 50l.; there was no van with him - he did not say where the goods were moved; I did not ask him - I took a note to Eley, by Dent's desire, after I came back from taking the meat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was locked up separate from Eley, and different people came to me, trying to get a different statement to what Eley had given; I said I would say nothing there - I was spoken to by one inspector and another - they said Eley said different things, and I said different; I said I had spoken the truth, and should say no more to any of them.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at Pimlico. The prisoner was about sixteen months in my service, and left about March, last year; I recommended him to my brother-in-law, and knew him down to the present time - I give him an irreproachable character; I know the prosecutrix perfectly well, and have seen her write - (looking at a receipt) I believe the signature to this to be her hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion have you seen her write? A. While the prisoner lived with me I provided him a lodging at the prosecutrix's, at 2s. a week - there was a dispute about a week's rent; I said if she would send a receipt for what I owed her I would pay it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you seen her write more than once? A. I had a bill for the lodging sent to me by the boy - I went to her, and she wrote a receipt before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Having seen her write once, you know her handwriting better than she does herself? A. I swear to the best of my belief; the person who wrote it certainly ought to be the best judge - I never saw this recipt till to-day; I was informed of the prisoner being in custody last Friday week or fortnight - I came merely to give him a character; I only speak of this from having seen her write once - it is more than twelve months ago.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Did you sign that before the Magistrate? A. I signed a long roll of paper, in a long sheet, on parchment; I wrote my own name - the signing at the bottom is not the same as I wrote; perhaps I might have a much better pen.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that? (opening the paper at full length.) A. That is my hand-writing, it is like it; Eley did not come and examine my furniture - the night before he bought a loin of veal and a leg of mutton - that was all; I asked him to drink, and sent for some gin - he did not examine my furniture.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of a horse and mare belonging to Mr. Choppin and Mr. Dundas, that were put to winter with your master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What colour were they? - A. A grey horse and a grey mare: On Saturday, the 19th of March, I racked them up in the stable, about five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. And left them safe in the stalls? - A. Yes; the lock was rather out of repair, but by a sharp force the lock had effect; I saw them again about half past five.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you go to the stable again? - A. Not till the next morning about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you the first person there? - A. No, my master had been there; I found the horse and the mare gone.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the state of the door? - A. I did not look at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Your master takes in a great many horses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You cannot tell who is the proprietor or owner of any given horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.You know they were in the custody of Mr. Hall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES LOVELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You are the bailiff to Mr. Hall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the mare and the horse that belonged to Mr. Dundas and Mr. Chopping? - A. Yes, they were brought to me in those names.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember seeing them on the 19th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200047"></xptr>of March? - A. Yes, about twelve o'clock, I saw them in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to them on Sunday the 20th of March? - A. I went to the stable about six o'clock in the morning, and observed the door upon the jar, within about four inches of the post.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it appear to you to have been forced? - A. No; I went into the stable, and missed the grey horse and the grey mare; there were eight horses in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of missing them, did you pursue them on the Oxford-road? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What time did you set off? - A. About seven o'clock, I came up with them between Wheatley and Tetsworth, in Oxfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q.In whose custody did you find them? - A. The gentleman's at the bar, he was riding the grey mare, and leading the grey gelding.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know them to be the same? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was it? - A.About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the horses seem to have been rode hard? - A. I think the gelding had been rode very hard, for I saw the saddle mark, and the mark of the spur; I asked him what he was going to do with those horses, he asked what odds it was to me; I told him it was odds, they were horses that were placed in my care, and I must take care of him and the horses, till I could get a better answer; then I took hold of him by the collar, he got down off the mare, and asked what I was going at with him, and I told him, I wanted to know if he had any fire-arms, and he said, I was very welcome to feel; I felt down the side of his pocket, and found it was nothing but fancy, and I told him, he might get up upon the mare again, if he chose; he got up upon the mare again; there was a gentleman upon the road that assisted me, he put a stick through the prisoner's bridle; and between that and Wheatley, he told me he had bought them both of one Ward, a horse-dealer.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say where? - A. At Wycomb.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say which Wycomb? - A. High-Wycomb; he said, he gave thirty guineas, and a gelding; I asked him, if any person saw him pay for them; he said, there was no person up at the public-houses; then we went on to Wheatley, and ordered a post-chaise, but no chaise being to be got, I sent back to Tetsworth; then we came on to Oxford, which is six miles, and I enquired for a constable, and he was taken into custody; he said, he had made an appointment with Mr. Ward; at Abingdon-fair, and he was to meet him on the 20th of March.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you quite sure they were the two horses that were lost from your master's stable? - A. I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Your master has a great many horses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what Mr. Dundas's christian name is? - A.No; the servant said it was Mr. Charles Dundas's, he sold two the same day; the grey gelding was Mr.

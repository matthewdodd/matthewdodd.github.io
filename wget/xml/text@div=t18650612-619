                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, of Short-street, Maida Hill—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 8th July, I was on my cab, going from the stand, there to the Eagle public-house, Clifton Road, which is two or three minutes' walk from the rank—as I turned a corner, I saw a man and woman talking together—the man appeared intoxicated, or I should not have noticed them—when I got to the Eagle, the prisoner rushed in front of them and exclaimed, "You are a pair of pretty b—s"—he struck the man, who had hold of part of the woman's dress, and said, "If you are a man put up your hands"—he then struck the woman—a man came out of the public-house and said, "Here, do not hit a woman, hit me"—the prisoner said, "Oh my man, you do not know what I have to put up with, she is constantly out with this man, leaving my children neglected; I have found them together frequently before"—he struck his wife a second time, and hit Brown a second time, who fell down—some girls was standing by, and the prisoner said, "I know her, she is as bad as any prostitute in Paddington"—I turned round, and when I saw them again, they were on the other side of the way—it being very dark I could not see much—I saw that Brown's hands were in front of him, but whether striking blows, or warding off blows, I cannot say—I went across to part them, and the man stooped to pick his hat up, and fell—the prisoner threw himself on the pavement, as if he was endeavouring to excite the woman to strike her husband—she then turned round to her husband, and struck his hat off, and kicked at him and said, "I will give you some<lb></lb>thing</p>

               <p>when I get you home"—I went into the public-house, and then went back to my cab on the rank.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you say that the deceased stooped to pick his hat up, and fell on the kerb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He fell close to the kerb—I had seen him fall from one of the blows previously—but he was so far intoxicated that he was hardly able to walk—the last I saw of him was, he went down the turning facing the Eagle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am footman to Mr. Watson—I know the deceased—he was coachman in the same family—I met him on this day about half-past 9 o'clock, by the Clifton Arms—we had a pint of porter between three of us—I saw him up to half-past 10—he was then partially intoxicated—I saw him next morning about 11 o'clock—there was then blood on the breast and right sleeve of his coat, also on his breeches, which were cut in three or four places, and his boots were saturated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know the deceased well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he told me on Sunday, that he had been in the habit of wearing a truss for some time, as he was ruptured, and could not pass his water, but that he had left it off for about a week, and he believed that was the cause of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Kilburn—I was called to see the deceased, about 10 o'clock on Sunday morning—he was sitting on the side of his bed—I examined him, and found him suffering from some injury from the abdomen—I found that he had been suffering from a rupture, and I imagined it might be from that, but there was no hernia—I passed a catheter, and found there was no water in the bladder, only blood—I called in another surgeon, and we were at quite a loss to know what was the matter—the man died that night—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and found he was suffering from rupture of the bladder, as well as of the intestines—a large quantity of water had escaped into the belly—there were no marks of external violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If a man had been in the habit of wearing a truss and suddenly left it off, and got excited by drink, would that cause it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; rupture has nothing to do with the bladder, but if he had been drink<lb></lb>ing and the abdomen was full, it might rupture, though I think a kick would be more likely to do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of 9, Nottingham Court, Long Acre—last month I was in a public-house opposite the Victoria Theatre, having ray first glass of drink, and a person there recognized me, and asked me to give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as he had come out from having six months, and was hungry—the male prisoner was there—I went across to a ham and beef shop opposite, and the female prisoner followed me, and said "Halloa, what do you want there, why don't you come with us, and have a com<lb></lb>fortable tea?"—I said "I am not in the habit of going with strangers"—she said "It is only close by"—I said "Where is your husband, perhaps if he comes out he will be cross"—she said "He sent me out"—I walked to another public-house, and a man not in custody came in, and had a few words with me, but the landlord stopped the quarrel—the female prisoner then proposed to bring some ale to her place, and I took the ale—the man came out, and tried to renew the quarrel, and the male prisoner came up, and shoved him on the shoulder, and said "Get away, you b—fool, you are going to spoil it"—I said "I am very glad to see you"—he said "It is all right"—we walked shoulder to shoulder, conversing, and the female prisoner was two yards behind, with the beer in her hand—immediately I turned into the court I received a fearful blow on my head, which partially stunned me—I said "Oh!" and the next minute I found myself across the male prisoner's arm, and felt a suffocating sensation so that I could not call out—he had his arm round my neck, and she was fumbling for my money—he said "D—your eyes, how long you are about it, tear the b—thing away"—he eased my neck, and I called "Police!" and "Murder!"—he dashed me down and kicked me tremendously hard on the side of my head, and my left eye was on my cheek—after my money was gone, I had a purse with a few pawn tickets and sleeve links in it—I tried to protect it, but he put his foot on my neck, tore my hands away from my pockets, and said "Let go, you b—swine"—I became unconscious, and they threw cold buckets of water over me—I went to the police and described the prisoners—I had to lay in bed ten days, perfectly helpless, after which I saw the male prisoner at the Stones End Station, and picked him out from several others—I also saw the female prisoner with other females, and recognized her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I ceased to be a seaman twelve year ago, I have since been a costermonger—this happened at 4.5 or 4.15 in the afternoon—I had not been drinking, and was not in an excited state, throwing my arms about—the female prisoner was the only woman there—I had not been fighting that afternoon—it is not my profession—I do not know Kayson, or any person living in Bedford Court—I have not said that the man who assaulted me wore sandy whiskers—I lost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a sovereign, four half-crowns, two shillings, and sixpenny worth of coppers—the policeman did not suggest the prisoner to me—I was an hour in his company, and from the terror and cruelty I received from him, it is impossible for me to erase him from my memory.</p>

I keep the Blue Coat Boy, Borough—at 3.30 or 4 o'clock on this afternoon, the male prisoner came into one com<lb></lb>partment, and the female into another—there were a few words, and the prosecutor who was there, left with the female prisoner—the male prisoner left directly afterwards, and renewed the altercation outside the house—the prosecutor and the prisoner went away together.</p>

I was in Mint Street, about 4.50, on the afternoon of the 14th, and saw Armstrong, who described a man and woman—he said that the man seemed as if his whiskers had not been shaved lately, and he thought they were sandy—he seemed as if he had been drugged; he was helpless, and seemed unconscious of what he said—about five minutes before that I saw the male prisoner come out of a court, and go into a lodging-house—I saw nothing of the woman—Armstrong had blood on him, and some sawdust, and water—I took him to the station, and then went to 4, Star Court, and found this can (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the table, and this pocket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the floor—I have compared it with the prosecutor's trowsers.</p>

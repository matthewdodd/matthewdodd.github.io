I am an unfortunate girl the same as the prisoner; I live at No. 1, Cross Keys-mews, Mary-le-bone-lane; the prisoner lived near me; I met her on the 4th of June, by the chapel, at the bottom of Vere-street, Oxford-road; when I met her I asked her how she did, it was about nine o'clock at night, she answered me, she was very well; I was holding my gown up when I spoke to her, and I let it down; I walked up to the top of Vere-street, and another young woman was along with me, and the prisoner was behind me; when I got to the top of Vere-street, the prisoner crossed over from me; I went to take my gown up, and it was wet; the young woman that was with me put her hand to it, and she said, it smelt like lemon; I crossed over to a light in Shepherd-street, at a shop-window; I perceived my gown was turned colour (this is the gown) it turned yellow, and afterwards it went into holes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what it was? - A. yes, it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100067"></xptr>vitriol that was thrown over the gown: I went home and pulled it off, it was in holes; the young woman pulled her's off, and her gown was as bad; I had a suspicion that it was the prisoner that threw it over me; I went to Marlborough-street the next morning, and got a warrant, and brought the officer to where she lived; and when he searched the room, he found a bottle of vitriol; she said, she did not go to throw it over me, she meant to throw it over a gentleman and the wind blew it over me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and she any quarrel? - A. No, I never had a word with her.</p>

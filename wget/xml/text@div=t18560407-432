                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Harper, a licensed victualler, of the White Swan, Farringdon-street. On 13th March, about half past 8 o'clock, the prisoner and another man came in—they asked for half a quartern of gin—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner threw down a sovereign—I went into the bar parlour to get a half sovereign to give change—I bent the sovereign in the trier, and I told the prisoner it was bad—he wished to have it back, and said that he would pay me in coppers—I told him I should detain it, and send for a constable—he ran out of the house, the other man remained—he drank the gin, and ran away—I was not paid for the gin—the policeman pursued the prisoner, and brought him back in four or five minutes—I am quite sure he is the man—I gave the sovereign to the officer.</p>

On 13th March I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" in Field-lane—I saw the prisoner running up Fleet-lane—I ran and stopped him, about half way down the Old Bailey, brought him back, and he was identified by the last witness—I took him to the station, and found on him a good shilling—he refused to give his address.</p>

I knew I had not committed any felony, therefore I would not stop, until I could see whether I could overtake him or not; my object was getting my sovereign, as I did not know where he lived; I was in liquor, and felt rather excited at it.</p>

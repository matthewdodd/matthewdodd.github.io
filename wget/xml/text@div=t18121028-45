I had made them for the prisoner, and he being a stranger, when I measured him for them, I had taken a deposit of four shillings. The prisoner came in between nine and ten o'clock at night, and asked me whether the boots were done. I told him, not quite, I had to punch the holes in them, and I would do it in a few minutes. The boots were on the counter. He took up one, and said, is this one. I said, yes; and while he was standing with the boot in his hand, I waited on a customer, and when I had served the customer, I missed the prisoner out of the shop. He had gone away with the pair of half boots. It being Saturday night I did not go out after him. I never saw him until I saw him before the Lord Mayor. I then charged him with stealing the boots. He said, he had left them in the shop. He offered me the rest of the money, which was fourteen shillings. I made the boots for him, from his measure.</p>

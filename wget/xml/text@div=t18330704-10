On the morning of the 22d of May, I was walking in Edgware-road and met the prisoner who was a stranger, she spoke to me; we got into conversation, and I let her go home with me to have a breakfast, as she said she had been walking and was very tired - I laid down on my bed, not being very well, and I fell asleep, leaving her up; I don't think I slept more than a quarter of a hour; when I awoke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040031"></xptr>the prisoner was gone, and I missed the articles stated - I saw the greater part of the articles found in about three quarters of an hour afterwards, at the prisoner's lodging by the officer - the prisoner was there at the time and said, she was very vexed to think she had done such a thing, and she would not do so any more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any basket in her hand? A. No; she asked me to pawn a shawl for her, which I did in the Edgware-road, and gave the duplicate to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put your mark to this paper? (her deposition). A. Yes - I did not see her come in - I saw a basket found when the policeman came - I did not see it before.</p>

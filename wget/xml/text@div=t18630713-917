                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-detective</hi>). On Friday, 5th June, I was watching Messrs. Batger's premises, 15 and 16, Bishopsgate-street, with another officer named Whitney—I saw Jacques and Vanner both come out Jacques was carrying a bag—it appeared to contain one of these boxes—I only judge from the shape and size—they went through Spitalfields into Brick-lane, and then Jacques gave Vanner the bag with what it contained—we still followed them, into Thames-street, Bethnal-green, and Vanner went into No. 30—we remained there some time—it came on to rain very hard, and we left watching them then—on the next day, the 6th, I saw both of them again coming out of the prosecutors' premises, in the evening-Jacques had a bag, with apparently one of these boxes in it—they got up into their master's cart, and went away with him, with the bag in the cart—on the Tuesday after we watched them again, and about 7 o'clock we saw Jacques carrying a bag; Vanner was with him—we followed them into Union-street, and there stopped them, and took them in custody—we examined the bag, and it contained this box of peel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) unopened—we afterwards went with Mr. Arnold to the house where Baylis lives, 2, Winchester-street, Bethnal-green—Baylis was out in the street opposite,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186307130059"></xptr>
               <p>and we went into the house together—I told him we were officers; that we had two lads in custody for stealing some peel, and, from information we had received, we believed he had been receiving it—I then asked him if he had any peel about the place in any quantity—he said no; he bought his peel a box at a time, of Mr. Gregory, of Shoreditch, where he bought his plums and currants—I told him we must search the place—we went to go up stairs to do so, when his wife flew at me, and Baylis at the other officer—they had a scuffle together, and Whitney got up to the top of the stains, and the wife was scratching and flying at me to prevent my going up, and then Baylis and Whitney came tumbling down again with a barrel of flour all over them—we were smothered—we afterwards got a light, fetched Mr. Arnold in doors, and proceeded to search—in the parlour, between the bake-house and the shop, I found this full box of peel standing by the fireplace, on a shelf—in the bake house I found two boxes partly filled, and a quantity of empty boxes, and up stairs, in the back room, I found, in a sack, about 1 cwt. and some odd pounds of peel, which was identified by Mr. Arnold—I asked Baylis how he accounted for the possession of it—he said the peel he bought of Mr. Gregory—the boxes he could not give any account of; he could not tell who he bought them of—we flaw the name on the boxes—we then took him to the station.</p>

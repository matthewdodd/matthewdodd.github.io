My wife keep a haberdasher's shop, at 13, Plumpstead-place—between 3 and 4 o'clock, on the morning of 15th June, I was awoke by one of my lodgers—I looked out of my bed-room window, and saw the two prisoners running down the garden with their boots in their hands—they got over the wall at the bottom of the garden, and I saw them well</p>

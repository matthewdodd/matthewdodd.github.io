                  </hi>. I am a brass finisher, of Deptford. On 27th Dec. I was at the Standard Theatre, Shoreditch—I left at half-past eleven o'clock, as I stepped on to the footway I heard a noise at my gold guard-chain, which was round my neck—I had a watch to it in my waist<lb></lb>coat pocket—I saw my chain on the wrist of a man—I drew it away and missed my watch—I gave him in charge—he had two hearings and was discharged, as it was not found on him—I saw nobody else.</p>

On 28th Dec, about half-past twelve in the night, the prisoners came to me—I knew Brown before—they showed me a watch, with the glass broken, and only one hand (I do not know which of them had it) and asked if I would let them have a little money—I said I had none to spare, and they left.</p>

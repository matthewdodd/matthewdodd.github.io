               <p>I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, these things were taken out of my drawers in my bed room, they all went from one place, which makes me suspect they all went at once, I found one of my gowns about seven months afterwards, the prisoner lodged with me five or six months, she came to me in December, they were furnished lodgings, she came to me as a married woman, Mr. and Mrs. Gower, and officer told me they had the prisoner in custody that day for robbing her lodging, and he said to me did she rob you, I said no, because my husband charged me to say no, for fear they should punish me for what I had said, as I could not prove it at that time, I went with him to some pawnbrokers with some tickets, which he said he had taken from her, and there I found my table cloth.</p>
               <p>- LIGHTFOOT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Payne, in Wardour-street, he is a pawnbroker, we had an order from Litchfield-street, to stop the prisoner when she came to our shop, which we did; on the 29th of January, we took in of her a table cloth, this is the same, it was pledged in the name of Mrs. Brown, she said they were her own property, when she left them at our house. (The table cloth deposed to.) We have nine duplicates of things pawned by the prisoner, and all the rest proved to be the prisoner's wearing apparel.</p>

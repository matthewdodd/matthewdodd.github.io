                  </hi>. I am the wife of Arthur Causdale, a baker, at Greens-end, Woolwich—the prisoner was in our service a fortnight—his duty was to serve the customers and assist in the bake-house: he had also to receive money from the customers, and it was his duty to pay it in when he came from the round he had been—on the 19th of June, he paid to me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of Mrs. Marshall: that was part of an account of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when he came in, I told him to come and book the bread—I said, "What money have you got?"—he said, "Mrs. Marshall has paid that, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "That is not right"—he said, "That is all she gave me"—the receipts produced are in the prisoner's handwriting—he left</p>

I let a lodging to the prisoner, about twenty-two months ago; she left me about four months ago, She made away with sheets, blankets, bolster and bed; she replaced the bed with a sack of straw, by cutting the bed in half, and drawing the top part of the feathers to the bottom, and the upper part was replaced with a large sack of straw. She was taken up for an assault between four and five months ago, and sent to goal. I went into the room before she went out of my house. She did not go with me; I found the bed as I have represented to you; and the bolster, and blankets, and sheets were gone; when she was in custody, she sent to me, that if I would but forgive her this time, she would replace the feathers. I never found out what she had done with them. She had a room to herself, and those things were articles of furniture. It is five months or six months since I missed the sheets; and she said they were in the wash, and the blankets, she said, were being scoured. About six weeks afterwards, I asked after the sheets, and she said they were lost.</p>
               <p>Do you ever give your lodgers leave to pawn any part of the furniture? - No; I never give my lodgers leave to raise any money on my things.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came up to my room with a bolster in her hand, and informed me that she was going to pawn it, as the others had done before. She had pawned things of Mr. Langley's after. About three days afterwards, she told me about the circumstance of the straw.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor keeps a house for unfortunate women; and I have a family of children. The prosecutor and others in the house, have sent me to prison three or four times, through the quarrelling of these women with me. I did make money of this bolster once.</p>
               <p>Court. She was sent to prison for the assault? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was she in prison? - Three weeks.</p>
               <p>When did you go before the justice to charge her? - About two months ago.</p>
               <p>How came you not to go before the Justice before? - I could not find any body to prove that she had taken the things, till I found these two women.</p>
               <p>Why you cannot prove she took them now? - No farther than what these women say.</p>
               <p>Then your account is, that when you found out these two women, you went to the Justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To whom? - Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Did she ever pay you any part of the money? - No. She owes me thirty shillings now.</p>

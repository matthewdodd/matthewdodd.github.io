On the 30th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, I had occasion to go to the back premises, and saw a light in the prosecutor's shop, which was not usual—I went and told my husband, and then went down to the yard and called out—nobody answered—I saw two men in the shop—I called to know who they were—they made no answer, but put the light out and came out—one was John Balch, and the other William Knowles—neither of them had any thing to do with the shop—they were employed on the premises, but not in the shop—the other man remained with the things, which had been taken out of the shop and put into a shed—we found the shop-door open, and questioned Balch about it—he was very insolent, and we</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brass-founder, in partnership with my brother—we live in Clerkenwell—the prisoner had been in our services for fourteen years. On the 30th of April I searched the shop he worked in between one and two o'clock, and on a piece of timber, on which the roof rests, very near the tiles, I found several pieces of metal concealed—I took part of them down, marked them with a punch, and had them re-placed—I had an officer provided to stay in the street and watch the house, and when the prisoner left, about half-past seven o'clock, he took him and brought him back—he was taken into the casting shop—I found 20lbs. 10<hi rend="italic">oss</hi>. of old metal concealed about him, and among the rest those pieces which I had market with a punch.</p>

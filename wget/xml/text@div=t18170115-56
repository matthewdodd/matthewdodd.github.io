            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. I heard the cry, and stopped the prisoner within one hundred yards of the place, where the prosecutor was robbed; he was running. I took hold of him, and asked him what was the matter; he said, there had been a row, and that he wanted to get out of it; he struck me, and ran away. I took him again. I am sure he is the man that I first stopped.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner before the magistrate; before he got there, he asked me if the matter could be made up. I said, where is the watch; I made him neither threat or promise; he said, it is thrown into a little pool, in the middle of the ruins of the hospital. I found it there.</p>

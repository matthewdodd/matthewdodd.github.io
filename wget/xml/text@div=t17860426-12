               <p>On the 15th of March, between ten and eleven, I was going down Brick-lane, and I saw the prisoner coming along with a bundle; Brick-lane is one part in Spital-fields, and one part in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Is that one way of coming in from Hackney? - Yes; I asked the prisoner what he had there; he said, it was a bed wrapped up in a blanket; I asked him where he brought it from; he did not give me any answer at first, but afterwards he said he brought it out of Barker's-yard, and was going to carry it into George-yard; he desired me not to stop him, because his wife was down-laying, and he owed a little rent, and was going away; and I insisted on seeing what was in the bundle; I took him to the Rotation-office, and there I looked over the things; I found it was not a bed; I took him over to the watch-house; the bundle contained the things now produced. I searched him; he said I might search him and welcome, for he had nothing but his own property about him: when I searched him, I found these three pins and these three pieces of silver; before I opened them, I asked him what he had there? he said, there were some pins, a shilling, and some halfpence; I found these things in his waistcoat-pocket after I stopped him; he brought the things a little way, and he would not carry them any further; I got this young man to assist me.</p>

               <p>What did he say? - He said he was hired to carry them as a porter.</p>
               <p>Was what he said, before or after you searched him? - After I found what the things were, he said he was hired to carry them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Did not he tell you that those things had been given to him by the person that had hired him, as a satisfaction for his labour? - I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Did not he give the account I mentioned? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you with him about half a guinea? - I do not remember any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, that if he would give you half a guinea, you would let him go? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Roberts, did not you ask me for the half-guinea, and I told you I was a poor man? - My dear friend, you told me you was a poor man, and was going to move the bed and things, because your wife was down-laying.</p>

               <p>About a quarter after ten, I was called out of a public house; I was there from half after four, I never quitted the house; a man asked for a porter, and the boy at the public house told him of me; he called me out; the man asked me if I was a porter? I told him yes; I immediately went in and fetched out my knot; I went with him, and by the French church, Spital-fields, another man stood, and they put a bundle on my head, and bid me go into Whitechapel, and they would take it themselves; and when I got about five or six yards, one of them came in between the wall and me, and said, young man, we neither of us have any money, but you will find something in this paper that will satisfy you, and immediately put it in my right-hand waistcoat-pocket, and being confused, I did not know what to say when I was stopped; they said it was a bed, and so I said the same.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Tell me distinctly what the prisoner said with respect to those things that you found in his waistcoat-pocket, in the paper? - When I took them out, wrapped up, I asked him what they were, before the watchman in the watch-house; he told me they were some pins, one shilling, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not find any crow, or implement of house-breaking upon him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What did he say before you searched him? - He said he had nothing but his own property in his pocket; he said I might search him and welcome; he did not make any objection to being searched.</p>

Some time after supper, his wife came in with a plate of cold meat that she went to the cook's shop for, and she called for a pint of beer, and asked him if he would have any? and he said no, he did not want any, he had had a very good supper; that was between nine and ten; and while she was eating her cold meat, he then said to his wife, Polly, says he, make haste, for we keep Mrs. Jones up; I looked at the dial, and said, no, Mr. Watts, you do not, for if nobody was in the house, I should not shut up till eleven; it was then near twenty minutes after ten, if not half an hour. After she had drank her first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260048"></xptr> pint of beer, she called for a second pint, and it was after that, that he bid her make haste; that made me be so particular to the time, or else I should not have noticed it: then they called for the other pint after that.</p>

               <p>Where were the other two men that supped with him? - They were there also, for they lodged in the house; they were not out of the house at all, nor the prisoner was not out of the house from the time he came in; they staid all of them; they never went to-bed till I shut up my house; they were all of them with the prisoner in the same box, and the prisoner's wife eat her supper in the same box.</p>
               <p>Were here many other people in the same box at this time? - Only them three together, and the wife with them.</p>
               <p>Were these men at home all the afternoon? - They were in the room when the prisoner came in; Pike was mending his harness, he came in about half an hour after the prisoner came in, in the afternoon; he had his harness on his shoulder, he is a coachman; Jones was in the tap-room when the prisoner came in, for he was not well, and not able to work, and he was at home all day; he has no where to be, but about the house.</p>
               <p>What liquor had the prisoner from four till nine? - He had one pint of beer; he had no more till they joined in company, then I believe they had three or four pots of twopenny and toast at supper; but he had only one pint before supper.</p>
               <p>Had Pike and

             any drink when they came in? - I cannot recollect that; these three men did not join company till they went to supper together.</p>
               <p>Were they acquainted before, the prisoner and these two men? - No, not particularly acquainted; they had met together in the house before, they knew one another.</p>
               <p>Was your husband at home? - He was not very well that night, and was gone up to bed.</p>
               <p>What time did he go to-bed? - I take it he went up to bed at the time they were at supper; he says the bowl was on the table when he went up.</p>
               <p>Did he take a bit with them before he went? - No, Sir, he did not eat with them, nor drink.</p>
               <p>Did you sup with them? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor drink? - I never touched it, upon my word.</p>
               <p>Did not you sit down, and eat a bit with the wife, to keep her company when she came in? - No, Sir, I did not; I never sat down with any of them, nor eat nor drank with any of them; I was minding my business.</p>
               <p>How came they to have no nutmeg to this toast and ale, because that is a necessary ingredient? - They had none, Sir; nutmegs are too dear now, they are sixpence a-piece, they are too dear to give away.</p>
               <p>Had you none in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Had they any spirits? - No, no spiritual liquors.</p>
               <p>Had they no gin? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor rum-punch? - No.</p>
               <p>What time did they go away? - Mr. Watts went out of my house, a little boy fetched him out, about half after ten, soon after the conversation about his not keeping me up; I saw no more of Watts.</p>
               <p>How long did his wife stay after that? - She stopped a little bit, and then she went, she took her beer in her hand, about a quarter of a pint.</p>
               <p>Recollect now, whether she did or not? - I think she did, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Are you sure, one way or the other? - I think the took it in her hand; they live but over the way, and I suppose she took it home; there was not more than a quarter of a pint left.</p>
               <p>Might she not as well have swallowed that, as taken it away with her? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner's wife and these two men continue in company together after the prisoner went away, till the wife went away? - Yes, she went out soon after.</p>
               <p>But till she went out they continued in company, only the prisoner leaving them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon after she went away did you shut up? - About a quarter after eleven, I saw no more of none of them after that.</p>
               <p>Was there any body left in the house, after the wife went away, except your lodgers? - I am not able to say that, Sir, but I know we were in bed very soon that night.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in company with Pike and Jones after? - No, Sir, they never had any thing to drink after, nor fell in company with any body after, but went up stairs to bed when I shut in.</p>

            , and that was all that lodged there; I went up two pair of stairs on account of a man and his wife that came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260054"></xptr> and laid a couple of nights in the house, and I moved up to make room for them, the man was going on board a ship, I have continued up stairs ever since.</p>
               <p>Was that before or after the prisoner was taken? - Oh, since the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear that the prisoner was taken up? - About eleven I believe at night.</p>
               <p>That was the very night he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who came and told you? - I think it was the watchman that told me while I was shutting the gates.</p>
               <p>Did you go to see him that night? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him that night before you heard he was taken up? - Yes, he had been at the house and supped with me.</p>
               <p>What time did he come into the house at night? - He was in before I went in.</p>
               <p>What time did you come in? - It was in the afternoon, I had been trying to get into Bartholemew's hospital, and it was a wet day and I staid by the way; I went out in the morning between nine and ten, I think I came home between four and five, as nigh as I can guess, I did not take knowledge of the time.</p>
               <p>When you came, I think you say, Watts was there? - He was.</p>
               <p>What was he doing when you came in? - He was hemming a stirrup and mending a pad, I think it was, or some of the harness, in one of the boxes in the house at the window.</p>
               <p>Did you join company with them then? - I joined company with them when I came in, I continued at the house the remainder of the night, I never went out any further than into the yard.</p>
               <p>What beer had you? - We had three pots of twopenny.</p>
               <p>Did any body else drink with you at that time? - Only us three, this man at the bar and the man with the wooden leg, and I, we had three pots of twopenny, we called for it about eight, when we began to toast the bread to put to the twopenny, I did not drink any beer before I went to supper, nor I did not see them drink; I sat all the afternoon without drinking, I commonly sit there all day without drinking, because I have been ill so long.</p>
               <p>What had you for supper? - Toast and twopenny and some Cheshire cheese, and some moist sugar.</p>
               <p>Which of you was it called for the nutmeg? - We had no nutmeg at all.</p>
               <p>How happenened that? - Really I do not know, I think it was asked for, but they said there was none in the house, I am sure we had no nutmeg; after supper there was a horse came in with the mad staggers, and we all three went out together to see it, there was nobody else in the house hardly, this was a little after nine, we stopped but a very few minutes, I came in again directly, we had a pot of twopenny after we came in, that made the fourth pot.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner go away then, or did he come back with you? - He came back with us again, and sat down and drank share of the last pot, he went away about half after ten.</p>
               <p>Did any of you go out with him? - Nobody that I know of that belonged to the house; the boy came and enquired for a porter, I do not know who that boy was, I have seen the boy leading a couple of blind men about, but I do not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Who answered the boy? - I believe the prisoner answered the boy; and said do you want a porter at this time at night, the boy said you must come directly, for the gentleman is waiting for a porter; I cannot remember who the boy spoke to first.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Jones your sister-in-law answer the boy? - I cannot say, I remember my sister stopping the boy, and asking him what sort of a man it was, the boy said it was a tallish man, with a cocked up hat, and my sister asked him where he was, and he said, he stood in the street; then it was that the prisoner asked who could want a porter at that time of the night? and somebody in the house made answer to him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260055"></xptr> go and see, and he went out to see, and his wife followed him out, if I am not mistaken, his wife was there, and brought a bit of meat for his supper, and he said he had done supper, so she called for a pint of beer and eat it.</p>
               <p>Did she go out a little after him? - Yes, to the best of my knowledge she did, and came back again to look for his knot.</p>
               <p>What o'clock might this be? - To the best of my knowledge it was as nigh half after ten as can be, I could almost swear to the time, by his saying to his wife, we keep Mrs. Jones up, and she said, I shall not shut up till eleven, if there is nobody in the house, I looked at the clock, that made me so particular.</p>
               <p>What time was the house shut up? - At eleven, as nigh as I can guess, and while I was shutting the gates, I heard he was taken up, the doors were then shut.</p>
               <p>When you heard that the man that had just been supping with you was taken up; why did not you go to the watch house? - I could do him no good, I was no housekeeper, and another thing, I did imagine they would not have let me seen him, if I had gone; the next morning when he went to have his hearing, I went down, I do not know that I did tell them any thing of it that night.</p>
               <p>Was it so common a thing for your friends to be taken up? - I might mention it to my sister, Pike might be gone to bed, she might be gone up stairs.</p>
               <p>Had not your brother and you some talk about it that night? - No, he was gone to bed, I believe, he went to bed about nine, or between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Did he go to bed directly after supper? - I do not know, he did not sup with us.</p>
               <p>He supped in the other room? - I cannot say where he supped that night, or what time he went to bed that night.</p>
               <p>Was there any particular reason for his going to bed that night? - No, not that I know of, he had not complained of being ill that I heard, I was so ill myself; the next morning I went down to see Watts.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - I went by myself.</p>
               <p>Did your sister go before you, or after you? - If she went at all, she went after me, I believe; but I do not know, I did not see her there.</p>
               <p>Then you do not remember hearing her say it was very hard they would not let her in to speak for him? - No; that must be the second time, I do not think she went there, the first morning I went by myself, and I think I came back by myself.</p>
               <p>What became of the two Clarkes that night that the prisoner supped there? - They might be out, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Were they both out? - To the best of my knowledge I believe they were; I cannot be sure; I believe

             was not up, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after you was told of it, that Mr. Jones went to the office? - It was after that; some time after they had had their hearing, in the middle of the day, I went to the office, when I heard he was going to have his hearing; I think it was after Mrs. Jones came; I met her there, and she complained to me that they would not let her up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you known<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260056"></xptr> the prisoner? - About eight months; I always heard a very good character of him, as an honest hard-working man.</p>

               <p>I think he told you it was a bed, wrapped up in a blanket, that he was bringing it from Barker's-yard, and carrying it to George-yard? - He said he was a poor man, and had a little rent behind, and that his wife was down-laying.</p>
               <p>Butterill. I was close behind; Roberts asked him what he had on his back; he told him a bed, tied up in a blanket; he said he had a bed, and was going to George-yard; Roberts said he must go with him; the things were tied up as they were now.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. I confess, Gentlemen, I may now very openly declare, that I perfectly concur with you in opinion; I am extremely satisfied with your verdict. I think these witnesses should not be permitted to escape with impunity; I have no doubt but the story they have told us is false; let them all three be committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner Watts. I do not mean now to pronounce upon you the sentence of the law, which will be done at the regular time, but I have called you back for the purpose of telling you what you are to expect, and the reason of it; the crime for which you have been convicted is an enormous one, and it is a growing one; your fate would have been extremely doubtful at all events; but if there was any doubt at all, you have probably completely removed it, by the attempt you have made in setting up a defence which the verdict of the Jury, concurring with my opinion, has discredited: therefore you must prepare for your fate, and you are not to expect that the mercy of your Sovereign will be extended to you: and I hope it will be understood by every body, that those attempts to escape punishment will always be considered as aggravations of the crime; and where the crime is of a capital nature, such attempts to elude the law will preclude the prisoner from any hope of mercy, and also bring the deserved punishment on the heads of the witnesses themselves.</p>

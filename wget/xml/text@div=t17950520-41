I secured the place and went up stairs again, and came down at my regular time as I always had done, and I made all the inquiry where I thought these bad people lived; and I got an information and I sent for a peace officer, and I gave him intelligence where I thought he could find such people, and he went and the watchman went with him, and they found halfpence; they sent for me and shewed me what they found.</p>

               <p>I had an information that Mr. Sole had been robbed. I went to that young woman's lodging, Mary Fitzgerald's, it was as near half past seven o'clock as possible, on Saturday the 18th, I found her, the boy, and two more men, I knew them to be thieves before, they were eating of boiled eggs. I told them I was come to make a search for something that had been lost. She told me I was very welcome, there was nothing there that she was afraid of; searching the bed, I found this parcel of halfpence between the blankets and the bed. The bed was in the same room, I told her that was what I came after. She told me to take it and keep it to myself. I made her answer again that would not do for Mr. Sole to lose his property in that manner. I immediately sent for Mr. Sole by the watchman, and while the watchman was gone, one of the men that were there said, why cannot you keep it for yourself? I told him I could not think of making a property of what I know another to be robbed of; says one of the other men, (not her) d-mn him, we will do Mr. Sole out and out. Mr. Sole came up into the room. I opened the bundle of halfpence, and asked him if he could swear to that property before the prisoners? he said he could, he picked out these three farthings which he said he could swear to; he said he knew it was all his property, though he would not pretend to swear to it all. I charged him to aid and assist me to take the prisoners; one of the men said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200127"></xptr>d-mn your eyes, it shall not be six of you that shall take us.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that? - One man that is not taken, Ward his name is. Immediately Mr. Soles ran down stairs to get more assistance to take them, in the mean time they rushed by me, and insisted to go down stairs; all the men, that boy and all. I followed them, they got before, and got out of my sight. I followed on after them as fast as I could till more assistance came; this boy, the prisoner Parker, jumped into a river that parts from Turnmill street to Saffron hill, between them. A man who see him go down, said, he was under that bridge, I looked under the bridge; a man went down to this river or ditch; or whatever you call it, and assisted me to pull him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner? - It was. I pulled him out, and tied his hands behind him, and took him back to Mr. Sole's, and then I went back to the woman's lodgings, and took her afterwards; she made no resistance at all against me, she said that how she knew the boy to be innocent at that time, and then I took them to prison.</p>
               <p>Q.Now this room, whose room was it? - It was her room. I knew she lived in the court, but I did not know that that was the room before. She delivered up the key, and acknowledged it was her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any body lived with her there, whether it was the room of any one that was with her as well as her's? - I do not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LARCHER Sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman of that district, coming round the hour of three. I saw Mr. Sole's shutters broke, which here is a piece of it, and I saw a pane of glass broke; and I immediately rung his bell to alarm him. After that Mr. Sole came down and struck a light, and I asked what he had lost? he said five pounds worth of halfpence, but after that he found two papers out of the five pounds, that they had not taken, which were four pounds ten shillings he lost, which he has sworn to.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is it from Fitzgerald's to to Sole's? - Not above a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the constable? - I did. When I went up along with the constable, he told her that he came to make a search from information that he had got; he immediately turned down the bed clothes, and found the property of the prosecutor's underneath; he immediately sent me for Mr. Sole. Mr. Sole came, and thought of his opinion it was his property, by finding them three farthings particularly that he could swear to. After that Mr. Sole went for more assistance; because they d-mned and shugg-ed their eyes that six men should not take them. Immediately, while Mr. Sole was gone they flew out of the house, and ran down stairs, I catched hold of one by the collar, and one Ward that is not taken,

             a knife about half a foot long. I followed them along, with the constable, two or three alleys, till they got over the shore that goes up to Saffron-hill, there is a shore there that comes from Hampstead, runs quite down into Fleet Ditch, and so into the river, and there this lad jumped in out of the three, the other two made their escape by that time, there was assistance came, and ran after them two down Saffron-hill, they were not taken at all. I went back again after Mr. Brown, the constable, had taken that lad, and the woman was in the room; I brings her down to the party at Mr. Sole's house, that is all; I have told the truth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot pretend to say any thing but to one halfpenny and farthing, the farthing I have had in my house between two and three years; it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200128"></xptr>a bit of brass of some foreign coin, that I never see the like.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bit of brass found? - I papered the halfpence the Wednesday night before. This was on Friday night that this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the brass farthing? - In one crown's worth of halfpence, as we always put three penny worth of farthings in five shillings worth of halfpence. The halfpenny is marked with an M. and a crown, I do not remember seeing it till the Wednesday night to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put that with any of the halfpence? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the halfpence in a particular parcel to the farthing? - That I cannot say. The reason of my remarking the halfpenny was, there are many cutler's use my house, and they are used to stamp the halfpence, and seeing this halfpenny stamped in this way, I remarked it, because, I do not remember ever seeing one stamped so before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Parker. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning, I had no money, I went to pawn my coat to get some victuals, and coming by this here court, I met with this young woman at the bar, and I was always brought up in the parish, and I knew this young woman; and I asked her where a pawnbroker was open, to pawn my coat to get some victuals? she said they were not up yet, and she had something in a stone bottle, some peppermint, and I asked her to give me a drop, and she said, if I would come up stairs the would give me some. I had not been up there above a quarter of an hour before this gentleman came up, and they said that Mr. Sole's house was broke open, and robbed of some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fitzgerald. I was filling water at the end of the court; two young men came through the court that I had drank with before, and they asked me if I would have any thing to drink, I said I did not care, and I went up stairs with the water, and they followed me, and then I went down and fetched half a pint of peppermint, and I met this boy, Parker, at the top of the court; and he asked me to go and pawn his coat, and I said the pawnbrokers were not up. I said if he would go up stairs and wait a bit, the pawnbrokers would be open presently, and directly as I came up stairs, there was the constable in the room with the watchman; and they said they came to search my place, and I said he was very welcome; and he asked me if the bedstead turned up? I told him, no; and he searched on the bed, and there he found these halfpence; and he said, he supposed that was what he came to look for, for Mr. Sole's house had been broke open, and he had lost some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Parker. I have not a friend in the world.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. When you went into Fitzgerald's room, who were the first people you see? - I met her coming down stairs. I found all the three men in the room up one pair of stairs. I told her I had come to search the room.</p>
               <p>Q. To Larober. Were you with Brown? - I was.</p>
               <p>Jury to Brown. Why did you suspect these persons in particular? - It was not me that suspected them particularly myself, but Mr. Sole that directed me, having derived some particular information.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inquire of them how they came by such a quantity of halfpence? - I asked them how they came by such a quantity of halfpence, which I thought belonged to Mr. Sole? - they told me to keep them myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they did not tell you how they came by them? - No.</p>

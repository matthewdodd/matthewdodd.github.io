I was lately of the E Division—on June 11th I saw the prisoner at the Two Spies public-house, King Street, Long Acre, about 9 o'clock in the evening, with three others, one named John Hall, now awaiting his trial—they then went through Covent Garden into the Strand; I followed—Harlington went into a restaurant—I watched them—shortly afterwards they came from the restaurant and passed the Coach and Horses public-house—the prisoner entered one bar and I another—I saw him give a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—the barman tried it; it was bad—I posted men outside to assist—the barman called a constable and pointed out the prisoner, and they all ran away—I returned to the public-house, and the barmaid handed me the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—on the following Saturday, June 16th, about 3 p.m., I was with Detective Kerley, near Lincoln's Inn Fields—we watched the prisoner—he went to a little boy and gave him something—the boy went into the Castle in Portugal Street—I followed—Kerley waited outside—the boy got some rum in a bottle, and tendered a half-crown—when I came out the prisoner was waiting at the top of the street—I took him into custody—I took him to the public-house, and there saw Kerley pick up the bad half-crown—we got assistance and carried the prisoner to the station—on being searched we found three counterfeit half-crowns in the lining of his coat, loose—the prisoner said "You b——, you put them there"—he afterwards said he picked them up.</p>

On the 28th of October last, I went out to get some beer, I left my little boy in the room and the prisoner at the bar; I left my white cambric muslin gown in my box, I was out about ten minutes, and when I came back I perceived my muslin gown under her gown through her pocket-hole; I did not tell her of it, she dined with us after she had the gown in her possession, she went out after dinner, and I went a little way with her, knowing her some time I did not like to tell her of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner? - A. She lived in the family that my husband and I did before I was married. When my husband came home at night I told him of it, and he went after her the next day.</p>

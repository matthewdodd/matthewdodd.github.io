             sworn. On the morning of the 12th of June, between one and two o'clock, as near as I can guess, I was at <placeName id="t18060702-4-crimeloc22">Holloway</placeName>

               <p>Q. And these trowsers you put under your head. A.Yes, I had them under my head when they came on me; these three prisoners were along with the man that held me; the prisoner that stands outside took the trowsers away from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020006"></xptr>Q. What were the others doing there. - A. The young one, when they talked of one another's name, desired no name to be expressed.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got the trowsers what did they do next. - A. They went away from where I said and left them, after they had been there a good piece of time.</p>
               <p>Q. They took the money and the purse, and left the trowsers, how long had they been doing this. - A. They were about fifteen minutes as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you talking to them. - A. No, the man that held me was hurting me, I struggled to get from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a quarter of an hour kneeling upon you. - A. He was near a quarter of an hour, he used very odious expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it star light or moon light. - A. It was not moon light, it was very bright.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see their faces. - A. Yes, and the man who held me had a smock frock on, the others were dressed much as they are now, only one of them had not a white jacket on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen either of them before. - A. I might have seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had or not. - A. I cannot say, because I was in that place a year before.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they go when they left you. - A. They went out of the yard over into another yard of the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do. - A. I was gathering up the things I had laying in the hay, they came into the back yard again and went over the meadows, they did not speak a word to me the second time, nor I to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give any alarm. - A. As soon as the public house was open in the morning, I told the waiter how I had been used.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any of the men again. - A. That very morning, at six o'clock, I saw the man that held me.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking of them three men at the bar. - A. I saw them in the back yard the next day, and one of them struck me, that big man; I saw them all four together in the hay yard of the public house where I had been sleeping.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they drinking in the house. - A. I saw them there, it was in the yard where they abused me, they came to me and asked me if they had robbed me, I said to the man that held me, these three men robbed me while you held me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they taken into custody at that time. - A. No, they went away to work, they wrought at Mr. Small's that lives just by the side of this place, I went to their master that they wrought with, and they abused me again, that was in the afternoon; I had not a farthing to go to any justice's on the day they robbed me, which was Thursday, but on Monday I went to Bow-street, and got an officer to take them up; one was taken in the same public house, one in his master's-yard, in the same place, and the other between the public house and his master's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume that you (from your dialect) are an Irish labourer, and when you cannot get work at one place you go to another. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You understand that these men are tried for their lives. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand there is a reward. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not you told that. - A. I was told that I would get for my loss of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this hay yard a place where Irish labourers sleep. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who slept there besides yourself. - A. There was another man that slept in the hay that saw every thing they did to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him to assist you in taking up these persons that had robbed you. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. These men were on the spot from the Thursday to the Monday at work there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing from the other man. - A. No, they spoke to him, he told him there were women enough if they would go to the other yard.</p>
               <p>- COX sworn. I am one of the conductors of the patrole at Bow-street. I apprehended Baxter in the tap room, I apprehended Jarrard in Mr. Small's yard, and Althorpe I apprehended in a foot path opposite Mr Small's gate; the prosecutor pointed them out to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Jarrard called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You struck nobody but the prisoner? A. I struck every body that I thought was inclined to strike me - I struck the prisoner first - by some means or other I pushed two men down in the first instance - very likely I knocked them down - I cannot say that I had my fist closed - I was so irritated, whether I tripped them up, or struck them, I cannot say - I might knock them down, but I do not recollect whether I pushed them or struck them - I will not swear my fists were not doubled - I did not strike many people in the first instance, because I was the first that was seized - I pushed them down by some means, and with my hands, I believe - I am sure it was with my hands - I cannot recollect whether my hands were closed or not - Daley, I, the deceased, and Martin, and the other two men were in the row - I cannot swear there were any more.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not the old woman complain of being indecently treated by the deceased? A. I cannot say - he pushed her with his shoulder - she was in front of the prisoner, inside the deceased - in passing, the deceased accidentally pushed against her - the prisoner was one of the persons there, and two women and two men, as near as I can recollect - Daley was behind me - but the woman did not complain of being pushed by the deceased indecently or rudely in my presence - the prisoner said, "He offended my mother" - McCarthy never uttered a sentence - I have not the least animosity against the prisoner - I saw a mark on him, which I gave him myself - I struck him on the temple with my closed fist; that was before I pushed the two men down - I was irritated then, because he rushed violently against me, and we quarrelled - I struck first - I knew McCarthy before - he was not sober - I had two glasses of rum and water with one or two friends at the Chequers - I had not been in any other public-house, on any drinking system - I had been receiving some money at a public-house for a sick tradesman - I drank porter at the man's house I took the money to.</p>

            . I was in company with Crowley on this Sunday morning - I saw McCarthy walking along Turnmill-street, and pass Castle-street - he accidentally stumbled against a woman - he was intoxicated - to the best of my belief, he did not push against her - I saw him do nothing but attempt to put his foot on the pavement - he had one foot on the pavement, which is higher than the street stones - the prisoner then stepped forward, and struck him a violent blow on the side of his head, which threw him backwards into the carriage-way on his head - McCarthy had not said any thing to give offence to any body that I saw - the prisoner, and a woman he called his mother, and another woman whom I do not know, were standing on the pavement - there were two men, I believe - McCarthy did not come against any body designedly - his shoulder might come in contact with the woman, as he came on the pavement - she did not see him coming along - he might put his shoulder against her - he did not do it in an offensive way - the prisoner said nothing, but struck him a violent blow on the left side - he fell in the carriage-way - Crowley stepped forward, and lifted up McCarthy - I assisted him- I helped up McCarthy while Crowley stepped forward, and asked the prisoner "Why he had struck that old man?"- he said, for insulting his mother, and he would do so to any body who insulted his mother - Crowley then struck the prisoner, and the prisoner, I believe, struck him - the prisoner fell - another man came up to Crowley, and Crowley, I believe, struck him - I left McCarthy, to go for assistance - they then dispersed - Crowley and I helped McCarthy down towards his lodging, and were overtaken by the prisoner and a gang of twelve or thirteen persons - the prisoner came up, crying out, "Here they are" - I had no dispute with the prisoner that afternoon - I never saw him before in my life to my knowledge - the prisoner came up and struck among us - several came up and caught hold of Crowley, and threw him down on the opposite side - I do not know where McCarthy was all this time - I got away - I stood in a door-way, and they were looking out - I was on my way home, and met the prisoner afterwards with a jug in his hand - he met a person who he knew, and told him he had had a row.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Cas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030050"></xptr>tle-street. On this Sunday morning, I looked out of my window, hearing a noise, and observed five or six men scuffling together apparently - I afterwards saw three of them cross the street, and go towards Saffron-hill - some person came from the opposite end of the street, and said, "Here are three of them," and struck amongst them - McCarthy was one of them - I did not know the other two - the person struck McCarthy, and he never arose till I called the attention of the police to him - I do not identify the person who struck that blow - there was a further scuffle between fourteen or fifteen of them, and they went to the other end of the street - they came back - I told the police, as I thought him severely injured - in the first instance, I heard a disturbance between five or six men, and a noise as if a man fell against the house, but I could not discern that - the first thing I saw was, apparently, five or six men scuffling together - I could not see the place at the curbstone where the dispute took place - it was three houses from my window - when I got to the deceased, he laid there - he never moved from the time he was struck till he was moved by the police and two other men - he laid about two feet from the curb-stone - I should think he was struck somewhere about the side of the head - I do not know any of the people who were there, to distinguish them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first thing you saw was the scuffle; what gave rise to that you cannot tell? A. No - I afterwards saw three persons cross the street, and walk along - the two outside ones appeared supporting the middle one - after the police came up, I went down myself - I did not see the old woman at all - there was gas at the end of the street, and directly opposite - I was too far off to see the woman.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live on Holborn-hill. I visited the deceased on Saturday morning, the 21st of June - I found him suffering from intense disease of the brain - I did not examine his head particularly - I did not see any external injury - I continued to visit him till his death - my last visit was on Tuesday, the 24th - he died early in the morning of the 25th - after his death, I opened his head - I found two marks of violence under the scalp, one on the right side, and one on the left - I found within the head, blood and bloody serum on the right portion of the brain - the brain, of itself, presented marks of inflammation, and a fracture at the base of the skull - the immediate cause of his death I believe to be inflammation of the brain, arising from external violence, and judge, from the marks under the scalp, one on the right side of the head, and the other on the left, that the injury was inflicted there - the base of the skull separates the mouth from the brain - (a violent fall generally produces that) - the inflammation appeared in its last stage when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you think if a medical gentleman had been called in, in the early stage of the inflammation, that proper remedies might have stopped it? A. It is possible - I should think it had existed three or four days - medical assistance should have been called in before - I did not see him till the Saturday - my assistant saw him on the Friday evening - intoxication would certainly considerably increase inflammation of the brain.</p>

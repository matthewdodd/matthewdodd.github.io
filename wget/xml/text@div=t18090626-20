                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260017"></xptr>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner about the New inn any day - A. Yes. On Sunday the 11th of this month I was sitting in the lodge, I was looking out of the window; I took notice of the prisoner and two men; I saw the prisoner in company with two others, as I was in the lodge at the entrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was one of the men - - A. The prisoner was one; the other men I did not take particular notice of; they seemed as if they came to some gentleman; the prisoner passed the lodge window and returned, the others went further up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have any thing with him - A. He did not appear to have any thing with him at all as I saw. The window stands in the inn.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that he was going out, do you - A. There was no passage that way that he was going.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, in consequence of one of the laundresses speaking to you, you pursued the prisoner - A. She called me from the lodge; I went up stairs to No. 5, there I perceived the door of the chamber had been broken open, and some mischief had been done to these chambers; I went in pursuit, and I overtook these men in Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. That was soon after you first saw a chamber that had been broken open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that you followed these men - A. Yes; I overtook the prisoner in Chancery-lane, he was one of the three; they were going towards Holborn; they were walking; the prisoner had a bundle in his right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him at the time - A. No; I did not take the bundle from him; he surrendered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perhaps open the bundle at that time - A. No, I did not; I held him there till I got a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him and the constable any where - A. I did; to the Roll's watchhouse in Carey-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other two men - A. They went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. At the Roll's watchhouse did you open the bundle - A. It was opened; I saw it opened; there was a time piece, and tea chest rolled up in a dirty table cloth. These are the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. - . Q. The New inn is a public thoroughfare - A. I do not know how far that is to be described a public thoroughfare. We are in the habit of locking up the New inn.</p>
               <p>Q. A number of people pass through, do not they - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular in the three men - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take particular notice of people coming in - A. Not particularly; I was sitting in the inside of the lodge, looking out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear that the prisoner at the bar was one of the men passing by - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you watch him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray whereabouts is the chamber that was broken open - A. On the left side.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him go towards that place - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards when you seized the prisoner with the bundle - A. About half an hour, on three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was it within an hour - A. I dare say it was.</p>

               <p>Q. How near are they to Mr. Oakden's chambers - A. In the same passage; one is on the left and the other to the right; up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that afternoon seeing any person in the passage, or stair case - A. I was going there; it was about six o'clock, or a few minutes after I saw them people; I heard some voices, I could not distinguish what they said; I am rather hard of hearing; I was terrified; I saw the back of the men; there were a great many people passing; I could not swear to any of them; I saw one man with a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come out of the passage - A. I saw three going; I could not tell who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man come out of No. 5 - A. I saw one man in particular with a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any people that came out with him - A. The others came out before him; I did not distinguish how many.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this man come out of No. 5, did you go yourself any where - A. I went up one pair of stairs, to my master's door; I saw the door safe; what alarmed me I saw some stones at the door, in the passage, between the two chambers, and some lime and dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the door of the other chamber - A. I did; I called for Stapleford very loud; I went down to the porter and told him. That is all I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner and he could not speak together - A. I am certain of that, because I was outside of the door during the time the prisoner was locked up; we never suffer any prisoner to be in the yard at all.</p>

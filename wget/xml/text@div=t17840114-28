               <p>The prisoner lodged in my house about eleven weeks, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, and other things; she left her lodgings just before Christmas, I did not miss the things till she was gone, she was gone a week before I opened the door, she took the key and gave me no warning, the person who took the room for her desired me to open the door; we found her at a house in Clerkenwell, where she lodged, we took her, and she said the things were at Mr. Nicholls's the pawn-broker's.</p>
               <p>Was any promise made by you to her of favor if she confessed? - Not any.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I received two sheets and two spoons; I took them of the prisoner; I knew her before; they were pawned at different times, all separate; the last the 27th; they were pawned in their own name; they have been in my possession ever since; they are the same things that the prisoner pawned.</p>
               <p>(Two sheets and two spoons deposed to.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I pledged the things, I meant to replace them again, I did not give up my lodging, I offered part of the things back again.</p>
               <p>Nicholls. Two days before Mrs. Martin told me the things were stolen out of her house, the prisoner sent money by a person from Clerkenwell, as I understood afterwards, to redeem them, and I would not give them out, because I understood that the person herself was near where I lived, and therefore I would not deliver them.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you tell us so upon your first examination? - I did not know whether it would be of any service to the prisoner or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140036"></xptr>Court. You are to tell the whole truth, never consider the effect of evidence, whether it makes for or against the prisoner, that the Court and Jury will judge of.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. How did this woman behave during the time that she lived with you? - Some part of the time she behaved very well, and another part of the time she got acquainted with a Captain of a ship's lady, and she borrowed some plate of them, and pawned the plate for thirty shillings, and after a while she was taken up for that plate; I went and paid the money, and she gave me a note of hand for payment in two days, and she never paid it: she was brought to me in the character of a Captain's widow, and I did not know whether she had any husband or no, but he was a foot soldier; she was very well off, her brother had just done for her, and put her good clothes on.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any children? - One; some of my friends have been here to day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you know the Steers were discharged by the Magistrate on their own recognizance? A. Yes; they have surrendered here - I found the shoes two months after the robbery.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Hanworth. I was in Mr. Maine's employ, but was turned away, in consequence of this robbery - about a fortnight after I was turned away, I met Pearce in the Swan-yard at Hanworth; I knew him before; he asked me to drink; I drank, and he said, "Stop a bit, I want to have a little talk with you presently," and soon after, he said, "I thought you had been in some prison before now, from what I heard;" I said, it was out of anybody's power to put me into prison; "But," said, "you have done it nicely, I knew it was you that took them, as soon as Mr. Maine told me about the robbery, the next morning;" I said, "For God's sake, what did you do with them?" meaning the shoes; but I did not say shoes; I said, "There must have been five or six of you to take them away;" he said, "No, there was only Will Steers, me, and another;" I said, "What did you do with them?" he said, "We have done with them right enough, we have buried them in the gravel pits;" I asked him to let me have a pair, as I was almost barefooted, and wanted a pair; he told me to come over to him at Witton next Sunday, and he would let me know; I went over next Sunday, and found Pearce alone; I asked him if he would let me have a pair of shoes; he then told me that one Orwell, or'some such name, over at Twickenham, had them to make away with; I understood that Orwell had got them all; he asked if Benny, Mr. Maine's foreman, had lost any clothes; I said, I did not know, but I thought he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as odd, that he should ask you about what you knew nothing of, and he knew all about? A. Yes; he said, he knew he had, for he saw the waistcoat hung out to dry at Steers', and the jacket was at Witton; he said, Will Steers would be at home in a fortnight if I wanted any shoes, and that he was gone to work at Case Orton - on the next Saturday night, I went to Twickenham, as I wanted to buy a pair of shoes, but I could not find Orwell out - I thought I should get a pair cheap - three weeks after this I went to Pearce, and said, Steers was not come; he said, when Steers came home, he would let me know about the shoes. The next Sunday afternoon, he had promised to meet me again, but I thought he would not come - as I was going down to Mr. Maine, to tell him what I had heard, I met him in the Swan-yard again - he asked me if I had seen Will that day; I said, "No; he has not been here, has he?" he said, "Yes, he has been here all the afternoon;" I said, I had not seen him, and asked him again, if he had got any shoes, he said, Yes, for he had been sorting them out that morning - I told him to ask for a pair for me, for I would buy them; he said, No, he wanted a pair for himself; he would not ask for them, but he would show me the man, if I would go with him, and I might ask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260058"></xptr>myself - I went with him to Witton, which is about two miles - as we went along, he said, very likely Will would give me a ticket, to go and get a pair of shoes - I supposed by that. that they had been pawned - we went to the yard where Steers lived - he said, "Steers is gone to bed, but I will soon call him up; you stand under the tree, out of the moonlight;" he then called Will - his mother came, but I did not see Steers till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you so anxious to get a pair of shoes? A. To show them to Mr. Maine. I think I informed him of this a fornight ago last Monday; after Pearce said the shoes were at Steers', I went and told Mr. Maine; I did not tell him before, because I did not know whether they were telling me the truth or a story, and I wanted a pair to show Mr. Maine, as a proof.</p>

On Thursday night, the 17th of August, between eight and nine o'clock, these shoes were safe in a room adjoining the kitchen; they were worth above 40l.; I missed them about six o'clock the next morning; it was then daylight - I lost a great coat, but no waistcoat - I know the shoes produced to be Mr. Maine's.</p>

I live at 23, Hornsey Road, and work for Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode—on 4th February I was in New Street, about 6.45, and saw Wilbutt dragging a form along the pathway—when he got to the Northumberland coffee-shop, Jones came up to him and said, "Come along, make haste," and lifted the form on his shoulder—he went down as far as New Street then, and there I saw another form against the wall—Hinder was standing at the side of it—Wilbutt put the form he was carrying down by the other one—they then left the two forms in the charge of Hinder—Jones and Wilbutt went towards the place where they had taken the forms from—I saw a gentleman looking about—he said some forms had been stolen, and I informed the police, and saw Wilbutt taken.</p>

               <p>on the 8th, in Chancery Lane—I told him the charge, he said he did not know anything about the stealing of them, but he knew who did do it; he asked if there was anyone in custody—I told him that a man named Wilbutt was—he said he did not know him by the name of Wilbutt, he knew him as <hi rend="italic">Black Bill</hi>—I took him to the station, and he said there were two forms of type taken about a fortnight previous to these two, and one on the Tuesday or Wednesday previous, and he would take me and show me where the metal was sold—he took me to Bartholomew Close and showed me the place, and said, "They gave three half-pence a pound for it"</p>

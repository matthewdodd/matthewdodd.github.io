                  </hi>. I am the father of the deceased, and reside at 116, Pratt Street, St. Pancras—on Saturday evening, 17th February, I started from my house with a baked potato oven, on wheels—I was dragging it, and my two sons were behind—the deceased and his brother—previous to starting I saw the prisoner about twenty yards behind me, with a horse and cart, which was then standing still behind some trucks—I was dragging my truck three feet from the kerb, on my left—when I had got about twenty yards from my house, which would be forty yards from where the prisoner was, his horse and cart dashed in between me and the kerb, knock<lb></lb>ing one son down under the horse's feet, and killing the other—I did not see the cart bearing down upon me in time to get out of the way, it was done so momentarily—the cart caught the oven as well, and drove me with it—the prisoner had both reins in his hand, drawing up—the elder boy scrambled out, and was picked up—he was not hurt anything to speak of, only his knee—the deceased, Albert, was carried away by a boy to a doc<lb></lb>tor's, close by—the prisoner got out of his cart and went over to the doctor's with me, and the boy was lying there, a corpse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 122, Pratt Street—on Saturday afternoon, 17th February, I saw the potato oven—Mr. Church was dragging it by the handles, and the two boys were shoving behind—it was about a yard from the kerb; it in a pretty broad road; there was room for the cart to have passed easily on its right side—I saw the prisoner before the collision, he was, standing up in his cart, driving—he was going tremendously fast—I did not notice what he was doing—I saw the horse and cart come rushing on the left hand side of the oven—it nearly knocked the oven over, knocked the two boys down, and the wheel went over the little boy's jaw and killed</p>

The trucks were lower down than my house, not between me and the prisoner—I can't say at what rate he was going, but it must have been very fast; it threw me right forward—I was like between the shafts of the truck—if I had known that anything was coming I could have turned and got out of the way.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody about 6.30, in the evening of 17th February, at the Star Coal Wharf, Camden Town, when he came in with a light cart and horse—I told him I should take him into custody for causing the death of the child Church—he said "I am very sorry for it; I went to deliver some coals at Waite's Place, Pratt Street; after I had delivered them I got up on to the shafts, and the horse galloped off; I took out my orders to see where I was to deliver the next lot, and I never saw the oven till I ran into it."</p>

I am the brother of the deceased—I was pushing behind the potatoe oven, and my brother by the side of me—the horse knocked me down—I scrambled from under my father's feet and saved myself—my brother was killed dead on the spot—I did not hear any band of music playing at the time—half an hour before we started there was a band, but it was all clear out of the street before we started—that could not have frightened the horse—I did not see the prisoner till he dashed into us.</p>

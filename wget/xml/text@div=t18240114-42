Between twelve and four o'clock in the day my bed-room lock was picked, the chest of drawers broken open, and this property stolen, with the duplicate of five silver tea-spoons, pawned at Chappel's, and other trinkets; they were all together in a bag; the value of the whole is near 20 l.; I had seen nobody in the house, and do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you occupy all the house - A. It is a large house divided into two, and has only one common stair case to both. I rent one half, and a baker the other. The landlord does not occupy any part of it.</p>

               <p>the 15th of November I was in bed—I had been asleep, and was awoke by the prisoner touching my toe—I got out of bed and made towards him, and made a blow at him—he fell, not in consequence of my blow, but to hide himself—he was very much in liquor—when I laid down again he wanted me to go and fight with him outside in the court—I said I did not want to fight him, if he wanted fighting I would talk to him in the morning when he was sober—that would not satisfy him, he wanted to light right or wrong—he said if I did not fight him I had no business to sleep, and he would cut our heels and our ancles off—there were other lodgers in the room, but they were asleep—I said nothing—I knew I had no business to stop in the room when he said this, and I dressed myself and went down stairs—he had gone down before me—when I got down I found him outside the door—he asked me what I wanted—I said I wanted no quarrelling but to go to bed—I then asked what he wanted—he said, "Come on, I am ready for you"—he was making towards me—I defended him off by striking him somewhere in the face with my fist—I cannot say where, I struck him a hard blow—his face did not bleed—I did not give him a black eye—I bit him about the mouth I believe—I did not knock his teeth out—he then struck me over the eye with a knife, and after<lb></lb>wards cut me down the back of the neck and over my left ear—the policeman parted us—I was instantly taken to Guy's Hospital, and got my head dressed.</p>

I was passing the court, and heard a cry of "Take the knife away from him!—he has got a knife!—murder!—he is killing me with a knife!"—another voice said, "There is a policeman at the top, why not call him?"—I went up, and found the pro<lb></lb>secutor on the prisoner—they both had hold of each other—he said, "Po<lb></lb>liceman, he has got a knife in his hand; take it"—I caught hold of him, and saw his left hand drawn out of his left pocket—I said, "Where is the knife?"—he said, "I have got no knife"—I put my hand into his left pocket, and found this knife—it was shut, and was not bloody—there was a good deal of blood from the wound, all over the prosecutor's shoulder and frock—I saw the prisoner fumbling in his pocket before he drew his hand out—I did not look at the point to see if it was bloody—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at Guy's Hospital. I saw the prosecutor when he was brought in—he had three or four small wounds, and one cut behind his left ear—the cuts appeared to be done with a knife—I think this knife would do it—there was not the least danger from the wounds—there had been some bleeding, not much—the knife would not necessarily have been bloody if it had inflicted the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. That night, as I was going to bed, I chanced to put my hand on this man's bed, as it was so near mine; he told me to mind what I was about or he would knock me down stairs; I said he should not do it: he got up, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me across the bed, and said, if I wanted any thing to come down stairs, and he would give it me; he was drunk as well as me; when we got down stairs he struck me, and I struck him; a witness stood by, and hallooed out to him, "Do you think he has got a knife?" I had got a knife in my pocket, but I never used it or took it out at all. If it was not a couple of pins I had in the cuff of my jacket that did it, I do not know what else it was.</p>

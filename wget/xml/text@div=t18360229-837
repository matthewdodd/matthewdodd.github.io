                  </hi>. I keep a shop in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. On the 23th of February, Mr. Parker, the publican, sent for me, and told me something—I found my coat at the pawnbroker's—this is it—it had been at my shop—I do not know whether it was inside or outside—it was not sold—I had seen it the same morning, at half-past ten o'clock, on the counter—I missed it about eleven—we do hang such things outside.</p>

I saw a young man, who asked me to buy this coat for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him that—I went to Mr. Parker's, and had a pint of beer—I pulled off the ticket, and it was thrown in the fire—I put on the coat, and went home to my mother, and then pawned the coat for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Henry Parker, who keeps a wine vault, at No. 43, High-street, St. Giles's, next door but one to Mr. Lazarus. I remember the prisoner coming to our house at eleven or twelve o'clock that day—he said, "How do you do?"—I said, "Very well"—he had no coat then, and nothing in his hand—he went out, and came in again in a minute or two, and brought a coat and threw it on a cask—he then went to it again and pulled off the ticket, and threw it into the fire—it did not burn directly—I saw 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—the prisoner said, "Don't say any thing"—he then drank some beer, put the coat on, and went out with it on, and I sent one of the old men to tell Lazarus to come—he came to the door—I asked if he had lost anything—he said he would go back and see—I was going out that afternoon, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner, and gave him in charge—I have known him some time—this is the first thing I have known against him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the wine and spirit trade; I have carried on business under the name of Leman Hart, and Son, in Fenchurch-street, but have moved to Trinity-square, Tower-hill. We had business transactions with the prisoner for two years, up to 1848—on 25th Sept. 1848, he bought five pipes of Port wine of us, at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a pipe, without duty, in bond—it came to 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my clerk sent him the five warrants by post—each warrant repre<lb></lb>sents a pipe of wine, and passes it from person, to person—on 7th Dec. 1848, he said he had lost one of the warrants marked with a diamond, a "D" and "No. 8" (that warrant came back into my hands in 1850, but I have looked for it, and am not able to find it)—he asked me how he was to get the pipe of wine out of the docks; I told him that the Dock Company would pro<lb></lb>bably deliver it, having an indemnity from us holding them harmless—he said he was going home, and I requested him to have a good search for it—this indemnity and delivery order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were afterwards sent to him by my orders; I gave them to him, on his declaration that he had lost the warrant for the pipe, No. 8—I should not have done so if I had believed that the warrant was not lost—I afterwards received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it bears the signature which we generally have, and which we have always believed to be Michael Pellett's—I believe it to be his writing, but he and his daughter write so much alike—his daughter managed the business at that time—I received the letter on the following day to that on which it bears date—I heard nothing more of the wine till 1850, when I was called upon by Mr. Watkins to pay the amount, in consequence of my letter of indemnity to the Dock Company—I paid Mr. Watkins the money, and he gave me up the warrant supposed to be lost—I was not aware of this fraud till 1850, and then I was not able to find the prisoner, and I never heard of him till the other day, when we accidentally met him in Mark-lane; he ran away—it was in consequence of the representation he made that we gave him the letter of indemnity—we certainly should not have done so, but for the letter which has been produced—it was the Dock Com<lb></lb>pany</p>

               <p>that required that letter, not us—we parted with our delivery order and letter of indemnity on the representation that he had lost the warrant—the letter was sent to the Dock Company not to us—the letter of the 16th bad nothing to do with our delivering it—we did not send it to the prisoner, hut to the London Docks—it went to the prisoner first—I did not send it myself, my clerk, George Symons, did by my direction.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You just now said, that but for the letter you would not have parted with the indemnity; what letter was it that you meant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I misunderstood the question—the indemnity by us was given previously—we had received no letter on the subject of the indemnity before we parted with it; nor any application from either Mr. Pellett or his daughter—Mr. Pellett requested us to give this indemnity to the Docks—I have no partners—Leman Hart, my father, is dead; but the business is still carried on under the old name—I have no son in the busi<lb></lb>ness—"Leman Hart, and Son" is myself—I had had dealings with the prisoner since 1846, during which time he has paid us 13, 14, or 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in duties, and all together—there is a balance of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing by him to us, and some bills running—they were not his own bills; they were paid at maturity—there was a bill of his of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. winch he paid, and he paid a sum of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was not after I allege that he robbed us of these orders—the bills were due, and paid in 1849—we received 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his account after we charged him with robbing us, of this sum; in addition to which, bills for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which were covered by his name, were taken up.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that you would have trusted him to any amount, were you aware that he would sell the warrant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—wine warrants are made out to a particular person, and it is necessary that that person should endorse them, after which they can be transferred from hand to hand, unless they are endorsed specially—I should not have paid for this wine when I was called upon, on the indemnity, unless it had been endorsed properly—we also sold the prisoner other goods—he was not in advance to us at the time we sold him this port wine; it was ready money—at the time we parted with this wine we did not owe him any money—this letter of indemnity was written by Mr. Symons, by my order—the other acceptances that the prisoner gave were not paid, not a farthing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He called on you on 7th Sept? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I told him to go and make diligent search for the warrant—he brought me the other four—I received a communication afterwards, about the search, by letter, on 11th Dec—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was in consequence of that letter that I gave the letter of indemnity and the delivery order to the Dock Company—I have always believed this letter and the signature to be the prisoner's writing, but now I believe it to be in the writing of the daughter; that is, the one of 11th Dec., and the other in that of the father.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Leman Hart and Co.

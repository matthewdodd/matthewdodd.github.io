            . I am married, and live at Sheerness - in November, 1830, I was present at the marriage of the prisoner with Sarah Dunn - I witnessed the register - the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. You are sure it was the prisoner? A. Yes, I had never known him before then - he was married in the name of James Fraser.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. When did you last see Sarah Dunn? A. A little while back - I have seen her several times since 1831.</p>

            . Q. But you had not seen her before that? A. No - I cannot tell whether her name was Sarah Johnson or what it was - Sarah Dunn was the name she went by on that occasion, and I heard several persons speak of the marriage afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. But afterwards, when you heard the people talk of a marriage, did they talk of Fraser having married Sarah Dunn? A. Yes, and she was married by that name.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN BLISS. I lived in Lambeth in 1831, and carried on business there - on the 21st of December, 1831, I married the prisoner in the parish church of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, in the name of Ann Bliss - my name is Mary Ann Bliss - I gave my name so to Mr. Fraser, but on the day of our marriage he told me it was only a mistake made by the clerk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you never hear of this mistake before the day of the marriage? A. No, I did not - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100104"></xptr>never gave Fraser only one name - he told me in the church that it was a mistake of the clerk, he had put "Ann" and omitted to put "Mary," but that was of no consequence at all, and I did not think it was - he never told me of it before - I had been married before - I gave my right name to my first husband, it was

               <p>Q. And were you not quite aware that you should give your full name? A.

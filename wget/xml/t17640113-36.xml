             came and told me he had bought a tub of the prisoner, and he thought he bought it too cheap: I found it to be my tub, when I took the prisoner up, and charged him with stealing these tubs. He confessed that he had stole as many as came to about fifty shillings, from time to time: I do not know but he has taken as many as come to twenty pounds. I reposed a great deal of confidence in him.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me about two months ago; he was going into the country, and had two casks, and wanted to sell them; I gave three shillings and six-pence for them: they are now at Mr. Bevan's house.</p>
               <p>Bevan. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Denbigh. He came in distress, and borrowed a shilling of me; after that he told me he was carrying a tub to a turner's shop, which was bespoke, and if I would go and call for a pint of beer, he would come and pay me; he came, and said they would give him but three and six-pence for it; so I took it, and stop'd my shilling. This was last Monday night about seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Denbigh. I am a cooper, and live in Oxford-road near Grosvenor-Square. In a minute or two, I mistrusted it was not honestly come by; so I left the tub in the Tap-room, and went and enquired where the tub came from: I knew he worked with Mr. Bevan; then I went and let Mr. Bevan know of it.</p>

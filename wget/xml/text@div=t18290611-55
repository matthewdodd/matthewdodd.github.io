            . I am a bookseller. On the 29th of April, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked if I would buy the "Diary of an Invalid," which he had got in pawn for 6s.; I said I could not tell unless I saw the condition of it - he showed me no duplicate; he came back in about half an hour with the books, and I gave him 7s. 6d. for them - I had sent my boy to Southgate's sale, and when he came home, in consequence of what he said, I took the books down to Southgate, who claimed them - he came to my shop next day, and I took him to Southgate's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not say a person, whom I knew, had fallen into difficulties and had them in pledge? A. I recollect he did say they were in pawn for a friend of his, or that he had pawned them - I know he said they were in pawn.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I admit the former conviction.

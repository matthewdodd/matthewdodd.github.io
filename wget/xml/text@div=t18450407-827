                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On Thursday, the 6th of March, about a quarter to seven o'clock, I was on duty in Chiswell-street, and saw the prisoner looking in at Mr. Tarrant's window—there was another, six or seven feet from him, by the shutters of the next shop, which were shut—I saw the prisoner leave the window and go to the other—nothing passed be<lb></lb>tween them—the companion went to the same part of the window, and the prisoner remained—they changed places—the companion remained there two or three minutes, then returned to the prisoner, and they changed their caps, and the companion returned again, stood at the window a few minutes, and then returned to the prisoner—they both went to the cigar-shop, remained there a minute or two, and walked back a few yards—I then crossed the street, and secured them both—the prisoner said, "What do you want?"—I said, "You have been robbing the cigar-sbop," and in the struggle his companion got away—I took the prisoner into the cigar-shop, and told the shop-woman I thought she had been robbed—she went out, looked at the window, and said, "Yes, I have"—I found the window broken or cut, and a pound of cheroots gone—I told the prisoner I was policeman, and should take him to the station—I had a struggle with him a in the shop—I got him there at last—I found nothing on him—I after<lb></lb>wards found a knife in his pocket with what appears like putty on it—it is still visible—I searched outside the shop about a quarter of an hour after, and found three cheroots near where I struggled with them, six feet, from the shop, opposite the closed shop—I found a large hole in the prosecutor's window, which I could put my arm in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Jonathan James Tarrant, who is my stepfather, in Chiswell-street, St. Luke's. The policeman brought the prisoner into the shop—I had observed him five minutes before, looking in at the window, standing just in front of the window which was found broken—the policeman brought him in, and asked if I was aware we had been robbed—I opened the case inside the window, and found 1lb. of cheroots gone—I had seen them safe ten minutes previous—there had been 4lbs. there—I weighed them, and 1lb. was gone—the officer said, "Come out<lb></lb>side, and see what is lying on the pavement," and there were three cheroots—that was after I had been to the station—I found a large piece of glass out of the window (it was cracked before, but perfectly safe) a person could put his arm in, and reach the cheroots—they were right in front of the pane—the window forms part of the glass case they were in—when I returned from the station, I found three cheroots on the pave<lb></lb>ment at the next shop, which was closed—they were precisely the same size and quality as I lost.</p>

On Monday, the 9th of August, about half past two o'clock, the prisoner and another woman came into my shop, I had occasion to leave the shop, and while I was gone up stairs a child called me down; when I came down the prisoner and another woman was in the shop; she asked me the price of a pair of shoes, which hung in the window, and pointed to them; I reached them down to her. She said they were too small. I reached her another pair; she gave me the shoes again; she said she would call in the afternoon. Directly she was gone; I espied a pair of shoes on the table, I was sure they were not there when I went up stairs; I looked in the window; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150063"></xptr>saw there was a quantity gone; which proved to be three pair of men's, and one pair of women's were taken out of the window; I directly called to my husband, and went into the middle of the street; I saw the woman; my neighbour pursued them, and took the prisoner with the property on her.</p>

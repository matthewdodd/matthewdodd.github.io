               <p>Q. Did you lose any wine on the 20th of May last. - A. Mr. White had six bottles of wine of the prisoner, and he gave her linen for it, he thought it was for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live with you. - A. She did. On the 20th of July I charged her with taking six bottles of wine, she said it was not my wine, and she had disposed of it at the linen draper's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it part of the prisoner's business while living with you to sell wines. - A. No, she has carried out a bottle, but no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever look at your wines to see if there were any missing. - A. No, I did not count my wines to see if there were any missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to your wines. - A. Not to my knowledge, I kept the key.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITE. I am a linen draper. On the 20th of June the prisoner came and asked me if I would have any wine of her mistress, she would take it out in linen drapery. She had no wine with her when she came. I told her to tell her mistress I would. She afterwards brought four bottles of port and two of sherry, and took the linen drapery in return. The wine I drank, she said it was her mistress's wine.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That young woman came and said she had lost five shillings of her aunt's money, I went and asked the aunt to lend it me. That and several odd shillings I have given to her, and in return the first thing she made a present to me was a bottle of wine, and then others, till it amounted to half a dozen. I was not in the habit of drinking wine. I went to the linen draper's, I asked him if he wanted any wine, I never mentioned any name, I took three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180011"></xptr>that day and three the day after, and I had this petticoat for the money. On the day I was taken up I saw two gentlemen in the parlour, Mrs. Baron took no notice who they were.

             came to me and said the linen draper has come about the wine, I said you knew about it as well as me, you have been the instigation of it. She told me her aunt was going to fetch an officer, she wanted me to be locked up in the cellar, I would not. I went out in the street, and stood at the end of the New Inn steps until she came out to me, and then I went to the Seven Dials. I told Mrs. Green of it; and when I returned home she told me Mr White and Mr. Lamb the constable were searching my box, and begged me to say nothing about who I had got it off.</p>
               <p>Q (to Hannah Walker). Did the prisoner supply you with money. - A. Yes, five shillings for my teaching her to read.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any of this wine. - A. I never did.</p>

               <p>father's name is John, it is his business—he keeps about sixty-five horses—for several months my suspicions have been aroused about fodder—Hazele<lb></lb>den was my father's servant, and drove a van between Maidstone and London—he started to come to town on Friday morning, 16th January, and had to stop at Mailing, six miles short of Maidstone—he was due in London on Saturday, and back at Mailing on Sunday morning—I went into a bed room there, which looks into the yard, but took care not to make myself visible—I did not sec Hazleden's van drive into the yard, but I saw it in the yard—the horses were then in the stable—I saw Hazledcn get up on the van, and take a full four-bushel sack into the lock up—he was out of sight about three minutes, and then brought out the empty sack and put it into the van—I saw Howden, the, ostler, about five minutes afterwards, just inside the lock-up, and saw Hazleden put something into his trowsers pocket—he then got his horses out and started on the road to Maidstone—that was about 4 o'clock p.m.—I went to the police-station and came back with a constable—I was absent about twenty minutes—the prisoner went into the house to find the ostler, and I watched outside—the policeman afterwards told Howden to unlock his lock-up place, he did so, went in, and looked, and the prisoner said "You can match it if you can"—I then saw that the mixture there did not belong to my father—when I was at the window there was a horse and cart in the yard with the name of Frisby on the cart—there was a sack in the cart which the constable then took out, and asked Frisby where he got it—he would not tell him at first, but at last he said that he bought it off <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>—Joe was about two yards off, and head that—I found in the sack two sorts of oats, beans, meadow hay, a little oat straw, and some tares—this is not a very usual mixture—it is the mixture made up for my father's horses, and I told him it belonged to my father—he made no reply—Frisby said that he paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave Howden in custody—the constable went on the road and brought back Hazleden, and I gave him in charge too.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. Hazleden would start with three sacks of fodder, half of which was for the up journey, and half for the return—he was taken at Farningham, eighteen miles from Maidstone—there is a private stable of ours there where there, is fodder—he need not have had our fodder in his waggon at Farningham—I positively say that the mixture belonged to my father—I saw some mixture in a barn and took it up in my hand and examined it—I told the policeman it belonged to my father, but directly I took it in my hand I said that it did not—I was not able to find any tares in it—I was in Mr. Goodwin's room about half an hour—he could not see what I saw; he was ill, and was sitting in a chair close to the fireplace—I told him what I saw—I saw Hazleden throw his dinner basket on the waggon, and an empty sack after he came from the lock up—the mixture we gave to Hazleden was generally the same stuff—this (<hi rend="italic">a sample produced by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>) is my father's mixture, I am perfectly sure of that—it is the same kind as was taken from Frisby—this (<hi rend="italic">another sample</hi>) I cannot swear to; it is identical with some which was given to my father's horses, but not till last week—I know it by the beans—Hazleden would have to feed his horses at Eltliam in the stable view of the window where I was watching—this was on the return journey; he had to fee his horses at Spring Farm, after you get to Farningham—he has been off and on with us about fifteen years, and has also been in the employment of other respectable people in the neighbourhood, and always bore a good character.</p>

It was not because there were no tares, but because there was clover in it that I could not identify the mixture, and even if it had been formed of the same ingredients I could tell whether it was ours or not—the lock up is a small place for keeping a little corn—we do not pay once a year for the baiting, each man pays at the time—mixture which is left after being paid for is not the ostler's property—I have known Holder about fifteen years—the mixture really costs us 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a sack.</p>

I am a farmer, near Eltham—on 16th January, between 4 and 5 o'clock I went to Eltham with a horse and cart and drove into the yard of the King's Arms—I went into the house, and in coming out I saw Howden in the yard—I did not notice Mr. Larkins waggon there, I think it had gone—I asked Howden whether he had got any rough stuff—he said "Yes, I have got a sack, you can have it if you like, the price is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6d"—he went to his lock-up place, brought it out, and put it in my cart—it was in a plain sack, with no name on it, which I was to bring back—I had not brought my own sack—I donot usually buy fodder of ostlers at inns—rough stuff is sweepings of the manger—I cannot say whether this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) contains sweepings or not; it is a mixture.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon and general practitioner, in Abingdon-street, Westminster. I had known the deceased, John Bell-chambers,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184712130071"></xptr>
               <p>for about twenty-five years—I last saw him alive about a quarter to seven o'clock on Monday morning, 11th Oct.—I had been sent for—he lived at 44, Wilton-street, Westminster—I found him in bed in a state of insensibility—he had two black eyes, and a cut on the right side of the fore-head, just above the brow, a graze on the right cheek, and a small cut on the left cheek—I applied lotions to the wounds, and did what I considered necessary for him—I then left him—I returned again at eleven o'clock, and found him much in the same state, still perfectly insensible—I saw him again at four o'clock, and bled him at the arm first, and then ordered him to be cupped—he was attacked with convulsions, at intervals of about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, or sometimes longer—I continued to attend him until he died, which was on the following Sunday evening, the 17th, at about nine o'clock—I just got into the house as he died—I saw him after he was dead—I thought it right to call in to my assistance my son, who is surgeon of Westminster Hospital, as he was more acquainted with these cases than I am, I being a private practitioner, and, in conjunction with him, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased's person—in my judgment the cause of death was injury done to the brain, in consequence of a fracture of the skull—the fracture went through the frontal bone, and extended right across the upper part of the orbits—it was directly over the right eye-brow; not exactly in the front, but more towards the corner—it was a perpendicular cur, and then took a lateral direction over the plate of the upper organ—the fracture perfectly corresponded with the cut under the right temple—I attribute that injury to violence certainly—I should hardly think it possible, from the position of the cut, that it could have been caused by a fall—if the deceased had been struck on the head with such an instru<lb></lb>ment as this bolt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it might have produced such an injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the injuries you found on the person of the deceased such as could have been the result of one blow, or must there have been more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think there must have been at any rate one for the cut, and one for the blow on the eye—the other injuries about his person were not material—the fracture was downwards, and across the base of the skull, making almost two sides of a triangle, but they would not be equal in length.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You think there were two blows given? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, from the appearance of the left eye, that he must have been struck, because it was a very slight cut, as if he had received a blow with a fist—there certainly were not two blows with the same instru<lb></lb>ment—I knew him well—he was a stout man, about five feet six inches, I should think; not a big man—I do not know that he was bigger than I am, and a very little stouter—the wound was a clean cut, not as if done with a life-preserver, or any blunt round instrument—this bold is precisely such a one as would produce it—this is not a sharp instrument, but it would come down at once on the single edge—it must have been a blow struck downwards, as if you struck a blow with a ruler—it would not be the point of a circle that would come on the forehead—if I was to strike in this way I should make a straight cut down—it would certainly be a portion of a circle that would come in contact with the body—the wound was so high up on the forehead that he could not, in my opinion, have received that cut, and consequently a frac<lb></lb>ture by a fall—I think, in consequence of the cheek being grazed, he must have come with his head in that way—the grazing of the cheek itself would raise a presumption that it might be the result of a fall—sup<lb></lb>posing that he stumbled for a yard or two, and fell with his head upon a high</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184712130072"></xptr>
               <p>kerb-stone, I do not think that would account for it—I do not think it would be morally possible that a man's falling on his cheek, and grazing his cheek, would inflict a would above his eye—I know the spot perfectly well; it is a high kerb, but not very high; it is not six inches high—I went by it this morning—I did not measure it, but I should say, by my eye, that it certainly was not six inches—it is at the corner of Kensington-place where the deceased fell, and where the blood lay—I look particular notice of it as I came here—I do not think there is a gradual descent towards the kerb where he was found—there is no descent in the street of five or ten yards, before you come to the spot where he was found—I should think, from the spot which was pointed out to me, and where I saw the blood next day, that he must have fallen off the pavement on to the stones, instead of falling against the kerb—there is no descent in the street, I think it is quite flat—it is a very narrow street, with the kerb-stone flat—there is a grating not six inches form the kerb where he was found, for the purpose of carrying away the water—there is not a small channel running down there, nor any channel at all; it is all flush—the grating is close up to the kerb—the street is not very rough there—I took particular notice of it this morning—I should certainly say there are not stones projecting two or three inches over—it is as flat a paved street as any I know in London—there are no stones sticking up about there—I will swear that—there was no water when I came up this morning—I did not pass it yesterday, but I did the day before—I am in the habit of passing it every day of my life—the kerb is about six inches above the road paving.</p>

                  </hi> I am the son of the last witness, and one of the assistant-surgeons at Westminster Hospital—I assisted my father in his <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body of the deceased—I have been in Court, and have heard to what he has attributed the death—I concur in that opinion, that he died from the effect of concussion and irritation of the brain, produced by the fracture of the skull, as he has described—I should think that the injury over the right eye, to which the fracture was traceable, was occasioned by external violence, and not by a fall—this iron bolt would be likely to produce such an injury if used against his person—in my opinion the position of the wound was too high to be ordinarily received by a fall—there was no abrasion of the skin, merely as wound—if a fall had occasioned it, I should have expected to find abrasion of the skin besides—it appeared to be a cleaner wound than would have been the result of a fall, as if some smaller instru<lb></lb>ment had been applied, producing the injury, than falling flat on a surface.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not quite understand what you mean by saying that the edge of the kerb might produce a similar cut. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you can imagine one surface of this bolt to represent the edge of the kerb-stone, of course any person falling with that particular part of his forehead against the edge of the kerb would produce such a wound as was produced by this instrument, except that probably the edge of the kerb-stone might inflict a wound of rather a</p>

               <p>sharper kind than this instrument—this has no sharp edge—if it was described as an incised wound, I should imagine it would come nearer the character of a wound inflicted by the kerb-stone than by this bolt—if it was produced by the end of this instrument, I should imagine it would produce a wound of a more jagged character than that which was produced.</p>

                  </hi> I am carter to Mr. Weeks, as ginger-beer manufac<lb></lb>turer, and live at the King's Head public-house, Orchard-street, West<lb></lb>minister. Mr. Beese manages that house for his brother—I was there at two o'clock in the morning of Monday, 11th Oct—I knew the deceased, Mr. Bellchambers—he was there that morning—I was serving behind the bar, and saw him come in—Mr. Beese was behind the bar—when Mr. Bellcham<lb></lb>bers came in he went in front of the bar, and offered Mr. Beese a pinch of snuff from a silver snuff-box—there were other persons in the house at the time, two of the prisoners, M'Coy and Sale, were standing by the beer<lb></lb>engine in front of the bar, not far from Mr. Bellchambers—Mr. Beese invited Mr. Bellchambers to come behind the bar—he did so—he told him that he thought there was some bad company, some bad parties, in front of the bar, and advised him to come in behind out of the company—I should say that was said loud enough for Sale and M'Coy and the people in front of the bar to hear—Sale said to me, "Do you know that old gentleman that is going behind the bar?"—I said, "Yes"—Sale said he should like to have what the old gentleman had got in his hand—Sale and M'Coy were in company together—M'Coy did not say anything—the old gentleman bad the snuff-box in his hand, and a sort of yellow cash-bag, from which he paid for what he had—M'Coy said, "I will not do anything for the sake of hurting the house, as you know the old gentleman"—Sale was with him at the time he said that—M'Coy and Sale were drinking ale together, which some sailor was treating them to—about three-quarters of an hour after Mr. Bellechambers had come in, Doyle came in—Mr. Belchambers was then behind the bar—M'Coy and Sale were in front—there were several people with Doyle, but none of the prisoners except Sale and M'Coy—I noticed Davis come in about three o'clock, or half-past, dressed very decently with a plaid shawl on—he called for six penny<lb></lb>worth of brandy and water—that was about half an hour after Doyle had come in—Doyle spoke to Davis, but not to any of the others that I saw—I do not know whether he took any of Davis's brandy and water—Doyle and a woman were quarrelling together—Doyle struck her, and there was a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>, and Davis attempted to get behind the bar, which I and Mr. Beese refused, and said, "We do not allow strangers behind the bar"—Mr. Beese went to turn the woman out, and Davis forced himself behind me and went behind the bar to speak to Mr. Bellchambers—he did speak to him—Mr. Beese, on that, made a communication to me, in consequence of which I kept my eye on the parties—Davis said, "How do you do, Mr. Bellchambers?"—Mr. Bellchambers seemed to know him, and said, "I have lent this man a shil<lb></lb>ling, and I have lent him many a one, and I have lent him one now"—he asked Davis what he would take to drink—Davis said he would take a little drop of brandy and water—we had no brandy up, so we wee obliged to make sixpenny-worth of shrub and water—a few minutes after that Davis went from behind the bar, and went out with M'Coy, Sale, Doyle, and others—they all four returned in about five minutes—Davis went behind the bar again, and Sale and M'Coy stopped in front of the bar and called for a pot of sixpenny ale—Davis went and spoke to Mr. Bellchambers again—they seemed to know one another very well indeed—after Davis had been in there</p>

               <p>some short time, he invited Mr. Bellchambers home to take a cup of tea with him—Mr. Bellchambers asked him in what direction he was going—he said towards Charing-cross—Mr. Bellchambers said he was going in a contrary direction, and declined—I saw him hand the shilling to Davis—he took it from his cash-bag—Davis saw the cash-bag—it was after Davis had asked him home to tea that he handed him the shilling—M'Coy, Sale, and Doyle were then in front of the bar—they might have seen the cash-bag when Mr. Bellchambers was in front of the bar, but I cannot say whether they saw it afterwards—Mr. Bellchambers had a watch with him, which he was wearing in his pocket, with the seals hanging outside—he called for some ginger-beer, one glass for himself and one for Davis—they were the only two behind the bar, except me and Mr. Beese—Mr. Bellchambers and Davis were talking to one another; I could not hear what—after the shilling had passed, Davis was counting some money in his hand—I do not know whether it was five shil<lb></lb>lings or six shillings, and he dropped a half-crown underneath the settle where he was sitting—he took that money out of his trowsers pocket—I did not hear from him why he wanted to borrow a shilling, he having money of his own—I did not speak to him about it—about a quarter-past four o'clock Mr. Beese ordered all the prisoners, except Davis and Mr. Bellchambers, out of the house—he turned out all the party at the bar, and about half-past four Davis went out.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 51, Wilton-street, Westminster, and am a car<lb></lb>penter—I knew the late Mr. Bellchambers, he lived at No. 44—I was at home on Monday morning, 11th Oct., after two o'clock—the house is in Wilton-street, and the workshop faces Kensington-place—the entrance of it is in Kensington-place—about half-past five, on that morning, I was in my loft, over the workshop, and heard some one in Kensington-place say, "Knock the b— —down"—I heard a fall against the shutters, and then down on to the pavement, as if the fall was first intercepted by the shutter, and then on the pavement—that was followed by a groan, and I heard some person run away—the groaning continued—a short time after I heard another person run—I heard a sort of sigual up the street, a sort of call, I cannot exactly describe it—it was some noise made by the mouth—I only heard two foot<lb></lb>steps—the first was a heavy step, and the second a light one—I heard the fall instantly the words, "Knock the b— —down" were made use of—I should say the whole of this, up to the time the last person ran away, occu<lb></lb>pied about a minute or a little more—I did not go out into the street—I could not get out by the workshop door.</p>

I was on duty on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, 11th Oct., in Orchard-street—I know Dacre-street and New Tothill-street—about four o'clock I was standing at the corner of New Tothill-street and Dacre-street, and my attention was called to the King's Head, by a noise of hallooing and shouting—I went towards it, and saw Mr. Beese turning fourteen or sixteen people out—I was about twenty-four yards off—I could distinguish the people he was turning out—Sale, M'Coy, and Doyle, were three of them—the place became quiet after a short interval, and I went on my duty at a few minutes before five, or just on five—I went to the corner of Cooper-street and Orchard-street, which is about twenty-one yards from the corner of New Pye-street—it was light enough to distinguish persons at that time—there was a lamp right over the prisoners heads—I saw Sale, M'Coy, and Doyle, and a man, named Conolly, standing talking together at the corner of New Pye-street and Orchard-street—I knew them before, and had seen Sale and M'Coy together between twelve and one that night—Sale lived at 15, Union-court, which turns down close by the side of the King's Head—when I saw them at five, I believe they saw me—Conolly left them, and went up New Tothill-street; and the three others came up Orchard-street, towards Strutton-ground—when I saw them move I went on my duty—only part of Orchard-street is on my beat—when I left the corner of Cooper-street I went to the corner of Dacre-street, stood there a moment, and saw one person come out of the King's Head, and only one person—it was about five minutes after that that I noticed the three prisoners standing together where I have described—Mr. Beese let that person out—he seemed to walk very steadily the distance I saw him—I could not see him above seven yards from where I stood—he was going towards Strutton-ground—that would be in a direction towards Wilton-street—I then went round to the corner of Cooper-street, and saw a person who I thought was the same I had seen come out of the King's Head, go up Orchard-street—he was still in the way towards Wilton-street and Strutton-ground—I saw the three pri<lb></lb>soners not above a minute after that at the corner of New Pye-street—the gentleman had then just got to the corner of Duck-lane, towards Strutton-ground—the three prisoners were then about opposite me—as I stood at the Cooper's Arms they left the corner, and came right past me, and were going towards Strutton-ground, the same way that the gentleman went—that was all I saw of either of them—I left at the corner of Strutton-ground—the pri<lb></lb>soners were then going on after the gentleman—on the following Wednesday</p>

                  </hi> I am one of the warders of the House of Deten<lb></lb>tion, at Clerkenwell—I was acting in that situation on 19th Nov.—M'Coy was in my charge—I observed that he was gloomy and declined to take exercise—I asked him whether he wished to go to exercise—he said he did not—he asked me for some paper, and said he should like to see the governor, as he wished to say something—I went with the governor to his cell, and took pen, ink, and paper—the governor asked him what he wished to state—he said he had something to say—the governor told him to put it to paper, and if he wished it to be sent, it should be forwarded immediately—I left him with pen, ink and paper—about an hour afterwards I went back, and he handed me this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was folded in this form—he put the pen and ink into one of my hands and this paper into the other, and said he felt his mind greatly relieved, or words to that effect—he afterwards said, (but I believe I am rather incorrect,) "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Doyle is innocent; it is a pity the innocent should suffer for the guilty"—he said it was a pity the guilty should remain so long in prison—he did not say anything about a watch—this is my signature to this deposition—I cannot recollect whether it was read over to me before I signed it—I have not been sitting in a public-house while the other witnesses have been examined—my deposition was not read over to me in the Court—I cannot exactly recollect what it was—yes, it was read over to me before I signed it—I cannot recollect that M'Coy said anything more than I have stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Coy.</hi> I asked for the letter to be forwarded to the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">Wit<lb></lb>ness.</hi> I believe I have stated that before—the Governor said what you wished to say should be committed to paper and forwarded to the Magistrate—he said it should be forwarded—he is not here—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>—"House of De<lb></lb>tention, Nov. 19, 1847. Sir,—I write these few lines to you, which I think myself justified by turning Queen's evidence in the case of Mr. Bellchambers, so that the guilty persons should be brought to justice, and the innocent have their liberty. About half-past five, on Monday morning, 11th Oct., Mr. Bell<lb></lb>chambers came out of the King's Head, in Orchard-street, and went up Orchard-street towards Strutton-ground. Me Bellchambers down Strutton-ground, down the Horseferry-road, down Regent-street as far as Kensington-place. When he had turned the corner at the bottom of Kensington-place, I asked him what o'clock it was; he answered twenty minutes to six; when I stole the watch from him and ran up Kensington-place. He hollowed after me, 'Stop the b----.' The two persons that were with me were behind me when I stole the watch. I had not run more than twelve yards when I heard a blow and then a fall, one after the other. I ran home to Sale's place, at Union-court, with the watch. I was there about five or six minutes when Sale and Lloyd came in. Sale said he had hit him on the forehead with a bolt, and knocked him down. Lloyd said he had brought his hat with him, which he had on his head when he came to Sale's place. Thomas Sale, John Lloyd, and myself. Lloyd is well known to the police; he is a short lad; he wears the hat of Mr. Bellchambers, a blue jacket, with anchors on the buttons, cor<lb></lb>duroy trowsers, and low shoes. He is somewhere over the water by the New Cut. Thomas Doyle is innocent. Your unfortunate prisoner, George M'Coy. Sir, will you please, when I come up to the office on next Thurs<lb></lb>day, to keep me from Thomas Sale."</p>

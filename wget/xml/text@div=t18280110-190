            . I am a watchman. About eleven o'clock at night on the 18th of December the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge, at the corner of Union-street, High-street, Shadwell; he said she had robbed him of three half-crowns and half a sovereign; she said she knew nothing about it - she afterwards said, "I have three half-crowns of the man's property, and that you know, Marshall;" he said "Yes, and you have my half-sovereign as well;" they were both in liquor; a man named Harris, who is not here, said he saw her take it - she said she did not; the half-sovereign and three half-crowns were found on her by the officer; the prosecutor is gone to sea, I believe, and Harris cannot be found.</p>

            . I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; I was going to search her; she said she would take out what she had, but she had nothing but what belonged to herself; she pulled out some silver and halfpence, but I said that would not do; she then pulled out a bit of paper, and the half-sovereign in it - she said she had it of Marshall, and meant to give it him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking with the man at the public-house, and he called for a glass of gin and water; he had no change - he took out the half-sovereign; I took it to give change; I had 18s. 3 1/2d. in my pocket.</p>

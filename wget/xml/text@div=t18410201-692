               <p>street, Camden Town. The younger prisoner was in my service for seven weeks—the other prisoner is her mother, and used to come and visit her—Ilived in Baham-street when she first came to me, and I moved from there to Grove-street while she was there—I discharged her at my present resi<lb></lb>dence—Ihave known her mother many years, and she brought her to me—hermother stole two sovereigns from me—she assisted her daughter to pack up when I moved—on Sunday morning, the 3rd of January, I said to the daughter, "You will find some money under my pocket handkerchief"—she said, "There is neither money nor a pocket handkerchief"—I said, "Are you certain there is no pocket handkerchief"—she said, "Ma'am, you never brought it home last night"—I said I was certain it was in my cloak pocket last night—she said, "Indeed, Ma'am, you never brought it home"—I went to my trinket-box and missed a silver scent-box—I imme<lb></lb>diately applied to the constable, and said, "Here are circumstances which must place beyond a doubt that what I have lost must be lost through Mary"—I went to her lodgings and found her there—I said, "Mary, what have you done to my silver scent-box"—she said, "What do you mean, ma'am?"—I said it was at the top of my trinket-box—she said, "I have neither seen your trinket-box nor your silver scent-box"—I said, "You had my keys and the care of all my money, how could you avoid seeing the box?"—she said, "I know nothing about it"—I turned to the officer and said, "Take her before a Magistrate"—a woman in the room said, "Pray don't take her, ma'am, she is related to you"—I afterwards missed the other articles stated, part of which were found at the pawnbroker's—sheaccused the mother, or she would not have been taken.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184102010079"></xptr>
               <p>kindness"—she never reproached me for the example I set her daughter, and say she would inform my husband of it—I understand you—I am of your country, and we are both too passionate, perhaps, you want to frighten me—I sometimes swear a little—I am not at all tenacious—I did not swear when the mother called on me; how could I, when she almost went down on her knees, and said, "I never received so much kindness from any body?"—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent for her when she was in distress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you use an oath, and say you would stab her, or take some other means of <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> for her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, Sir, I am on my oath, such an occurrence never took place—such an expression never passed, not even a tendency to it, never indeed—I did not go to her lodging in Gee's court, Oxford-street, two days after the daughter left ray service—it was the third day—there were two women in the room—I charged her with taking my property—shepositively denied it—Weaver was with me—he did not search the lodging on that occasion, not till the tickets were produced—Mary said, "Positively, I know nothing of your box"—the woman entreated me not to take her—I said, "Constable, do your duty"—the woman said, "Pray, be still a minute, I will produce the ticket of the box," and, going to a shelf or cupboard, she brought down some tickets—I said, "Give me the tickets"—she said, "No, let me get the right ticket"—presently she pro<lb></lb>duced the ticket of a table-cloth—the constable immediately said, "Give the tickets into my hand, or you will render yourself a party to it"—she gave the two tickets to him—I had not missed the gold locket—the table-cloth I knew was out of my linen chest—the prisoner said, "It is not my doing, it is my mother has done it"—she ran across the room, and got hold of a box—the constable said, "Mary, what have you there?"—she said, "No<lb></lb>thing belonging to you"—I said, "It is something belonging to me"—the constable <hi rend="italic">capsized</hi> the box, it was turned out, and, among the rest, was a duplicate of a sheet and shift—he did not make any search, but only <hi rend="italic">cap<lb></lb>sized</hi> her box—I gave Mary leave to go after a place on the 2nd of January, on which day the sheet was pawned—she was not taken into custody on the 3rd, on the 8th I went to apply to the Magistrate for a search<lb></lb>warrant—hesaid, "Take her into custody"—I said to Weaver, "How do they take people into custody, what will become of her if she is taken?"—he said, "Lock her up"—I said, "Is there a fire and bed for her?"—he said, "There is neither one nor the other"—I said, "Then let it be till to<lb></lb>morrow"—onthe 9th she said it was not her, but her mother, and the woman in the room said, "I declare it is not Mary; she is honest, but her mother is a thief"—about ten days elapsed from the time I found the prisoner till I took her into custody—I took the mother in her master's shop, in Green-street, Leicester-square, and he said he would not keep her longer, for she was tipsy that night—I get tipsy sometimes, I take a little sometimes, but not to disguise myself—Iam sure my Lord will not allow such impertinent questions; it is illegal, I think, to answer them—I could have had counsel if I wanted them, but I wanted to keep back as much of the accusation against them as I could—that I swear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why did you bring out what was not in the indictment, that the woman stole two sovereigns from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I did at a moment—Ihave not sworn to that, but decidedly she did doit—there is not a syl<lb></lb>lable of doubt that she has done it—the younger prisoner said before the Magistrate that she had received these things as presents from me—I never</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184102010080"></xptr>
               <p>gave her any thing but a pair of boots—I never get tipsy—if I was to tell you I did not take any thing, I should be perfectly wrong—I never gave any of the articles to either of the prisoners; is it likely I should go to my trinket-box and give her my property? I—I never heard of her going to be married while in my service—she brought in a silk handkerchief one day; her mother was in the kitchen; I said, "Mary, how came you by this fine silk handkerchief?"—the mother laughed and said, "I suppose Simon, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> or somebody gave it her to hem"—I said, "Who is that?"—she said, "A sweetheart, I suppose"—I never made her any present—I do not know that she ever slept on the sofa while in my service—she slept with me mostly every night, I believe regularly; but in Sahara-street I did not wish to place so much confidence in her—I wished to be a greater stranger to her—she might have slept on the sofa in Baham-street—she did—I think she lived with me in Baham-street five weeks, and a fortnight in Grove-street—Weaver never brought two blankets for her to lay on in Baham-street—he brought one, and he was to sell that to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bevis, and live in Somerset-place, Deptford. On Saturday night, the 20th of April, before I went to bed, I went over the house—the door was latched with a common latch, but I am sure it was fastened; also the windows, with two latches and a bolt—I went to bed about twelve o'clock—I was the last person up—when I had been in bed some time I was awoke by a noise—I could not tell the time—I laid awake some time, and fell asleep again—about three o'clock in the morning the policeman came—I got up, and found the place very much in disorder—the lower rooms were all dirty and filthy—I missed the articles stated—the two books and a shawl had been on the dining-table, and the jug and teapot on another table in the same room.</p>

On the 3d of July I was at the Swan, and left about half-past ten o'clock in the evening, with Field and Sullivan; when we got opposite Hickman's-gate Sullivan left me - I was two or three yards from Field when he left - the prisoners were in the middle of the road with a quantity more - it was not dark; I had seen Fitzgerald that day, but never before; I was struck and knocked down, and when I got up I saw Field on the ground and a man kicking him: I cannot say who it was - there was more than a dozen in the gang - Ledger came afterwards to my assistance.</p>

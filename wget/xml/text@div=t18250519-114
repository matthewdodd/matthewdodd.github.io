When they returned Newell said, "Master, a very bad case has happened;" he desired Brown to tell me what it was, but he did not, and after some time Newell undertook to tell me, saying that six sacks of coke had been taken from the four chaldron. I took him to the office, and he stated the same to Mr. Staples, the chief clerk of the coke office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he tell you this as soon as he returned? A. Yes. I have a good opinion of him, and should be happy to take him into my service again.</p>

             sworn. - I am a milliner; I live with Mrs. Franks, in St. James's street. About six weeks ago, we received some lace from Miss Joachim; we were to make her a cloak, and to put that lace upon it, which we did. A man said he came from Mr. Goldsmid for the cloak, and I delivered it to him. The prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure he is the man? - A. I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM GOLDSMID, Esq. sworn. - On the 23d of February, or thereabouts, I was going down to the Treasury; my niece, Miss Joachim, desired me to call at Mrs. Franks's, and desire them to send her cloak home. Mr. Rose kept me some time at the Treasury, where the prisoner was generally waiting. I had left my carriage, and desired the coachman to call at Mrs. Franks's, for the cloak; and I went down on foot to the Treasury. When I came out, the carriage was at the door, and as the coachman was opening the door, he told me that it was not quite ready, but if I would go back there, I might have it; I said, I had no time. The prisoner at the bar overheard me, and asked me if he should go and fetch it for me; I told him, yes, and gave him a shilling: I told him, if he brought it home safe immediately, he should have another sixpence or a shilling. He was to bring it to No. 18, Alie-street, where my niece lives with me; I found it did not come, and in the evening I went to Bow-street; and on the Monday following it was found at the pawnbroker's.</p>

             sworn. - I take in washing; On the 23d of February, the prisoner brought a cloak to me, and said his wife desired me to pawn it for her, and I went and pawned it at Mr. Rochfort's, in Jermyn-street; it was a black silk cloak, trimmed with lace; (produces the duplicate); I pawned it in the name of Mrs. Roach, in Bond-street, for I had carried property of Mrs. Roach's there; she keeps a dress-shop.</p>
               <p>JOHN DOBREE sworn. - I am servant to Mrs. Rochfort, pawnbroker, in Jermyn-street, (produces the cloak); I took this in of Mrs. Flora, on the 23d February; I think it was on a Friday, in the morning; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Flora. That is the cloak that I had from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Miss Reddish. This is the cloak that I delivered to the prisoner; I know it by the lace.</p>

               <p>Miss Joachim. I know this lace to be the same that I sent to Mrs. Franks's, to be put upon the cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As soon as I had got the cloak from that young lady, it begun to pour with rain, and I stood up; and as I had the direction only by word, and not by card, I forgot it, and did not know where to carry it; I called upon Mrs. Flora, and what happened in her apartment I cannot particularly say, but she pinned the cloak up for me. It is the first offence, and I throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

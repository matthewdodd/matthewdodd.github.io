                  </hi>. I am a baker; I carry on my business at Montpelier Vale, Blackheath. The prisoner was in my service, to carry out bread, and to receive money—he used to take out bread in the morning, and deliver it to the customers, and he was to account in the afternoon or evening, when he booked his bread—I never allowed him to go over one day—he paid me or my wife every evening—he had been in my employ about a year—I discharged him on 19th Dec., and gave him into custody about ten days afterwards—on discharging him, on the 19th, I said, "I shall not want you any more"—he did not account to me for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received on 16th Dec., or for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received on 18th Dec.—he did not account for, or pay me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 19th Dec.—on the 19th, I said to him, "You have been taking money of Spinks, and Cook, and Evans, and it is not the first time; you had a caution last week; I shall not require you any more; if you like to look up in the week, I will speak to you again; I shall have nothing more to say to you to-night"—he said he was very sorry, and he would not do it again; if I would forgive him, he would pay me the money—I did not give him into custody till the next week but one—I was not present when the policeman Brown took him—I used to pay him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and his bread and flour.</p>

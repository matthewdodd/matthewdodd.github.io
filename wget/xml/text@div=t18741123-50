               <p>9th October, about 9 o'clock at night, the prisoner came and said he had come to take the apartments for his master's son, who was a merchant in Cannon Street—I showed him the room, and after that he stood talking to me in the parlour—he had a coat on his left arm—he stood very near me and I went round the table because I was suspicious of him, and I opened the parlour door because I was afraid of him—he followed me round the table and asked me for my address—he dropped something on the floor and I said "What have you dropped, a pencil?"—he said "Yes"—he followed me round the table again and stood laughing in my face—I never thought of my pocket—he wanted to go and see the garden—I did not see him do anything, but he stood very close to me with the coat over his left arm—he said that he thought the apartments would do very nicely and I was to be sure and ask a good price; his master was anxious to get his son there as he had a daughter residing at a surgeon's in the neighbourhood—he went away and I let him out—about half an hour afterwards I missed my purse from my dress pocket—it was there five minutes before the prisoner came—it contained 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a foreign piece, a card, and a stiletto—I have not seen any of those things since—I gave information at the police-station directly—I afterwards saw the prisoner at Greenwich on the 15th or 16th.</p>

I am the grand-daughter of the last witness—I remember a man coming on 9th October—I saw him come and I saw him while he was there—the prisoner is the man—I have no doubt of it—I went out to pay some accounts for my grand-mother about two hours before the man came—she gave me some money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I was coming across the passage when the man came from the kitchen to the parlour—I brought the lamp into the parlour and went out again—I was standing at the kitchen door when the man went away—my grand-mother told me that she had lost her purse and we looked about everywhere and could not find it, and we came to the conclusion that the man must have taken it—my grand-mother suggested that.</p>

She said "I don't know, I don't wish to say," and then she was pressed by the police and her husband to look again, and then she said "The second man in the row," and I was the third man I am quite sure you will not convict an innocent person.

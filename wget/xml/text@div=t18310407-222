            . I am a Policeman. On the 24th of February, at near eight o'clock at night, I heard the call of Police, and took Batcheler and Stanford - Burk secured two more; the whole five were together - I charged them with stealing the cap, having seen Mrs. McMahon; I saw one of them throw what appeared to me to be a cap into the road, but I could not secure it - I took Batcheler, Stanford, and Kelly to the station-house; I afterwards went and took he other two from Batcheler's information, as he said, as we went along, "If you won't hurt me I will tell you who stole the cap, and where it is;" I took the others to the station, and went back with him - he showed me where they had thrown the cap, and I found on Griffiths a knife, which the cap had been cut with; the cap had been cut, for the peak, which has been found, has part of the leather fastened to it - I only found the peak where Batcheler took me; it was thrown down an area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you take on yourself to say that Griffiths cut the cap? A. No, but he is the only one who had the knife - when I took Batcheler he had Kelly's old cap on; I found his own cap next morning in a field- Batcheler did not say he had taken the cap himself.</p>
               <p>MRS. McMAHON. I swear this is the peak of my boy's cap; it is leather - I know it, because I beat him severely for breaking it at school; this is broken in two places, the same as his was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That accident might happen to any other cap? A. I know this is the peak - my husband made it himself, and there are a great many more holes in it than necessary, as he did not understand the mode of putting it on.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BATCHELER. I am nearly fourteen years old. I was in company with the prisoners on the 24th of February, and saw Mrs. McMahon's son outside the door Griffiths said to him, "I have lost a halfpenny down here, and if you like to find it you may keep it for yourself;" he stooped to look for it, and Griffiths snatched off his cap and put his own on the boy's head - he then took his own off his head again, and ran away; the boy's cap looked like a new one - the other three prisoners were with him at the time; he gave his cap to Kelly, who said, "I am d - d if I don't wear this cap;" I said, "Kelly, mine is a poor old cap, you may as well give me yours;" I saw all this done.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say? A. They were going up higher to steal a till - they had a leg of mutton, and a batter pudding the night before; I told him to give the cap back to the boy, but he would not - I was taken in a quarter of an hour, and told of this directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go and tell Mrs. McMahon? A. They all ran away, and I with them - Griffiths cut the peak off the cap with an iron handled knife, he chucked it down an area, and then put it on Kelly's head; I have known the prisoners about three months, but did not keep company with them - I live with my parents; my father sells watercresses, and I go about with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went about every day with water-cresses? A. Except being in the House of Correction for a month with Stanford, when they took him, and me for being with him - he has been there sixteen times; I was never there but once - I did not keep up an acquaintance with him: I was going out to call my brother to tea this day, and I met him - we had not been out of prison two hours then - they made me go with them, for Griffiths snatched off my cap to make me come, and said he was going to get a batter pudding; it was not my cap that was put on the boy's head - I meant to tell the first officer I met of it; I was always brought up honest - Griffiths only threw the peak into the area; he threw the cap into an old iron-shop - I took the officer to the shop in half an hour, but he could not find it; I got my cap back in the morning.</p>
               <p>Stanford's Defence. I deny all Batcheler has said - he did not go to find the cap till the morning.</p>
               <p>Kelly's Defence. He said he would go and nick the cap, and we ran on; when he went home he asked Griffiths to lend him his knife, and he cut the peak off - he knocked my cap off, then picked it up, and said my cap was on his head.</p>
               <p>Gander's Defence. Batcheler said, "Here is a half-penny for you," and when the boy stopped, he knocked off his hat, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Griffiths, Gander, and Kelly received a good character.</p>

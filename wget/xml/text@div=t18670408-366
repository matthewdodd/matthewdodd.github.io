Bishop, General Post Office, till called for, is missing; do you know anything about it?"—he replied, "I do not"—I said, "It was seen in your hands this morning"—he said, "Yes"—Crocker the constable was present, and he produced a sovereign and a penny, which he said he had found on the prisoner—I did not see him searched—I said to the prisoner, "Where did you get this money from?"—he said, "The sovereign I received from Mr. Robinson for my wages last Saturday"—this was Tuesday—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the one I enclosed in the letter to Mr. Bishop—I showed it to the prisoner, and said, "This sovereign was enclosed in the letter addressed to Mr. Bishop, General Post Office; in fact, in the letter that I have been asking you about; it was in the letter this morning"—he replied, "I cannot tell you any more than I have told you."</p>

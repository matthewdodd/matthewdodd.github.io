On the 28th of March, at nine o'clock in the morning, I sent him to receive 20l., which was to come by the Tottenham coach to the Swan inn, Snow-hill; he returned about twelve o'clock, and said it would come up by the two o'clock coach, and that he had met his brother from Cambridge, which had detained him; our house is about half an hours' walk from the inn. I sent him again about a quarter to two o'clock, and told him if it was a cheque to get it cashed; he returned a few minutes before four, and said that a pretty job had happened - he said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100058"></xptr>have lost the money;" I asked how he received it - he said he received a 5l. and 14l. cheque, and a sovereign; I said, "Where did you put it?" he said he put into in his side coat pocket, and showed me his pocket, which was very deep, and had no holes in it; I said he had not lost it out of that pocket - he said he was certain he had put it there when he received it at the banker's; he said, "I received five sovereigns for the 5l. cheque, and received the 14l. cheque at Lombard-street; I there asked for a bit of paper to put it into, and they gave me a piece; I was detained nearly an hour, and finding I was detained so long, I jumped behind a coach, and the twenty sovereigns must have jumped out of my pocket;" I said they never jumped out of that pocket, it was too deep - he said, "I am certain this is the pocket - I saw it quite safe in the pocket when I left the banker's;" I said, "I cannot believe it - you have not lost it - tell me in what hands you have put it;" he said, "I have lost it, Ma'am." I said, "I must send for an officer, if you won't tell me where you have put it:" he said, "Then you must send for one, and I shall lose my place; and to put an end to it I will go before a Magistrate, and state the same."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever lose anything? A. Yes, several things; he could have run away if he had chosen.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in great distress about losing it, was not he? A. Indeed he was not; I was sorry to see him so hardened - I was astonished to see him so cool and careless; he said I was a liar, he had lost it. I have inquired, and find he has been keeping had company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to forego this prosecution if his friends would give you 10l.? A. No, they said, "Will you take 10l.? you will never get your money back;" I said I should be glad to see 10l., for it was a great loss to me; I did not wish it from them - I said, "Give me 10l. of my own money" - I asked if it fell as he put it in - he said then he should have dropped it at the banker's. I said I should ask the Magistrate if I should do right in taking the 10l.; I did not have his brother taken up - I went to the brother, and said I had lost twenty sovereigns - he said"I am very sorry - I was in hopes he had got rid of all his had acquaintances; but I will go and see if I can get it out of him." The brother was not taken up.</p>

On the 28th of March, about five minutes past two o'clock, the prisoner came to the Swan, and asked if I had not got 20l. for him - I gave him a 5l. cheque on Messrs. Fry and Co., and a 14l. one on Sir William Curtis', with a sovereign - he said he did not know where the banker's were; he got on my coach, and I put him down at St. Mildred's-court, and saw him go up the court to change the cheque.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mitchell paid me the money, and asked if I would have anything to drink; we went to a house, and staid there about half an hour; I went and received the cheques, and at Sir William Curtis' asked for a bit of paper to wrap it in; I put it into my coat pocket, and as I went home, as I had been a long time, I got behind a coach, and at Stones-end I missed the money; I went back all the way, to see if I could find it, but could not - I went and told mistress; they threatened to give me in charge, and brought a man who was not an officer, to frighten me; they kept calling me thief, and I said I would go before the Magistrate; mistress then said if I would give her 10l. she would take it - my brother came; she asked him to give her 10l. - he would not, and she gave me in charge.</p>

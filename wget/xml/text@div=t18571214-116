                  </hi>. I live in Spicer Street, Mile End New Town, and sell newspapers. On 22nd Nov.

(she had been searched, and no money found on her) and she said that she had spent it—I said that was impossible, for there was nothing but a dead wall between her and the man, and I had not lost sight of her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ryan's Defence.</hi> On the night of 22nd Nov. I went to Stepney for a half sovereign which was owing to me; I got there about half past 6 o'clock; I remained there till half past 8 o'clock; and it being Sunday evening, and the shops being shut, I asked the man's wife to give me two candles, a box of matches, and a bit of tobacco; I laid down the half sovereign on the table; she took it off, and gave the change; as I came home this female spoke to me, and asked me to go with her; I refused, and said I was a married man; and, on purpose to get rid of her, I went to the public house, and gave her a drop of beer, and the officer and the witness came in and took her and me at the same time; if I had wished to pass bad money, should I not have put down the bad half crown for the beer? but I did not; Mrs. Williams is the person I received the half crown from that was found on me.</p>

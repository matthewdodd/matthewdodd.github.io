On the 13th of June he brought me some brass from Mr. Alexander's foundery; it was charged to me at 14 lb. 4 oz. we weighed it, and it weighed 13 lb. 2 oz. so it wanted 18 oz. of what it was charged to me. I went and searched the prisoner's room, there I found one of the pieces cast from my pattern, which weighed just 18 oz. I can swear it to be my property; he himself delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Q. How can you say, that that brass was yours?</p>
               <p>Navine. (He produced a book.) This book is carried to the founder; and when he sends a parcel of cast brass, he enters it in this book. Here I am charged with 14 lb. 4 oz. out of which the prisoner took a piece of 18 oz. and delivered me but 13 lb. 2 oz. What is set down in this book, I must pay to the founder, it being set down when it is weighed there.</p>

I told the prisoner he had better come and set on my side of the room - he came and sat by my side; we drank together, with two other men. I asked the servant to change me a 1 l. note, he returned it to me, saying that he could not. I wrapped it up in a piece of paper, and put it in my pocket I fell asleep - when I awoke, my breeches-pocket was turned out, and the company and my note were gone, as also my pocket-book, containing my discharge and some duplicates. Next morning I went to Knightsbridge, and found my shirt had been redeemed by producing the duplicate, and that the prisoner had offered a man 3 s. to redeem another shirt of mine - I stopped two of the articles. I traced my note to the Grapes, at Brompton. I found my shirt, which had been redeemed, at the barracks.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Queen's Head. The prosecutor was there, and the prisoner sat by his side. On the following morning, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came, and asked me to get a shirt out of pledge for him. He gave me the duplicate of a coat, I returned it - he then gave me one of the shirt. I said I never took things out of pledge for soldiers; he went away. In about a quarter of an hour I saw him with the shirt in his hand.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 14th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was at the corner of the street, and saw the prosecutor and his apprentice on the top of the house; I then saw the prisoner on the ladder for about two minutes - he came down and took up a board from the foot of the ladder, put it under his coat and ran away; in about ten minutes Franks came to me and asked if I had seen any one take the board; I said Yes, and he ran towards Bethnal-green-road.</p>

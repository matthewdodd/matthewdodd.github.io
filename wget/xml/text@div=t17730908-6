I went and sat in a box behind them.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from them?</p>
               <p>Boyle. Close behind the box they were in, not half a yard from them; she had a knife in her hand picking a bone; in the space of two or three minutes, she went up to her husband; I thought she was going to give him a lick with her hand; instead of which she struck the knife into his throat; the blood immediately spouted out as if a butcher had killed a pig.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe she did it with a design?</p>
               <p>Boyle. Yes; or else she would not have killed him: then she dropt the knife and the bone she had in her hand under the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of her then, did she remain in the house?</p>
               <p>Boyle. I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear as if she did it on purpose?</p>
               <p>Darling. She had said she would spill his blood, and be hanged for him an hour or more before she did it: he did not live five minutes; I never heard him speak, sigh, or groan; there was a great deal of blood, but the person that supported him pinched his wound up, and stopt the bleeding.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer's labourer; I was backwards and forwards in the house; we were tileing the back part of the house; the prisoner and her husband sat in the next box to the bar; there is but a little passage between the bar and the box where they sat; his back was towards me, and she sat opposite to him; she had a bone of mutton; I never heard what they said; I heard them jawing together; she was jawing him; I turned back upon my heel, and saw the knife drop under the table, and the blood spurted over the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the box?</p>
               <p>Duncan. There was only herself and her husband; I did not see her strike him; she came out of the box and said murder, murder, he is killed; she ran out of the door; he turned out of the box, and put his hand up to the wound on the side of his neck; he took hold of the wound and said you have killed me; I asked if any man would help me, I took hold of him, and stopt the blood as well as I could, and said he should not bleed till a surgeon came; I endeavoured to get him to the door; he staggered up, but could not go farther; he dropt upon his knees before I could bring him to the air; at last I got him into the yard, he was just alive then; when I saw him dying, I closed his eyes and his mouth, and tied a handkerchief round his neck, he was not alive a minute when the surgeon came: I believe from the time he was struck with the knife till he died was about twenty five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see the husband strike her, or do any thing to her?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the morning before the accident happened, my husband was bad from his work; he came home; they say he is my husband, but he is not; I lived with him eleven years, but never was his wife; he came home and called me a great many bitches and whores, and used me very ill, and broke every little thing belonging to the apartment that I had; he ran a fork into my arm, I have shewn it to a great many people; he struck me and knocked me down, and used me very ill in every shape in the world; I went to Mrs. Darling's who has had a spite against me six months, I called for a pennyworth of beer; he called me every thing that was ill; I had no person to take my part; I sat a great way from him; when the meat was made ready he eat his belly full; then he called me to come to him; he said you b - h come and eat a bit; I was overjoyed that he should ask me to come to eat with him after we had quarrelled; I went to him with as much joy as I should go into the kingdom of heaven this moment; when I came to him he took up a pipe and threw it in my face; after that I went to another box, then he threw a pint of beer in my face; I had a pennyworth of beer in one hand and the knife in the other; I threw the knife at him, which proved fatal. I beg your Lordship will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080009"></xptr> ask Mrs. Darling whether she has not had a spite against me a good while.</p>

               <p>Darling. I heard none nor saw none; I was backwards and forwards in my business constantly; my husband was laid down to take a nap; they were upon the jangling order, but I did not think they would have come to blows, much less to this unhappy thing.</p>
               <p>Q. From the jury. How long had they been in your house before this?</p>
               <p>Darling. Two or three hours; she did threaten to cut his nose with a pint pot; I took it away.</p>

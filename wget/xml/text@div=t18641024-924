                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Eliza Watson, who keeps a haberdasher's shop at 33, Fore-street—on Saturday, 8th October, the prisoners came into our shop together—they asked the price of some prints at the door first—Grogan then asked for some stockings—I went round the counter, got some, and showed them to her—my mother came in about that time and said she had got nothing that would suit them—while the two prisoners were there a person named Griffiths came in and asked for some gilt buttons—I told her I had not any—she went away and came in again for some velvet buttons—my mother told her she had nothing to suit her—she went away, and then the two prisoners went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness—on 8th October I came into my shop while the prisoners were there—Grogan was looking at some stockings—Smith appeared to be doing something at the end of the counter, but I could not tell what it was at the time, though I had my sus<lb></lb>picions—I watched them, and then Griffiths came in—she was taken into custody and discharged—I told Grogan we had no stockings to suit her, and drew them away from her—they then left the shop—I went round the counter and found a piece of linsey of fifty-two yards on the floor underneath where Smith stood, and I missed a piece of linsey of twelve yards—the pieces were both together on the chair when Smith and Grogan came in—I had seen them safe a very short time before; it was a little after three then—this is the piece of linsey (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I apprehended Grogan about three-quarters of an hour after Smith was taken—I told her I was a detective officer, and she must consider herself in custody for stealing, in connexion with another person, a piece of linsey at 33, Fore-street—she said she knew nothing of it whatever—I took her to the station—Miss Watson was there, and identified her as being the person she had seen in the shop—Grogan refused her address.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you your watch when you went into the yard? - A. Yes; I was making water in the yard, and the prisoner came and clasped her arms around me, and gave me a shove down, and clapped her hand against my watch-chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her lay hold of your chain? - A. Yes, I felt her lay hold of my watch-chain with one hand, and with the other hand she had hold of my collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose your watch at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do, did she stay with you? A. Her cap and bonnet slipped off; she got them up, and ran out into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the house before you went out into the yard? - A. Yes, she was standing in the same room, but not with me; I am sure of her person.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know about this business? - A. Nothing further than that the woman was in the house before this young man came in; I observed him go backwards into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remain in the tap-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stay in the tap-room, or go out? - A. She went directly out after him out at the back door; they had not been out but a few minutes before the door burst open, and she ran through instantly, in a minute's time, into the street; I followed her down Clement's-lane, and found her there; I asked her concerning the watch, she positively denied knowing any thing about it; she came back to the house with me without any force.</p>

               <p>Q. The watch has not been found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober? - A. So far as I know he was not the least the worse for liquor.</p>

I said, what reason have you to swear so, I am not going to touch you. He then threw fire-brands at me, and two or three of the scattered coals sell on our barge's head, which I flung at him again. I then heard him call for a powder horn, and say, d - n your eyes I'll soon stop your firing. I'll do for you; he then charged his gun and shot at me, and I have now one of the shot in my thigh; they were what we call No. 1. but I am not sure it was the prisoner at the bar, it was about eleven o'clock and very dark.

I was going down the river about eleven o'clock that night, I heard the people call one another names, and saw firebrands thrown out of the stern of the West-Country barge to the other barge, and heard them rattle. After that I heard a person swear a great oath, and he called aloud for something, one of the men said it was for a powder horn. I just kept clear of the barge's stern; in a moment I turn'd my head about and off went the gun. The prosecutor then call'd out for help, and I made all the haste I could to his assistance. The man and boy were very much hurt, he has been in the hospital.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you lose it? - It was taken out of the shop. This man took it out of the shop; the prisoner was introduced to me as an injured man, I allowed him to come to my house to eat and drink as often as he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been accustomed to come to your house? - From two to three months, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was this taken? - He took the opportunity to take it out of the shop, by seeing no person present.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he took it? - I only believe it by my servant telling me of it. It was brought to be glazed to my house. I did not see it taken; I was out at the time.</p>
               <p>JOHN BATCHELOR sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of April, I was working at the bottom of my master's shop, and this gentleman was in the shop, it was about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I can say; I see him go out of the shop, and I immediately had a suspicion that he had done something.</p>
               <p>Q. This prisoner was in the shop? - Yes; he was there a good while by himself, and he went out of the shop, and there were a great many cottons and callicoes laying by the door, and I had some suspicion that he had taken one; I knew there were ten gown pieces laying, and I took the little boy with me to a pawnbroker's, and they knew nothing of it; and coming back I see the prisoner in Carter-lane, and he went into a chandler's shop. where he had left the gown patch.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't know that of your own knowledge? - The people told me so.</p>

            Are the people here? - No. He came out of the chandler's shop, I and put the patch under his coat, and I followed him down into St. Paul's Church-yard, and stopped him with the patch under his coat, and told him my mistress wanted to speak to him; as we were returning back to our house he took the patch under his coat, and told him my mistress wanted to speak to him; as we were returning back to our house he took the patch and threw it into a pawnbroker's shop, the corner of Sermon-lane and Carter-lane.</p>

               <p>I am going of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with Kavannah? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As an apprentice? - No. I went out with this gentleman, and he brought me to a pawnbroker's shop, and the gown was not there, and we were going down Carter-lane, and we saw the gentleman(the prisoner) coming down after us, and we turned into a street, and waited there a good while, thought he would come by, and I went up Carter-lane, and I see him come out of a chandler's shop, and put the gown patch under his coat; and we went after him into St. Paul's Churchyard; and at the corner of Sermon-lane, he threw it into a pawnbroker's, and I went in and took it out.</p>
               <p>(The patch produced.)</p>
               <p>Batchelor. This is the patch; I know it by 259 on it.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you seen that before you gave it up to the constable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. To the best of my knowledge is mine; but the boy knows better, because he received it from the porter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The first beginning of my acquaintance with Mr Kavannah was by a countryman and his wife; one Sunday in particular, I happened to meet this countryman, so in course we went in to drink together, and I told him I was going to sell part of my land, and go to sea, to try my luck; and he told me he would help me to a person that would buy my land of me, and he took 'me to Mr. Kavannah; Mr. Kavannah was to give me four hundred pounds for it, it was worth six hundred pounds, and so he was to get two hundred pounds by me. in a fews days after we went down to counsellor Gould, and he refused the deeds; at last we had a contract between us, which I signed, and I was to give him a meeting at Glastenbury, in Somersetshire, where this land laid. Mr. Kavannah, before I came there had been and too possession of this land, and ordered the tenants to pay no rent but to him; I had a thought of his doing this; I was persuaded to go down into the country, and I went to Mrs. Kavannah, and I asked her for little money; I told her I was determined to to go; so she let me have three half guineas, two shillings, and five shillings in had halfpence. I told them I meant to go down next morning, and they would insist on my sleeping there that night; I went to bed that night there, and instead of putting my breeches under my head, I put them down by the bed side. The next morning I found two of my half guineas were gone; at last it was found out that the servant maid had got the two half guineas; so I had the two half guineas back again. I went down to the Swan with two Necks, Lad-lane, and took the coach directly, and when I came to Glastenbury, I understood that Mr. Kavannah had been to my tenants; and I wrote to Mrs. Kavannah, and she sent me down the gown patches while I was there. It is a swindling job. I am very glad it is now brought forward, or else if I had staid longer in the house I should have been hanged.</p>

            What do you say about taking this gown patch away? - I was to have gown patches of them, and they wanted me to have a watch, and ten pounds worth of these halfpence, or any thing that they could not cleverly tell what to do with.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Kavan ah. Had this man any right to take any patches? - I under stood that he had been in prison for fourteen of fifteen months, that his wife had kept him there; I thought he was a very much injured man, in concequence of that, I told him he might come to my house, and eat and drink till he could do some thing for himself, the land that he talks about, by inquiry, we found it was so embarrassed that he could not fell it; Mr Kavannah had a power of attorney, and i quired into the situation of it, and found that he had made away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What could induce you to give a man money that you knew nothing of? - The person that introduced him to me said, that he would have done it if he was able.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I came up to Mrs. Kavannh, she had put by some gown patches and a watch, and several other things. I was kept enticed both day and night, stupid and drunk every day and night ever since I had he concerns with Mr. Kavannah. I have got no friend here in town.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gibraltar-walk, Bethnal-green. On the 12th of Aug. I was at home, and noticed the prisoner looking at some chairs—he asked me the price of them—I told him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he represented his name as John Ward, of No. 2, Swan-street, Minories, and that he kept a cabinet-maker's shop—he asked me if I would bring them home—I said, "Yes"—he said he would meet me on the road in half an hour—he met me, and asked me to carry them to the next street, where he had sold them—I did so, and when</p>

               <p>I got within three or four doors of the house which he took them into, he told me to stop, and he took them in to Mr. Lazarus—he came out again, and said in half an hour's time Mr. Lazarus would get change and pay me—we waited about—then the prisoner went in again, and said, Mr. Lazarus could not pay to-day, but he would to-morrow—I said that would not do for me—I went in with the prisoner, and Mr. Lazarus said he had nothing to do with me, he had ordered the chairs of the prisoner, but he did not tell me at that time that he had paid the prisoner for them—the prisoner then said, "You will pay Mr. Bastin for the chairs to-morrow"—we both came out together, and the prisoner said, "What time will you meet me to-morrow?"—I told him, and he made an appointment to meet me at two o'clock the next day—I went there and waited till half-past three—the prisoner did not come, and I went to where he told me he lived, and he never lived there—I then went back to Mr. Lazarus, and said to him, "I am afraid that man has <hi rend="italic">done</hi> me out of the chairs, and you will not do wrong to pay me if I give you a bill"—he then produced a bill of the prisoner of the chairs sold to him for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. less than the prisoner was to give me for them—I told him I would lose no time nor expense in finding the man, and on that day fortnight I found the prisoner, and gave him in charge—Mr. Lazarus did not say in the first instance that he had paid for them, but, on the contrary, said he would pay when we came together—day after day he told me that—then he produced the bill repre<lb></lb>senting that he had paid for them at the time.</p>

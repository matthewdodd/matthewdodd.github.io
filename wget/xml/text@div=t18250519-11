            . I am a porter of the House of Commons. I was sitting on my chair, and saw the prisoner go up to Mr. Bellamy's apartment, at No. 13; I asked where he was going - he said to a committee-room, to see a friend: I said, "What committee-room?" he said he did not know. He had the umbrella under his arm; I took him down to my room, and asked where he got it - he said, "From No. 13 committee-room;" I said, "Is it your own" - he said, "No, but I lost one yesterday, and I thought I had a right to take one to-day."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I wish the gentlemen to understand that I am under peculiar circumstances. It is a prosecution which is instituted against me very lightly. - I came from the neighbourhood of Fulham, and went to inquire for some of the members whom I knew, and among the rest for Sir

             - I was directed to the committee-room; I had a new silk umbrella in my hand, which was very wet, and I put it down in a corner of the room; I then turned round to the table where the members were, who I wanted a frank from, and Sir John Newport told me his franks were gone; I then missed my umbrella, and asked the people about the place if they had seen it - they smiled, and said I was not so badly off as a gentleman who had lost his great coat. The next morning I went into the room again, and in the same corner I saw this one, of the same colour; I fancied it was mine, and took it up in my hand - when I came to feel it it was a cotton one. I addressed a gentleman, and said, "Is this your's" - he said not; I said, "I have a good mind to take it, and call as I return from the City, and, as they are all Bristol people, I may, perhaps, hear of my own."</p>

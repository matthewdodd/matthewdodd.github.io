               <p>two prisoners rushed out of the public-house, and knocked my brother down in the mud immediately—other parties were still coming, and my attention was drawn from my brother—I saw Mr. Freeman knocked down at the same instant as my brother, by some others—I went up to assist my brother, and was immediately attacked by the two prisoners and a man in a flannel jacket, having the appearance of a bricklayer—they knocked me down, and I was kicked dreadfully by all the parties—I got up on my legs, and found my hat and a silk handkerchief which was in it were stolen from me—I cannot say whether my hat was pulled off or taken off, but it was gone—I had an umbrella—I kept that fast in my hand for some time, and held it up to protect myself from the blows, and then that was wrenched from me—I cannot say by whom—I was knocked down again repeatedly—I was no sooner up than I was knocked down again—the two prisoners and the man in the jacket were the three that continued on me—I have not seen the other man since—I was endeavouring to run away, and called, "Police," as hard as I was able, the whole time—I made a run towards a public-house, and when I came up to the door I received a push—there were two or three persons at the public-house door—I entreated them to let me in—the landlord said he would have no <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> there—I was pushed from the door, and at the same time I received a blow from James Hawkins, and he seized the chain of my watch, and drew it from my waistcoat pocket—I had a guard on, and with the force of the pull he broke three buttons out of my silk waistcoat—my guard saved my watch—I caught hold of his hand with both my hands, and he struck me a blow with his other hand—the man in the flannel jacket came at the same time, and hit me with both his hands, one after the other, and I fell in the mud, and pulled James Haw<lb></lb>kins on me—my watch was then hanging loose out of my pocket—the other prisoner was also kicking and beating me at the time this occurred—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a handkerchief</hi>) this is the one I lost—I found it in a band-box is Thomas Hawkins's room, where I went in company with Ashton and Ellis, he policeman, and a constable, about five o'clock in the morning—there were other handkerchief in the box—the prisoner said, at the time the policeman were searching the box, "There is a handkerchief there which don't belong to me"—the prisoner and his wife were in bed there—they did not open the door, it was burst open—the policeman knocked at the door two or three times before they burst open, and they answered, "Who's there?"—the policeman called, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> me want you to open the door"—he wanted to know what they wanted with him, and they at the same time pushed the door in—it was very easily done—the door flew open—they were both sitting on the bed when I went in—the policeman had a light—they searched round the room, and when Ashton went to the box, the prisoner said, "There is a handkerchief in that box that don't belong to me"—he said nothing about it before Ashton went to where the box was—I said it was my property—there were tow large dogs in a cupboard in the room—one of them was something of a Newfoundland breed, and the other a mastiff—they endeavoured to rush out on us—I have not found my umbrella or hat since.</p>

                  </hi>. I hold a situation in the East India Company's service. On the 9th of October, I was going with my brother and Mr. Freeman towards Smithfield—when we got out of the coach, the coachman observed that that was the Swan, pointing to a public-house, which I believe was the Bull—we asked a person, who appeared to be a lad who attends to water the horses, and he directed us further on to a house with a light—we went on, and arrived at the public-house, and saw two woman standing, off the stones—we asked them where the White Swan was—they gave as indecent answer—I heard Freeman say, "You may as well be civil"—I turned my head for the purpose of finding the place, and I received a blow in the face from one of the woman—I said to her, "You had better mind how you behave yourself, or I will give you in custody"—I was immedi<lb></lb>ately knocked down by a blow from behind, before I had scarcely finished the words—I did not see the person who struck me—I had an umbrella with me—after I was knocked down in the first instance, I endeavoured to get up, but as often as I did so, I was knocked down—I defended myself with my umbrella, which was torn from my hand, and I did not find it again—I did not see the prisoners, not to recognise them.</p>

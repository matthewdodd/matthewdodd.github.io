               <p>WILLIAM MINCHIN sworn. - I know a person of the name of John Ruggles, at No.9, Downing-street; he calls himself an army-agent or broker; I was a sort of porter, who opened the door and took messages; the prisoner was at the house several times; he used to come for money that Ruggles owed him, as I understood. (The bill shewn him,) This is the same bill I saw at Hatton-garden; the prisoner brought it to Mr. Ruggles for acceptance; he at first objected to accept it, saying, he had no correspondence at Manchester; the prisoner said, he was a very good man, a respectable man, a responsible man, at Manchester; and, at last, Mr. Ruggles accepted it; I verify believe it to be his writing; this must be about May or June; Mr. Ruggles has lodgings at South-Lambeth; Downing-street was the Agency-Office. Agency-Office was on the brass plate on the door; only the lower part of the house was furnished; there were some officers came at first to buy and sell; Mr. Ruggles continued there till the bills became due, and then he kept away from the house, and got another person to come there in his stead, of the name of Kelly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you first went there, there was some agency business? - A. Yes, there were some officers who called; there was a person employed there as clerk, I don't know his name; there were two rooms, an antichamber and office; the bill was accepted in the office; I opened the door as porter, but was sometimes called into the office; I will swear, upon my oath, I was in the office when the bill was brought in for acceptance; I was not in when it was accepted, but it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN LEES sworn. - I have a release from the prosecutors; I have resided at Manchester upwards of ten years, and am a silk and cotton manufacturer, and cotton spinner; I am well known there, and am in partnership with my brother, John Lees; I never saw the prisoner at the bar, or heard of

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Lees is a very common name in that country, I believe? - A. Lees is a very common name, but Jonathan is not; I was brought up within a quarter of a mile of where he lived; he is not a respectable man; I have not seen him for two years, but I made inquiry prior to my coming up, and found he still lives in the same place, and follows the same occupation; I never saw him write.</p>

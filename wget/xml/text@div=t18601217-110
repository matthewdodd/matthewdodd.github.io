                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 59). I am on duty at Woolwich—about twenty minutes or a quarter to 5 on the night of Thursday, 6th December, I saw the prisoners—there were two others with them when I saw them first—the prisoners were walking to and fro past Mr. Brangwin's shop in Powis<lb></lb>rtreet, Woolwich—I was watching them for about ten minutes from the opposite side of the street—I was not in their view, I could see them—I saw Woodall take this print (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the front of the prosecutor's shop, and take it down the street towards Kelly, who had a sack in his possession at the time—during that time Kelly was watching; looking up the street towards them, I saw Woodall put the print into the sack—on that I immediately crossed over and took Kelly info custody—I told him I wanted him for stealing the print from the shop—I was in plain clothes—he said, "You cannot say that, for a man asked me to carry it for him"—I then took him to the police-station—I gave the sack to a lad to carry—it was brought to the station-house with us—the other prisoner escaped—I left the station as soon as possible, and made towards Greenwich, the Lower-road,</p>

               <p>and there I apprehended Woodall—I told him I wanted him for being con<lb></lb>cerned with others in stealing some print—he said, "Oh, you have made a mistake"—I then took him to the station, where they denied all knowledge of each other—I searched them—I found a return ticket on each, and a I halfpenny on Woodall—they refused to give their address—they said that they did not wish their friends to know they were in trouble.</p>

I live at 71, 72, and 73, Powis-street, Woolwich, and am a linendraper—that print is mine; my private mark is on it—on 6th December it was in a recess between my two windows—the value of it is about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are eighty-nine yards in the two pieces.</p>

This cloth was outside my shop on the 29th of March—I missed it about twenty minutes past seven o'clock, when I was called out of my parlour—I have frequently seen the prisoner—he was horse-keeper at a house opposite—about eight o'clock the same evening we went and found it in a hay-loft which the prisoner has the charge of—I saw the prisoner before I searched, sitting in the tap-room—the officer spoke to him, and he went into the yard, and began shutting the gates—he was with me when I went into the loft—this is the cloth.</p>

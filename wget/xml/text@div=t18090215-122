            . I am a taylor. On the 31st of January last, between the hours of five and six o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop in a very great hurry with something in his hand, he threw it behind a tub in the shop; I went to see what it was, it was a couple of pieces of carpets; I was rather uneasy at the man throwing it in in that kind of way; I sent my brother round to the brokers; I found in Spital square Mr. Harlow had lost two carpet; in about an hour and a half the prisoner returned again, and passed up to the place where he had put them; I told the prisoner I must know where he got them; he made answer it is all right; I sent for an office, he came and took him in custody.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in custody at Mr. Owen's house, and the carpets; he had then the carpets with him; I asked him where he had got them; he said from a sale in Spitalfields, he did not mean to keep them; he had been employed to hold the candle for the auctioneer.</p>

I get my bread by attending sales; there being nobody there when the sale was over I took the carpets down; I asked the girl in the shop if I could leave them there; I did not throw them behind a tub, nor any thing of the kind. When I went to fetch them from this gentlemen's house I told him I was going to take them to Mr. Harlow's house. I had been holding the candle for Mr. Harlow two hours, of course I expected something for my trouble.</p>

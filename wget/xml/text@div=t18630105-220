I am the wife of Thomas Nokes, of Grantham House Amherst-road, Hackney—on Saturday night, 20th September, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I went into my bedroom, on the first-floor—as I went in I heard a noise, as of some one getting out of the bedroom window—I ran down stairs, opened the street door, and saw some one sliding the pillar of the portico, which is near enough to my bedroom window for a person to get to it from the window—I went into my room, and missed this dressing-case, and these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in the dressing-case were three bracelets, three rings, and, I think, two brooches—there were several brooches in another room into which they went—they went into two rooms besides my bedroom—I lost a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns, and a guinea, which were in the dressing-case, and a purse and some silver coin—I also lost this cameo brooch—the property which I lost was worth about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I noticed a mark at the bottom of the window, as if it had been prised open.</p>

               <p>mean to say that you had all these things of Yates?"—he said, "yes, I did"—I asked him how long he had known Yates, and he said, "About nine years"—we then left the house, and as we came outside with Clements, we told him that we were going to his mother's, that he might accompany us if he liked, or he might be taken to the police-station—he said he should like to go; so we went to his mother's house—I told his mother that he had said he left some property there—she said he had done nothing of the sort—he then said, "Mother, I have told the truth; you had better give up what is left"—his mother then pointed to a writing-desk, in which were the fittings of this dressing-case—I asked him who he had bought them of—he said, "I had them of Yates"—there were also two or three little memorandum books, and a pencil-case—Kemble, Austin, and Horn, were convicted here last November Sessions—I was in that case—there were six indictments against them for stealing property from different gentlemen's houses, in which cases they used a very fleet horse and gig—one was sentenced to fifteen years, another to four years—Yates' wife was tried then and acquitted—I was in search of Yates at that time, and had been from 13th October—I went fre<lb></lb>quently to the house where he had formerly lived, and could find nothing of him—I was in search of him till 9th December, when I took him—I told him that I took him for being concerned with Kemble and others, who had been convicted, for robberies, mentioning Mr. Bowley's as one, of 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery; that Simpson had stated that he received the property from him, and pledged it for him—Yates said he had never given him any property to pledge—I said, "What made you abscond, for I have been looking for you, and could not find you ever since they were tried?"—he merely said, "I abscond"—he did not say "Yes," or "No"—I took him in custody.</p>

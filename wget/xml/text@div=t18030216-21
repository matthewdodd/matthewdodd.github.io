            : On Friday, the 14th of January, about half past three, I was in the accompting-house, No. 20, St. Swithin's-lane; I was apprised that a man was detected in the warehouse by one of our porters, William Knight, of having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160016"></xptr>stolen two bottles of brandy; I went into the warehouse, and saw the prisoner, he had nothing on him then; a constable was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, and the brandy was delivered to him. The prisoner appeared, as he does now, to be deaf and stupid.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KNIGHT sworn. - I am warehouseman and carman to Mess. Pollard and Company: On the 14th of January, as I was going from the dwelling-house to the accompting-house in St. Swithin's-lane, I saw the prisoner take two bottles of brandy out of a basket containing nine bottles; they were standing by the vault door, waiting for the permit to carry them out; I saw him putting them in his pocket, I taxed him with it as he was coming across the yard, I asked him what business he had there, or who he wanted; he could not give me any answer, he said, he wanted some liquor; I made him pull them out of his pocket, and replace them; I marked them immediately, and they were marked before the bottles were full, they don't hold quite two quarts; they are the property of Messrs. Pollard and Company. (They were produced).</p>
               <p>EDWARD RICHARDSON sworn. - I am a constable: The prisoner was delivered to me; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in liquor, coming by I saw the bottles standing, I tried to pull the cork out of one of them, I could not; then I tried another, and while I had hold of it, he came in. I could have gone away before the man came in if I had had a mind to it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Constable). Did he appear drunk? - A. Yes, I think he was.</p>

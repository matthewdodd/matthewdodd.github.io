I am managing bankruptcy clerk to Mr. Lane and have had the conduct of this matter—on 9th November I went with Mr. Mason to the prisoner's place in Whitecapel, and Mr. Moore told him that Mr. Andrews had been appointed receiver and he had called to take possession of his property—we looked over the house, principally to look for a cash box, but could not find it—I asked him for his books and papers, he said that he had none—I asked him if he had any property of any kind in his possession, he said that he had not—I asked if he had any debts due to him, he said "No"—I went back again the same day with Mr. Mason in consequence of further information, and we looked in a particular place for the cash box, but could not find it—I asked him where it was and what had become of it, he said he never had one—I said that we had received information that a few days before he had produced a cash box containing Bank of England notes to the amount of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that was all a mistake—we searched the house with more care but did not find anything—I was present afterwards at a meeting when he was shortly examined—that is not on the file, but there is a copy of it among the papers—I did not see him again till 2nd February—up to that time I did not receive any paper from him or any communication whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I drew the affidavit of Mr. Richard Dixon of 8th November, 1875—he is a partner of Mr. Marcus—the receiver was appointed on his application—it was upon that that I went to him and asked him about the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—not being able to find any money I went and saw Davis between the two visits—I next saw the bankrupt at his solicitor's office when the resolution was passed to wind up his affairs—the Registrar refused to register because the estate did not disclose any property to administer, there was then an appeal to Mr. Hazlitt and this resolution was registered—it'was then that Mr. Andrews became trustee—the prisoner was not present when that resolution was registered, but his solicitor was—I swear that, for he spoke to our counsel, but I was not present—something occurred in the Registrar's private room, but I was not there—after that I subpœnaed him to the Bankruptcy Court on 2nd February—I cannot tell you when the notice was served, the books are not here—a clerk in my department served it, he is not here—I did not make it out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Registrar Keene refused at first—the prisoner was repre<lb></lb>sented on that occasion by Mr. Pass—the further hearing was before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt sitting as Chief Judge—Mr. Pass was present when Registrar Hazlitt gave his decision as to whether Registrar Keene was right, but I do not know whether the defendant was—I should not have served him with a notice—the ordinary course was pursued as with other debtors—the prisoner did not complain that the appointment of a trustee had not been advertised—I believe it was advertised—I have not got the advertise<lb></lb>ment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Andrews, the receiver and afterwards the trustee—while he was the receiver I took possession of the defendant's stock-in-trade—that was on 9th November—there was a sealskin jacket there which was claimed and given up—that would not be stock—the only stock I found was some rabbit skins which I made as good a price as I could for, and sold them at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was present when the inquiry was made about the cash box and heard the prisoner's reply.</p>

I carry on business with my father and brother as fur merchants at 4, Jewin Crescent—early in October we were the holders of an acceptance of the defendant's for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went with my father to his residence—I had not the bill with me because it was not due; it had two or three days to run—he said that he was quite prepared to pay it, and he gave me a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from a japanned cash box in a drawer—there were several other notes with it; I could not see what they were, but it was to his advantage to show me that he had a lot of money because he wanted me to give him credit for more goods—he was to have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. returned, but he bought more goods and said that I might keep it on account—I said that if he would call at the warehouse I should be happy to do business with him, and he came on 4th October and bought 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods on account, and gave me a bill for the balance; I allowed him 2 1/2 discount on the order—the bill was never paid—my brother was present, he gave evidence at Bow Street similar to mine—he is in Germany.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not tell Richard Dixon that I had seen 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the cash box—I saw him for the purpose of getting him to take as cash 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more bills—I offered him Myers' bill for 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he said "This bill is not worth the paper it is written upon"—I told him I thought the man was trustworthy as he had paid me a bill a short time before, but I never told him I had seen him take out his cash box with 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called on Myers in the way of business and not to get money, although the bill was not due till the 8th I took 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 4th—he gave me a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, but I did not offer him the change because I had not got it with me—you must ask him why he gave it me before it was due—I told him I would give him a cheque for the change when he called at my house—he did call for the balance, I asked him to buy more goods, and he gave me a 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill—this (<hi rend="italic">a small mahogany box</hi>)is not the cash box I saw—I am still under the impression that it was a japanned cash box—I saw some papers in it—he took out several notes, but I cannot say whether the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was at the top—I know that they were notes because he said so, he said "I have some more money besides," but whether they were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes or pieces of tissue paper I do not know—I have not given him the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill back, he has not applied for it, and was at my bankers when he came—it is in my possession now—it has never been applied for; you can have it if you want it—I believe Mr. Mason took the stamped receipt when he came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Mr. Dixon—I was in Manchester last month on business for the firm and went to 40, Lord Street to seek for a person named Portugee as I had the name—I got the address from the bankrupt's examination—I did not find him there and then went to 4, Lord Street, thinking it might be a mistake, but he was not there—I made minute inquiries but found no one bearing that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sent instructions on Monday, 10th April and I was at Manchester next day making the enquiries—I had four or five sheets of the examination given to me but I should not like to say that the address was</p>

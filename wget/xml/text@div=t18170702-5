            . I live in Little Gray's-inn-lane. On the 8th of June, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was coming up <placeName id="t18170702-5-crimeloc23">Russell-street, Covent-garden</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18170702-5-crimeloc23" type="placeName" value="Russell-street, Covent-garden"></interp>

I caught hold of his breast in falling, I held him 'till assistance came up, I called out, Mr. Bury came up in five minutes, I had a three shilling token, a half crown, and some small silver, in my pocket, in all 10s. 6d. which I lost. I also lost a pocket-book; I did not know I had lost it until after the prisoners were taken to the watch-house; I was then going to get some drink, and missed my money out of my waistcoat pocket-my book was in my inside pocket. I could not have dropped the money; I was stunned by the blow; when I came to myself I found them all gone from me. I am sure Willey is the man who struck me.</p>
               <p>WILLEY. Q. Was you not intoxicated - A. I was not. When Bury came up I was quite insensible. I am groom to Sir John Malcolm.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BURY. I am a constable. I heard the prosecutor call out, I went up to him, and found him holding Willey by the neck, the prisoner, Hutchinson, and another man were running away, the prosecutor was half up and half down, he appeared insensible and not drunk. Willey was trying to get away, I laid hold of him, he struck me several times and got from me, I called after him, and Bartlett stopped him. I knew both the prisoners before. I fetched the prosecutor to the watch-house, he went out and returned in ten minutes, complaining that he had lost his money and pocket-book. I went with him to the spot where the scuffle took place, and found the pocket-book laying in the gutter. I am certain it was the same place.</p>
               <p>WILLEY. Q. Did he not ask you the way to Gray's-inn-lane before the scuffle took place - A. Yes; and I directed him - He was quite sober.</p>

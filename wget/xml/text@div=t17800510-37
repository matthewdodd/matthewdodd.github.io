               <p>Did you know the prisoner before that time? - No, I did not. Says he, are not you going to Mr. Long's in Half-Moon-street? I said yes. Then he asked me if I did not come from Mr. Gray's, a tailor, in Stanhope-street? I told him yes. He asked me if Mr. Gray was at home? I said yes. Then he said I must give him the clothes, and go home and tell my master Mr. Long wanted to speak to him; I came home and told my father what had happened to me.</p>
               <p>Did you give him the clothes? - Yes. I thought he was Mr. Long's servant.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you saw the prisoner again? - About two weeks. I then saw him at Sir

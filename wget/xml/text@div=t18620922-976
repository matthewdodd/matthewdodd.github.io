                  </hi>. I am a porter, and reside at 2, New Inn-square, Shore-ditch—on Friday morning, 28th August, about half-past 12, I was on my way home—when I got within twenty yards of my own door the prisoner stopped in front of me, and put both hands up to my face—I put my hands</p>

               <p>up, thinking he was going to strike me—I was then seized from behind by the throat by some other party whom I did not see, and my neck held down—I distinctly saw the prisoner from the position I was in—the lamp was at my back, and the light was shining on the prisoner's face—I distinctly saw his features—I had got on this coat buttoned up, and the prisoner kept working away at it, and the watch was taken away—he had his eyes on mine all the time—I was left insensible, and the persons ran away—when I came to, I found my watch and chain and hat were gone—I also lost a chronometer, which was found about 2 o'clock on the following day by a neighbour—she is not here—I gave a description of the person who had robbed me to the police at the station.</p>

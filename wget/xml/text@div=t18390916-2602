                  </hi>. I am clerk to an architect, and live in Shoreditch. On the 17th of September, about nine o'clock, I was in High-street, Shore<lb></lb>ditch, and hearing a noise in the Spotted Dog public-house, I stopped with several others, at the door—I saw the prisoner near a gentleman, and watched him—he seemed very busy, and the gentleman turned round</p>

               <p>sharply as if some one had been at his pocket—he passed on, and just as two policemen came up to take the persons out of the public-house I saw the prisoner come towards me, and then felt something pull at my pocket—I instantly turned, took hold of him, and gave him in charge for at<lb></lb>tempting to pick my pocket—he said, "Me, sir?"—I said, "Yes, you sir," and just at the time my rule was picked up from the pavement—no one was close enough to take it but the prisoner.</p>

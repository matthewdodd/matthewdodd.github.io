                  <hi rend="italic">Kelly's Defence.</hi> I am very sorry. I was drunk at the time, and meeting the other prisoners, Thomas sent me with the coin to various shops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Quinlan in his defence</hi> said he was seeking work at the docks, and saw Kelly drunk, with a crowd round him—he took Kelly's part, and Kelly treated him to drink—he was directing him the way home when they met with Thomas, and that he had nothing to do with the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> stated that he saw Kelly fighting in a crowd near the Hercules public-house with his hat off, and found there was a dispute about some money. He got him away, and Quinlan brought him his hat. They had some beer together, and were accompanying him on his way home. That Kelly went into several shops and gave him the two-shilling piece to buy beer with; he had no idea of its being counterfeit, or that Kelly had been uttering bad money; he thought when arrested that the policeman suspected he was the man who had taken Kelly's money in the crowd.</p>

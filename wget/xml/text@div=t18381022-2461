                  </hi>. I live in Billow-fields, Woolwich. On Saturday, the 25th of August, I met Dunn, near the Arsenal-gate—I went with her about a hundred yards—something passed between us, and then I missed my handkerchief—I accused her of it—she denied it—I tried to secure her—she struggled, but I held her—I missed my watch also, but I did not miss my box for some time—nobody was near me before I missed my handkerchief—she denied all knowledge of the watch, and was dis<lb></lb>charged—the watch was then found, and she was taken again, and the box found on her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Dunn</hi>. I never saw his watch at all—I asked him to give me a pipe of tobacco, and he gave me the box to take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the first battalion of the Rifle Brigade. On the 14th of this month, about eight o'clock in the morning, Corporal Stamp came to my room—I went out, and saw Radley and Lax<lb></lb>ton—I shook hands with Laxton, and asked her how she did—she asked if I had any money—I said, "No"—Radley then asked if I would go and pawn a watch for her—I told her I would, after parade—she asked me whether I could not go then—I said I would try if I could—I went and dressed myself, and took the watch to pawn—I got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I returned the seals and chain to Radley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Radley</hi>. You did not—you sold the seals and the duplicate of the watch to another man. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Yes, I did, but she asked me to sell them—I sold the seals for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and returned the money to Radley.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Radley</hi>. No, you did not—I found the watch two months ago, between the Arsenal-gate and Plumstead-road, and I kept it to know whether it would be advertised—I then gave it him to pawn—he said it was better to pawn it, and have a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> out of it.</p>

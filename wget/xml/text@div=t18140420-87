On the day before mentioned, about half past seven, the two prisoners came into the shop; Fautley asked to look at some ribbons. Bowers and Fautley were close together. I took out a box with a great many ribbons in it, and put it before them. Fautley took her bonnet off, and laid it on the ribbon box, and measured her bonnet to see what quantity it would take to him it. She objected to the assortment, and wished to see more. I turned round to take out another box, and on turning to them again I saw Fautley take her hand from the box, and put something into her pocket. I suspected she had taken something. She then asked me to shew her some white ribbon; I turned from her to take out the white ribbon box, and when I turned again I saw the same as before. She took her hand from the box, and put something in her pocket. she bought a yard and a half of ribbon, and left the shop. I went after her and stopped her about half a dozen yards from the shop. I told her I suspected she had taken some ribbons. I brought her back and searched her, and found no ribbon upon her. I found one piece of ribbon in the shop, and Mr. Mason brought in a piece of ribbon; he said his wife picked it up in the area, just by where I stopped the prisoners. Bowers begged my pardon, and wished Fautley to do so; Fautley refused.</p>

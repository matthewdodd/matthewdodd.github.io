I live at 44, Millard Street, Hackney Wick—in the beginning of July I lived at 20, Ellesmere Road, Bow, with my mother, Harriet Barlow, and my sister—we occupied the ground floor—the prisoner is my aunt, my mother's sister; she lived on the first floor—on 2nd July I had been out with my mother—we were both quite sober—we returned home between 12 and L o'clock—my sister was then in the room—we went into a ground-floor bedroom, and the prisoner came down and asked what the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was—my mother said that there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> and called her a liar, and said she would dash her brains out, and she went to the drawers and picked up a glass thing used for flowers, which holds about a pint of water—she then asked my mother to let her go by; my mother said, "No, when you have put that down," and the prisoner put the glass down and Walked to the room door to go upstairs—my mother then walked to the fireplace, and the prisoner rushed to the table and picked up a flower-pot full of mould with a flower in it and threw it at my mother, who was three or four yards off; it struck her on the forehead; she began to bleed, and ran out to the bottom of the street calling out "Police!"—I went after her, and found her bleeding—she did not return to the house; she was taken to the police<lb></lb>station, where her head was dressed—the prisoner was not sober—the only <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was that in getting a light I knocked an image off the mantelpiece; it was my mother's—next day my mother appeared before the Magistrate and charged the prisoner with the assault, and she was sent to prison for three months—on Saturday, July 6th, my mother complained of her jaw, and on 7th July she went to the hospital, and died on the 8th.</p>

               <p>we got there about ten o'clock, and left about 11.30; we had no drink there but we had a pint of ale at my grandmother's—we are lodgers in the prisoner's house, and had been so for two three months—there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> except by my throwing down the image—my mother and I were not quarrelling—it was an earthen flower-pot which the prisoner threw—my mother said nothing to her, only told her to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> out—my mother had rceceived a wound on the top of her head about four or five weeks before, but it was not treated by doctors; she only had linseed-meal poultices—she got that wound in a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—she was not drunk—she was in the habit of taking a drop, but not to say to be a drunkard—she was able to go to the police-court the next day, Monday, but she was not drinking afterwards; we went right home—she was not drinking next day—she had some drink on the Friday—she was not drinking every day up to the time of her going to the London Hospital—the prisoner had not been very kind to my mother; I never saw her assist her or give her clothes—I had no brother living there, but seven sisters; there were eight of us altogether—they were in bed—my eldest sister was at work—I worked and gave my mother money, and so did my sister—two of us and my mother kept the family—the former wound on my mother's head had healed up.</p>

In the beginning of July I was living at 20, Ellesmere Road—I was sitting up in the dark, and remember my mother and brother coming home—when they were in the room the prisoner came down, burst open the door, and said, "What is this <hi rend="italic">row</hi>?" she said, "There is no <hi rend="italic">row</hi>;" the prisoner said, "Yes there is," and walked to the drawers and picked up a glass and said, "Let me go by"—my mother said, "Put that down and you can go by"—there were no flowers in it—she put it down, and my mother said, "You may go by now"—my aunt then picked up a flower-pot and threw it at my mother, and it struck her on the forehead—my mother and brother were sober—the prisoner said that if she did not let her <hi rend="italic">go</hi> by she word beat her brains in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner—on 3rd July, about 4 a.m., I saw Harriet Barlow at 'the police-station with a wound on her forehead just over one eyebrow, about 2 ¼ inches long and going to the bone—it contained the grit of a flower-pot, and dirt, and it was in a dangerous place, being over certain nerves, and other things might follow—I only saw her once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was called in for my father, who was away—when I dressed the wound I told the deceased to go to a medical man, or to a hospital, because after the second day the wound would require fresh dressing—I heard nothing then of a wound at theback of her head.</p>

                  </hi>. On 7th July I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital, and I think about 2 p.m. Harriet Barlow came there suffering from lockjaw—I dressed a wound on her forehead—there was then as far as I remember a piece of plaister on it—she died of lockjaw on the 8th, fourteen hours after she was admitted—I did as much as I could for her—the wound was in a very unhealthy condition indeed, probably from a con<lb></lb>ciderable quantity of dirt having got into it—I made a post-mortem exami<lb></lb>nation, and that was the only wound—she died from lockjaw produced by the wound on her forehead—that is not uncommon, especially in that position, it is a very important nerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I cannot tell when the wound was dressed last—<hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi> is attributable to many causes, but generally to a wound—if she had a wound on the back of her head a few weeks before, which had appa<lb></lb>rently healed, I could not say that that had anything to do with the lockjaw; when I found a wound like this which would be a distinct cause, I cannot attribute it to a more remote cause—if she had been drinking during the week that would make her more unhealthy.</p>

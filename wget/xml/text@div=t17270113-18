I called a Neighbour and told him I had lost my Watch, and sent my Maid for Mrs. Burgis, to tell her I must speak with her, she came about 7 o'Clock, and I asked her, why she had played the Rogue with my Watch, she denied having meddled with it, upon which I told her she should go before a Justice, and then she desired she might send for a Cloak, and a Hoop-petticoat, and whispered to a Person that I did not know, and that came in without being sent for, who went and fetched her what she wanted; when they came she was a pretty while in putting them on just at a Corner of the Room, near which there was some old Pattens, she pretended her Shoe was unbuckled, or her Garter untied, upon which she stooped down for a little Time: And after we had been before the Justice, and knocked up all the Pawnbrokers thereabout to enquire if the Watch had been offer'd to them, could hear nothing of it, the Watch was found under an old Patten, with the Cristial downward, just by the Place where the Prisoner made an Excuse to stoop, notwithstanding that the Pattens had been removed, and the Place strictly searched before.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence. The Prosecutor invited me to drink Tea and Breakfast with her, and desired I would bring my Girl with me, I went one Morning about 10 o'Clock, and asked her Maid if her Mistress was within, she said yes, but she was in Bed with a Gentleman; I went another Morning, and then a Gentleman's Footman came to the Door, and I suppose she was in Bed with his Master. So hearing she kept such bad Hours, that she seldom got up before four or five a Clock in the Afternoon, I went in the Evening about Five a Clock, and found the Prosecutor dressing of her Head, she asked me to drink a Glass of Wine, and I believe I might drink two Glasses of French Wine burnt, I enquired what a Clock it was, and the Watch was fetched and said down on the Table, I did not stay long, but went out and came again, and told her if my Child would not be thought troublesome I would leave her while I went to the Playhouse, which she seemed very well pleased with; I went away, and after some Time Mrs. Cooper sent for me from the Playhouse, and when I came she asked me why I had played the Rogue with her Watch, I, as very well I might, denied it, and they were for searching me, and I gave them leave to strip me naked (the Constable promising to look out at Window) this was in her own Room, and they did search me, and after they had so done and carried me before the Justices I was admitted to Bail, the Constable that was then charged with me, came the next Morning and told me he had News to tell me, for the Watch was found, and all further Proceedings would be stopt.</p>

               <p>Colonel Ridley depos'd. That the Prisoner sold Oranges, and had a good Character: but that there was great Reason to believe, that the Prosecutor Cooper, was a lewd infamous Woman and a common Street-walker. The Jury <rs id="t17270113-18-verdict99" type="verdictDescription">

I thought it was all right; he called it his authority only Kusick came into the room; the other man staid at the door; he looked under the bed, and pulled the clothes off my wife that was in bed. I was in my room all the time he was searching it, he went to the next room; then I stood by the door, when they had searched the next room. I begged and prayed that they would not go up stairs, because of the woman that had been in labour all that night. With a great deal of persuasions, they did not go up and search the other rooms they then said I must treat them with something to drink. I went down stairs, and gave them a quarten of gin which they did not pay for, and then they went away. I had no such person as

When they went away, Kusick said Kelly I will be here again at half past ten o'clock pray do not say any thing of our being here; for this man we want, and must have him. As soon as they were gone, I went up stairs because I was naked, as soon as I entered my bed room, I missed my watch from off my table; I wound it up the over night, and laid it there. that I might see what o'clock it was; I always lay my watch there, I have never seen my watch since.</p>

I told Kusick what I took him in custody for; he said he knew nothing of the watch, he said he had been at Kelly's house, to find a man of the name of Riley; as to the watch he knew nothing about it, I searched him and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge that is laid against me, I went to Kelly's house to for Frenk Riley. Mr. Kelly said come up stairs and see he said he was not there; I came away. When I got home I was met by three of the gang; Oh said they you have been to Kelly's, I said yes they said you had better not go there again they called me a nose. I am innocent of the charge. My wife had been robbed of her shawl, I went there to find the man that had taken it from her. I thought I had better put up with the loss then go there again.</p>

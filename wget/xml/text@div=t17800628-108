             came in and asked the woman where I lodged if t hey should leave the things; there was a sheet, some china, and some trifling things, I cannot recollect what, I was in bed there; she said they should not leave them then. They said where should they leave them but in their lodgings? that they came honestly by them, and would leave them there.</p>
               <p>What sort of china was it? - Long dishes, two soup plates, and brown plates all full of colours; it was burnt-in china I believe.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I have been out of place three months; I have lodged with Mr. Timmings ever since.</p>
               <p>Who lodges in this house besides? - Several young men; sometimes strangers every night.</p>
               <p>How came you to take such particular notice of that night? - Because I looked at the things particularly.</p>
               <p>How came you not to recollect these things when those gentlemen asked you about them? you said there were a sheet and china, and some trifling things you could not recollect? - Some cups and such things; I did not recollect the china; I was always with Timmings every night.</p>
               <p>Have you been there ever since you lodged with her? - Yes, I have never been out of the house since.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure they brought all the things which were brought? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they bring the silk gown there? - No, I must have seen it if they had. I was never out of the place.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the watch brought there? - No, I did not. Some things were taken away in the morning; these were kept.</p>

            , Gardiner, and Kelly knocked at the door; Mrs. Timmings let them in; they brought some things with them, and desired she would let them leave them there. She refused. They said they came honestly by them and where should they leave them but in their lodging. After some persuasion she let them bring them, and they left them below stairs, and went up to bed; she called to them afterwards to take them away. There was a cloak with fur on it, two sheets, one longer than the other a petticoat, and some other linen.</p>
               <p>Did you see any plates there? - Not till next day. She was going to bed when they came in. She was not out that evening.</p>

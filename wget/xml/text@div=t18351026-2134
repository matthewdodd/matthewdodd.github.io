                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 138.) On the morning of the 30th of September, at half-past five o'clock, I was in the Edgeware-road—I heard a woman call out "Police," and saw the prisoner with a bag in his hand, at No.47, Connaught-terrace, close to the railing—there was a woman near him, and some other persons at a little distance—he ran away.</p>

               <p>leaving the bag behind him—I followed, and he was stopped by another officer in my view—he had a cap on—I took him back to the spot—the woman had taken the bag into the house—the officer knocked at the door while I took the prisoner to the station-house—I afterwards saw the same bag in Sergeant Graves's hand—he took it to the station-house, and in it was the best part of a goose, part of a leg of mutton, and some rump-steaks—we took the prisoner's cap off, and there was a rope in it—I am certain the prisoner was the man who dropped the bag—I just lost sight of him while be turned the corner, for two seconds.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No.47, Connaught-terrace. The goose was cooked overnight, and there was beef and mutton in the larder—I saw them in the bag, and know them to be the same—they are the property of George Spiller, who lodges there—I did not give the alarm—I had dressed the articles—they were kept in the area.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going along Oxford-terrace—the sergeant stopped me, and asked me where I was going—I said I was going to work up the stone-yard for the parish—while he was talking to me a policeman came up and said, "Here! a robbery has been committed"—then the sergeant said, "Here he is," and caught hold of me, and took me into the Edgeware-road, he got over into an area, and found the larder open.</p>

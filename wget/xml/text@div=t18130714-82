            . I am a plumber's labourer. Me and my partner were at work in the building, in the two pair back-room about half past two o'clock. I had to go down to the back kitchen; we had a fire there; we were making a joint to a leaden pipe; I was going down the kitchen stairs; I heard a rustling noise in the shop, I cast my head round; I saw the prisoner with a basket, and one or two saws; he threw the basket down with the tools, and pushed by me, making a queer sort of noise. He endeavoured to escape along the passage; I called to him to know who he was; he made no answer. I followed him; he got through the place where the board was loose, that he had come in at; I catched hold of him by the skirt of his coat, and the board being on the swing struck me on the head; the prisoner did that, which made me leave my hold; I followed immediately afterwards, and secured him; I never lost sight of him; he went only to the next door the wine-vaults. This is the basket he had.</p>

               <p>Burgess. These are mine.</p>

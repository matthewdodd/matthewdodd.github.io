Bermondsey—the prisoner is my father—he is a hair-dresser—the deceased Sarah Margaret Rogers was my mother—the family consisted of my father and mother myself and a little boy, three years old—I remember a Sunday afternoon when we went to Victoria Park together—I don't know the date, it was five or six weeks ago—we had tea before we went out—we started about 5 o'clock—we rode in an omnibus—we had some ginger-beer there that was all we had—I saw Mr. Doffy, our landlord, in the park, and walked about with him—we were all friendly together—I think it was getting on for 11 o'clock when we came away—we came back by omnibus—when we got back we went into our own to get some only had one room that was the back parlour down stairs—we all slept in that room—we had supper when We got home—I was sent out to get some vinegar; I could not get any, and my mother afterwards went and got some—before we started to go to the park, there was some quarrelling between my father and mother, because my mother's frock was dirty at the bottom—he said she ought to have washed it, she said she could not; that was all that took place—there was no further quarrelling when we came back—after supper I went to bed, before my father and mother—I slept on the floor by the side of their bed—they slept in the bed with the baby—I went to sleep—I was awoke by my mother calling out "Eliza, your father has cut my throat!"—it was then nearly daylight—I saw father lay the razor down on the table; I think it was open—my mother was lying in the bed with the baby—I don't know on which side of the bed she was lying—father was sitting down at the foot of the bed, and ran and sat on the foot I did not notice his throat—mother got out of bed, and ran and sat on the foot of the door-step—she had her chemise on; there was blood on it, and there was blood on my little brother's face and head—I did not notice anything on my father's clothes—he kept his razors in the bottom box by the door; that box could not be reached from the bed; you would have to get out of bed to get to it—before this I had once seen my father split my mother's head open; I can't tell how long ago that was—they have been <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> and</p>

I live at 11, William's Terrace, Blue Anchor Road, Bermondsey—the prisoner and his wife lodged in my house—they occupied the back parlour on the ground floor—that was the only room—they had lodged with me about three months—the prisoner was a barber and hair-dresser—he used to work for his brother, and go out to work in the day—they had two children living with them—sometimes they would be quar<lb></lb>relling, at other times they would be pretty happy and comfortable—before this occasion I have been disturbed at night with their quarrelling—I slept in the back room upstairs—I got up on one occasion, and called out to him, and asked what he was making that noise and disturbing, all the house for at that time in the morning, and I would not have it—he did not make any answer—I could not hear what the quarrelling was about—on one occasion when I got up and called out to him he said it was his wife that com<lb></lb>menced upon him, that she was always <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> at him—she made no reply to that—that was about 3 o'clock in the morning—I could not tell what the noise was about—it was a quarrel between themselves—I never learnt what it was—the prisoner was a sober man all the time he was lodging with me, and the deceased was a sober woman—on Sunday evening, 16th June, they went out—I went out before 5 o'clock—she had been at home all the morning, and he had come home to dinner—nothing had occurred during the day that I heard—I was in Victoria Park in the evening, and saw the prisoner, his wife, and the two children there—I left them in the park about 9 o'clock—I was with them there some little time—they were both sober, and seemed very friendly—I got home about 12 o'clock—they were then at home—James Stone, the brother-in-law, was at the door when I went in—the prisoner and his wife were in their room—I did not see anything more of them that night—I went to bed in the back room over the kitchen on the first floor—I heard nothing before I went to sleep—about 2.30 I heard a shriek—it was then just about break<lb></lb>ing day—it was Mrs. Roger's voice—I got up and came half down stairs and called out "Mr. Rogers, what do you mean by disturbing the house at this time in the morning?"—I got no answer—Mrs. Rogers called out "Come and help me, I am bleeding, he has cut my throat"—she was in her room, and the door was shut—the little girl then opened the door, and came running out and said "Father has cut my mother's throat"—I saw the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The room was dark—I have known the prisoner about three months—I thought him to be a very strange man, in simple ways; if they Were quarrelling or anything, he had childish ways with him, he seemed as if you could hardly get a word out of if you spoke to him; simple in his ways—he was out in the garden one Sunday, standing right in the middle of a bed which I had been digging up, and I said to him "you will get into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> directly; look where you are standing," and he said "I did not know" in such a simple manner—he was decidedly strange in his manner—he appeared to be fond of his wife, and he would not rest till she said "Good morning" to him when he went out—I never saw anything amiss with him and the children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> By being childish in his ways, I meant he had such a simple way if you spoke to him; he would not bring out his words as you might do, as though he had to look at his words before he spoke them—I could understand what he said pretty well; he spoke rationally, pretty fair—there was nothing else that I noticed, except a few words when they have been quarrelling—I heard him once say that she had torn his coat up at the back—I know they did quarrel, I could hear them when I was in bed—I suppose I have heard them quarrelling four or five times, in the night—she once threw the teapot at him; I heard the teapot go down the stairs—I could not tell the particulars of that quarrel—at that time they were living in the back room over the kitchen—I go out about 8.30 in the morning, and I don't get home till about 7.30—the prisoner worked for his brother—he was able to attend to his work—after they had had a quarrel he would not leave his wife till she had bid him "Good-bye."</p>

               <p>in a nearly exhausted condition, leaning forward on her knee—I was told that her husband was wounded likewise, in the back parlour—I passed by her, and told the policeman to bring her after me and lay her on the bed—I think she was probably laid on the bed before I noticed the state of the bed, as I was looking at the prisoners throat—there was nothing remark<lb></lb>able about the room except the blood—there was blood over the bed and pillow, and blood on the floor—the prisoner was sitting on a chair with his shirt on, and his trousers just drawn over his knees—I examined his wound, and found it was only bleeding a drop or so; it was of no material conse<lb></lb>quence, so I turned my attention wholly to her—she was then on the bed—the policeman came in some time afterwards and made some observation, I don't remember what it was, and the prisoner said it was his wife <hi rend="italic">done</hi> It—she replied "If I was to die this moment, it was him <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it; he was kissing me just before he done it, and telling me how he loved me"—he said nothing to that—I asked her about the position she was lying in at the time—she said she lay at the back of the bed, toward the wall, and the child lay on her arm, aid if it bad not been for the child obstructing or prevent<lb></lb>ing her from using her arm, she could have prevented him doing it—the prisoner's brother came in some time afterwards, and he said to the prisoner "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Jim, Jim</hi>, what have you, been doing?" the prisoner said it was his wife <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it—the brother said "No, <hi rend="italic">Jim"</hi>, or something of that sort—the prisoner pointed to his wrist and said "Did not she wound me there?"—I afterwards had them both removed to the hospital—I did not see the razor at the time—they were such wounds as might have been inflicted with a razor—the wound on the woman was a very serious wound, that on the man was a bad cut, but nothing to be apprehensive of.</p>

               <p>the angle of the jaw—it was superficial—one large muscle of the neck was partially divided; it was not a wound dangerous to life—he was under my care about a week or ten days, and was discharged cured—I saw him the whole of the time he was in the hospital twice a-day and sometimes more—I saw nothing strange in his manner that struck me, but I never held any continued conversation with him except on his own case; there was nothing in his manner that struck me as remarkable—he said nothing to me as to the cause of the wound—I asked him the usual questions as to his condition, and got coherent and sensible answers—the woman was also very pale and faint when I saw her; she had a wound on the left side of the neck, about 4 in. long and about 1¼ in. deep; it wounded the internal jugular vein and exposed the external carotid artery, and several vessels of the neck were more or less divided; it was a clean cut wound and was of a dangerous character; it was precisely such a wound as a razor like this might pro<lb></lb>duce—she died on 27th June, about 1.30 in the middle of the day—the cause of death was pyæmia, blood-poisoning, the consequence of the wound—she was under my attendance the whole time—on the Saturday before her death, the 22nd June, I felt it my duty to send for a Magistrate; she was then excessively weak, and had every appearance of not living many hours—the Magistrate came next morning between 12 and 1—at that time I believed her to be in a dying condition—I told her her condition, and she was perfectly conscious of it—I asked her if she was aware that she could not possibly recover; she said she was, she knew that she was dying—her husband was not present when the statement was made, because we thought his presence would only excite her and do her harm—on the Monday before her death she expressed a wish to see him, and I was present at the interview—she addressed him by name, and said "Now, <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, you retract what you said, that I did it"—he made no reply—she spoke to him for five or ten minutes with regard to their past life and so forth; but I cannot recollect if they recriminated one another about the various quarrels they had had—she confessed to once having stabbed him in a fit of passion, and he pointed to his wrist—I can't remember what he said; he said very little; merely that he did not know, he did not remember, and that sort of thing—I saw a mark on his left wrist; it was in the nature of an old wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Court Keeper at the Southwark Police Court—I attended with the Police Magistrate of that Court on Monday morning, 24th June, between 12 and 1 o'clock, at Guy's Hospital, and was present with him at the deceased's bedside—he asked her certain questions, which I took down in writing; this is what I wrote—it is correct (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "The examination of Sarah Margaret Rogers, taken on 23rd June, at Guy's Hos<lb></lb>pital. This deponent, on her oath, saith as follows: 'I conscientiously believe that I am dying. I recollect last Monday morning. I was in bed about day-break, with my baby on my arm, on my left side, the side I am on now. I had been asleep, I was not thoroughly awake; I heard my hus<lb></lb>band saying something, I don't know what, I was too tired; I partly raised myself in bed to put the baby off my arm, when his arm came round my neck, my husband's; a violent blow, I knew it was a razor because it was so sharp; I called to my little girl "Eliza, your father has cut my throat!" and she called Mr. Doffy, the landlord, and Mr. Dight, the lodger. I struggled a little with him to protect my baby, I think; and when they, the landlord and the lodger, were coming into the room he, my husband, said "Don't go out, nobody will know anything about it." Then I got into the passage, and sat on the street door-step; I think the cold stones to my feet brought me to; and then a policeman came in; he went in and said "De<lb></lb>tain that man." I don't know who fetched Mr. Moore of the Blue Anchor round; he came to me; he sent for somebody from this hospital, and they took me on a stretcher to the hospital. Eliza and the little boy Billy were in the room when he struck me. It poured like a pail on to my child. Between 12 and 1 o'clock, when I got into bed, he tried to choke me with his hand, thumb and finger; we had no words particular, only about my frock being dirty at the bottom; we had some words when we first went into the Victoria Park, about half-past 5 o'clock; he said I was lazy, and might have done it up; it was not dirty, I had only worn it once. We met our landlord and landlady, Mr. and Mrs. Doffy, in the park; we had two bottles of ginger beer going and coming back; he was quite sober; he had signed the pledge on 17th April, and we were just home in time to get some vinegar at the public-house. We went home and had supper com<lb></lb>fortably together; he ate a little, and so did I; he said if he did not eat anything I should think him proud—then we both laid on the bed and went to sleep. We had no quarrel that day; he was very strange in his manner. He used to say I thought of somebody else better than I did of him. I had no thought of wrong to him; I thought there was something the matter with his mind; I thought so for some months. My brother William, some months ago, advised me to go to a Magistrate and have him put away. He had let his shop and could not get another, and I think that preyed on his mind; he used to say I got him off that; he was working for his brother and doing well I told my husband I was happier when he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187208190080"></xptr>
               <p>out all day. We were always quarrelling; I stabbed him once with a knife about four months ago, on his wrist, because he called me a bad name, before we left Bermondsey New Road; it was a little table knife. I said I would do anything if I could only have seven years to get, away from him, he led me such a dreadful life.' The prisoner was not present when this statement was taken—his brother was there, and he suggested one or two questions to the Magistrate."</p>

I pursued the two prisoners who were walking fast; I overtook them in London-field, with the blanket under the arm of Murrell; I called to them, and said they had stolen the blanket; they said they had found it - I secured them. I had lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was the blanket ever out of the caravan? A. No, it had been over a chamber organ. I know nothing of Goddard - the caravan might be six or eight yards from the door; they might be near a quarter of a mile off when I first saw them; boys sometimes get in and throw the things about when goods are removed; they waited at the door till the officer's son came, and were quite willing to go with him.</p>

            . I was assisting to deliver these goods. I did not see either of the prisoners near the caravan. I saw the blanket in the caravan after all the goods had been carried into the house; I heard it was stolen while I was in the house - I had seen it safe about five minutes before. I followed, and saw Price with the prisoners in London-field; they behaved very well, and said they would go back and wait for a constable, for they had found it.</p>

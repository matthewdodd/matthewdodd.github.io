On the morning of the 11th of August, about two o'clock, the prisoner awoke me; I saw him leaning over me; he was quite a stranger to me - I asked what he wanted - he made some answer but I could not tell what - I said "If you don't go away I will knock you down, and cut your head open with a poker;" he then went to the door, wished me good morning, said it was all right, and went away. When I went to bed I had eight shillings, a sixpence, and 2 s. 7 d. in copper, in my jacket pocket, which I placed on the chair; when he was gone I saw my clothes on the floor, and I missed the money; I ran out immediately after him, without my clothes on. I saw the watchman in Tothill-street - I asked him if he had seen a <rs id="t18250915-101-deflabel549" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

            . I am a watchman of Tothill-street. I saw the prisoner pass me between two and three o'clock, as it was getting light - he appeared very cold, and I said "Why don't you walk fast and get warm?" he went into the Almonry, and I saw him again about ten minutes before three, running very fast - while I was calling three the witness came to me naked, and asked if I had seen a soldier pass. I then pursued through some courts, and found him in Little Chapple-street, and found 10 s. on him in silver, and 2 s. 9 1/2 d. in copper. The witness told me he had lost 10 s. 7 d., and before he saw the money, he gave me a particular description of this sixpence with a bit melted out of the edge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness said he had lost some money in the Almonry, and a soldier had taken it from him, but it was not me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

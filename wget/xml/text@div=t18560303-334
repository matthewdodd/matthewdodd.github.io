                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On the morning of 20th Feb., about 20 minutes past 4 o'clock, I was on doty in Apperton-lane, Harrow, and noticed that a mark which I bad put on a gate had been removed—I had hung the chain so that if the gate was opened by anybody it would fall off—in conse<lb></lb>quence of that I went into the field, and when I had got about halfway across I saw two men running—I followed them as far as Stonebridge, and then lost sight of them—having seen one of them go through a hedge, I went there and found some footmarks made by boots very peculiarly nailed—I found there two bundles containing five coats, a large cape, two silk handkerchiefs, three pairs of gloves, and a small strap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to the gate, from which the mark had been removed, and found footmarks of the same person—on Saturday, 23rd Feb., I saw the prisoners in custody; I got their shoes and compared them with the footmarks, by making fresh im<lb></lb>pressions six inches off, and the impressions corresponded exactly—I did not put them into the footmarks—this is Pittum's right shoe, it has round headed nails across the front of the heel, and here are three nails in the toe—Prior's shoe is nailed on one foot outside the heel, but a portion of them are worn out, and I found the impression of the missing nails in the foot<lb></lb>marks—I was about twenty yards from Pittum when they crossed the Great Northern Railway, and I believe he is one of the men, by his size and dress—this gate is about five miles from Mr. Bunstall's—I traced the footmarks one mile nearer the gate towards Mr. Burstall's.</p>

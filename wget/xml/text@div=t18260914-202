The prisoner came, on the 15th of August, to my house with his son, and slept there that night; he was very drunk when he came; I went up into the room where he slept, and saw a parcel of torn pieces of paper, which my wife can swear she had in her pocket.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner; he was very drunk, and went to bed at seven o'clock in the morning. In putting on my pockets, I found I had no money in them; I had had 16s. the night before in them, 10s. of it was in a brown paper, and the rest loose; there were some half pence and farthings; I had counted them the night before; my room door was not locked; I can swear to this piece of paper as one that had been in my pocket.</p>

            . I slept in the same room with the prisoner; I heard the clock strike four in the morning, and said to the prisoner, who was in bed, "How do you find yourself," as he had been tipsy the night before; I went to sleep again, till between five and six o'clock, and then he was standing in the room without his shoes; he walked backward and forward, and then laid down on his right side; I heard him count some money, which I thought was half pence; and then thought I heard some silver; I heard some paper tear, and saw his hand go over the head of the bed; I heard something fall on the floor - he said soon afterwards "I wish to God they would get up; where am I;" I said "At Mr. Corcoran's;" he said"What! Corcoran's in Grub-street:" I said Yes; and he said "I am all right;" I said "Your son was here last night, and ordered you not to go till he came between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and you can't go out till Mr. Corcoran gets up;" I then heard Corcoran go down, and said "Corcoran is gone down, and you may go down now if you like;" he got up; I went down and saw him in the bar taking change for something; he then went out and returned shortly after; some inquiry was then made; I went up into the room with Corcoran and found the torn paper - I gave it to the officer.</p>

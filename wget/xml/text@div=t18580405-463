The prisoner came and made motions for half a pint of beer; my daughter served him—I saw him give her a bad sixpence—I returned it to him and took the beer from him, and he went away—he came again in quarter of an hour and made motions for half a pint of beer—I did not give him the beer, but took his money; it was a bad sixpence—I saw my husband mail it on the partition on the counter.

                  </hi>. I have been lodging at the White Hart, Portpool-lane. On Sunday evening, 28th Sept., about half-past 10 o'clock, I was in Leather-lane with Henry Bullen—Graziani, who was on the other side of the street, took a stick out of another man's hands, ran across the road, and hit me on the shoulders with it—this black stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I ran into Mr. Caves's, the King of Prussia, at the corner of the street—they would not let me remain there, and I ran out again, and Graziani struck me on the forehead with the stick which knocked me down, and cut my head open—I got up again directly, and saw Graziani, and also Bardinet, and several other foreigners, and Bardinet stabbed me in the side with a knife—I did not see a knife—I saw him strike me with something, and felt myself stabbed—both the prisoners ran away towards Baldwin's-gardens, where I overtook them, and I there saw the knife with a little boy, who had picked it up—I got my hands cut in the scuffle, while I was on the ground—I was taken to the police doctor, and have been attended by him since—I bled a good deal from the wounds—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the shirt I had on—I had seen Bardinet in a public-house about a week before—I had not quarrelled with him, and no words had passed between us on this evening—I have seen Graziani going up and down Gray's-inn-lane; but never had any quarrel with him.</p>

On this Sunday night, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I was passing through Leather-lane, and there was a crowd of persons running towards Holborn—when I first saw them they were nearly opposite Cross-street—I stood on one side for them to pass me, and they turned up Baldwin's-gardens, and had got twenty or thirty yards up when Graziani came up from towards Charles-street—I was at the corner of Baldwin's-gardens, and he came and stood with his back against the shutters of a draper's shop—I stood close to him—the crowd then turned back again into Leather-lane, and as they were coming round the corner some one hallooed out, "Here is one of the b—foreigners, let us have him for one," and Graziani was directly collared by five or six of them; they then knocked him down and picked him up again, and dragged him towards Portpool-lane, and I saw no more of him—from the time he came from towards Charles-street, till the mob surrounded him, he was not in the mob at all—I swear he had no stick or anything in his hand, I must have seen it if he had—I did not know him before—I am an Englishman.</p>

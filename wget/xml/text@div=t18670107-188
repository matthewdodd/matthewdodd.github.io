                  </hi>. I am a dyer in High Street, Camberwell, at 70 and 71, Oakley Street, Lambeth, and I have a third establishment—I have been in business forty years—the prisoner has been in my employment for twenty-two years—I brought him forward in the business until I placed him in the management of the Oakley Street business—I cannot trace back what his wages were beyond 1862—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the wages book, it is in the prisoner's handwriting—in 1862 he had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, that was gradually increased to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this book shows it—it includes the wages of all the other servants—it was the prisoner's duty to account to me for moneys which he received on my behalf—we generally balanced up once a week, when I was there—if I was out of town he balanced the books and carried it forward to the following week—it was his duty to enter in the cash-book all sums he received—I believe this cash-book before me is entirely in his handwriting—none of these three sums are entered in any of my books—I did not receive from the prisoner 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., paid by Messrs. Brewer, on 4th May, 1866, or 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 16th, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 15th June—the last entry of wages to the prisoner is on 18th August, 1866, that was Saturday—he did not leave my employment on that date, he came again on the Monday—I am not sure whether he came on the Tuesday, but I believe that was the day he absconded—he never returned to business after that—I could not find him, and I took trouble enough about it—I employed a detective to make inquiries, and sent some of my men with him—I should say it was quite two months before I was able to discover him—he never at any time made a claim to be a partner—the first I heard of such a claim was at the Southwark Police-court—in January, 1866, in consequence of something that occurred with respect to my accounts, I said to the prisoner, "John, you are robbing me"—he said, "I am not"—I said, "I know you are; how much have you taken?"—his answer was, "It is under 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Sit down and make out a compiete list of what you have taken, and well understand that you will have to make a clean breast of it; if you attempt to deceive me in this matter I will prosecute you as sure as you are born"—he thereupon made out this list of items, which came to 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "Is that all?" and he assured me it was all—I then wrote against the amount at the time, "A loan of cash by</p>

               <p>A. Beattie to J. W.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He is your nephew, is he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is—he was managing ray business in 1857—at that time I left my business, in conse<lb></lb>quence of being a shareholder in the Royal British Bank—as such I was liable to calls—I left London to avoid arrest, and I assigned my leasehold premises to the prisoner—I did not make over my business to him—he and his sister carried it on during my absence, in the name of J. W. and E. Webb, late A. Beattie—I was not cognisant of the billheads being sent out headed, "J. W. and E. Webb"—I have not got any of those billheads that I am aware of, I have looked for them and cannot find them—I did not give any directions as to how they should be sent Out—I think I have seen some of those billheads since this prosecution commenced, but I am not certain—I did not find any in a box of the prisoner's—I have had a notice to produce them, I do not produce any; I cannot find any—none were returned to me when I came back to London—the prisoner had an account at the London and Westminster Bank while I was away—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>) this was the account kept by him, in the name of J. W. and E. Webb, for the purpose of carrying on my business, but not by my direction, I knew nothing about it—it was money that came out of the business, and money advanced by my friends; most, if not all, the money advanced by my friends was used in paying out an execution in Oakley Street and Camberwell—I believe the income received during my absence was placed to this account, and it was as mueh my property then as when I was at home—the money that was at the bank was most assuredly mine, and the bank-book shows it—he handed me the balance when I returned—when I left home in 1857 three friends advanced me three sums, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have here the notes upon which those sums were advanced (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), these were given by the prisoner and signed by him—those sums were advanced, I think I may venture to say, on the security of my good name, no other security was given except these notes—Mr. Patteson, my solicitor, who is deceased, received the money; a friend of mine repaid it for me on my return with my money; every shilling of it was mine—daring my absence "J. W. and E. Webb, late Beattie," was put over the facia of my places of business—upon my return the prisoner received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that book shows it—I re<lb></lb>turned before March, 1858—I returned at the end of the former year, but, not having received my protection from Vice-Chancellor Kindersley, and not having settled with the liquidators of the bank, I could not then hold property safely; when I got that protection, and had settled with the bank all demands upon me, then we settled up the affair of the balance, the prisoner received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid over to me 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—since then he has received nothing from me but the wages recorded in this book, except what I gave him in the shape of gratuity—this book commences in 1862—he has stolen the whole of my old books and sold them for waste paper last Christ<lb></lb>mas twelve months to my stationer. Mr. Paradise, in Queen Street, Cheap-side—after my return I made him presents of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and all that sort of thing—perhaps I did not always enter those advances in the books as gratuities, sometimes they came out of my pocket, and I believe were not entered at all—some were entered as grutuities—here are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070098"></xptr>
               <p>two sums of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered in the cash-book as gratuities; they are entered in the prisoner's writing—I think they are not entered as gratuities, but they were so—altogether I should say those advances amounted to about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as I never expected any return, I did not keep any particular account of them—about two years before he left I called his attention to some accounts that had been left unpaid—he said they had been overlooked—I said, "Well, you are a very pretty bookkeeper to look after my interests," and three days afterwards those accounts were paid in—that was not a dispute exactly, but I felt annoyed certainly—it was last Christmas twelve months that he gave me this bill—I then charged him with robbery—he did not deny it: he said at first, "I have not taken anything"—I swear that he made out a list of moneys he had received amounting to 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said that was the amount he had plundered me of; he did not use those words—I do not remember his ever asking me for an increase of wages since my return—he did not ask me for advances or want money from me—I gave him money once when he told me he was pressed upon for rent—I mean to swear that from 1858 up to the time he left he never asked me for anything more than his 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—it was for that alone that he was managing my business, except what I gave him in the shape of gratuities—one night he sent his wife to say he should give me warning, and leave at the end of two weeks, but thereby hangs a tale; he never told me so himself—I never heard that he was about leaving me to become the manager of a dyeing company limited—after the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. affair I was constantly suspecting him—I think it is very likely I had some conversations or discussions with him, but I cannot charge my memory with any one in particular—very likely I had several—on the morning he absconded I went to his house—I was sent for—he was not there—I broke open his desk by his wife's direction—she was very ill, I sent a message up to her, and asked her if she wished me to do it, and she sent me down word that she wished me to do it—it was a bureau desk—I found nothing in it but dirt and filth, private correspondence, bills for gin and beer, and all that sort of thing, and I think some cheques—I also found some savings bank books—I don't know what I did with them; I have looked about for them repeatedly since and cannot find them—I have every bit of the papers I found, but they relate to his private matters, and I don't think you would like to have them read—I very seldom omitted settling the weekly accounts with him, perhaps I might do so twelve or fourteen times in the course of a year, or it might reach twenty—I can swear that when he omitted to pass an account one week he did not do it in the subsequent week, because I went over the accounts with him, when I came up and ascertained for a certainty what all the money was for, and how applied, and all about it—I have been through all the accounts since 1862.</p>

British Bank, and we advised him to pay them out, not in his own but in the name of somebody else, and it was ultimately agreed that they should be paid out in the name of the prisoner and his sister, and they were to receive the money for the purpose—the leases were to be assigned, some to the pri<lb></lb>soner and some to his sister, and some to them jointly—I received from Messrs.

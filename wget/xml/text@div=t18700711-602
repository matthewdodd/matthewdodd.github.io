                  </hi>. I am a detective sergeant, at Birmingham—I know a cottage in Caroline Street, Birmingham—I don't know the name of it, it is at the end of a lane—I had occasion to watch that cottage on 26th March last—it was occupied by a man named Rafferty, a dipper and silverer in the jewellery trade—it is a private house, having a very small shop, with a lean-to at the back of it—I have known the prisoner, Wilson, eight or nine years—he is a gunmaker at this time—he was in business for himself, with two others, named Meeninham and Gill, in Harper's Buildings, Weaman Street—Meeninham and Gill are Irish—Wilson, I believe, is an Englishman—there was no name up—it is a small shop, or rather shops, one above the other—there are a great number of gunmakers' shops in the same buildings—they had two shops, one leading out of the other, up stairs, on different floors—it is about a mile from Rafferty's cottage—about 4.30, on the afternoon of 26th March, I saw a brother of Meeninham, a youth about nineteen or twenty, coming up Caroline Street, with a hand-cart, apparently with something in it; I could not tell what—he went up the passage, towards Raffertt's cottage, followed by Wilson—Bodley, one of the Irish con<lb></lb>stabulary, was with me—I lost sight of the man with the hand-cart for about an hour—in consequence of what Bodley said to me, I went down Caroline Street, into George Street—I then 'saw young Meeninham with the same hand-cart, and a large box in it—he went to the Midland Railway goods receiving office, in George Street Sandpits, Wilson following—I can't say whether Wilson went into the office or not—young Meeninham came out without the box, and went away with the hand-cart—I went into the office, and saw a large box there—I believe it was the same box I had seen in the hand-cart—there was no other box there like it—there was a direction on the box—I read it, and took a copy of it; it was "Mr. John Wilson, Mid<lb></lb>land goods station, Leeds, from J. Wilson"—some little time after, by the</p>

               <p>permission of the railway officials, I opened the box—it contained nineteen muzzle-loader rifles, nineteen bayonets, and one Snider rifle, a breech-loader—there was no invoice or bill inside—the rifles were in a rough state, finished so that they could be used; but not burnished, either the stocks or barrels—the stocks were not cut—the box was fastened up again in my presence—on the evening of 29th March I was watching the entrance to Rafferty's cottage, with Black, a brother officer, and saw young Meeninham bring a hand-cart, similar to the one I saw before up Caroline Street, with a cask in it—he turned up the passage in the direction of Rafferty's cottage, fol<lb></lb>lowed by Wilson—I could not say they went into the cottage; I remained; in about half an hour, young Meeninham came out of the passage again with the hand-cart and a similar cask in it; Wilson followed him down the passage, close to him—Black followed them—I afterwards went to the same railway receiving office I had been to before, and found there a small cask addressed "Edward Ward, 68, Rutherglen-loon, Glasgow, from J. Johnson"—I did not meddle with the cask that day, but I saw it opened on the 30th, it contained thirty large six-chamber revolvers, all alike, and fourteen boxes of cartridges, marked fifty "each; I should say they would fit the revolvers, they were marked No. 12, and the revolvers are what they call No. 12—there was no bill or invoice in that cask—it was fastened down again—I went to Glasgow and on 1st April I saw it delivered at 68, Rutherglen-loon; I should call it a marine-store dealer's shop; I did not go inside, I don't think there was any name up, I did not notice one—next day, 2nd April, I was again near Ward's shop, and about 12 o'clock two men came, they went into the shop and remained a minute or two, and then one of them brought out a cask, on his back, similar to the one I had seen, it was taken to a place called Gildey's Court, to McNamara's as I was told—I followed it there, it was taken into a room, I did not go in, I watched whilst the Glasgow police came, and they took it in hand—I saw it open, it contained fourteen revolvers and thirteen cases of ammunition—it was left with the Glasgow police and I returned to Birmingham—on 4th April I went to the arrival platform of the Midland Railway, Birmingham, and saw the 5 o'clock train from Leeds come in, and the prisoner Davit came out of it; I had known him before—I know nothing more about him at that time—on the evening of 14th April I was again watching Rafferty's cottage, with Black, and saw young Meen<lb></lb>inham come up Caroline Street, with a hand-cart and three boxes, apparently empty—Wilson was following him close by; they went up the passage lead-ing to Rufferty's—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes young Meeninham came out of the passage with the hand-cart and three boxes, they appeared to be a great deal heavier than they were before; Wilson fol-lowed him down the passage; Black followed him—I afterwards went to the Globe Parcels Office; Black was there; I found there three boxes similar to those I had seen in the hand-cart—I copied the addresses on them, two were addressed "J. H. Kershaw, Glassmaker's Arms, Bailiff Gate, Newcastle-on-Tyne," and the third to "C. H. Williams, Globe Express Office, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle—on Tyne,"—I did not open those boxes, I marked them—I then went on to Newcastle-upon-Tyne and communicated with the police there, I went to the railway station and saw the boxes arrive, about 6 o'clock on Saturday morning the 16th, and pointed them out to Hickson and Thorburn two of the Newcastle police, after this I returned to Birmingham on 18th April I was at the Midland Railway goods station with Bodley, and saw two boxes there, one was addressed "C. H. Williams, Globe Express</p>

               <p>Office, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne," I saw it opened, it contained twenty-five revolvers precisely similar to those I had seen before; there was an address on the other box, I did not put down the name but the address was "Globe Parcels Office, Market Street Manchester," that was also opened in my presence, it contained about 1 1/2 cwt. of ball cartridges, part of it would fit the revolvers, and the other was for rifles—there was no invoice in either of the boxes—on the 14th May I was at the Great Western railway station, Snow Hill, Birmingham, and saw young Meeninham and a little boy with three parcelsin black oil-cloth, two of them seemed to have a strapor something round them—shortly after I saw the prisoner Wilson and a stranger—they went to young Meeninham—I could not say whether they spoke—they ultimately carried the three parcels into a third-class carriage, into which Wilson and the stranger got; the parcels were handed to them—that train was going to Paddington—I communicated with the chief of the police and a telegram was sent to Scotland Yard—I have since been shown some oil-cloth bags—I know Davitt, I had seen him several times in Birmingham prior to the 26th March, but not since 4th April—this manufactory had been carried on by Wilson and the other two for eighteen months or two years previous to my watching it, or perhaps more—Wilson formerly worked for a man named Wilson, a gunmaker, and afterwards for a Mr. Williamson; I believe he was the last person he worked for before he commenced this manufactory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer in the Leeds force—on 28th March last I went to the goods station of the Midland Railway, in company with Bodley and Inspector Hunt—Bodley pointed out a box to me—that afternoon two persons came with a hand-cart for that box; Wilson was one of them, the other was a man who acted as warehouseman for Davitt—the box was given to them and put in the hand-cart—Davitt's warehouseman took it away, and Wilson walked beside him until they got to the Horse and Jockey, about 100 yards away from the station—Wilson then went into the Horse and Jockey, and Davitt's warehouseman took the box along Swinegate into Milne's yard to the warehouse that, I have since ascertained, had been taken by Davitt—it appeared very heavy, and some persons living in the yard assisted the warehouseman up the yard with the hand-cart; it was taken into the warehouse, and the door was locked by the warehouseman, and they then went away—that was, I believe, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I and Knapp watched the warehouse through the night—about 9 o'clock next morning the warehouseman came and opened the door; in a short time Davitt came, and went into the warehouse; a short time afterwards the warehouseman came out and went somewhere, and in a short time returned with a hand-cart and four or five empty casks, which he put into the warehouse—about 12 o'clock they left for dinner, and returned about 1 o'clock—they were in the warehouse till about 3 o'clock; the ware-houseman then came out and got a hand-cart, and took it to the warehouse door, and they brought out two casks, which appeared to be very heavy, and Davitt assisted the warehouseman in putting them into the cart; he then handed the warehouseman a piece of paper, and the warehouseman went to the London and North-Western Railway goods station in Wellington Street, Leeds; he put the casks on to a landing-stage there—I copied the addresses on the casks, and handed them to Hunt—I then followed the warehouseman back to the warehouse; two more barrels were brought out by Davitt and the warehouseman, and put into the hand-cart—I did not see any paper handed at that time—the warehouseman took them to the same goods station, and placed them on the same landing-stage—I afterwards saw one of those casks opened on 29th April, the same night they were taken to the station; it contained rifles, sword bayonets, revolvers, ammunition, and ball cartridges—on 4th April I saw Davitt leave the warehouse with a green carpet bag; he went to the station, and left by the 1 o'clock train for Bir-mingham—the name of Jackson was painted on the inner door of this warehouse—I saw Davitt in Leeds several times after this; he lived at 22, Oak Road, Leeds, and the warehouseman lived in the same house, and passed by the name of Henderson and Wilson—I know the prisoner Wilson; I only saw him once in Leeds, that was at the time I saw him at the Midland goods station.</p>

I am inspector of the London and North-Western Railway, and the Lancashire and Yorkshire, at the joint station at Leeds—on 29th March, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw two barrels brought to the station by a tall man; I don't know who he was—they were addressed "John James White, Esq., of London, Burgon's Hotel, Athlone, Ireland," and "Miss Margaret Delmere, Castlereagh, Co. Roscommon, Ireland," and "from L. and W. Rawlinson, general dealer, Leeds," was printed at the bottom of both the cards—that same afternoon the same man brought two more in a hand-cart, one was addressed "Mr. John Flannery, general merchant, Ballyhaddareen, Co. Mayo, Ireland," marked "X 76," and the other "Messrs. McDonnell, general merchants, Tuam, Co. Galway, Ireland," and those two had printed at the bottom of the card "From J.

Williams, Globe Express Office, Pil<lb></lb>grim Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne"—Thorburn and I watched those two cases the whole day—I watched most, up to 6 o'clock in the evening—no one came to claim them—I then opened the one addressed to Kershaw—it contained twenty-five revolvers—the other was subsequently opened; that also contained twenty-five revolvers—they are six-chambered breech-loaders—they have not been inquired for, to my knowledge—I have fre<lb></lb>quently communicated with Inclewood's Parcels Delivery Office in Pilgrim Street since the arms were seized, but no one claims them—no such name as "C. H. Williams" is known there—I have made every inquiry—I have not endeavoured to find Mr. J. M.

I have, for a long time, devoted my attention to the study of handwriting, for the purpose of ascertaining the genuineness or otherwise of documents—I have had several documents laid before me pur-porting to be signed by Davitt, the complaint marked A, and four receipts for sums of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., received from Inspector Clark and Mr. Campbell—here are four cards, Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8, one addressed "Mr. C. H. Williams, Globe Express Office, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne," two to "J. M. Korshaw, Glassmaker's Arms, Bailiff Gate, New-on-T," and one to "Mr. C. H. Williams, Globe Express Office, Pilgrim St., New-on-T"—I have compared those addresses with the undoubted writing of Davitt, and I believe them, without a doubt, to be in his handwriting—there is the word "mail" on three of the cards, in a different handwriting—here are six other cards, No. 9 to 14 inclusive, No. 9 is addressed to "Mr. Richard Cunningham, Mayne St., Boyle, Co. Roscommon, Ireland;" No. 10, to "Mr. John Flannery, general merchant, Ballyhaddareen, Mayo, Ireland;" No. 11 "J. Jas. White, Esq., of London, Burgon's Hotel, Ath-lone" No. 12 to "Miss Margaret Delmere, Castlereagh;" No. 13 to "Messrs. McDonnell, general merchants, Tuam, Gal way;" and 14 to "Mrs. Cecilia Higgins, Newport, Mayo, Ireland, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Dublin"—I believe all those to be in Davitt's handwriting—I also believe these two delivery orders, dated 16th March, to be in Davitt's handwriting, except the receipts; this card, No. 4, and the paper, No. 2, I also believe to be in Davitt's hand-writing; the whole of it, including the signature "Benjamin Richards"—I believe the whole of these documents are in the same handwriting—I should perhaps have had a difficulty in taking any one singly, but taking them collectively I have no doubt whatever in tracing the handwriting—the endorsement "Wm. Roberts," on the bank post-bill I also believe to be in Davitt's handwriting—here is a letter, No. 1, said to be found upon a person named Forrester, I believe that also to be in Davitt's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">The Witness pointed out to the Jury some of the peculiarities in the forma<lb></lb>tion of the letters upon which he founded his opinion.</hi>)</p>

I was at one time an officer in the Federal Army, in America—I left it in 1865—I became a member of the Fenian Confederation in 1862, and remained so till 1866—an organization of the Fenian conspiracy existed in New York and in several parts of America, and meetings were held at which I was present—the object of the con<lb></lb>spiracy was to overthrow Her Majesty's Government in Ireland, and esta<lb></lb>blish an Irish republic—an oath was administered to the members, at first—I swore it—it was to be faithful to the Fenian organization, and to take up arms, when required, for the establishment of this republic in Ireland—the organization was very extensive in America—the head quarters were in New York, and there were branches at different cities throughout the United States, with state centres as the heads of them—I was sent to Ireland in 1865, by John Mahoney, who was then the head of the Fenian organization in America—the Fenian organization existed at that time in Ireland, and the head centre of all, Stephens, was in Dublin, and the organi<lb></lb>zation was ready to fight at any time if he gave the word—the organization extended to England—at the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, in the early part of 1866, all the prominent leaders were sent to England, to Manchester and Liverpool, and likewise to Scotland—we had frequent meetings in Liverpool, at different public-houses, at which I was</p>

               <p>present—money was collected at those meetings to carry on the organization, is well as to buy arms—arms were procured from Leeds, Birmingham, and ill the manufacturing towns in England, bought with the money collected by the Fenians—I knew Colonel Burke; it was his function to buy arms—a great quantity were bought—arms were sent to Ireland, and seized—some were sent by the Fenian organization in England to Ireland—this went on in 1866, and up to March, 1867—in February, 1867, an attempt was made to seize the arms in Chester Castle; the mail train from London to Holyhead was to be seized as it was passing Chester, the telegraph wires were to be torn, and the rails taken up—the arms taken at Chester Castle were to be put in the train and taken to Holyhead, where the mail-boat was to be seized, and the arms put in it, and taken to some port in Ireland, not Dublin—I gave information, and that enterprize was disconcerted—many Fenian meetings were held at Liverpool in February, 1867—a man named Flood was one of the leaders in the attempt on Chester Castle—he has since been convicted at Dublin—he was acting at that time in getting men from Birkenhead and other places, in company with Captain McCafferty—Flood got fifteen years, and McCafferty was sentenced to be hanged, but his sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life—it was supposed that as many as 1,200 Fenians were to surprise Chester Castle, but I did not go to Chester; I only went to Birkenhead—I saw as many as 600 going from the Liverpool district—the night before they started, it was expected that there would be as many as 1200 or 1400—I think the attempt was on 11th February, it was on a Monday—Fenian meetings were held at this time in Liverpool, at Mullins's beer-house, in Birehfield Street—I know Davitt—I gave his description before he was arrested—he has lost one hand—I was asked about him by Mr. Williamson, and I gave his description, and said that he had only one arm—I saw him at public-houses in Liverpool at the time of the Chester rising, and at different Fenian meetings—I cannot say whether I saw him the day after the attack on Chester Castle, but it was immediately after—meetings were held every day until we went to Ireland—Mullins's house was full at those meetings, up stairs and down—these meetings consisted entirely of Fenians—McCafferty and Flood were there; Captain Deasy, who was arrested at Manchester, and several others, about thirty altogether, all American officers—Captain Dohany, of the American army, was also there—he has not been tried—he has gone to America—Colonel Burke was there—he is now undergoing his sentence—the subject of discussion at those meetings was the loss of not having taken Chester Castle, and making arrangements for the rising of the night of 5th March, in Ireland—that meeting lasted, very likely, three or four hours—Davitt was there the whole time—I saw him there about three times altogether—I have seen him twice since—the meetings were all one as prominent as the other—there were three meetings at the same place—some of the people there were the same, and some were not—the subject of discussion was just the same as the first, a rising which was contemplated in different parts of Ireland, on the night of 5th March, that was arranged at that meeting—I did not know what Davitt was at that time—I did not inquire—I know he was well known by the members, he would not be allowed in company if he was not a prominent man—these meetings were only of leaders from the different centres, from Runcorn, and different places round Liverpool—a good many towns in England had their organisations—the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Taylor Street, Lower Broughton Street, Manchester—I know Davitt—I knew him in April; he was introduced to me as a hawker in fire arms—I purchased of him three revolvers and 100 cartridges—I was going to America, and I was told that I could buy them cheaper here than I could in America—I was going to Philadelphia—I had a father and sisters there—I paid 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the revolvers, he wanted 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down before I got them—I left them in Mrs. Geoghan's house, where I was lodging, at 43, George Leigh Street—I owed her some money—I had borrowed some money, and I had missed paying two weeks rent; I owed her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have paid her since—I did not get the revolvers, I applied to her for them.</p>

               <p>to make a present of the other, and to dispose of the third to friend there—the prisoner told me they were No. 12 revolvers—I was told it was a general thing for every person in America to carry a revolver—after leaving Mrs. Geoghan, I went to lodge at 8, Harrad Street—I did not tell her what I was going—I left the revolvers behind me—I was once in the Volunteer Artillery, at Manchester—I did not go away and carry off my carbine and accoutrements—I never received them—I swear that—I left the force without getting them—I was born in Bristol, of Irish parents.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Willington-on-Tyne—I know Davitt—I bought some revolvers of him, as near as I can remember, about eighteen months ago—I bought either seven or nine, I don't remember which—I did not buy them for myself, but for Father Sharpies, the parish priest of Willing. ton—I think he wanted them in consequence of some Catholic priets in the neighbourhood being robbed some few weeks before, and he wanted them as a protection for his own house—I can't tell whether he wanted them all for himself—I think the houses of five parish priests were broken into that winter—I know there were some; I saw it in the paper, and I have been in the houses soon after; there was Canon Bewick, of North Shields, for one, Mr. Brown, of Howden, and others, and some money was taken away—I remember Mr. Murphy preaching; some of the robberies were before that, and some after, but I think most of them before—Davitt gave me his address, 6, Wilkinson Street, Haslingden, Manchester; he was introduced to me as a hawker by my brother, John Connell, who went to America scon after—Davitt said I had to pay him in advance for them for fear when they came they might not be taken, and he might be at the loss of them if they were not—I am a copper extractor, at present in the em-ployment of Mr. Cook, a lead and silver merchant, at Howden and Wil-ington.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>) When Davitt was working for my father he generally commenced at 9 o'clock on Monday, and 7 o'clock other days—he had not carried out letters for a long time—he generally left at 7 o'clock in the evening, on Saturday at 2 o'clock—I think the last train left Haslingden at 8.16—I scarcely think that would run through Liverpool; I fancy not—I think the last train for Liverpool was between 5 and 6 o'clock, that would go to Accrington and Preston, or you could go from Haslingden to Manchester, and from there to Liverpool—the first train dowan in the morning was somewhere about 8 o'clock; from Liverpool I</p>

               <p>think it was 10.13; there are two routes from Liverpool to Haslingden, one by way of Manchester, and another by way of Preston—there are several trains in the course of the day both there and back—I am almost sure that the first train from Liverpool to Haslingden is 10.13—the last train would be between 8 and 9 o'clock—"Tillet" is printing generally upon linen we were only occasionally doing that—when Davitt was not doing that he would be in the office, doing odd jobs, anything almost—tillet work was done by the day—he was not allowed any special holiday, we have no fixed time; if he wanted a day he could have got it; he did not that I know of; if he was away for a day or half a day I should miss him, but not think anything at all about it—I would not undertake to say that on any particular day in 1867 he might not have been away for half a day or a whole day—it was his duty to carry the mail bag to meet the train from Haslingden to Manchester at 10.13; that is the train coming in from Liverpool—if he was not there my father as a rule would do it for him, he did it sometimes; there was only that one mail bag to be carried; there was one from Manchester at 5 o'clock, but the letter carrier fetched that—Davitt took the morning one because the letter carriers were out with their letters; sometimes another man might do it, I will not be certain.</p>

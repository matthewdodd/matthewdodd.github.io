               <p>Q. I should rather have thought if there was nothing valuable in it he would have returned it?</p>
               <p>Dobbs. I cannot tell what thoughts he had about it; he did return it me; then he asked me if I had any valuable pieces in the purse; I told him he had got my all and was welcome to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about returning them if there were?</p>
               <p>Dobbs. He said he would return them; I told him he had got my all; he said he was in distress; I told him what I had he was welcome to; then said he this is not all, and I think shook the purse; I said, then search my pockets and welcome; he turned back again and put his hands across my breeches pocket; I had about three-pence halfpenny in my pocket, which he felt; he put his hand across my waistcoat to feel for my watch; he did not put his hand into my pocket, nor ask me for my watch.

This man that was robbing me, said to his partner, d - n your eyes, if you use the young man ill, I will shoot you dead; I begged him not to let my partner be hurt; he said he should not; he said go on, if you turn again I will shoot you, if you don't you shall not be hurt; I walked gently on; that was all that passed between the man and me.</p>

               <p>Dobbs. The man was about that man's size, but I cannot swear positively; from the appearance and from the voice that appears to be the very man.</p>

               <p>Dobbs. I believe I asked him if he remembred what sort of a purse it was, and so did Justice Addington; he said it was either a purse or a linen bag, and that he threw it away; I took out the purse I had in my pocket, and asked him if he knew any thing of the purse, and whether it was like the purse I had in my pocket; he said he had done it away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of that man?</p>

               <p>Q Do you take the prisoner to be the man?</p>

               <p>Q. The other man seemed shorter than him and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. Yes, he was shorter than him I am sure, and seemed to be shorter than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take upon you to say positively he was shorter, or that he appeared to you to be shorter?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I am sure he is shorter.</p>
               <p>Q Are you sure he was shorter than the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. He appeared to me to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. Yes, he stood before me sometime.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, is that the man or not?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I do not think he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you took sufficient notice of the shorter man to know him again if you was to see him?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I knew him so far as to prosecute him and he was convicted.</p>
               <p>Q Was you here at the trial of Madan?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. Yes, he was cast upon my indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take upon you to say that you swore to the other man positively that you knew his face?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070035"></xptr>Beckenham. He appeared very much like the man; the coat that I lost was upon Madan's back at the time of his being taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see only two men?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. No; they pushed me about the length of this table before they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. They were a good while with you?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. Yes, about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take particular notice of Madan's face?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I took particular notice of the men, their appearance, their size, and make, but could not see a great deal of their face.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think upon looking at that man?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. He might be there for what I know, but he does not look like the man that came before me.</p>
               <p>Q The question is, whether you believe that to be one of the two men or not?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I do not believe he is one of the two men, because the man that came to me first was a very lusty man, and the other was considerably shorter; Brannon is taller than this.</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I believe Brannon is something taller, but there is but very little difference.</p>
               <p>Q. You do believe this is not the man?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I believe so.</p>

            . Have you seen Brannon in Newgate?</p>
               <p>Dobbs. Yes, after the last time I was before the Justice I came to look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. What say you as to the difference in height between this prisoner and Brannon?</p>
               <p>Dobbs. There is not a great deal of difference in the height; Brannon is a lustier man; there is a causeway at the place where we were robbed; the man might have some advantage in that.</p>

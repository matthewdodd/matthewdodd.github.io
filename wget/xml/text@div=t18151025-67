            . On the 29th of September, I saw the prisoner with several other persons; I saw them go into several shops. I was afraid of getting too near to them. I followed him into Wright's shop, and found a three shilling token in Wright's hand, which was tendered to him by the prisoner. I asked the prisoner if he had any more about him? he denied that he had. I found three other counterfeit tokens upon him, and some copper. The tokens are all counterfeit. (Tokens produced to the witness, and identified by him as found upon the prisoner.)</p>

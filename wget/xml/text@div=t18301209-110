On Wednesday night, the 1st of December, the prisoner, who was a stranger, was standing in the street, and I asked her to show me into Ratcliffe-highway- we were then at the corner of Bluegate-fields; we went to a public-house, kept by Mrs. Davis - I had twenty sovereigns in a purse in my left-hand breeches pocket; I did not go to any house with her, but we went down <placeName id="t18301209-110-crimeloc637">Gravel-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you been drinking before you went to Davis'? A. Yes, but I had not lost my recollection; I had been with two cousins, a male and a female - I have said that the person who took my money had a black cloak on - I was told I had charged a man named Haggerty with robbing me, but if I said any thing it was the effect of the liquor; I do not know whether I charged a man named Melville with robbing me; I might have done so - I took a small glass of gin at Davis'.</p>

            . I am landlady of the Marquiss of Wellington, High-street, Shadwell. I remember the prosecutor and the prisoner being at my house - they had a quartern of gin, and a small glass of brandy; the prosecutor first took out some silver to pay for it, and then he took out a purse with a quantity of gold in it - he wanted me to change a sovereign; I said as he had silver I would not - he put it into his purse and put the purse into his left-hand trousers pocket; they went away together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could not see his pocket? A. No, it was below the counter - he seemed capable of conducting himself as far as I saw; the purse might have fallen, but it was not likely.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On that Wednesday evening I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock: they were coming up Ratcliff-highway, and the prosecutor was upbraiding her for not letting him go - when he saw me, he said "Officer, I must throw myself under your protection, this woman won't let me go;" she had hold of his clothes -I said, "You had better go about your business, and let this man alone;" I asked him where he wanted to go - he said"To Old Gravel-lane;" I said I would show him the way - she followed; and said "Just let me speak to him" - and she whispered something in his ear, but she did not do any thing then; he got on to the corner of a turning, and said to me "Will you have a glass of grog?" I then saw that he was in liquor - he pulled out a leather purse, and said"You think I am deceiving you; but I have money" - and he shook the purse; I took him over the bridge, and he said "Will you see me on board my ship?" I said, "I can't, unless you go to the inspector and ask his leave: if you go there and are in liquor they will send you to the watch-house" - he felt horrified at that, and said "I will go by myself" - I said "Go on, and if I meet the woman I will turn her back" - I did not meet her - after the prosecutor had shown me his purse, he put it into his pocket and buttoned it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dark when he showed it you? A. It was under a lamp; the way we went, and I returned, was the only way to get over the bridge; I did not meet the prisoner - it is a place of great thoroughfare but not much frequented by women of the town.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never told her what was the charge? A. No, the two men asked me, but I said I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090060"></xptr>not know - I was not at the station when the prosecutor stated that it was a man who had robbed him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prosecutor had charged a man with it the first night? A. Yes, a man named Haggerty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman at a draper's shop, 386, Bethnal Green Road—on 14th January the child Susan Williams came in for three yards of calico, which came to 5 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she tendered a bad fourpenny piece and three halfpence—I told her that it was bad and to go home and tell her mother to come, as she said that her mother gave it to her—she left and did not return—I kept the money—I had seen her before on 8th January at Wilderspin's potato-stall outside our shop, who handed me a bad fourpenny piece—I bent it and gave it back to him—I saw the child again on January 17th in Maple Street, and the mother too, and her child just outside the street-door—Susan went to Mr. Muller's door, and I followed her and spoke to Mr. Muller—I looked in his till and found some coppers and a bad shilling, which I marked—the constable has it and the fourpenny piece.</p>

I live at 69, Cheshire Street, and sell tobacco—about three weeks before Christmas the prisoner Susan came in for some tobacco; and tendered a fourpenny piece in payment—I said that it was a bad one; she said she would take it back to her mother, but I kept it, and the prisoner Ann came and said that she wanted her money back, what did I keep it for—I gave it to her—the girl had been there six weeks before for half a pint of ale and gave me a sixpence—I put it in my pocket where there was no other silver, and gave her the change—five minutes after she had left I found it was bad, and gave it to Warner.</p>

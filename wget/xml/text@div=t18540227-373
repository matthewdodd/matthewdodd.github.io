                  </hi>. I live in Eyre-street, Fitzroy-square. On 21st Jan., Simpson came, about a quarter past 5 o'clock, for a bonnet shape—she gave me in payment a half crown—I took it in the parlour; I thought it was not good; I gave it to my sister, she thought it was good; I left it with her—I gave the prisoner change, and she left the shop—I afterwards got the half crown again—my sister left it on the table, and I took it up—I tried it, and bent it—I put it in a drawer, where there was no other money—on Wednesday, 25th Jan., the prisoner came for a bonnet shape again, and she gave me a half crown; I looked at it and saw it had much the same look as the other—it looked dull—I rang the bell, and called my brother down—he took the half crown to the public house, he brought it back, threw it on the counter and said it was bad—Simpson was at the counter at the time—the half crown was bent at that time—I told my brother it was the same woman that was there on the Saturday, and told him to fetch a policeman—he went, but could not find a policeman—he went a second time, and when he was gone the second time the prisoner Day came into the shop—he asked Simpson how much longer she was going to keep him there—she said she had given a bad half crown—he said if his wife had bought any<lb></lb>thing he would pay for it; and he took out a shilling, I believe it was, but I declined to take it, and they both went out—I put the second half crown in the drawer with the other one—the officer came to the shop with the prisoners the same evening, and I gave him the two half crowns—I had not left the shop in the interim—no one else had put anything in that drawer or taken anything out—there was other money in the till, but not in the drawer.</p>

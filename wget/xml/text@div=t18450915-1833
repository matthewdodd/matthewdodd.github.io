                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in the Market-place, at Norwich. On the 25th of Aug., about eleven o'clock at night, I was walking down Threadneedle-street—I was accosted by the prisoner, who had a shabby genteel man with her—she came to me in a very rode way, and snatched at my watch, but could not get it—the man walked off almost immediately—he had come close to my side with her, but I do not think he touched me—the prisoner continued dancing and singing very rode airs all the time I was going along Threadneedle-street—I pushed her off several times, and after five or eight minutes I got rid of her, and bid her good night—the policeman was opposite, and told me to take care of my money, as I was in queer company—after I had got ten or fifteen yards I began to feel for my money, and it was gone—I fancied I had taken my purse out at the Bull in Bishopsgate-street, where I had been, and had left it there—I had seen it safe when I had left the Queen's Arms, which was three quarters of an hour before—I had seven sovereigns and six half-sovereigns in it—I followed the prisoner a little way up a court, and examined my pockets—she was afterwards taken by the policeman, and when he asked me if my money was safe, I said it was gone—ten or twelve minutes had elapsed between the singing and dancing and my missing my money—when the policeman took her she dropped the purse containing the seven sovereigns and six half-sovereigns on his boot—I had not charged her with it before, as I was not positive where I had left it—this is my purse and money.</p>

I saw the prisoner that evening with a man, who left her, and then I saw the prosecutor with his hand on the prisoner—I looked them in the face, and they moved a few yards to the corner of Broad-street—I heard the prosecutor say "Good night"—he went in the middle of the road, and the prisoner went up the court, which has no thoroughfare—the prosecutor made a stop, felt his pockets, and rushed up the court—they were there two or three minutes,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184509150036"></xptr>
               <p>and I heard him say, "What are you going to do now?"—the prisoner said, "Sit down"—I went up the court and said, "Is your property safe?"—he said, "Yes"—he came out of the court—I brought the prisoner out, and was holding her—he was feeling his pockets, and then he said, "For God's sake hold her fast, she has got my purse"—he came up and said to her, "Give me my purse, or I will give you in charge"—I let go of her left arm, and seized her by her right hand—I then heard something, and felt something fall on my boot—I stooped down and took up this purse, which has been sworn to by the prosecutor.</p>

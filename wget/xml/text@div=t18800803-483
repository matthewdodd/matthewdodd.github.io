                  </hi>. I lived on the 23rd July at the Golden Cross Hotel, Charing Cross—on the 22nd July I was in Endell Street about midnight; I was talking to Margaret West—I had a watch and chain—some one snatched at the chain, and I fell down from the force of the blow or <hi rend="italic">grab</hi>—I did not see what became of the watch—I saw two or three persons but not their faces—one man was sentenced the following day at the police-court.</p>

I drank with Margaret West at several public-houses—I had a good deal; West had not so much—the watch was snatched very quickly—West had hold of my arm; she did not seize me round the waist nor hug me—I took out my watch in the public-house—Miss West and others saw it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 127, Stamford Street—on the 22nd July I with Mr. Spencer—I met him about 7 in the evening—I dined with him, and then I went with him to a music-hall in Holborn—I saw three rough men following us from the music-hall—Mr. Spencer was a little tipsy—one was convicted on the following day of stealing a watch; the two others were the prisoners—the one who is sentenced said, "Sir, you have dropped something," and snatched the watch—part of the chain went too, and part was left hanging—Russell was standing on one side, and White-hand on the other—both ran up the street—we were both knocked down—I was quite sober—I got up and ran after the thief, and saw him give the watch to Whitehand—I held Whitehand, who was walking off with the watch—I said, "Give me that watch"—he said, "I have got no watch" and he pulled the arms off my dress, and struck me on the nose, which caused a black eye—I got away—I afterwards met the man who is con<lb></lb>victed, and gave him into custody—I gave a description of the prisoners, and afterwards identified them at Bow Street—I am sure they were the men; I saw their faces.</p>

I received a description of two men from Miss West—I went to Oatskin Court, London Road, on 24th July—I found Whitehand on the first-floor back—his wife and two other women were there, not Russell—I said, "I want you for being concerned with Mullins (<hi rend="italic">The man who was convicted</hi>) in stealing a watch in Endell Street on the 22nd"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—his wife said, "Peter shall suffer too, as he had a share of the money"—Whitehand then said, "I shan't go with you unless you go to Westminster for Peter"—I took him to Bow Street—Russell was taken on the second-floor in the same house—he was charged with the same offence—he said, "I know nothing about it, but I will go with you"—both prisoners were put with 12 other men at Bow Street, and identified by Miss West without the slightest hesitation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 12 men were similar in appearance to the prisoners—I was not standing close to Whitehand, nor Miss West, nor Russell—Miss West did not walk up and down; she looked at the prisoners about two minutes.</p>

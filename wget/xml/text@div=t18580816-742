                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 36, Wellington Street, Clerkenwell. On the night of 18th July last, about half-past 10, I was going along Victoria Street with my father and sister—my father is a very elderly man, turned 50—my sister and I each had hold of his arm—an elderly man and woman came up to us, the woman poked her head in my father's face, and said something to him; I did not hear what exactly—she said she knew him—I told her she was mistaken, that he was my father, and we were going home—I was immediately attacked by three persons, the prisoners are two of them; the female prisoner commenced beating me very violently about the head—I had my shawl across my arm, and she began to drag at it—she beat me very dreadfully indeed for some time; I could not see what the others were doing, for the two women were beating me at once—I saw the male prisoner knock my father down and kick him—the female prisoner tore my bonnet off my head, and completely destroyed it. I held my shawl until I was beat insensible, and then it was taken from me; when I recovered my senses, my shawl was gone—I saw it again in the policeman's hands on Monday morning; it was worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that these two prisoners are entire strangers to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: I had never seen either of them before. My father is not here—he was not examined before the Magistrate; he was very ill on the Monday, and was not called up—I was perfectly sober, and so was my sister—my father had been out all day, and had had a glass or two of liquor—I am not aware that the male prisoner ever lodged with a cousin of mine. This beating and fighting lasted about half-an-hour, as near as I can recollect—it was all on one side, for I had no power to give a blow back, nor had my sister or my father—I do not know whether the prisoners were drunk, they did not appear so—no policeman came up for half-an hour; the fire engine had gone along a little while before that, and that had attracted the policemen's attention, and the street was very lonely—directly I screamed, a policeman came to my assistance. The elderly man and woman came up first; they did not commence the row, they merely spoke, and then we were attacked by these people. The shawl was afterwards found in the ruins. I am quite sure I never heard of these people before—I have no cousin who keeps a lodging house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 21, Wellington Street, Clerkenwell. On the night of 18th July, about half-past 10 o'clock, I was going along Victoria Street, with my father and sister—an old woman came up and spoke to my father; I did not hear what she said. I asked if she knew my father, and she began to use foul language—the two prisoners and some others came up—the female prisoner struck me, and threw me into the road; I screamed for help, and the witness Mr. Chamberlain came to my assistance—I saw the male prisoner strike my father and kick him—I saw my sister struck by a woman not in custody, and also by the female</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160019"></xptr>
               <p>prisoner—after she had struck me she dragged my mantle off, and when Mr. Chamberlain came up she threw it at my feet—I saw her and another woman dragging at my sister's shawl, which she had on her arm—I did not see them take it—I went and assisted in lifting my father up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long before the prisoners came up did the old woman come up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 3 minutes—no blow was struck by either party before the prisoners came up; there was an old man with her—they went away as these people came up—the female prisoner struck me, and I screamed for help, and the old man and woman were gone then—I did not hear the prisoners ask what was the matter—I did not see my sister drag the female prisoner's shawl off, nor did I do it—I knew nothing of the prisoners before. I had no money about me, nor had my sister; my father had—he was the worse for liquor—he did not strike any one, he was too overpowered to do that; nor did any of us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch jeweller, of 30, Garnault-place, Clerkenwell. On 18th July, about half-past 10, or a little later, I was coming up Victoria-street, and noticed a disturbance on the opposite side of the way—I went across, and saw the female prisoner strike the last witness off the kerb into the road—I caught her, put her back, and went further into the crowd; and the two prisoners were knocking and beating the father and sister about—the father went down, and the male prisoner kicked him. In the scuffle there was a shawl lost, but who took it I know not. I called the police; No. 223, I believe, first came up, he took the female prisoner away; and No. 224 found the scarf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose there was a regular row between all these people? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a fight, what you might call a <hi rend="italic">scrimmage</hi>—the two witnesses were being knocked about—their bonnets were torn off their heads, and their mantles taken from their shoulders—they were not assaulting the other parties—of course they tried to take their own part. I heard nothing particular said, there was too much confusion. I did not see either of the witnesses trying to pull off the female prisoner's shawl.</p>

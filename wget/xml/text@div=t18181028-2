I called out Stop thief! the watchman came to my assistance, I then saw the prisoner run from the people, and turn up Scotland-yard, I followed, but returned to my wife.

No; I received a very severe injury, which prevented my going before the magistrate the next day, but I went the day after. I never authorized any one to inform the prisoner I would make it up for a 1l.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the alarm, and ran across the street; Little said he had been robbed of his watch, I saw the prisoner run from him, he was about eight yards from him, he ran down Scotland-yard - I lost him-the other watchman said he thought he had concealed himself; I found him in a coach-house in the yard, and charged him with the robbery - He denied it. I found nothing on him. As soon as it got daylight I went to the place where I took him-the other watchman, Brewer, found a watch-case about twenty yards from where I took the prisoner, and in the direction he had ran.</p>

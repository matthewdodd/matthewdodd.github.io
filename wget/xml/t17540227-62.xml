             took hold on my hand, and asked me in a loving manner if I had been throwing at cocks, and whether I would give her and the other a glass of wine. I went with them to an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175402270038"></xptr> house in Wine-Office-Court; the other staid below while I went up stairs with Braseel. She called for a pint of wine, sat down, and pulled me on her lap, and asked me if I would go to bed. I said no. The maid brought the wine up, I paid a shilling for it. Braseel gave me a great many fine words, which I can't express now, and wanted to feel my private parts; she then took out twopence halfpenny (which was all the money I had left after paying for the wine) and kept it; she took the wine and bottle and would not let me drink; we went down stairs, and she let me go out into the court. I stood a little while at the door; because I had spent so much money, and lost the rest, I thought it was not right. The two prisoners came to me there, and fell to hugging me and giving me fine words; then Burton took off my hat and gave it to the other, who put it behind her; then one said to the other, The young man is in liquor, let's loosen his stock; upon which they took it off, and I saw it in Burton's hand afterwards. They then took hold of me, one by one hand and the other by the other, and took out my metal sleeve buttons. I then was afraid they would strip me, and seeing my hat under Braseel's apron took it away by force. They then made the best of their way off, but I went after them for my things, and the prisoners were taken in Fleet-street. I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said that the prosecutor met them, that he was in Liquor, and pulled them about; they were, they said, afraid of him, that he struck them, and would not let them go one way or other; upon which they charged the watch with him, as he did with them.</p>

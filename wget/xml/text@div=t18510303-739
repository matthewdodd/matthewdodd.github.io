                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I was sent by Mr. Austin to fetch his tools—the prisoner went with me—as we went he left me, and went in a public-house; I went on—he then passed me on the road, and got to the beer-shop before I did—I brought two baskets of tools away, which the landlord gave me—there were all sorts of tools—the prisoner was in the house, and had began to work—he came away with me as far as Tottenham Court-road—I carried both the baskets—I had three planes and one square in one of them—when we got to Tottenham Court-road, we went into a public-house—I put the baskets on a tub that was there—I was talking to a man, and when I looked round the prisoner was gone, and I missed the three planes and square—in consequence of information I went to a pawnbroker's in Tottenham Court-road—I found the three planes and square there—I had not given the prisoner any authority to pawn them.</p>

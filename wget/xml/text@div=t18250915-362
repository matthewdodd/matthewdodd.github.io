            . On the 14th of August I was on Snow-hill. I saw the prisoner there, but did not see him do any thing; there were four or five boys together, and I saw one of them take the handkerchief from Mr. Mullett's pocket, but I cannot swear that it was the prisoner; about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, a gentleman came and gave a handkerchief into my hands; I did not know that it was the handkerchief taken from Mr. Mullett; I seized the prisoner, because I thought he was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150138"></xptr>one who took the handkerchief; I saw him near him; I seized the prisoner at the time it was drawn; I signed this deposition at the Mansion House (looking at it); I did swear that the prisoner was the person, but I was sick, and had not been in such a situation before; I did not know what I was about; but, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I did wrong, and I am very sorry; I have seen the person since who did take it - it was not the prisoner; the reason I swore at the Mansion House that it was him, was I thought it was him, but now I cannot say, (from there being a crowd at the time of the robbery,) that it was him; I have since seen the person who I can swear committed the robbery, and I cannot now take upon me to swear against the prisoner.</p>

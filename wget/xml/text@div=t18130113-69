             came in the shop, and asked me where a piece of black crape was that he left on the counter. I did not miss any thing. I told him, I saw it just before I served the customer, meaning the prisoner. We made search for the crape, and could not find it. There had been no other person in the shop. My young man pursued the prisoner, and in ten minutes he brought him back. and when the prisoner was brought back he had two shawls and a remnant of crape. We had not missed the shawls until the prisoner came back.</p>
               <p>Stepard. When I went through the shop, I saw the prisoner purchasing a handkerchief of Mr. Powell; when I returned I missed a piece of crape that was laying on the counter. I went out in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him near three hundred yards from our house. I desired him to come back with me. I told him there was a mistake in the things that he had bought. He would not come back, but run away; I followed him, and overtook him when he had run about sixty or seventy yards. He had a small bundle under his arm, which I wished him to give me. He would not. I insisted upon his going back with me. He attempted to untie the bundle. When I saw that he endeavoured to untie the bundle, I snatched it away, and took it to my master. The bundle contained two shawls, and the crape that I had missed.</p>
               <p>Q. You got him home - A. Yes, and I went for a constable, and gave him in charge. These are the shawls, and the craps; they are my master's property.</p>

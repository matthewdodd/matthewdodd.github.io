(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he said that the office of Mr. Hodgson, the treasurer of Queen Anne's bounty, did not open until eleven o'clock, and that it would be an accommodation to him if I would take my bill out of that receipt, and give him the change—the amount of my bill was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took it of him, and gave him the difference—there must have been gold and silver among what I gave him—I cannot say what coin it was—it must have been the coin of the realm—I know I gave him even the fractional penny—before twelve I presented it at Mr. Hodson's office, in Dean's-yard, Westminster—I did not get the money—I was told that mine was the seventh application.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am treasurer to the Governors of Queen Anne's bounty. Mr. Thomas produced this receipt to me on 11th April, 1849—the incumbent of Minster, in Kent, was at that time entitled to the sum speci<lb></lb>fied in the receipt, as a half-year's dividend—I did not know at that time that the prisoner was not entitled to it—he is incumbent of Minster—any person bringing a receipt signed by the incumbent would receive the money—the prisoner was not entitled to the sum mentioned in the receipt on 11th April, but I did not know it at that time; I know it now, I had a certificate from the Registrar of the diocese of Canterbury—I received a letter from the prisoner about half-past ten o'clock that morning, desiring me not to pay anybody—the writing of the letter is similar to the receipts which I have had from him before—I have never seen him write—I have acted on those receipts, and paid money on them, not to him personally, but to persons who have brought them from him—I have here two receipts in his handwriting—I have had no personal communication with the prisoner on the subject of those receipts, only by writing—he has answered one letter of mine—I have that answer here—that is the only letter I had from him, except the one I received on the morning of 11th April—I can say that money was paid on these receipts—I never had any complaint from the prisoner respecting the money so paid—this letter came by a messenger—there is no envelope to it—my office opens at ten in the morning—that is the usual hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to the Governors of Queen Anne's bounty. On 11th April the prisoner, for aught we then knew, was entitled to receive the sum named in this receipt—if nothing had occurred to prevent it I should have paid it—we have since paid the money to the sequestrators—I have never paid any of these sums to the prisoner personally—the first payment made to him was in Oct., 1847—he became Incumbent in the July previous—he was paid the half-year, due on 10th Oct., 1847—that was paid to his receipt, which is here—in April, 1848, another half-year became due, and for that half-year three receipts were presented; we paid one of the three, the first that was presented, the other two were rejected; then commenced a correspondence—Mr. Hodgson thought it a case that it was his duty to represent to the Archbishop of Canterbury—he did so, and at the same time he wrote to the Incumbent, and his answer is now in Mr. Hodgson's posses<lb></lb>sion—when letters are sent from our office they are put into the letter-box, and the messenger comes round at the close of the office, seals them, puts a stamp on them, and takes them to the post—that is the daily process—I am not able to say whether the letter addressed to the prisoner was put into the box—it was written by Mr. Hodgson.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> The answer has not a post-mark on it—it seems to have been enclosed in the envelope, which most likely was put into the waste-basket—I can positively swear that money has been paid on each of these receipts to the parties whose names are written on the back—there is a set form for these things issued by the office—that set form is copied most accurately in these receipts, in every way—they purport to be signed "Richard Child Willis, incumbent," and in the letter to Mr. Hodgson be signs himself R. C. Willis—subsequent to that correspondence, which was in April, 1848, we have paid one receipt to Dr. Willis' signature; that was at Michaelmas, 1848—I can hardly say that in doing so we acted on that letter—that was merely an explanation of why he passed three receipts before, but at the subsequent Michaelmas another half-year became due, and we paid it to his receipt, not with standing he had presented three on the previous Lady<lb></lb>day—we acted upon the letter as coming from him, and we paid one of his receipts afterwards—this is the letter we received from him in April, 1848—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To C. Hodgson, Esq.,—Vicarage, Minster, 17th April, 1848. Sir,—I was exceedingly grieved to find by your letter, which reached me on Saturday evening, that you should imagine I had done anything by which you should have been the sufferer; I can assure you, Sir, such was very far from being the case, inasmuch as one of the three receipts you mention had been actually paid as the bankers can testify, though the party who banded it in with others was quite unaware of the circumstance before it was presented; the others I was assured would not be presented at all, being, as I told the tradesmen, and positively believing it to be so, wrongly worded; I could be far more minute in this unfortunate affair, but as you require a statement by Tuesday, and I am perfectly overwhelmed with duty, I find it impossible to add more at present. I am, Sir, with the greatest possible regret at what has occurred, your faithful servant, R.C. Willis"—this other letter is the one we received on the Wednesday morning, 11th April—I believe it to be in the prisoner's writing—I also believe these two receipts to be the same handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"Tuesday evening, 10th April, 1849.

               <p>from a state of mind almost bordering upon insanity, I feel well assured that I have distributed to tradesmen more receipts for Queen Anne's bounty for the parish of Minster, in Kent, than one; I hope therefore that none will be attended to, for I have not been master of my own actions. I write this with the deepest concern, in much agony of mind. I have left Minster, nor will my health permit me to return. I am, Sir, yours, &amp;c., R.C. Willis.")</p>

The publican states that he gave me the shilling back, and I went away with it, and the shilling found upon me. If I had intended to defraud I should have got rid of it. The other publican states I gave his barmaid a shilling, and he broke it; and his witness states that he picked up a shilling from the floor, and he broke that, and you will find there is only one shilling broken. One of the constables stated that I was rolling about the street, and if that is not to be drunk, I don't know what is. As to the piece found in my boot, I don't know how it came there. I am not guilty, as I knew not what I was doing.</p>

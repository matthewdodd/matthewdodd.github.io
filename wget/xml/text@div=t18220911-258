            . I live at Chelsea; my father keeps a horse and cart. Hill came about half past eight o'clock, and asked for it to take some linen to Pimlico. My brother called me up; I put the horse in the cart, and drove as far as the Queen's Head - there two more men came up to the cart, and told me to go to the brick field. I turned round, and Tutton brought a bit of lead and put it in the cart. I said that was not linen, and I could not take it; and at that moment the witness came up, and they ran away. Tutton joined us in the brick field. Hill was not with him there; he stopped at the public-house.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the child after it had been found in the privy-it was in a very putrid state. I conceived it to be about a seven months' child. I cannot say whether it was or was not born alive-its nails were not perfect-that might be the case if it was born alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210017"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR.PLATT. It is not common for seven months' children to be born dead-it would not have been in so putrid a state in that short time if it had been born alive.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOX. I am a nightman. On the 17th of April, I was employed to empty the privy, and found a child there, wrapped up in a petticoat, and had a piece of worsted about its neck-there was nothing particular in the manner in which it was wrapped up.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN HUMPHRIES. I live in New-street, Mile End. The prisoner, Thompson, lodged with me: she took the room, in my house, with her husband, and lodged with me about a month. On the 14th of April, at half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I went out, and returned about nine o'clock for something that I had forgot. Thompson let me in - She appeared in a flurry - I asked if she was ill-she said she was not; but the woman who had slept with her the evening before, had been taken ill. I told her she had better send her home, as she was not my lodger-she said she was in the yard - I went there, and saw her standing by the water butt-it was the prisoner, Cornwall, with a pot in her hand - She seemed as if she was in great pain - I told her she was in labour, but she said, that she was not. I told her to go to her own home, as she did not lodge in my house - I asked Thompson if the woman was not in labour - She said there was not any thing at all that ailed her, only that she had caught a cold, and had been poorly in the night, which occasioned her to be in that state. Cornwall said she was going, and desired me not to talk harshly to her - She went away, and I saw no more of her - I followed Thompson up into her room-from what I saw there, I told her, that the woman had been in labour, when she replied, that it was not so - I went out, and came home about half-past five o'clock - I then went to the privy, and found it nearly full - I saw something had been thrown down, and told my husband of it - He went out, and found nothing there but some horse-hair - We went in search of Thompson, and found her in George-yard, Whitechapel - I asked her what was become of the young woman who was ill in the morning; she replied, that she had gone into the workhouse - I asked whether she was not in labour, and she replied, that the doctor was of opinion, that it was no such thing-my husband asked her who had thrown the horse-hair down the privy, and she replied, that it was herself - He said he hoped there was nothing else there-she left our house the next day - I saw the prisoners at the workhouse on the Friday morning-Cornwall was in bed-she called me to the bed-side, and told me, that the child was not alive when she threw it there-that was all I heard, there being so much noise. I said,"Sally, was the child alive?" and she answered me, No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. If she had been ill in the night, I must have heard it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Grand Surrey Canal Company. On the 6th of March my attention was called to the deals—there ought to have been forty-six—I found by the book there were forty<lb></lb>three deficient—I did not make the entry in the book, but I saw the deals after they were entered, and I had sold several parcels from that pile—there was a pile of 147, and fifty-five and forty-fix had been delivered—the rest, which had been sold to Mr. Scarf, remained—I saw them safe on the 4th of March, and missed forty-three of them on the 6th—I then went to look at sixteen which I had sold to Mr. Hinton, and out of tkem I missed four<lb></lb>teen—I missed in all fifty-seven planks and forty-three deals, eighty-four pieces in all—I went to Archer's Wharf, and saw a punt lying there, which I had seen the day before four or five ships dowa, and the eighty-three pieces of wood were on the brick-wall—they were the pieces I had seen safe on the premises of the Canal Company on the Tuesday before—I saw the prisoner shortly after, on Mr. Archer's wharf in custody—I said I was sorry to see him there—he said, "I only hired the punt for Johnson"—I knew the prisoner—I cannot tell whether he was employed on the water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman.

                  </hi>. I live at Dunstable, in Bedfordshire. On the 9th of November I was at Blackfriars-bridge, between one and two o'clock, and perceived a crowed pushing me—I heard some one say, "Push him up," or <hi rend="italic">"Shove</hi> him up"—I turned and saw the prisoner, and two other men, more respectably dressed than himself, were close to me—I looked at then very hard, and they at me—I shifted about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards—again was looking through the balustrades at the procession, and I felt some persons pushing on me, and I heard some one say, "Have you got it?"—another said, "You"—a third voice said, "Hand it over to me"—I felt my pocket, and my purse was gone—it contained 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—they were all sovereigns—I immediately turned round, and saw the same three men close to me again—the prisoner was one, and I am sure he was one of those I had seen before—I looked at them very hard, and they at me—they seemed as if they were in conversation, but seeing me look at them they dispersed—two went one way, and the prisoner the other—I followed close to his heels for a distance, expecting to see an officer, but not seeing one, I collared him, and accused him of picking my pocket—he said he had not, but finding I held him, he said, "Loose me, go with me, and you shall be all right, I have money in my pocket"—I told him I should not loose him till I had my money, I should either have him or my money—a struggle then ensued, and he threw himself out of any hands, but I immediately got hold of him again—at that time an officer came up, and I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Elizabeth Pettifer thus depos'd. I am a poor old Woman, that's true, tho' I have always taken an honest Care to get my Bread, but Misfortunes may happen to the best of us, and as it is my Case, I think this was a wicked Baggage to serve me as she did. For she comes to me one day, and tells me a fine Story, about a Gentleman that was dead, and said that he had left me a Pension, and had order'd me a Load of Coals, and 3 Pound of Candles, and 2 Loaf of Bread that would come in that Day, and besides that she had brought me a Guinea which she gave me, but I afterwards found it to be Brass, and she said that she must have half a Crown for the Clerk, and so she took my 2 Petticoats, and said she'd pawn them for half a Crown, and I let her take them, and she carry'd them quite away. The Prosecutor consenting that the Prisoner should have the Goods. The Jury <rs id="t17260114-21-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

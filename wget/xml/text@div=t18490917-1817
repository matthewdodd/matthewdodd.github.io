                  </hi>. I am single; I live at Footscray, in Kent. On Saturday night, 1st Sept., about a quarter to six o'clock, I was going home—I went into a beer-shop at Woolwich to see a young girl who lived there—I had a bundle with me, containing twelve yards of calico, six yards of print, and a shawl—I saw the prisoner in the beer-shop—he spoke to me three times,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170103"></xptr>
               <p>and I made him no answer—I did not know him before—we afterwards drank together—I left at a quarter-past six o'clock—he asked how far I had to go—I told him seven miles—he asked if he might go with me, and see me safe as far as Eltham—I consented, and we went on together—he asked me to go and hear a song at a public-house—I went—he called for some gin—we were there about half an hour—we afterwards went to another public-house, and had some gin there—we went on again for about two miles, and went across some fields—there is a footpath there—he wanted to take me along by the hedge, and said that was the way—I told him I would not go, but he took bold of me and pulled me along—he threw me down, and pulled up my clothes—he did nothing to his own clothes, but he tried to; a carriage came along, I hallooed, and he took my bundle and ran away with it—the carriage stopped there—it afterwards went on again—I went on the road—the prisoner came back again and took away my shawl which I had on my arm—I would not let it go at first, but he held up his fist at my face twice—he did not hit me—he then took my bonnet and shawl, and ran across the fields—I got into the road, two girls came up; I looked for a policeman—I found one, and told him about it—I saw nothing more of the prisoner till the Monday following—he was then in the barrack-room in custody—I have not seen anything of the things since—he appeared to be sober.</p>

On Saturday night, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, I saw the prosecutrix at the station at Eltham with out bonnet or shawl—she made some complaint—she was perfectly sober—I apprehended the prisoner on Monday morning at Woolwich barracks—he was in the guard-room, and was brought <hi rend="italic">out in custody</hi> for being absent from the garrison—the prosecutrix was with me, and gave him in charge—he asked me what it was all about, he did not know—I asked if he knew the female—he said yes, he had seen her before, he was in her company an hour and a half on Saturday night—I told him the charge at the station, and he did not deny it.</p>

On Sunday morning, 2d Sept., between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in High-street with a shawl on his neck, a bonnet on his head, and a bundle, containing a piece of print and a piece of calico—I asked where he got those things from—he said he had been with a young woman, named Gipsey, during the night, and she had run away from him drunk, and they belonged to her, that he had been living with her for two years—I believed him, and did not take the property—he was sober.</p>

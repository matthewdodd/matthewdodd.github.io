In the month of June last, in con<lb></lb>sequence of the non-arrival of a remittance from Florence, I was desirous of obtaining 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a temporary purpose—I communicated that wish to Mr. Orsi, who is acting as my secretary—on the 10th of June I received this letter by the post—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I saw the prisoner the day afterwards, and he told me he was the man that written to me the day before—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Private—Cornhill, June 10th, 1847—Mr. Pollard presents respect to Prince Napo<lb></lb>lean, and Mr. P. will do himself the honour of calling upon the Prince to-morrow morning at twelve o'clock on private business. Prince Napolean.") On the following day he came to my house in King-street, and introduced himself as the writer of that letter—he was at that time a perfect stranger to me—he told that he had heard I wished to have some money; and that he had 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to offer if I wished it—I told him I was not quite sure that I should want it; that I was about selling out several shares in railways, which I had at that moment—I asked him how he knew I wanted money—his answer was that he was a man of business; that it was his busi<lb></lb>ness to procure money for noblemen; and if such was the case that they always came to him—I asked him about the terms, and he was to take five per cent.—I asked his address—he told me he was living at No. 10, Essex-street, Strand—I then told him to come back on the following Monday, that would be the 14th—he produced some stamps to me, and asked me to sign my name to them—I declined doing so—it was on that occasion that I asked him for his address—he gave it me and then left, arranging to come on the Monday following—he came on that day, the 14th, at twelve o'clock—he began to speak about the commercial crisis, and told me that money was very rare at that time—I told him if he did not like to finish the business I did not care about it—he said he had not altered his mind, and that he had the two bills in his pocket—he then produce two pieces of paper with writing on them—there was no writing on them on the first occasion—they were then blank.</p>

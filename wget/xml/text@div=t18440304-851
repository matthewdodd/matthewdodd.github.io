                  </hi>. I am a feather-bed manufacturer, and live at Finchley-common—I have premises in Newton-street, Holborn. The younger prisoner has been in my eldest son's employ for three years and a half,</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 1st of March, about four o'clock, I saw the younger prisoner in the yard—I saw him take up a piece of paper—it had the appearance of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, because I saw some writing and printing—I did not read it—Mr. Spencer had driven off about fire minutes before—I told the prisoner he had picked up a note—he said he had not—I asked him to let me look at it, and he squeezed it up in his hand—he then went to the gate to go home—I stopped him at the gate, and wanted him to let me look at it—he would not—he tried to push me away—I would not let him—he went into the warehouse, came out again, and then went in again, and went away with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Adcock, and live at the Central School House, Plumstead—my husband is a bricklayer—on Thursday, 16th July, we closed the house about 11 o'clock, but left the kitchen window open about two inches—I came down about 5.20 next morning, and found the window wide open, and missed a coat, waistcoat, pair of boots, a shirt, and two dresses—they were safe the night before—I went to the police<lb></lb>station, and gave information—in consequence of what I was told, I went there again on the 21st—I saw the male prisoner in custody, and found he was wearing some of my husband's property—I afterwards saw the female prisoner, and found that she was wearing a petticoat and brooch belonging to me—the value of the property stolen was about 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I apprehended Smith on 21st July—he was wearing the boots I now produce—I said I should take him for being a deserter—after I got him into the street I told him that he would be charged with breaking into a number of houses in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of Plumstead—I took the boots from him—he said he bought them from some man on the Common—they were identified by the last witness—I told the female prisoner she would be charged with being concerned with the man in stealing a quantity of property—when she was in the dock the brooch was identified by Mrs. Adcock, and she said it was given to her by Smith.</p>

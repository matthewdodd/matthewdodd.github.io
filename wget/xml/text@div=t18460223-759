                  </hi>. I am a plumber—I live in Patriot-row, in the parish of Bethnal-green—on the 25th of Feb. my attention was called to my shop-window, by my daughter, about five minutes after six o'clock in the evening—I found the window was broken—I had some brass metal taps in the window inside the shop—the window being broken would enable a person to get his hand in and take the taps, if he had put his arm in the whole length—I missed them—I had seen them safe about half-past four o'clock—I ran out, and went round the corner—I there saw the prisoner, with a blue bag on his back—I am sure he is the man—I put my hand on the bag, and felt one end of the taps—I laid hold of him, and said, "I want you"—he said, "You b----r, I want you," and hit me three or four times under the ear—I have not been well since—I said, "I will never leave you," and he struck me in the stomach, which took away my breath—I kept the bag, but he got away—a young man pursued him with me when I got my breath, and we took him.</p>

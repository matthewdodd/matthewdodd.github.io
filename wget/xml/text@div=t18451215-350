                  </hi>. I live at Newington; the prisoner was in my service. On the 24th of Nov., about eleven o'clock in the morning, my wife put a sovereign and a half into a drawer—I was in the room—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and ten sovereigns in the drawer—my wife locked it, and took away the key—between twelve and one a gentleman called, and I asked my wife for the key of the drawer—I went to it, but a person came, and I was called out—my wife afterwards asked me for the key—I said I must have left it in the drawer—it was looked for, and was missing—I afterwards opened the drawer—a sovereign and a half sovereign were gone—I examined the prisoner's box—I found a sovereign and a half sovereign in it, and gave her into custody—the sovereign found in her box was a King William sovereign, which was the same as the one I gave my wife—the prisoner had no means of getting a sove<lb></lb>reign—I took her in when her mother turned her out of home—I allowed her no wages—I said I would buy her things.</p>

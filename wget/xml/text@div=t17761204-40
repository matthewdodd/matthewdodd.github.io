               <p>You are not sure as to the person? - It was the same that robbed me; I saw him stand a good while, and demand Mr. Sawbridge's money, with many oaths; I could hear him perfectly.</p>
               <p>Had he any weapon or pistol? - He had a pistol which he presented to my face, which I suppose he presented to the chaise; I did not see it; I saw my master's hand twice out of the window, and saw him hand something to the man, but I could not see what it was; I saw him take it; and the last thing that he said was, That will do; and wished Mr. Sawbridge a good night.</p>
               <p>Was any body with your master? - There was nobody in the chaise with him.</p>

               <p>How long did he stay with the carriage? - About six minutes, while my lord gave him the watch and the money; when he had got them, he said, Good night, catch me, hang me, and be d - d.</p>
               <p>How far was Gray off at that time? - About ten yards; when he and William came up, I told him I knew the man; that I had seen him at the Assize at Maidstone; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>To GRAY. When he left Mr. Sawbridge what did you hear him say? - I heard him say, He may send after me, and pursue me, and hang me as soon as he pleases, and be d - d.</p>

               <p>He knows he only swears against me for the money he will get by me; he is confident within himself that I am not the man. My Lord Mayor said he thought it was a person much less than me, and that he did not know that I was the person. There is a man now in Maidstone gaol has confessed the robbery. Barrett is as bad a man as can be.</p>

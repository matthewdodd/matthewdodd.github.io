About one o'clock in the morning of 21st of July I was passing St. Martin's church—the prisoner accosted me—we went to a public-house in Piccadilly, and had some<lb></lb>thing to drink, then to a coffee-house—then to the Haymarket, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and had some brandy—we reached Old Boswell-court at half-past four, or a quarter to five o'clock—when we got out, I took my money out of my purse, seven sovereigns and some loose silver—I paid the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man, and had seven sovereigns and seven shillings left—I went up to bed—the prisoner aroused me, and said her husband was ringing at the bell, and if I did not leave, there would be murder—I went to the window, and found it was not so—I thought something was <hi rend="italic">up</hi>—I called the policeman—I found the key of the prisoner's box behind her, between her back and her shift—I had earned this money—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man saw it with me—I am under charge, on suspicion of stealing a timepiece, but the bill has been thrown out.</p>

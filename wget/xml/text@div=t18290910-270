            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 27th of August, I was in Pitfield-street, and met Dowlan with a bundle; I asked what he had got, he said silk, and he was going to take it to some young woman he knew at the mad-house, at Bethnal-green - that he bought it in Holborn on Saturday night, of a man he did not know, at 2s. 6d. per yard, and gave 5l. for the whole; I took him into a public-house, looked at it, and then took him to the office - he said there, that he had lived with Mr. Maynard's fourteen days; I went there, and found it was right - he said he lived at No. 5, Harford-place, Drury-lane, and then at No. 2, West-street, Smithfield; I took Maynard's young man with me, and went to West-street - I found he lived there, but did not find any thing; we went on to No. 5, <placeName id="t18290910-270-crimeloc1488">Harford-place</placeName>

Cummings and Clow, who lived next door - they knew all the goods; Fairer was at that time out; when he returned, I asked him if he knew a man named Dowlan - he said No; I said, "What, not the porter next door?" he said, "Yes, I do;" I then asked if he ever sold him or given him any handkerchiefs, or silk; he said No; I then produced the property - he began to cry, fell on his knees. and said he hoped his master would forgive him, that the Irish had led him into it - I cautioned him to say nothing; we went and found these stockings in his box; I took him to the office - when Dowlan was before the Magistrate, Dowlan said Fairer had given them to him to sell.</p>

It was the last we had of the pattern, and it was missing - we had sold the pieces; the value of the whole is 6l. or 7l; Fairer was not alone in the shop to my knowledge; he was not employed about the silks; he might get access by taking down the inside shutters which we put up on Sundays and at nights; whether he picked the lock or not I do not know; he has been a whitesmith; the locks are but common ones - he said it was on Sunday afternoon he got them.</p>

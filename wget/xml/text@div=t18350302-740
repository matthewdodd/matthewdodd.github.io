                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in St. George's, Mid<lb></lb>dlesex. I took the business of Mr. Law on the 5th of May, 1834—the prisoner came into my service the latter end of August or the beginning of September—on the 5th of February last I received information which in<lb></lb>duced me to make inquiries, and in consequence of them I missed a silver watch which had been pawned by Benson, in Mr. Law's time—I inquired of Carter, and found the watch—I had not seen it before I found it—I only know whose it was by what the duplicate specified, and Sophia Ben<lb></lb>son claimed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had never seen it before your attention was directed to its loss? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; it was not taken in Mr. Law's time, for I had seen it done up in paper in the drawer about six weeks after I took the business—I did not open the paper—I cannot tell that it covered this identical watch—I discharged a shopman for theft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the duplicate that was on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the name of "Benson" was on it—it was pawned for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were two watches there pawned for the same money, which was rather singular—after I saw this parcel, both the parcel and the duplicate were taken.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner gave me this watch, or one similar—I cannot tell the day nor the month—it was before Christmas, and while he was in Mr. Garrett's service—he asked me to pawn it for him—I pawned it at Mr. Barford's for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave Bates the money—this chain and key were attached to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I belong to the copper trade—I am an apprentice—the officer came to tell me to go to the office, and I went the next day—I did not fear any charge against me—what I did, I did out of kindness, I swear that—he said he was to pawn the watch, and have so much for doing it; and as he had not time, as he only came out on Sundays, he asked me to do it—he gave me a shilling—I did not mean to conceal that, when I said I did it out of kindness—I suspected some<lb></lb>thing wrong at first—he said he received it from a watch pledger—I do not know what that means—I had not pawned any thing before—I have since—I gave the name of Brown—Bates told me to say so, as that was the name of the person—I gave a false address—Bates told me to give no address—he did not tell me what address to give.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say he told you to give no address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not quite say the word—it was rather a slip of the tongue—he told me no address—I said Baker-street, or something—it was an invention of my own—I am sure I do not recollect whether I gave any number—they asked me whose it was, and I said a friend's—they asked me if I was a housekeeper or a lodger—I told them "No."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the answer you gave, "No?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told them neither—I remember that—I mentioned a number—I do not know where it was—it was out of my own head—I have not been in the prosecutor's house—I have been in his shop twice—I was not there in Mr. Law's time—the con<lb></lb>stable did not tell me I should be charged with stealing the watch, or that I must account how I came possessed of it—he said I must appear against Bates—he came and asked if I had pawned any thing for the prisoner.</p>

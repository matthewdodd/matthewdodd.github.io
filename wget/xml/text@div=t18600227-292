My father keeps the Stag Inn in Wandsworth-road—on 16th February the prisoner came, and another man with him—they had half-a-quartern of rum, and after that the prisoner called for half-a-quartern of brandy—he gave me in payment a counterfeit five-shilling piece—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the crown piece in the back part of the till; I am sure there was no other coin of the same sort there—the other man then asked for two pickwicks, one for each of them—I served them, and the other man offered me a bad shilling—I saw at once that it was bad—upon that I looked at the five-shilling piece and I found that it was bad too—I sent my sister for my father, and the prisoner and the other man ran away—I did not give change for the shilling—they left part of the brandy—I took the shilling and kept it—I gave an alarm, and several persons ran after the pri<lb></lb>soner—I had the shilling and the crown in my hand—I might shew them to some one, but they were not out of my sight—I afterwards marked them, and I or my father gave them to the constable.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 1, Hamilton-street—on that Thursday I was at the Stag Inn—I saw the prisoner running across the road—I ran after him, and took him in Simpson-street, about two hundred yards off—it is not a thoroughfare—I took him by the collar, and took him back to Mr. Bluck's—I saw him put his right hand up to his mouth just as I laid hold of him—what he put in his mouth I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Stag—on 16th February my daughter gave me a crown and a shilling which were counterfeits—I requested her to nark them in presence of the prisoner, and I saw her do so, and I gave them in charge to the policeman—I was at the Clapham police-station, when the prisoner was brought up about 1 o'clock the same day—the prisoner was in the dock—the inspector gave direction to search the prisoner—the marked money was laid on the desk that the inspector was writing on—the prisoner was about two feet from where the money was laid—the shilling laid uppermost, and while the sergeant was taking off the prisoner's shoes, the prisoner put his hand towards where the money was, and put his hand to his mouth—I looked immediately, and there was the crown piece, but the shilling was gone—I had seen it not a second before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, V</hi> 27). On 16th February the prisoner was given into my custody by Mr. Bluck—I searched him in the back parlour of the public house—I found on him a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a sixpence, a three-penny piece, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good—Mr. Bluck gave me a counterfeit crown and also a shilling—they were both marked in my presence—I took the prisoner to the Clapham police-station—he was placed in the dock and I was directed to search his shoes; before I did that I laid the counterfeit crown and shilling on a ledge about four inches wide—the shilling was on the crown piece—I proceeded to examine the prisoner's shoes and found nothing, and as I was looking up I saw his hand go to his mouth very quick and I saw his neck to be swallowing something—I looked at the ledge and the shilling was missing—it was missing in two or three seconds after I had placed it there—another constable who was by said, "He has taken some<lb></lb>thing;" that caused me to look up—the prisoner was taken before the Magistrate the next day—I had noticed the shilling that Miss Bluck marked, and I have seen a shilling produced afterwards by Dudley; I believe it is not the shilling that Miss Bluck gave me—it is marked something like it, but the two marks do not form so much a cross, and the one I received from Miss Bluck had a very dead sound—I believe, by the mark and the sound, that this one produced is not the same shilling—the prisoner gave his address at No. 10, Bond-street, Vauxhall—I went there and there were three No. 10's; I went to them all and no such person was known,—I inquired at several other places.</p>

I said, "I am the inspector on duty;" he said "I have something to say to you; is the magistrate gone?" I said" Yes; he has been gone some time;" he said, "This is the shilling"—he had this shilling in his hand—I asked him where he got it; his coat was then open, and he said, "From here," and he put his finger and thumb in a small rent inside his coat—it is marked—he said, "You will find it is a good one; I wish it examined."</p>

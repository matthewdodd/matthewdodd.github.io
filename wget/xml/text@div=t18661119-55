                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a leather cutter—at a quarter to six on Wednesday evening, November 7th, I was opposite Shoreditch Church, on the right-hand side—I had my watch in this waist-coat pocket, and the chain round my neck—all of a sudden I got a blow on the back of my head behind the ear—I turned round, thinking it one of my comrades, and the same person then snatched my watch from my pocket, breaking the chain; this piece remained round my neck—I ran after him, and thought I should be able to catch him, when several persons stood in the way and said, "What's the matter?"—I was stopped there a few minutes and lost sight of the man—I had not noticed him till after I received the blow—when I turned round I saw not only his face but his dress—there was gas<lb></lb>light in the street, and it was near where a building was going on—the prisoner is the man—I did not go to the station, but A policeman came across the road and I told him—afterwards my master said I had better leave it alone, but the policeman said he would not leave it alone—on the Wednesday when it happened I went to the Kingsland Police Station, and on the Friday the policeman came and took me to the station—there were four other persons there, five altogether—I was told to pick out the right one, and I picked out the prisoner—I had no hesitation at all—I picked him out immediately.</p>

               <p>opposite Shoreditch Church—there was a sort of passage there, but the prisoner did not go up that passage—it took a few seconds to break the chain, as it was very strong.</p>

I received a description from the last witness, in consequence of which I apprehended the prisoner on the 9th of November—I told him the charge—he said, "You are mistaken; I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station, and fetched the prosecutor—I took the prosecutor into the inspector's office whilst I went and found four young men about the same size as the prisoner—I then took the prisoner into the charge-room, and told him to stand where he liked among them—after that I called the prosecutor, and the moment he went in he said, "That's the man," as plain as he could speak—the prisoner then answered, "I know nothing at all about it; I can prove where I was that night; I was at the shop at my work, and my book will prove it"—he handed me this book, and I found in it that he was not there that day at all.</p>

I am a shoemaker, of 59, George Street, Bethnal Green Road—I know the prisoner—he works at the same shop as I and my brother—on Wednesday, 7th November, he came there at half-past nine to ten in the morning, and was there till he went to his dinner, and when he came back from his dinner he was there till 9 o'clock—I know that night was Wednesday, 7th November, because I had to go to Turner's Music Hall, Mile End Road, to see a friend—I went there about half-past nine—we have a clock in the shop—we are generally in the habit of taking work home to a shop in Brick Lane—I don't know the name—he was in the habit of going from eight to a quarter-past to take his work home—he did not go on that evening—a young man engaged to work for me, Thomas Russell, was there, and my brother and mother.</p>

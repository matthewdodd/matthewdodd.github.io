             sworn. - I know the prisoner by apprehending him; I was going on my duty on the 4th of November towards Kensington Gravel-pits, about eight o'clock in the evening, and saw him on the road with a little girl and thirteen geese before him; I asked him where he brought them from; he said, from Henley-upon-Thames; I asked him where he was going to; he said, to his brother, a poulterer, in the Haymarket; I told him to go on, and followed him up as far as Tyburn-turnpike. Instead of turning the way to the Haymarket, he went through Cumberland-street; I followed him through different streets, and then I took him and the geese to the watch-house; I found Mr. Battye, and be owned the geese in the watch-house; the prisoner said, forgive me, for God's sake, for I bought them of a man and woman coming along the road.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>"My Lords, with humble submission, I most humbly implore your humanity in behalf of my most unfortunate situation. Returning from Windsor with my child, I met a man and woman who had geese to sell, and I bought fifteen of them. I ever bore a good character, and I have written to my brother, but he has not come to town."</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

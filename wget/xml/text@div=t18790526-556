I went to assist the constable in the last case to the prisoner's house, Worcester Ground, where I found B 298, the prosecutor and the last witness and six or seven other persons—I did not see the prisoner there—I assisted the other constable with Murray out of the room, and got to the comer of Peter Street, when the prisoner ran across the street, and gave me a violent blow over the eye with this belt with a brass ring (produced)—Jackson ran after him, and the prisoner threw him down—he was then charged with stealing a shilling and assaulting me.</p>

B 297 was taking Murray, and there was a crowd following—the policeman who took me in custody let go, and another policeman took his place, and he took out his staff, and would have hit another young man, and then he turned round to me, and said, "You had better go home. "I said, "I am going home." He said, "Go along home, or else I will give you some of this if you don't go off."</p>

               <p>eight o'clock in the morning, a woman came to my shop and asked for some tobacco—about two hours after she was gone, the prisoner came in—he asked me if I was a buyer of soap and candles—I said, "No"—I asked him to show me a list, which he produced—I asked if he was a traveller for that party, which was James Hibbald, whose name appeared on the list—I knew that house—the prisoner represented that he came from James Hibbald—he said so—he mentioned the name of James Hibbald, of No. 119, Bishopsgate-street—I gave him an order for a pound of rotten stone, and a pound of black lead, as a sample, to be supplied from James Hibbald's bouse—he brought the goods himself about three o'clock in the afternoon, with this paper marked A—the writing was all there with the exception of the receipt, which he wrote before me, "Settled same time, J. H."—I paid the money, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he wrote that as the receipt—he put the "J. H." in my presence—those goods were genuine—he left a sack, and said he would call again at seven o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—about an hour after he left, the same female who had been before came in again—the prisoner called again at seven o'clock—I asked him if he could bring me 141bs. of each, the same as the sample—he said he would—he brought 14lbs. of each—I did not undo those goods till I went to Worship-street—I then undid one parcel which he had represented as 14lbs. of black lead, and there was only 4lbs. of black lead, the rest was coal—that bill came to 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid him, and he signed that bill before me the same as the other—he affected to have authority to sign Hibbald's name—I was surprised at his signing "J. H."—I asked him how it was he brought me a bill, not a printed bill head—he said he was so late that night, he merely wrote it out in a hurry—when he went away, I asked him to leave me one of those lists—he refused, saying he had only one—he said he would send me one with the goods—as fast as I bought these goods a woman came to buy them again—she said she would pay me directly, but I did not let her have them—I have never seen her since—I have the goods and the bills here—I went to Mr. Hibbald's next morning, on discovering rubbish instead of the things I had ordered—he represented himself as a seller of soap and candles, and produced this list, which I looked over—I asked the price of the black lead and rotten stone—I asked if I could have 1lb. of each as a sample—he said decidedly so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But in this particular transaction, he affected to come from Hibbald, to supply you with Hibbald's goods, and gave you a receipt as having autho<lb></lb>rity to do so from Hibbald? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and by that means he got the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my money—this is the bill and receipt—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"London, March 26th, 1845: Mr. Rule, bought of J. Hibbald, 1/4 ream of glass paper, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the ream, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 1lb. of stone blue, 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; lib. of lead, 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; lib. of rotten stone, 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; total, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that was the state in which he brought it, as a bill coming from Hibbald's, for goods with which he had supplied me in the name of Hibbald, and when I gave him the money he gave me this as Hibbald's receipt for what I had had, "Settled same time, J.

               <p>NARCISSA TAYLOR. I live in Crown-street, Finsbury-square. On the 22d of July, I called a coach in Bishopsgate-street to take me to Leadenhall-street, to the Battersea stage; while I was in the coach I took my purse out of my pocket to pay, the coachman drew up to the side of the stage, I stepped out of one into the other; I had not been in the stage three minutes before I missed my purse-Hoby went after the coach, but could not find it; he went to look for him again, and I went on to Battersea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I am certain I did not drop it - I suppose it fell out of my lap. The prisoner was brought to me on the Tuesday after.</p>
               <p>PETER HOBY. I am a carver. I stood by the side of the stage, and assisted Miss Taylor out of the coach-the prisoner drove the coach; I saw him get on the step, put his body in, and look all over it. No. 367 was chalked on the coach. Miss Taylor said she missed her purse; I went after the coach, but could not find him at any of the stands; he was taken into custody on the Tuesday; if it had dropped between the coaches I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I drove to the stand in Mark-lane, and got a job immediately.</p>

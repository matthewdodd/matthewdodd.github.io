                  </hi>. I am going on for eleven years of age. I am the daughter of Frances Hellens, and was living with her—on the 27th of Nov. I went out with my sister Selina—I went into Gloucester-street—a young woman came to me, and said, "Little girl, your bonnet is untied"—she asked me to let her tie it, and she did—she then told me she had a son who was gone for a soldier, and had stopped out all night drinking, and said, "I want such a nice little girl as you to go into a public-house and see if there is a soldier there"—I had my little sister still in my arms—the young woman then took her out of my arms, and told me to go into a public-house and look into the tap-room, and see if there was a soldier there—I went into a public-house—she then sent me into a little cake shop, and gave me a penny piece, and told me to buy a lady's-finger, and I did so—she then told me to go to an<lb></lb>other shop, and get a pound-cake for the baby—I did so—she told me to ask for a piece of paper—she wrapped up the cake and the lady's-finger, and put them into her pocket—she then sent me into another public-house—she then sat down on a step,. and gave me a fourpenny-piece, and told me to go and buy 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of plum-pudding, and to get 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loaf, and she told me the first public-house she came to, she would sit down and have a pint of beer—she held the child while I went on all the errands—she then sent me for 2oz. of cheese, and I went—we got on to the London-hospital, and then she told me she wanted to go up a court for a minute—she went, and took the baby, and I never saw her nor the baby afterwards—she had told me to stop at the end of the court, and I waited a long time—I do not know how long—a woman said I waited twenty minutes—a good many people spoke to me, and a young man took me to the station, told the people I had lost a baby, and then that young man took me home—the woman who spoke to me, and took the baby, was dressed in a half-mourning gown, a black-crape bonnet, and a dark shawl—she had a crape flower by the side of her bonnet—she had a pale complexion, and she had a flat curl on her cheek—I believe her hair was dark—I was examined before the Magistrate, at Union-hall—I did not know the female who was produced to me, at first, but when I came to see her have the bonnet and shawl on, I recognized her—when I saw her first at Union-hall she was dressed very nicely, not in mourning—she was dressed better than when I had seen her before—the constable showed me a crape bonnet, and, to the best of my recollection, that was similar to the</p>

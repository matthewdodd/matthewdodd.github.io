            . I know the prisoner. I was married to him on the 3d of February, 1818, at St. Pancras church. I signed this entry in the register, and saw him sign it - he left me on the 2d of March. I have seen his former wife since that. We were in furnished lodgings. My friends intended giving me some property, but they thought they would wait to see how he behaved to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was he introduced to you - A. I first met him in the public street, where I was waiting for a female friend - it rained, and he held an umbrella over me. I would not allow him to see me home, but he would not leave me till I promised to meet him. I promised, in order to get rid of him, but did not meet him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was your next interview - A. By chance, in the street - he spoke to me. Our courtship continued about six months. I made no inquiry about him. He obtained no money from me, he only took my watch when he left; I have since got it back from the pawnbroker's. He wanted me to mortgage a house which will come to me at my mother's death.</p>

            . I am a watchman in that street. I was fetched to that house. I went in; the prisoner was sitting in the house by the fire, in her smock; she told me that the man up stairs had took all her clothes away. I went up stairs, I said, give the girl her clothes; they were done up in a bundle; he said, I charge this girl, she has got my watch.</p>

He knocked me about the room, I cried out murder; I ran down stairs and sent for the watchman. He had no watch or money.</p>

            . When this man and woman came into the house I asked the man to pay for the bed; he said he had no money, he would give me the watch till the morning. I sat there a long while asking him for the watch, he said, would I have it then, or in the morning. I was tired waiting. I went down stairs. A while afterwards he was using the woman in a very bad manner. I went up stairs and asked him what was the matter; he said he would serve me the same; the prisoner ran down stairs without her clothes, and sent me for the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the watch - A. No, I did not.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On Tuesday evening, 16th March, I was in John Street, Minories, about 7.45—I saw Lynch there driving a one horse van containing wool—Hooper was walking by his side—I followed them into Trinity Square—Hooper stopped at the corner on the pavement, and Lynch drew his van over on the opposite side against the square and stopped, and then came back and commenced talking to Hooper—Hall then came up with another load of wool upon a van; bales of wool—he stopped at the corner of Cooper's Row and got down—he had some conversation with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050008"></xptr>
               <p>others for about a minute, and then Lynch came over and drove his van away, and Hall followed with his van—Hooper got up on Hall's load behind as the van was going on, that was in Trinity Square, and after going 30 or 40 yards round the dark part of the square, Hooper pushed a bale off into the roadway—I had to come over the gate where I was, and when I came out Hooper was off the van, about 2 yards from me—I took hold of him and told him I should take him into custody for stealing the bale of wool—he said "You have made a mistake"—I took him to the Seething Lane Police Station—I afterwards went to Brewers Quay, Thames Street, which is the wharf where they were taking the wool to be put on board a ship—Lynch was there, and Hall came down with his van while I was there—I told them I should take them into custody for being concerned with an<lb></lb>other in custody in stealing a bale of wool in Trinity Square—they said they knew nothing about it—the bale is 3 cwt.—in the direction in which they went they were not going direct to Brewer's Quay; they ought to have gone straight down through Cooper's Row to the Tower, instead of that they turned round to the right—they both lead to the same point, but the usual practice is to go straight down, and they went round the square; it was rather darker that side than the other—I knew Hooper, and therefore I followed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Both roads lead to the same spot, and one diverges a little—Lynch was walking by the side of his horse, in front of the van, and Hall was walking by his horse—the van was in motion when the wool fell to the ground—Lynch's van was in front, and it was from Hall's van that the bale fell—Hall's van was 12 or 14 yards from Lynch's—it was about 7.55 when it was pushed off—the bales were not tied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Brewers Quay is about 200 yards from the place, where the bale was thrown off.</p>

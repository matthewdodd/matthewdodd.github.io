               <p>JOHN DAGGER. I live in Prospect-place, New Kent road. On the 16th of May I went to <placeName id="t18310630-141-crimeloc756">the George, in West-street, Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. You came in with two females, and they said, "Bill, a quartern of gin;" you gave me the money under your hand that they should not see it - I gave you 4d. change, and you sent for 1d. worth of sugar. Witness. I did not hand my money in the way he describes - there was no change brought to me; he came, and asked me what I pleased to want; I told him - he went, got a quartern of gin, and I gave him the sovereign.</p>

            . I keep the Green Dragon, in Half Moon-street, Bishopsgate. I was attending at the bar of the George, in West-street - the prosecutor came in with two persons; I cannot tell whether he was connected with them or not - the prisoner then came to the bar, said he wanted a quartern of gin, and he would bring me the money directly - I gave him the gin, and told him to bring the money: he went away, leaving his hat and gaiters behind him - I did not see him again till he was taken; the prosecutor came, and asked for his change soon after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave him change of 1s.; he was there with two bad characters; whether they took it or not I cannot tell; Mr. Bird was my master, hot Mr. Tell - he had only been there two or three days; I had lived nearly six months at the Crown, and not knowing what a place Mr. Bird's was I went there to get a better birth - I always wore a seal-skin cap; the two women were not strangers to the house - Mr. Bird knew them well; the prosecutor gave the girl a penny to get some sugar.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.Was it before or after you gave the sovereign that you gave the penny for the sugar? A.After -I had only 1 1/2d. in my pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you give the gin to the women? A. Yes; I expected a person to come, and he did not - I could not drink at all.</p>

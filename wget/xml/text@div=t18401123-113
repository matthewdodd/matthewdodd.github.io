                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Tooting-court, Crawford-street, Marylebone; the prisoner kept the house; I lodged and slept with her. On a Saturday night in October I came home about half-past twelve o'clock, and found my daughter and the prisoner at the door, and the supper on the table—the prisoner told me to sit down to the table—I sat down by the fire, being very cold—she told her daughter to come to the table—I said I could not sit down at her daughter's table—that was all I said—my daughter gave me my supper as I sat by the fire—I was eating it, and never spoke a word, when the prisoner took the poker and struck me over the head with it—my daughter took hold of her, and she stabbed her with a knife, which was on the table, and bit her in the arm—my daughter said to her daughter, <hi rend="italic">"Kitty,</hi> come out and look at your mother, for she is breaking my arm"—my daughter said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, <hi rend="italic">"Betty,</hi> don't you do any more damage"—that was after she had struck me with the poker—my daughter caught hold of her and kept her till her daughter came out and took hold of her mother, and my daughter caught hold of me and took me out—my daughter took me down to the station-house, and there I gave information—the prisoner was brought there in less than five minutes, by Hunt—I was bleeding a good deal from the blow—my husband was sent away eighteen or nineteen years ago from this place, and that is all she has to say against me, and she will be sure to have my life when she comes out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's daughter. I was at home before my mother—I had the supper ready when she came in, and Mrs. Crow was giving the soup round to her lodgers in the next room—my mother was in the other room—Mrs. Crow came into the room, and told my mother to sit down to the table—she said she was cold, and would sit by the fire—with that she called her daughter to the table, and my mother said she could not sit down to her daughter's supper as she could sit down to mine—the prisoner then took the poker from the fire-place, and struck my mother with it over the eye—my mother was sitting at the fire at the time—after she gave my mother the unmerciful blow, she took a plate off the table, and broke it with the poker—she was going to give my mother a second blow with the poker, when I went between them, and prevented it, and she cut me in the hand with a knife which she had in her hand—I brought my mother down to the station-house—Hunt went with me, and brought the prisoner there—I brought the poker to the station—I gave it to Hunt, and next morning gave him the knife—my mother was not cut with the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information given at the station-house, I went to the prisoner's house—the door was fastened—I knocked—she came and put her head out of window, and said, "Is that you, master Hunt?"—I said, "Yes, open the door"—she said, "I will open the door for you"—she did—I asked her what she struck the old woman over the head with a poker for—she said she knew that, and she chose to do so—I asked how she came to cut the daughter's hand—she said she had not cut the daughter's hand, nor yet touched her—I told her she must go to the station-house—she did not say how it hap<lb></lb>pened</p>

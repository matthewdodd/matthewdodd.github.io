            : at the time the two first tippets were stole I was in the shop 45; I saw the two prisoners but I did not see any thing they had got; about a quarter of an hour afterwards the two prisoners were round the door again, as I am told; I was out when I returned the two other tippets had been stole; Mr. Slack informed me what had happened, and delivered to me the two tippets; they were carried before the magistrate, and I have had them in my possession ever since. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner Marshall. Please your Worship when I set off from my friends house in the morning, I went to Charles-street, Bartlet-square to a butler, and drank a little with him there: coming down Bond-street I met a friend that had just come from France; I went with him and had four pots of ale; he told me of a place of a gentleman just going abroad, to enquire at the Oxford coffee house, accordingly I called there and he was not at home; just as we got to Mr. Slack's house we parted and shook hands together; he returned back to go up Oxford-road, I left him and going by the prosecutor's door I saw this tippet lay by the prosecutor's doors; I picked it up, and was walking away with it openly in my hand; the prosecutor came and catched hold of me and took me into the shop, and when I got into the shop, he said, he would prosecute me if he could; I begged mercy; if I had meant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150169"></xptr>it as a thief I should not have carried it in my hand; he told the gentleman of the office that I stole another tippet which he found on the ground by me; when I was before the justice I begged his pardon, and he said, you rascal if it was in my power I would hang you, and if you are not heavy enough, if I could have my will, I would pull your legs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Goodall. I left Marshall nigh the prosecutor's door and went on; I heard the cry of stop thief! I turned back and in about twenty yards I heard the thief was taken; accordingly I saw it was Marshall, he called me in, as as soon as I got in, the prosecutor took hold of me by the collar and said, sir, you have got the other two; he kept me about three minutes and then let me go; in the course of an hour and a half, two constables took me up and searched me and found nothing.</p>

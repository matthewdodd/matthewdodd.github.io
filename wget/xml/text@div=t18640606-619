                  </hi>. I am a furrier, living at 4, Carlton Chambers, Regent-street—on the night of 22d May, about a quarter past 12, I was in Cranbourne-street, Leicester-square—I saw the prisoner there with another man—they came, one on each aide of me, and shoved me-one of them laid hold of my arms, and put his hands round my body—I cannot say which it was—the prisoner then struck me in the mouth, and knocked me down—I called out "Police!" and the officer came up and took him in charge directly—I had some money in my pockets, but I had hold of it, and they did not take say.</p>

Q.</hi> What part of Cranbourne-street was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About the middle—there were a good many people about—I had come from Islington—I had been to a public-house there, Perhaps an hour, along with a friend or two—I had some porter to drink, nothing else—we had three or four pots—I left there about half-past 10 or a quarter to 11 and walked to Cranbourne-street—the other man was behind me, I could not see him well—the prisoner was in front of me when he struck me in the mouth.</p>

About quarter past 12 on the night of 22d May, I was on duty in Cranbourne-street, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner there with two others—the other two parted from him and walked past the prosecutor—then Moran went in front of the prosecutor and rushed against him—the old man still continued going on, some three or four yards, and the prisoner and the other men parted again, and Moran went in front, turned back, and again knocked against the old man, who said some<lb></lb>thing to him; I don't know what—they then did the same thing again after letting him go a few yards—they then came into Leicester-square—I got into Ryder's-court, and then the prisoner and the other two stopped together and talked—the old man was still going on—I heard one of the three say, He is right, come on"—the prisoner went in front of the other men, and the prosecutor, returned back again, and when he came to a hoarding in Leicester-square I saw him strike the prosecutor and knock him down—one of the other men then laid hold of his arms as he was down-Moran was in</p>

               <p>a stooping attitude over him; what he was doing I don't know—I caught hold of him, and one of the others by the collar—the third one was behind—I continued to hold Moran by the clothes, and he put my hand in his mouth and bit me—I took him to the station—the other one got way—the prosecutor was not sober, but he was well able to go home by himself.</p>

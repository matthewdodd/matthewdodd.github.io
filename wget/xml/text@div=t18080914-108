               <p>Q. How came you there - A. I had not been in bed all night, I was in liquor; I had been dragged there from a house in Fleet market; I fell asleep there and was dragged out; I do not know the sign of the house; I spent my evening at the Empress of Russia, Islington.

               <p>Q. Do you know where you reeled to after that - A. I went to my mother's in Golden lane; I could not get in; I went to the Old Bailey, and had something to drink; from thence I went into Fleet market to a public house; coming out a woman got hold of me; I was too drunk to recollect her person.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how you got into this court you do not know - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had your silver watch about you when you left the Empress of Russia - A. I had it between four and five in the morning, I looked at it then; I tucked the chain in my pocket to go to Fleet market.</p>

On the 2nd of August I was up a quarter before five o'clock; I heard a noise in the court, I saw the prisoner take the hat off the young man's head, his watch, and handkerchief; when she turned out of the court she gave it to the other woman that was with her; the prosecutor was very drunk; I saw the prisoner in two or three days afterwards; she was in custody.

On hearing a noise I came down stairs, I saw this young man and two women together in the passage, and when the woman, not the prisoner, saw me coming, she said the young man was her son, she said he went with the dirty whores, she would take his hat and his property, for fear he should be robbed of it; I saw them take the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the hat - A. This woman took the hat off; the man was very drunk.</p>

No, that was not taken in my presence; they went up the court; I did not see her afterwards till she was taken by the constable; they left the young man in the passage; I thought it was the mother and sister; that is the reason I did not stop them.</p>

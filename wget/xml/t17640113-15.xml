            . About seven in the evening, I was going by this Lady's shop, I saw the prisoner come out of her shop with a box: he ran cross the way immediately: I thought he had taken it feloniously by the manner of his coming out with it; I crossed the way after him; he was then assisted to hoist the box on his back by a woman that seemed to be in confederacy with him: I said, what are you going to do with that box? upon my second application, he threw it down, intending to throw it on my legs, and ran away: I ran after him; he never was out of my sight, till I took him; I brought him back to the box, and from thence to Miss Ramsay's shop; the box was pretty weighty.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Miss Ramsay?</p>
               <p>Baillie. I never had the pleasure of knowing her before that circumstance happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the man, so as to be sure of knowing him?</p>
               <p>Baillie. I took notice sufficiently of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is her shop?</p>
               <p>Baillie. A little before you come to Michael's Alley.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Baillie. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where the box was drop'd, did you take him?</p>
               <p>Baillie. Not fifteen yards distance from it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after?</p>
               <p>Baillie. In about three quarters of a minute, I had him back again to the box.</p>

            . I am brother to Miss Ramsay; I was sent for to her house, there I found the prisoner in the back parlour, and Mr. Baillie with him: I was told, the prisoner had stole this box out of the shop, and Mr. Baillie had brought him back; I got a constable and brought him to the Counter. The next day, I took him before the Alderman at Guildhall; we took the box there; the things were taken out, there were things of great value not mentioned in the indictment, then they were put in again, and the box nailed up again: the prisoner would not speak one word; he would give no answer at all to what was asked him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went to speak, they would not let me; the gentlemen said, I shall have the pleasure to make a day's holiday, to see you hanged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ramsay. He was asked several questions there and at the Compter; he never opened his mouth to speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baillie. I asked him several questions; he would not make any answer at all.</p>

               <p>They all said I was a Jew. I was afraid of getting my brains knock'd out, which made me afraid to speak: when I was coming along.

            . I never knew the prisoner before that time, only I saw some part of the affair that night. I was standing at the next shop to Miss Ramsay's, it is a milliner's shop, looking through the glass, having some jeweller's work to sell: there were people in the shop; I saw a man come out of the shop with a slapt hat, and an apron on; he unbuttoned the door and came out, with a box under his arm; and, in about two minutes after, Stop thief was cried out; the mob laid hold of the prisoner: some gentleman was there said, he had drop'd the box on his toes. I saw the man, as soon as he dropt the box, run cross the way again; it was not the prisoner; the prisoner is not the man that I saw come out of the shop with the box.</p>
               <p>Q Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I am sure of it: I am sure that man was taller than this man: I saw him unbutton the door, and go in, and button the door again, when he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is not the man?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I am sure he is not: that man ran cross the way; I did not see this man before he was taken hold of, and I saw the other man run cross the way when Stop thief was cried.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Baillie?</p>
               <p>Hatton. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him. (Mr. Baillie stands up.)</p>
               <p>Hatton. I think I saw this man among the crowd. I think he had hold of the man at the bar afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the box was down on the ground, was it the prisoner was laid hold on?</p>
               <p>Hatton. It was not above two or three minutes, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other man, at the time Stop thief was first called?</p>
               <p>Hatton. The man had crossed the way, and, I believe, ran a dozen yards then. - He ran immediately as soon as Stop thief was cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner run?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I can't say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say you never saw the prisoner before that night?</p>
               <p>Hatton. My lord, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be known, to give evidence here?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I work among the Jews. I am generally at the King's Arms in Hounsditch on a night. While I was telling the story, some of the Jews went out and brought the prisoner's wife in.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the shop, where the box came out, was the shop you was looking through the window?</p>
               <p>Hatton. That is on the right hand of the shop; it is a milliner's shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130012"></xptr>Mr. Ramsay. That shop was shut an hour before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Hatton. It was about 5 o'clock - I think thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baillie. It was about 7.</p>
               <p>Hatton. It could not be 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear it was not fix?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I will venture to swear it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Hatton. It was a Saturday night, the 18th or 19th of November.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ramsay. It was after 7 o'clock: I went out immediately; I went for another man: I met this constable, and carried him with me, and he took hold of the prisoner, and brought him out of the shop directly.</p>

               <p>Q. to Hatton. Where do you live?</p>

               <p>Hatton. I work in the filagree way, making things for ladies hair, and dress caps in the fancy way; and I was looking to see it they had the same sort of goods as I had. The shop was not shut indeed, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Baillie. Did you observe that shop to be open?</p>

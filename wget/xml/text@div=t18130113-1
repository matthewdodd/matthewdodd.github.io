            . I am the daughter of William Ward. On Tuesday morning, the 15th, about nine o'clock, I was in the shop; two men came in; they asked me if Mr. Ward was at home. I said, I did not know. They asked me, if Mrs. Ward was at home. I said, I would see. I went up stairs, looked over the bannister of the stairs, and called out, mother. I heard the parlour door slap to. I went back into the shop, and saw the men were gone. My mother came, and went into the shop.</p>

I heard a noise up stairs, about nine o'clock in the morning, as if somebody was screaming, and when I went up stairs I heard my mother say we were robbed. She was in the shop then. I ran out after the two men, and when I got as far as Broad-street. I heard the cry of, stop thief. I ran very hard, and when I got as far as Portland-street the prisoner was taken.

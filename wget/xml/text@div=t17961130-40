             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am the wife of Daniel Plater, of Woburn, in Buckinghamshire; I <rs id="t17961130-40-viclabel218" type="occupation">deal in lace</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17961130-40-victim370 t17961130-40-viclabel218"></join>; I came to town the 13th of November, with some lace, and on the 14th of November sold it to Mr. Wells, in Fleet-street, for which I received, in the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, eighty guineas in gold, and half-a-guinea; I put it in a leather purse, and tied it up with a string, and put it in my left hand pocket; I called at Mr. Moore's, to buy some drugs; not having money enough to pay for them, without exposing my purse, I borrowed two shillings of my daughter; after that I called at a pastry-cook's, and bought a pie for my supper; there I pulled out my purse, and put it again in my pocket; while I had my purse out to take out a guinea, a man came in and called for a cheesecake, and stood behind me to eat it; he went out before me; when I came out, I had the money in my pocket, and kept my hand round it; when I came under the scaffolding in <placeName id="t17961130-40-crimeloc219">Fleet-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was that the same man you saw in the pastry-cook's shop? - A. I don't know; he had the same coloured cloaths on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his appearance like the man you had seen? - A. Yes; the prisoner was on my left-hand, next my left-hand pocket, my hand was then round my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it round your purse after the man pushed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the man had quitted you before your and was off the purse? - A. Yes; I was then pushed almost down by the woman, as I judged.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The man pushed you against the woman, and then she pushed you again? - A. Yes; and then she laid hold on my cloaths, just by my pocket, and almost pushed me down, and obliged me to pull my hand out of my pocket to save myself; when I had recovered myself, in a moment, while the woman was by me, I missed my purse, and cried out, this woman has robbed me of eighty guineas and upwards; her face at that time was full in the light of the lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman by when you cried out you had lost your money? - A. Yes; she cried out, what are you at, what would you have; I said, I was ruined for ever; she went forward, and a man stood ready to receive her.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she spoke, her face was right against the lamp? - A. Yes; I saw her as plain as if I had held the lamp against her face myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak positively to her person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her since? - A. Yes; twice at Hatton-garden; on Monday, a week after the robbery, she was taken in consequence of an information, and a description I had given of her to the officers of the Police.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had observed her so much as to give a description of her person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see that person in Court now, that you gave a description of at the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is she? - Go down and touch the person. - (The witness goes down and touches the prisoner).</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the person you saw at the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same woman you saw that night? - A. Yes; I am quite positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were robbed, your daughter was with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Have you seen the man since that pushed against you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not very much used to London, I believe? - A. Yes; I have come many years with my lace.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, between seven and eight at night, there is always a great croud of people in Fleet-street? - A. Yes; but I never was interrupted before.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there when you were making your passage through this place? - A. I don't know, I believe there were more of the gang.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there sixty or seventy persons passed through while you were in the passage? - A. No, there were not; there might be five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there were not more than five or six persons about you? - A I saw nobody to take any notice of but the man and the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. This man pushed you against the woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Your description must be pretty general to apply to three persons? - A. I said, I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of the three did you say, to the Magistrate, was like the person? - A. Neither; I said the nose of Miss Seymour rather resembled her's, but I said neither of them were the woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you before that see a man? - A. No; I did not; we were coming along, my mother was leaning her right hand on my arm, and her left hand was in her pocket; the woman jostled me from my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do any thing more? - A. No, I did not; I put my elbow back against the woman, and she screamed out, "what would you be at," or "what would you have of me."</p>

               <p>Q. While you and your mother were under the scaffolding, how many persons might pass you? - A. I saw none pass and re-pass at the time; afterwards, there were a great many, twenty or thirty.</p>

               <p>Q. In what state of health was your mistress on that day? - A. Very ill; she had been very ill some weeks before, but able to go out; but on that Monday she was never out of bed, but to have it made.</p>

               <p>Q. What was her situation on Monday? - A. In hysterics most of the day from fretting.</p>

               <p>Q. What were her circumstances at that time? - A. Very low indeed; on the Thursday before she was taken up, I was obliged to pawn a petticoat for her subsistence; and a gown on Tuesday, and a petticoat on Monday; from want of fire to keep them warm, she was obliged to lie in bed, and have her child in bed; she was in the utmost distress through want and illness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing about her chambers of guineas, or a purse, all that week? - A. No; we were quite in want.</p>

               <p>Q. On this day she had hysterics the greatest part of the day? - A. Yes; for fear of the bailiffs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been in fits any day before that? - A. I don't know that she had, but she was in a very low way.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she been in fits any other day after that? - A. I don't know that she was; on the Saturday night, the bailiffs were at the door, and the fear and dread she was in was the cause of the hysterics.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Saturday she was out? - A. I will not charge my memory with that, as I was doing my business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had she been out? - A. I believe not from the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. As she was ill, I suppose she had some Apothecary attending her? - A. No; her circumstances would not allow it.</p>

On the 24th of March, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner making his way out of my cow shed, with a bundle under his arm; when he saw me he turned to the left, and got under the manger, under a horse's head; I went to him with a candle, and sent for a watchman - he then came out to escape, leaving the bundle behind. I took hold of him, calling very loud for help; his leg was over a fence - I caught hold of it - he took a knife out of his pocket, and cut me; it took a small piece of flesh out of the joint of my finger; he did it to release himself; and cut the person who came to my assistance. There was nothing of mine in the bundle.</p>

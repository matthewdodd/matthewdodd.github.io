            . I am an engraver and live in Widegate-street, Bishopsgate-street, City. I know the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120051"></xptr>I have known him personally for twenty years, but did no business for him. In March or April, he came into my shop and said, I have a little business to do in the engraving; I said, "Very well, walk in, pray what is it." He gave me a specimen of this ticket (looks at one), it was like this; he asked whether I could engrave such a thing, I said I could, and said "Pray what is it?" he said Prussian; I said, "What?" he said, a ticket; "A ticket of what?" said I; he said, "A ticket of admission;" I was looking at it; and saw the word "current" on it, which was the only thing I could make out; I began to say for what - he said, "God bless my soul, do you think I am giving you any thing wrong to do, you know me very well;" I said "I do." I have known him by being a neighbour, and occasionally meeting him; he wanted me to engrave two plates and have 30,000 impressions, if I could get them done, but there was no restricted number. I asked what time he would allow - a fortnight or three weeks was mentioned; I said, that was too short to get so large a number, but I would get about 10,000 done. We calculated that the 10,000, with the plates, would come to about 30 l., which made about 10 l. a thousand in all, including the plates. I took some impressions afterwards on certain qualities of paper, after engraving the plate, and he took the proofs with him. I was to supply the plates and print 10,000, he thought the paper I had would do; but after having proofs pulled, and taking them away, he said it would not do, and agreed to find the paper. The paper was included in the 10 l. a thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of the order he gave - A. I entered it in my order-book, and proceeded to put it in execution, and struck off 10,000 from the plate. The order was complete before a fortnight or three weeks; we used to lay them on the counter to dry, and he came repeatedly and sat in the shop, and cut them, gathered them up, and took them away as we got them dry, in thousands, packed up in hundreds. I employed three plates on them, as one was worn out; they were struck off in the common way of copper-plate printing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing added after the engraving was struck off - A. A line of letter-press was afterwards introduced, with this instrument (producing it) in red ink; this is the worn-out plate (looking at it), it was the plate of the reverse side of the instrument; I struck off 7 or 8000 with it, it was then worn out, I told him so; he said we must have another; I said, I could not afford it at the price; he said, he would give me two guineas to do another. The plates were left with me (looks at two others), these are them, they completed the instrument, except the red ink line; one of my men composed the letter-press instrument. The prisoner ordered it to be a complete copy of the one he brought. I did the 10,000, and about August he called, and said he had a fresh order for 5000 more, that it was a shipping order, and he wanted them done as speedily as possible; the order was entered in my book. I had received the first paper from the prisoner, in reams made up from the maker's, and some of it was left; it was made purposely, each sheet made two tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Foy coming to your house - A. Yes, the second order was then in progress, only 300 were done, and when he came in they were on my counter, drying. The plates, tickets, and paper, found by Foy, were the same which the prisoner directed to be made and finished; he called many times while they were in progress, I should think thirty times, and was very anxious to get them done.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this, is it one of the tickets, as the prisoner described them, impressed from the plate you have in your hand - A. It is, both sides correspond with the two plates, it was struck by his direction from the plates made by his order; those set out in the indictment (looking at it) are impressed from the same plate, but I did not make the impression; the letter-press of these is not mine. Here is the original ticket (looking at it) which he gave me to engrave the plates from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have known him twenty years - Yes; I call him Goldston; he said they were tickets of admission, he did not say it was to a theatre; he had proofs of some for approbation. I pulled him a proof as a matter of course; he did not say he wanted them for approbation, each time an alteration was made in the plate, he had an impression, he might take away several at different times; he said they were a shipping order, and I considered that he took them for approbation; he never said the order was for somebody else.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Are the types foreign or English - A. English. The plate is fairly reduced to its present state by working, I intended to repair it; and before that we have them planished, we send them to a copper-plate printer to be planished, and it came in that state to me, either from Harrison's, in Shoe-lane; or Shafe's, in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. There is tin or lead at the back - A. Yes, I had them first engraved to work two at the time, and they were laid on a bed of tin.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you understand either the German and French language - A. I do not, my Lord.</p>

I made it so, here is the water mark, and the mould it was made from. We made about 26,000 sheets, each being double.

            . (Through an interpreter.) I speak the German language. I am inspector of the police of Berlin. It is my duty to inspect the dollar notes, among other things, with a view to know if they are forged. I am one of the inspectors, (looks at the note) this is a treasury note or receipt of one dollar, it is a false one. I have seen a number of them in possession of Foy, they are false. In May last several Jews were taken up at Berlin for passing these notes. Among others I arrested two of the name of Lob, they were transported from Berlin, and one Simeon was in custody. I came over to England with him, we arrived on the 10th of July. I put a letter in the post at Hamburgh, directed to the prisoner.</p>

I have nothing to do with the office from which the notes are issued, but have orders from the Treasury respecting them; there is nobody here from the office. They are issued in Prussia instead of money, they are current money; whoever presents them receives money for them; they are received at all the Treasuries in payment of duties, and in exchange for money. I have seen money given for them at the Treasury an hundred times, no deduction is made. It is a treasury note or receipt, and is current money through the whole kingdom in every business.</p>

               <p>Q. Are they not receipts denoting only that government has received so much - A. No, they are actual money, any tradesman in Berlin would take them.</p>

I should call a receipt shile, the word shile is literally a receipt, unless schult is added it denotes no promise to pay, there is no distinction in the German language for note and receipt.</p>

            . I live in Villiers-street, Strand. I have known the prisoner as long as I have been in this country, about nine years; I never had any dealings with him except the transaction in question. I first saw him on the subject on the 11th of July, I had arrived in England the day before with the Inspector of the Police. I was in custody at Berlin. I saw the prisoner the day after our arrival, and had some conversation with him. I told him I was sent here from Mr. Lobb, of Hamburgh, to obtain the 5000 Prussian notes, and that I had the money to pay for them, and told him he had a letter to that effect; he said he had received the letter. I had no occasion to tell him who I came from, for I was present several times before when the prisoner delivered Lobb some at No. 43, Lant-street, Borough, last March or April; they were such as these produced - my application to him was for notes of the same description, as I had seen him give Lobb before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what language the prisoner speaks - A. He always spoke German to me. He said he would try to get them for me, but I must give him 5 l. beforehand, and not having it in my pocket, I promised to give it him next day. I told Foy of it - he gave me a 5 l. note, marked; I gave it to the prisoner, and he gave me a receipt for it, which I produce. I paid it; to him on account of the 5000 notes; he gave me some notes which I immediately brought with Clement, the officer, to Foy. The officer searched me before I went in for the notes, and I met him just as I came out - he stood opposite when I went in. I received notes twice from the prisoner; the first time 1200, and the second time 2100. He appointed to meet me to pay him 10 l. more at Somerset-house, I did so, and gave him 10 l. which I received from Foy, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You are a Prussian - A. Yes. I was never in custody except on this occasion; they kept me in custody from the 21st of May, to the 28th of June. I am now on parole.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw the prisoner give Lobb notes in March and April - A. I heard Lobb give the prisoner an order for 30,000 notes; he received on that occasion, an original note from his brother to give the prisoner.</p>

            . Simeon was put under my direction. I furnished him with money to buy notes of the prisoner. I received from him on the 30th of July, 1200 notes, 100 of which I marked, and sealed the others up. I produce one. I took the prisoner in Waterloo-street, Strand; I had given Simeon on that day, August the 1st, two 5 l. notes, the prisoner had those two 5 l. notes in his hand when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120053"></xptr>I took him. I asked where he got them from, he said from Mr., I asked for what purpose, he said for watches, which he had sold him. I told him, he was charged with forging Prussian notes; he said he knew nothing about these. I said I was certain he did, and asked where the plates were. I said I was certain he knew, for they were at Newman's in Widegate-alley - he denied all knowledge of them. I said, I should send him to the office, and search Newman's-house; he said if I did, I should not succeed in finding the plates, but if I would allow him to go, he would point out the place where they were to be found. I said I could not, and sent him to the office. I and Mr. Eckard, accompanied by a constable, went to Newman's - he was not at home, but was sent for. I told him he was printing some work for a man named Goldstein, I went up stairs, and found two men at work, printing with the plates - these are the plates that we brought away. In the printing-office, I found notes in various states, some paper half worked, and some wholly so. I also found some paper, and the type set up with red ink. I found the same two notes on the prisoner as I gave Simeon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You could not hear what was said between him and Simeon - A. No.</p>

            . I searched him before he went in, and remained in a coach - I did not lose sight of the house before he went in; he had none of these notes about him then, on his return he had some; he took them to the Crown tavern, Clerkenwell-green, and gave them to Foy. I accompanied him again next day, and saw him go into the house, he returned with a great quantity of these notes, and gave them to Foy at the Crown tavern. I did not lose sight of him till he delivered them. I assisted in apprehending the prisoner, and went with Foy to Newman's, and found a quantity of notes being printed.</p>

               <p>MR. ECKARD. They are all forged instruments.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I never had a felonious intent in my mind - it was through distress. I have a wife and seven children. I had an execution in my house - the man saw what distress I was in; I told him of it - he put his hand to his heart, and said - So help him G - d, there was not the least illegality in it; that he had known me in better circumstances, and only wanted to relieve me.</p>

               <p>Mr. PLATT on the following day, moved an arrest of Judgment, on the ground that the forged instrument should have been set out in the Indictment in the English language. The Learned Judge stated, that as this was the first conviction of its nature, he should reserve it on that and other points, for the consideration of the Twelve Judges.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose these glasses from that place? - I put them in a shop there for safety; I cannot justly say the time, it is three or four months ago; the shop is in the field, my house is against the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Your shop is not then the Queen's Head? - No, that is where I lodge; it is not my shop where I put them, it is the prisoner's master's shop, Mr. Edmondson, a coach-painter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his house? - In Warwick-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from there that they were lost? - No, it was up in the fields where they were lost; his shop is up in Maryle-bone-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not at the shop at the time they were missing? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see them after they were missing? - I saw this one glass about two hours after, it was standing up at the side of the shop, behind a large folding door, at Mr. Edmonson's shop; I know it by the frame, it is a painted frame, I took it when I took the public house, I keep the public house and am a coach-maker besides.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a coach painter, this man worked for the same master, Mr. Edmonson, as I do. On Saturday the 21st of last month, he and I were sent out to work, he was to assist me, the prisoner is a labourer, he used to grind colours; I sent him up to the barn, which is Mr. Edmonson's shop, in Mary-le-bone-fields, while I went home to get my breakfast; I had my breakfast, and went to see for him up there, and he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return? -  About a quarter before nine in the morning; I had left him in King-street, Golden-square; I supposed he was gone to breakfast, he comes in a little time after, he said he had been at breakfast, and Mr. Edmonson came, and he set me about another job, and this man and I did it; then he went away again, and I saw no more of him for about an hour, and he came back again and brought his boy with him, a lad about ten years of age; I wanted him to lend me a hand, to pull and haul the carriage, I asked him where he had been? he came and just went away again, then he went up stairs into the lost, I did not see him go up into the lost, but I heard him as I was at work underneath; there was nobody but he and I in the barn, and they could not get in without my seeing of him; I wondered who it was making a noise over my head, I hallooed out to him to lend me a hand to get the fore carriage under, and he comes down stairs, and he made rather a noise coming down the ladder, and I saw him bring this glass out, and I saw him put it behind a folding door, he had but this one that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he brought it from? - From one corner of the lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the glass standing? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150191"></xptr>In the lost, but in a convenient place for safety.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in the shop at that time? - I was in the shop at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he knew that you could see what he was about? - I don't know for that; I wanted him to assist me and he came to me rather fatigued, and said will you have any gin? he said he had had half a pint; I said I have drank one or two glasses this morning. I did not with to have any more. Mr. Bishop's public house joins to the shop, I went in to the mistress of the house, and asked her if she had any looking glasses in the barn? she said she had; she came in along with me; I told her that man had brought one down stairs; he said he knew nothing about it. I told him, what a wicked man you must be to deny it, when I saw you bring it down stairs. The boy was standing right facing of him while he was coming down stairs; this is the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the glass after it was put behind the door? - Bishop took it from behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept that glass till now? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Court to Bishop. You said, if I understand you right, three glasses were missing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the other two glasses? have you ever found them? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put these glasses yourself in that lost? - Yes, in a private place, three months ago.</p>

            When did you see him? - Not till I found that this glass was brought down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the glass behind the door? - I did</p>
               <p>Court to Pickering. Did you observe whether he was drunk or sober? - He was rather in liquor, but he knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never see the prosecutor but the last fortnight that he worked at my master's, I have worked for him ever since last June. My master, Mr Edmonson sent me up to the barn and ordered me to take some coals with me to dry a carriage (I lodge in Grosvenor-street, Golden-square) I went up to this lost for some light wood to light the fire, and I brought down this glass in my hand with some light wood; with that my prosecutor sent me to order a quartern of gin, and then he went out himself and came in again and brought Mrs. Bishop. I took the glass in one hand, and the old wood in the other to light the fire, I brought it down for safety, I thought it would be liable to be broke there, I thought it was my master's, I did not know that it belonged to Mr. Bishop, I have no witnesses, Pickering told Mrs. Bishop that I moved the glass with an intent of stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Court to Pickering. Did you see him bring down any fire wood? - Not a bit, he went up there for to light the fire, he did not light it, and when I went up there I light it myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My prosecutor he owed me some spite or other, and I could not make out what it was; it is not two sessions ago that he was tried here himself for thieving the colour of Mr. Creece.</p>
               <p>Court to Pickering. Is that true or false? was there any charge against you for stealing any colour? - I was tried here and was cleared.</p>

I have known the prisoner three years; I met her in Oxford-street on the night of the 30th of April, between the hours of eleven and twelve - she said her husband and her had fallen out, and he would not let her in doors that night; I took her home, and she slept in the same bed with me - my shawl was on a line in the room, and my gown-piece on the top of a box; I had two sovereigns in my pocket - I fastened the door with a bolt; I awoke between five and six o'clock in the morning - she was gone; I got up - I missed all these articles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever see me in the streets of London? A. Yes, I have seen you many times; you have spoken to me, and have drank in the Yorkshire Grey.</p>

             (Police-constable C 84). On the 3rd or 4th of May I went to where the prisoner lodged, in Oxford-buildings; I saw her daughter, who said her mother was out, and she had been out drunk all night - I sent her daughter to tell her I wanted to speak to her; she then absconded - I saw her in the street, but she ran from me; I afterwards took her from a brother-officer, and asked if she knew any thing of this robbery; she said No, but she had been out on the spree.</p>

               <p>ELIZA KEEFE. I am a servant out of situation - I live in White Lion-street, Soho. I went to the prisoner's house on the last Friday in April, in Oxford-buildings: I slept there four nights - I came home on the 1st of May; I did not lodge with her that night, but I saw her that night when she was going to bed - the next morning, before she was up, I gave her 2s. to get her children something to eat- I do not know the prosecutrix; the prisoner's husband is a pavior, and gone to work at Liverpool; they had no quarrel.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner on the Monday night - she had no victuals; she has eight children, and one in arms - her husband had left her only 2s; I said if she would send one of her little girls with me I would let her have 2s. or 3s. - I took the little girls, gave her 3s., and went to see her home; I saw her and Keefe go to bed -I lodge in White Lion-street; my husband is foreman at the gas-house - I have the prisoner's duplicates, and I find that on the Monday morning, at half-past eight o'clock, she pawned her shoes for 1s. 6d.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When was it you fell in with the prisoner, on the 30th of April or the 1st of May? A. On the 30th of April I met her in Oxford-street; I have had no quarrel with her - I had seen her once or twice in public-houses, and it being a disagreeable night, I took her in, and said I would give her part of my bed; when we got home, she said she disputed whether I was married to my husband, and I took the box in which my silver tooth-pick was in and showed her my certificate, and then she was satisfied - no one had access to my room, and I saw the articles safe when I went to bed; there are lodgers in the house, but they could not get into the room unless the bolt had been undone; I have never found any of the articles - I fell asleep about one o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170124"></xptr>and did not awake till near six; I then missed the prisoner and the property - the door was closed; I do not know how she came to bring up the question about my being married.</p>

               <p>COURT to WILLIAM TRODD. Q. Did you know of her applying for relief? A. I went to the workhouse on the Wednesday, and Mr. Turner told me that they put her out of doors, because she was so drunk; I understand her husband has sent her 15s. a week.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see her in the street? A. Yes, that was after she was charged with this, but she got from me in a moment - she was taken by another officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, at Woodcock-hill, Harrow—on Friday morning, 23d December, I had sixty-one lambs in a field near Kenton-bridge—I counted them on that morning—I saw them again on the Saturday, but did not count them—I counted them on the following Monday, and missed one—I searched the field to see if it had got out—I saw no gap—I then I looked in the drain and found the skin with the head on it; the carcase was gone—that was the skin and head of my lamb—I gave information to the police immediately—I afterwards went to the house of the prisoner John George, and found half a loin of lamb; one leg had been cooked—there was only the bone—there was also the fore part, with the shoulder on it, hanging up in the room up stairs—I compared the part that was uncooked with the skin of my lamb, and found a piece of flesh cut off with the skin, which exactly corresponded—that part was missing that was on the skin; it was behind the fore-leg—I then went to the house of William George, and found there the hind quarter, all cut up, and the fore part had only the shoulder cut off—there was only the breast and neck, which exactly fitted with the breast and neck found at the other prisoner's house—the meat found in the two houses made up the whole of one lamb—both the prisoners have worked for me—William was helping me to bind hay at this time—he was at my house, which is close to the field; he was there on the Friday—I saw nothing of him on the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>, T 57. I went with the last witness to the house of John George, and examined these joints of meat, and compared them with the skin—I agree with him as to their exactly corresponding—I also went to William George's, and saw some meat there—I asked him how he became possessed of it—he said he bought it <hi rend="italic">of Charley Grange</hi>, of Harrow, and gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I have no doubt that the meat found at each place were part of one lamb—John George said he bought the meat of Mr. Green, and gave 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

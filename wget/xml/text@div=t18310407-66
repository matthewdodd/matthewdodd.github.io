On the 27th of February, after two o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Cow-lane; I was sober - I had been with some friends, but was not insensible; I had not drank to excess - the prisoner was a stranger: she stopped me in Cow-lane, and asked me to accompany her home, which I refused - she walked with me to West-street; I desired her to leave me, but she wished me to go up a narrow turning, and I went just under a gateway, but refused going further with her; I was not there above a minute or two - a watchman came and said we must walk on; I told her to go her way, and I would go mine, but she would go the same way as me - she walked by my side to <placeName id="t18310407-66-crimeloc377">West-street</placeName>

I was with various shopmates, at a public-house in Park-street, at the foot of Southwark-bridge - it was a supper; I went there about eight o'clock - we supped at nine: a pot of porter passed round; there were about a dozen of us - I cannot say how many pots were drank; I drank nothing at supper but porter; and after that a glass of brandy and a glass of gin and water, nothing else; I swear that is all I had - I left the house about a quarter to two o'clock, and was sober enough to know what I was about; I could have made the woman go away if I had been inclined, but she pressed me to go under the gateway - I am not a bachelor; I was not more than two minutes under the gateway, as I suppose - we were doing nothing but chatting; she was pulling me about, but not I her - I did not say I had no money; nor that if she could find a house I would deposit my watch till morning; I did not feel her take it - the watchman came up almost immediately I missed it; the gateway is between King-street and West-street, but there is a turning leading into Smithfield before you get into West-street - I met the watchman in West-street; I was not in any court with her except the gateway, which leads out of King-street into West-street, I believe, but I was never through there - I turned out of my way to go there, but was not willing to go; she pulled me by my clothes - I swear nothing happened in the gateway; she had the watch grasped in her hand at the watch-house, and said I had given it to her, but I deny it.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat is between West-street and King-street, which was formerly called Cow-lane. About a quarter-past two o'clock I saw the prisoner and prosecutor in company between King-street and West-street, against the wall - I ordered them away; the man said, "You go your way and I'll go mine," but both went towards Cow-lane, and I saw no more till I called half-past two o'clock - I then saw them in West-street, at the corner of Phoenix-court, in West-street; I passed them - the man had been drinking, but could walk well enough: I said nothing to them then, because they were off my beat, but before I got round to John's-court, my inspector came running, and saying "Where is that woman gone?" I did not see the prosecutor then, not till he got to the watch-house; I found the prisoner in a privy about one hundred yards from Phoenix-court, with the watch in her hand - she asked me where her friend was, and said he had given her the watch; I told her he was near at hand, and took her to the watch-house - she never loosed it out of her hand till she got there, and said again at the watch-house, that he had given it to her for an improper purpose; I do not recollect what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were they together about your beat? A. Why, half an hour or more - she would not give the watch up till it was taken from her; she told me all the way along that he gave it to her, and pointed him out as her friend.</p>

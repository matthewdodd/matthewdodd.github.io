                  </hi>. I am a flour dealer of No. 11, Earl's Court Gardens, Kensington, and am the prosecutor in this case. I first knew the defendant in July last, and had dealings with him up to 23d Oct.—I received a verbal order on 22d Oct., from the defendant, at his house, requesting a delivery to him of ten sacks of flour—I sent five sacks next morning by my cart—I did not see them put into the cart, but I gave instructions to my man to go to the station and take a load of twenty-five sacks, five of which he was to deliver to the defendant—I called on the defendant on the Thursday follow<lb></lb>ing; Thursday was my usual day for calling—I did not say anything about the flour on that occasion; I called for money—I called on 7th Dec, and received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in part payment of some barrels of American flour delivered in August—I had also received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before that, which I placed to the balance which was owing—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. next day, and I said that the money should go, with the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been paid previously, to the payment of the five sacks which are now owing for—I asked him for the balance of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the barrels of flour which would close up the arrears, independent of these five sacks; he said, "No, I shall pay you for them as I think proper;" I said, "Certainly not;" and he said that he should pay me at his leisure, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—I had not at that time mentioned any particular date at which the five sacks were, delivered, but there was no quantity of five sacks delivered at once, at any other time—he admitted, after 23d Oct., that he owed me for the five sacks—he never disputed it till he was served with the writ; he told me that every time I called—I called every Thursday, but did not always see him—I saw him five or six times—the writ was issued 23d Jan., two days after this conversation—I was present, when the case was tried in the Sheriff's Court, and heard the defendant examined on his oath—he sworce positively, that he had never received the five sacks of flour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> And his wife swore the same thing, did not she? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was a pass book between us—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I made the entries in it, at his house, from time to time, and left it in his possession—when I stated, that this was the only lot of five sacks that I delivered, I meant that I delivered on that day—the last delivery was five sacks on 21st Aug.; but it was for the five sacks now owing for that I went for the money for—I found no entry here of five sacks delivered after 21st Oct.—I had this book in my hand, and could have entered the five sacks in it, if I had chosen—I had the book in my hand in Jan., when we were discussing about the flour—I dealt with him honestly—the five sacks, on 23d Oct., is not here, because I never had the book in my hand for two months; the excuse was, that it was lost.</p>

I was in the prisoner's service—I remember flour being delivered at his house on 1st Oct., it was not over good—it was in sacks; it did not work well—I remember the cart coming afterwards on 23d Oct.—it was on Friday, about three weeks after the first came—I know it was on Friday, because we had a second batch that day—Mr. Masters' cart came between 3 and 4 o'clock that day—the driver met Mr. Freeman on the pavement, and he said, "Can you tell me where Read lives;" Mr. Freeman said, "Wait a minute, I will put on my hat and show you"—I came up into the shop to ask a question of my master, and saw him and Fray going down the street—when the cart came I was in the bakehouse, and I looked up and saw Fray talking to Mr. Free<lb></lb>man—I heard the cart stop, that made me look up; I saw Mr. Freeman and Fray and the cart go off in the direction of Read's—the cart was drawn up by the side of the shop in Robert Street—there was no flour left at Mr. Freeman's by Fray that day—when flour is delivered, the cart is drawn up in Britten Street, which is round the corner—I am quite certain that on that occasion no flour was left by Mr. Fray—I saw Mr. Fray through the window, and I said, "I hope you are not going to bring any more of that rubbish here;" he said, "No I have none for you to-day;" this was on Friday 23d Oct.—Mr. Freeman had not any flour in Oct., except on the 1st—there was not any flour delivered till the middle of Jan.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Into what street does the bakehouse window look? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Into Robert Street—the other is in Britten Street, that is where the flour is delivered, about five yards from the shop door at the corner—I was not called at the trial—I have never stated that before to-day—the attorney questioned me on the subject, I did not tell him that I said to Fray, I hoped he was not going to bring any more of that rubbish—I called up through the bakehouse window to Fray—the rubbish was not brought in August; that was in barrels; the sacks were delivered on 1st Oct.—the flour in the sacks was not very good—that in the barrels was very inferior—I did not say anything on 1st Oct. about the rubbish—that in the sacks was the best, but that was inferior—I do not know anything about the money for that, that was left in the barrels—I had this conversation it might be six weeks ago, but I mentioned before to Mr. Freeman that I said to Fray, I hoped he was not going to bring any more of that rubbish, and he said that he had none for me to-day—I do not know whether my master heard it, he might have—he did not say to me "Do not you remember saying to Fray, 'You are not going to bring more of that rubbish here'"—I am now in the service of the defendant—I have been so about seven or eight weeks this time—I was taken on shortly before the trial; it might be a fortnight before—I had been away</p>

               <p>from him nine or ten weeks—I gave warning and left—he did not ask me to give warning; we had a few words, and I thought we had better be apart—I went back because he was getting a little busier—I was there on 23d Oct., I left on Saturday night, the third week in Jan.—I was away nine or ten weeks, and went into his service again about a fortnight before the trial—Mr. Freeman asked me if I would mind going up to the trial; that was to this trial, not to the other—I did not at first know that my master was taken to the Police Court about this charge—I did not know he was there before he was committed for trial, I did not know it till a month or five weeks ago—I knew it about a month back—I did not know he was charged—he did not ask me to come before the Magistrate to state what I knew—I saw him every morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the defendant's son, I am 15 years old, and am in his employ. I remember, some time in Oct., Fray, Mr. Masters' carman coming to my father's shop—he had a van with him which was drawn up in Robert Street, that is the street in front of the shop—it is not in that street that flour is delivered to my father's shop, but in Britten Street, round the corner—after the van had stopped, I heard the last witness speak—he was in the bakehouse—a person in the bakehouse can see into the street—he can Bee a cart or a van, and he could speak up from the bake-house to a person in the street—I heard him say, "I hope you have not brought us any more of that rubbish;" the carman said, "No, I have none for you to-day," and the van went away—it was not drawn up in Britten Street that day, and there was no flour delivered that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the bakehouse, the same that Honour was in—I did not go out of the bakehouse at all; I stopped in the bakehouse while the van was there—Honour was in the bakehouse all the time—I remember my father going away with Fray—I am quite certain that Honour remained in the bakehouse—my father was on the pavement in Robert Street—the place where the flour is delivered down into the bake-house is in Britten Street—that is the bakehouse that I was in—the bake-house looks into Robert Street, but the flour is taken in at the private door, down two flights of stairs, and then comes into the bakehouse—the first flight of stairs goes down to the yard, the flour is left there when we have no room in the bakehouse, but it is generally taken down—my father did not talk to me, and tell me that an action was brought against him for this money—I did not hear of it from him—my father has spoken to me about it, but not till the trial was over—my father knew that I was in the bakehouse—he did not ask me to go to the Sheriff's Court, and state that I was in the bake-house, and that the flour was not delivered—I do not recollect telling my father that I heard Honour say to Fray that he hoped he was not going to bring any more of that rubbish there—I recollected it two or three weeks ago, and yet I did not tell my father—I knew my father had been charged with swearing falsely that flour had not been delivered that day—I did not tell my father of this conversation, and that I heard Fray say, "I have none for you to-day"—I mentioned it to Mr. Pearce—I never mentioned it to any body before that—I had not been talking with Honour about it before that—I remember Honour leaving my father's service—I do not know what he left for—my father discharged him—I do not know that he charged him with anything—I remember his coming back some time in April—my father did not tell me why he was coming back—I did not talk over</p>

               <p>what I have now said with Honour—I did not say anything to him about it—I do not recollect when Honour first said that he had said to Fray that he hoped he was not going to bring any more rubbish—he did not tell me before I mentioned it to Mr. Pearce—I had not told Honour that I heard him say so—I told this to Mr. Pearce—I had not been pressed about it before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman. I drive my own horse and cart—I have worked for the defendant in carting flour from his place to Mr. Read's—I recollect in Oct. being at Mr. Read's house; the van was standing at Mr. Read's door—I saw it there delivering flour—I believe it to be Fray's van—the flour came from Mr. Masters—I saw Mr. Freeman in the shop, and he and I left together—we left the van standing at Mr. Read's door—the flour was delivered—I did not see Mr. Freeman go into the public house—we went together back to Mr. Freeman's shop—the distance between the two shops is about 200 yards—I have frequently carried flour from Mr. Freeman to Mr. Read's—on that evening, I was again in Mr. Read's shop; I had some conversation with him about flour—I did not see Mr. Read in his shop when I was there first; I went afterwards and saw him.</p>

Q.</hi> You are in the habit of taking flour from Mr. Free<lb></lb>man to Mr. Read's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—whether it was lent or sold is not my business—they were on friendly terms—I cannot say that I have seen them together, I have often seen each of them—I walked with Mr. Freeman to his shop—I went to do some repairs at his shop; I did them then—Mr. Freeman remained with me about ten minutes after I got back to his shop—I went away, leaving him at his shop—at the time I left Mr. Read's shop, the van was at his door—Mr. Freeman was in the shop—he was assisting in moving the sacks of flour—this was on 23d Oct.—I did not go to the Police Court nor to the Sheriff's Court.</p>

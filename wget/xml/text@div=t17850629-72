               <p>In what manner did he take these things from you? - I begged him to let my cloak alone, and I endeavoured to hold my cloak, and the other held a knife to my throat, then I let my cloak go; then they told me to go along about my business, and not follow them; I stood still and let them go, and then I was going to follow them, there being a public house near, and the other turned round with his knife, and swore he would run me through if I followed them; I did not go on then, I let them go off; I went to No. 8, in little Mary-le-bon-street, to a friend's house, and told them I was robbed.</p>

               <p>Had you light enough to distinguish the features of the persons that robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it after that the prisoners were taken? - The next day, one at four o'clock, the other at eight in the afternoon, I saw them the next day? I described them to the watchmen, and they went round to search for them, and saw them at a public house where they robbed me, not twenty yards off, there were fourteen or fifteen of them in company altogether, and I picked out the prisoners, I knew them perfectly well; I am now quite sure these are the two; I never saw them before the robbery, but I have no doubt but they are the persons; my cloak was never found.</p>

               <p>After I had cried ten on Wednesday the 29th of June, this woman came by my box crying, and the postman asked her the cause, she said two men were laying in the field, and they had robbed her, I went up and she told me the same, then I went and called my partner; she described them, and we went to search for them, we guessed partly who they were, the next day we went again, and she described them in the same manner again, and we went and took her to a house where these people resort.</p>
               <p>What house is that? - At the bottom of High-street, there is a skittle-ground , the man's name is Dickinson, there were about a dozen of them there, and she knew them when she came up, and before she came within a hundred yards she said them were the very men that attacked her the night before.</p>
               <p>Did she hesitate which it was? - Not a word, she fixed upon the two directly, I found a knife with two blades upon him, a common knife.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The knife that was put to me was a smallish knife, and much such a knife as that.</p>

             the watchman, and he told me of this robbery, the next day we went in pursuit and took the two prisoners, by the description the young woman gave us, the young woman went with one of the watchmen, which was Millar, then she saw the two men, and told him they were the two men; he did not think he could attack them both, so we went with him, and we took the prisoners, she was not with us then, I believe she was in a house in Baker street;. Cox was taken first, and the other some time after.</p>
               <p>Who took Cox? - There were Millar, Harry Jones, and I.</p>
               <p>Who took the other? - The other was taken by a man that is at the door, he is son in law to Millar, one of the watchmen; I was not present when the young woman shewed them to Millar ; they were taken some few minutes after.</p>
               <p>- MILLAR sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman , my comrade Jones brought this young woman to me on Wednesday night , and we went together to see if we could see them, but we did not that night; the next day between four and five my comrade told me that there were a great many people in the public house, so I went with the young woman over there, and she shewed them to us, it was between four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290097"></xptr> and five in the afternoon the next day, and she shewed me the two prisoners, they were the outside of the house.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take them then? - I was by myself, and I had nothing in my hands; I am very sure there was nobody with me but the young woman; if I had any assistance I would have taken them immediately.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you find your comrades to assist you? - My comrades was just on the other side of the chapel, a little distance off us, I went and told them, so they came the back way again; then Cox was there, and Bill was gone away, there were several people with the prisoners, but whether they were in their company I cannot say, there were above a dozen or better.</p>
               <p>How near did you go to them? - Within three or four yards, the young woman and me.</p>
               <p>So that she could see them very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she say anything to you in their hearing? - I cannot tell that they heard it, she told me them were the two lads that robbed her.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. How came you to tell me that you were present when the young woman pointed out to you these prisoners? - I did not tell you I was present; I told you she picked them out.</p>
               <p>You know the prisoner's conviction will be followed by a reward? - I am not beholden to the reward now nor any time, I can do very well without it.</p>
               <p>But you know the fact? - I have very often heard of it.</p>
               <p>Has there nothing of this sort been named now among you? - It has often been particularly mentioned.</p>
               <p>Court to Hoare. How came you not to tell me Millar went first of all to look for this man? - We went to the public house and wanted there till Millar and the young woman went to pick them out.</p>
               <p>Court. That is nothing like your former evidence.</p>

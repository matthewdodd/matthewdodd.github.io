             return again. - A. At one o'clock he came down into the kitchen to me, Rebecca a little girl about nine years old, a child of theirs, was sitting with me in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came home and came down to you in the kitchen, at that time where was the prisoner. - A. In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether any body was in the parlour with her. - A. Yes, she was engaged with a gentleman; he sent Rebecca up to tell her mother he wanted his dinner, Rebecca came down and said he was to have it presently, he seemed to be in a passion, and in about a quarter of an hour he sent the child up again, he sent word that he knew Mr. Brant was in the parlour, Rebecca said, no father it is Mr. Coggan, he said he knew it was Brant, he went up stairs in a violent passion, and looked out of the one pair of stairs window, to see who went away; when Mr. Brant went away he mobbed him out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Brant quit the house. - A. No, I heard him mob him, I did not see him; then Mr. Brown came down stairs into the parlour, Mrs. Brown and he had some words, I heard them at words, I did not hear what passed; Mrs. Brown said, I believe, she would not have any of her friends insulted, while he, the husband, lived upon the prostitution of her body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said upon that. - A. I do not know that he said any more. I and Mrs. Brown and the child went to dinner, and Mr. Brown went out before we went to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it you dined. - A. I think it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner dine with you. - A. She was in the room, she did not eat with us. After dinner Mrs. Brown wanted me to pledge a large looking glass, I refused to do it, she fetched Ann at Mrs. Turner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a person that lived with her formerly before. - A. Yes, she occasionally used to be at Mrs. Brown's, she sometimes jobbed at one house, and sometimes at another, she fetched her to go out with it, she took the glass to the pawnbroker's, and just as she came back, Mrs. Brown got a trunk to pack up her clothes, Mr. Brown came in again.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say at about what time that was. - A. No, I could not tell, there was no clock in the house, he went out about two o'clock and had been absent the best part of an hour. I believe it was about three o'clock Mrs. Brown said to him I am about to leave you to night as soon as he came in, I will take Louisa with me, as for Rebecca you shall keep. Mr. Brown said he did not care he would be d - d if Brant should come there, he was a bad man, I do not know what answer Mrs. Brown made. I believe the answer she made was rather angry. He went up stairs to the bed chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the room over the parlour. - A. Yes, he was gone a good while, Mrs. Brown was sorting and packing up her things, we were both in the parlour together, I went down into the kitchen to go into the yard, but did not stay longer than ten minutes. I came back and found Mrs. Brown in the parlour sitting at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things packed up. - A. Yes, some of them and some not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you went down into the kitchen to go into the yard could you tell from what you saw in the parlour when you returned whether she had been employed in packing up more things or whether the things were in the same state on your return. - A. I cannot tell that. Mrs. Brown went out of the door to Mrs. Orpwood's door, but on what account I do not know. Mrs. Orpwood lives at No. 4, Mrs. Brown's house is No. 2. I heard the noise of something like the motion or lumbring of a chair, I ran out to Mrs. Brown and met her just at Mrs. Orpwood's door. I said Mrs. Brown go up stairs something is the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You knew that Mr. Brown was up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the mere motion of a chair to raise an alarm in your mind. - A. I do not know, he was very quiet, I thought he might have fell off the bed, and as they had some words I thought there was something the matter, the noise was like the feet of a chair rubbing or scraping on the ground, I asked her to go up stairs and she would not go up stairs, she sent me, she said go up and fetch that little box of tickets out of the corner drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. What box was it. - A. The box that some duplicates were in. I went up stairs and saw Mr. Brown hanging up at the bed-post.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a four-post bed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the bed was it that the cord was fastened upon, which he was hanging upon. - A. Up at the round nob by which the rings run.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040011"></xptr>Q. Describe how the cord was fastened round the knob. - A. That I cannot, I had a small knife in my hand. I had been ripping Mrs. Brown's stays, I had that knife in my hand, I ran up stairs with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that post that Brown was hanging higher than your head. - A. Yes, it was about as high as that knob. I did not get up upon any thing to cut it. I cut it and he slipped upon the bed. His body was hanging, his feet was rather dragging on the ground, and his toes were turned underneath as much as I could recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. And his toes turning inward under the bed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Do you recollect the position of his knees, whether they were strait or bent. - A. No. I ran down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed or undressed. - A. Dressed.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the thickness of the cord. - A. It was but a small cord, I cannot tell, I took it down in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell from the appearance of the bed whether he had been lying on the bed. - A. I could not tell, nor could I tell whether the bed was made or no.</p>
               <p>Q. When you cut the rope how high did you cut the rope. - A. As high as the knob, I reached it.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now that it was as high as that knob. - A. Yes, I cut it in the middle, and then it all fell down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Do you mean that when you cut the rope in the middle at that place at the knob, there must be some remaining. - A. That came down all at once.</p>
               <p>Q. When you cut the cord, did you cut the cord or a loop. - A. I cut the loop I believe, I do not know, I was in such a fright I cut it so that it all came down together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you cut the loop and it all came down so together, was the rope in two pieces or one piece. - A. In two pieces. I do not know whether it was put on double or single.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not know whether the rope was tied double or single. - A. No my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. When you cut the rope which way did the body fall. - A. It fell upon the bed, he hung withinside, he hung in that position that when the cord was cut part of his body was on the bed and part of his legs on the floor. As soon as I cut him down I ran down stairs and said oh, Mrs. Brown, he has hung himself, and here is the rope, and I throwed the cord behind the fire not knowing what I was doing of.</p>
               <p>Court. You ran down stairs with the cord, how did you get the cord off the man's neck, I took the cord off his neck. I thought he was not dead, I undid his shirt collar and his handkerchief, not then I believe, but when I went up again. When I said to her oh Mrs. Brown he has hung himself, she said oh, Mrs. Andrews no; send for Rebecca.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you bring the cord down in your hand. - A. I do not know, for I took and smacked it behind the fire, I thought I should find him alive when I went up again. I put it immediately behind the fire before I knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Rebecca at this time. - A. At Mrs. Woollaston's, after she said send for Rebecca, Mrs. Brown went to the door and Mrs. Woollaston was passing by, she said send Rebecca home. When Rebecca came, she went and fetched Mr. Bennett, when Rebecca came in Mrs. Brown said go up stairs your father is in a fit. Rebecca went up stairs and I went with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she said any thing to you about a fit before that. - A. No. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. When you came down stairs first of all did she at that time express to you what she thought was the occasion of his death. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first time that you heard the word fit was when Rebecca came in. - A. Yes. I think she said he was in a fit, when Rebecca came Mrs. Brown said oh fetch Mr. Bennet, he is a surgeon, Mr. Bennet came and said he was no more. Mrs. Brown went up stairs with him and was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Bennet examine the deceased's person. - A. No. I dont think he did at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he told what was the occasion of his decease - A. I did not, I said I found him at the bottom of the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Bennet when he went there first, that you found him hanging at the foot of the bed. - A. No. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you. - A. I had no reason for not telling him except my fright.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any thing said to Mr. Bennet about his dying in a fit. - A. Yes, I told him that Mr. Brown died in a fit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Why did you tell him that Mr. Brown died in a fit. - A. That I can give no account, I must have been quite lost.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him that Mr. Brown died in a fit was Mrs. Brown present. - A. Yes. Mrs. Brown said nothing to my knowledge, Mr. Bennet told us to lay him on the bed, then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you unbuttoned his shirt collar. - A. The second time of my going up stairs, I think Rebecca was with me, I saw the black mark of the string about his neck, I did not say any thing about it. I was not there when Mr. Bennet came the second time, I was fetched to Aliffe Street, where I was nursing, I staid about an hour after Mr. Bennet was gone and had some tea.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were down stairs with Mrs. Brown had you any conversation with her concerning the death of Mr. Brown. - A. No. I do not think we had any, we talked about laying him out, a neighbour came in, I said he died in a fit and Mrs. Brown said so, when Mrs. Orpwood came in and 
               <persName id="t18111204-6-person118">Ann</persName>
             the servant I was going to lay him out, and then I was fetched away, and I was fetched to the jury on the Thursday or the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time that you mentioned that you found him hanging. - A. Not till the officer took me to Lambeth Street office, I believe on the following Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What day were you examined by the coroner. The day that this man came by his death was on Tuesday. - A. Yes, I think I was examined by the coroner on the Friday, and I think it was the Tuesday following, that was the first time that ever I mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040012"></xptr>about seeing him hanging by the neck.</p>

               <p>Q. You were examined two or three days after by the coroner, your fright was quite subsided. - A. I told him the same that I did before, and I don't know when I did it, I had been up night and day with a lady, my head was very bad at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What aged man did he appear to you to be. - A. I thought he was near forty, I do not know what age he was, he was pretty hearty all but his knee, he had been in the hospital a month, he could eat and drink hearty, there was something the matter with his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs and found him hanging, did you see near him any chair. - A. There was a chair standing sideways to the bed, it was standing in the place it usually stood, I had before seen it there, the chair was close by the body, the arm-chair stood almost at the bottom of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a cord as that. - A. Yes, it was a smallish cord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mrs. Andrews, I understood you to say that you went into the yard for about ten minutes. - A. Yes, leaving the prisoner packing up the trunk, putting her clothes together, I left her in the parlour, and I found her in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came back she was engaged in packing up the things. - A. Yes, and looking in her drawers, and putting her clothes together what she was going to take away.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the object she had in view when you went out in the yard she was carrying on when you returned. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did return you heard the noise like the scraping of a chair. - A. Yes, a few minutes after I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at the time that you returned and you heard the scraping. - A. She had gone out to Mrs. Orpwood's door, she stood at Mrs. Orpwood's door, I ran to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards, when you went up stairs into the room, the chair was in the situation of having been removed from the place in which it had been, and it was at the foot of the bed. - A. The chair was very near to the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a person had been disposed to hang himself, could you conceive a chair to be put more convenient for such a purpose. - A. I do not know, it always stood there.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be used for that purpose. - A. I do not know but it might.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he was a hearty man, and that he had a weakness in his knee. - A. He appeared to be a hearty man, he had very good use of his hands, and too much of his tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that from the weak state of his body, that any body could have hang'd him. - A. He was very strong and very spitefull, I do not think that any body could have hang'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that a man would suffer himself to be hanged up by a woman, or any body else without using his hands. - A. You will know that by the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no marks of violence found upon her. - A. No.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, in York Street, two doors from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of November was the prisoner at your house. - A. In the afternoon she came into my shop a little before four I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she remain with you. - A. Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe after that you saw the child Rebecca. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing between you and Rebecca, did you go to the house of Mrs. Brown - A. I went to enquire, and Mrs. Andrews answered me, Mrs. Brown was sitting in the parlour with the parlour door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she hear what passed between you and Andrews. - A. Yes, I think she could, I asked what was the matter, Mrs. Andrews said Mr. Brown had died in a fit, Mr. Bennet had been sent for, and he said he was no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of Mrs. Brown while she was sitting in the parlour. - A. She was full of grief, she asked me if I would assist Mrs. Andrews, and lay him out, I said I would come bye and bye.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Andrews said that Mr. Brown had died in a fit, did Mrs. Brown say any thing to that. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went again in the course of the afternoon to lay him out. - A. Yes, about a quarter before six, when I went the second time they were at tea in the parlour; Mrs. Andrews took a bason of water, soap, and towel, she went up stairs first, Mr. Brown was laying upon the bed as if he was asleep, he was dressed, I observed a small black mark on the front of his neck; I saw the prisoner the next morning, she seemed full of grief.</p>

            . I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of November last, I think you went twice to the house of the deceased. - A. I was. The first time I went it was five o'clock in the afternoon, Rebecca, the daughter of the deceased, came to me crying, I went to the house, I was shewn the deceased by Mrs. Andrews; Mrs. Brown followed me up stairs; Mrs. Andrews told me that he had been in a fit, this was in the hearing of the prisoner, he was lying on the bed on the right side, I immediately unbuttoned his waistcoat and felt his body, which was rather warm, but his extremities were cold, I said he was quite dead, Mrs. Brown immediately was struck with surprise and grief, and very much alarmed; Mrs. Brown said at first that she hoped he was not dead, I told her that he was quite dead, she said to Mrs. Andrews, you know what there is, let the furniture go, do the best you can for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Andrews said he died in a fit, did Mrs. Brown say any thing. - A. No, she neither confirmed it, or contradicted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time examine his person. - A. I only put my hand in at his body, and opened his mouth, his position on the bed was so that I could not see his neck, I went away, and said I was sorry for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040013"></xptr>Q. From your examination of him, and from what you observed, and from what Mrs. Andrews said had you formed any other opinion than that he died in a fit - A. I had not then, knowing Mrs. Andrews before. I was sent for again, and when I went there the second time I saw Mrs. Orpwood, and the body was removed on the floor; Mrs. Brown was in the room, and I think Mrs. Andrews, but I am not sure; I examined the body then all over, I discovered the mark round his neck, that was pointed out by Mrs. Orpwood; I then said there was no doubt he had died of strangulation, by the effect of a cord round his neck. I said I would call upon Mr. Robinson the high constable; Mrs. Brown said she would leave it to me to do what I thought proper, she did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is it your opinion now that Brown died of strangulation - A. It is my clear opinion; I believe hanging and strangulation are synonomous. It was by hanging as near as I could judge, and such a cord of this dimension would make such a mark as that; it was a small mark; the indent was all round, under the left side it was deeper; it came up to a point the two cords just under his ear. It appeared to me as if the whole body had been suspended by the cord.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the day that this unfortunate circumstance happened - A. Yes, on the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time in the day did you and your husband hear any thing in Brown's house - A. Yes, at half past three; I was in my kitchen ironing, my plates and dishes rattled on the shelf as I was ironing; I put my ear to my dresser, hearing a great noise; I heard Mrs. Brown say blast your eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know her voice - A. I do, so well as to be certain what I heard was her voice, and I heard another voice answer the same language to her; it was a man's voice, but who it was I really cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you think you heard a man's voice say what - A. D - n your eyes. I went up into my parlour, and opened my window, and looked out of the window. I thought I should see something the matter; I saw nor heard nothing. I did not know that he was dead until one o'clock the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Brown - A. Yes; he was a good natured man; he was a very nice sizeable man, he was between forty and fifty; he had been out of the hospital a month or five weeks. When he came out of the hospital I asked him how he did, he said, quite charmingly, except his knees failed him; he looked well.</p>

When I went to Mrs. Brown's house I saw Mrs. Andrews and Mrs. Brown; Mrs. Brown said, oh, Ann, stand my friend, see what you can do for me; Mrs. Andrews replied, poor Mr. Brown, he is gone, he died in a fit. Mrs. Brown was very uneasy indeed, and seemed to fret very much; Mrs. Brown said, Ann and you can lay Mr. Brown out; Mrs. Brown said she had not got a decent sheet. I went and got a pair of sheets out at the pawnbrokers; Mrs. Andrews then said, when we have had a cup of tea we will go up stairs and lay him out; Mrs. Andrews took the bason, soap and towel and went up, Mrs. Orpwood went up, Mrs. Orpwood dicovered the mark in his neck. I then went down to Mrs. Brown, I said, step up stairs, there is something for you to see. She came and said, oh, dear lad, what he has done to himself; she saw his throat and said, go directly for Mr. Bennet. I went for Mr. Bennet, he came.</p>

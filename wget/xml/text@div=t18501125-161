                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper's assistant—in April I lodged in Sutton-street, Soho. On 10th April I saw the prisoner about eleven o'clock in the morning, in the parlour of the Canterbury Arms, in Lam<lb></lb>beth—he came in with Anderson—they both spoke to me—there was a game of skittles to be played between me and one of the name of Jones—the prisoner said he would take the chalk, and see that the game was played fair—I played one game for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then Jones made me a bet of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I could not knock the skittles down in nine throws—I said I would bet him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me, and I went to 3, Sutton-street, Soho, where I lived, and asked George Williams, my landlord, to lend me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got thirty sovereigns, twenty half-sovereigns, and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-bank-note—I returned to the Canterbury Arms with James Chick, who I had met in St. George's-road—he went with me to borrow the money, and returned with me to the Canterbury Arms—when I got back, it might be twelve or half-past twelve o'clock—I found the prisoner, Jones and Anderson, and one of the name of Strong in the parlour—they sent for some sausages, and two or three bottles of wine—we then went in the skittle-ground—I put down 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one of the party said, "You had better play for a bottle of wine before playing for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I put down the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the table—Chick was at the table—the prisoner was marking the chalks in the middle of the skittle-ground—the bottle of wine was brought in—</p>

               <p>I played the game for the bottle of wine with Jones—the prisoner took the chalk—I lost, and then Jones made away, and Chick, Strong, and Anderson prevented me from going away—when I went out of the skittle-ground, I went to see if I could see anything of Jones—the prisoner remained in the skittle-ground with the other three—I returned to the skittle-ground afterwards, and they were all gone, and my money was gone—I had put down 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the commencement of the game, and Chick said, "I have got Jones's money, I might as well have yours"—I then put down the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that, the bottle of wine was played for; I lost it, and Chick handed the money over to Jones as I suppose, and Jones got away—while this was going on, the prisoner was about half-way down the skittle-ground, and he was gone when I came back—I had not lost that money in the game that I played; I played for a bottle of wine—the bet was for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.:I never played that game at all—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner after that till now.</p>

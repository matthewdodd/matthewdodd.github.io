                  </hi>. I am chief of the audit-office of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company—the prisoner was in the service of the, Com<lb></lb>pany, and had been so, I should say, about three months—he had to register what we call the excess baggage, principally that which we forward to the continent—the sheets are printed in duplicate—on the extreme right he enters the number of passengers, the number of packages, and the excess, weight, which is the weight of the passengers' baggage over that which is allowed by the Company; and in the next column he enters the amount charged for that excess weight—the number applies not only to the excess, but to the whole number and the whole weight, the net weight that is charged for—the number is the whole number, and the weight is only the excess weight—this sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the prisoner's handwriting—it is number 332, filled up by the prisoner—this is his own duplicate, which is afterwards sent to my office—it ought to be an exact copy of the ticket given to the guard—the way bill and the passenger's ticket show, weight, 200lbs. charge 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., while his own duplicate leaves those columns in blank—those columns being left blank in the return made to my office would indicate that there was no excess weight and no charge—the passenger's ticket and the guard's way bill correspond exactly—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book for Paris and Calais, which it was the prisoner's duty to keep—this sheet numbered 332 is his writing—that does not show any sum charged for excess luggage—if he had received any sum charged for excess luggage in respect of this number it was his duty to eater it in this book—there are two other sums received on that same day for excets by two other trains, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one case, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the other—the total of those two sums is made up at the end of the next day, Sunday, the 28th, with 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more received on that day—the total is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had tickets which properly account for those three sums—there is "No, 347, 2 passengers, 3 packages, 56 lbs. excess weight, charge 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the next is "No, 354, 1 passenger, 1 baggage, 28lbs. excess weight, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—on Sunday, 28th,"No. 370, 1 passenger, 3 packages, 56lbs. excess weight, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—those are exact specimens of what they all ought to be, the ticket of the passenger, the ticket of the guard, and that book—the duplicate of this sheet 361 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), on the 28th, is the pri<lb></lb>soner's handwriting—it is, "No. 361, 1 passenger, 5 packages, 392lbs. excess weight, and 58<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received"—in the book, "1 passenger, 5 packages, and no excess weight or amount"—No. 389, on 29th, is all in the prisoner's handwriting—on the duplicate there is "2 passengers, 3 baggages, no weight, no amount"—on the guard's bill, and on the ticket given to the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. F. H. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner had been about two or three mouths in the Company's service, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he is seventeen years of age, and son of Lieutenant Colonel Beckham, who dis<lb></lb>tinguished himself in the Peninsular War, I believe—the guard's ticket and the passenger's ticket would come back to the audit-office—they would give notice to the Company of what was the excess of weight, and what was the amount received—he ought to have made out a sort of check for himself—he would enter the amount, weight, &amp;c. from the duplicate into the book—if it were wrong in the duplicate, and copied from there faithfully, it would be wroug in the book—that book is called the "Continental luggage-book," and from that book it was his duty to enter into another book, the small cash-book—that is merely a statement of the totals—there was a drawer for the money which he received, in the prisoner's office—I don't know whether there were other clerks who used to put money in the same drawer—I cannot undertake to say that it was not so—there were usually two luggage clerks—there may have been three on one or two occasions, but very seldom indeed—they would not have the same duty as the prisoner at the same time—they would assist him—I don't think three ever were in the office at the same time—I should imagine if they received money for the luggage it would be their duty to put it in the till as well—the prisoner would make the ticket out for the sum received, whether he had it or not—it was his duty to make out the duplicate—he would not make out the passengers, the number of packages, and the excess of weight, and leave it to the person who received the money to put in the amount, certainly not—he would make out the whole of the ticket, notwithstanding he had not received the money, although he might have seen it paid—one would make out one part of the bill and one the other, but it is impossible to know how they would arrange it—all No. 332 is the prisoner's handwriting, and the duplicate—I cannot say whether he received that 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or whether one of the clerks who assitsted him did; and the other sum, the second charge in the indictment, would come under the same head—there are a great number of persons come in about the same time to have their luggage weighed, when we are busy—we were not busy at this time—the latter end of September we were doing very little business in fact—even if there was no excess the prisoner would have to give tickets if the passengers wished their luggage registered—I should say the proportion of persons of those who did pay excess to those who did not would be about ten to one, or not so many as that; and if the ten passengers wished their luggage marked and registered, it would still be the prisoner's duty to do it—I have heard of cases of passengers who are dis<lb></lb>honest enough to go away without paying at all—in those cases the ticket would be made out in the same way, but he would not hand it to the passenger unless he received the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I mean where the ticket has been handed to the passenger, and he has gone away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An intelligent clerk would never allow himself to be cheated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240065"></xptr>
               <p>in that way—we have pointed out some sums to the prisoner as having been omitted—his attention has been directed to them by the proper authority, and the money handed over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just take those green tickets in your hand again; do those show every ticket issued by the prisoner, whether there is excess laggage charged on them or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when there is excess—there are twenty-one registered to Paris on 27th, three by the 7 A.M. train, which is the one in respect of which the complaint is made on 27th and 28th—the whole of the vouchers on that occasion are made out by the prisoner—I have known such a case as a clerk in the office writing one part of the ticket, and he the other—the person who was receiving the money would know what sum to charge, by the weight being called out to him through the window—according to the ordinary course of practice the person who is in the office taking the weight on the ticket is the person who also receives the money—I know of no one assisting the prisoner on 37th, 28th, or 29th—I know Berlin assisted him on 28th—the prisoner proffessed to account every day—the omissions that I speak of were small sums that we were able to discover had been omitted—in than cases we had no means—those small sums amounted in the month to about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have a travelling auditor who goes to different stations when he thinks proper—whatever the pri<lb></lb>soner's excuse was, it was accepted at the time—we discover it when we go through the accounts, and after the tickets are sent to us; that is how we discovered it—the tickets are returned to us for that purpose, from France, and we return theirs in the same manner—six passengers took tickets on 28th, by the 7 o'clock train, and five on the 29th—the prisoner would have to attend to the local passengers, but not to passengers for Paris—I know by that book how many the local patseigers are—when luggage is over the weight allowed, then it is excess weight, and it is charged—there were two local passengers on 27th who were excessed, none on 28th, and none on 29th—there is no system of registeration unless there is excess.</p>

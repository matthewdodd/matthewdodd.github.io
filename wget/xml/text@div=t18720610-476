                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Echo,</hi> which is a British ship—the prisoner was an ordinary seaman on board—on 4th May, between 12 and 1 o'clock I was in the forecastle with the prisoner, having my dinner—some words occurred between us about cleaning out the forecastle—I asked him several times if he would clean it out, and he made no answer—I said "Silence gives no consent, you ought to say Yes or No, and then we will know what to do"—at last he said he would not do it at all—and I said "You never intended to"—and he said "No"—I said "Then you will have to do it, or you will go to the master, and you will know the reason"—he began to set up a lot of <hi rend="italic">jaw</hi> to me—I asked him "Who he was setting up his <hi rend="italic">jaw</hi> to"—and he says "To you"—I says "I want no noise, no <hi rend="italic">jaw,</hi> or nothing from you," and I told him to hold his noise—he told me to <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> up—I says "If you go on I shall have to give you a <hi rend="italic">lift"</hi>—he kept on daring me strike him for four or five minutes—he said "Hit me, if you dare"—I did not want a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with him nor no one else, and then at last I got a little out of temper, and I got up, but not intending to hit him at all—the ship gave a lurch, and with the forecastle being so greasy I was on the top of him before I knew where I was—I believe I hit him with my open hand at the side of the head—I saw him then with a knife in his hand—I saw it across my right ribs—it cut my jacket—then we had a scuffle—I tried to get the knife away—we went under the ladder leading on to the deck—his hand escaped from mine and the next I know I was stabbed across the forehead—I held him under the ladder for a good while and I called for a man, and said "Will you take the knife out of his hand, he has stabbed me?"—the man did not come—I held him till I was <hi rend="italic">that</hi> faint from loss of blood. I let him go and went up. the forecastle ladder to get the wound dressed—he said "You are a coward, you run away when you see blood"—I went and called the master, and he dressed my wound—it stopped about three minutes, and then it <hi rend="italic">bursted</hi> out again, and lasted from 12 o'clock till 6.30—I bled till I went out of my senses—it was a severe wound—I have ne feeling in that part of my head—he was getting his dinner with the knife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I was master of the <hi rend="italic">Echo</hi>—the prosecutor came to me with a cut on his forehead—it looked a very bad wound and bled a great deal—I dressed it—I afterwards sent for the prisoner and asked him to account for it—he said that they had done it in the scuffle, and he would do so to anyone that struck him; that Stevens struck him first—I made an entry in the log-book.</p>

               <p>out the forecastle; we had words about it. He said I should do it every morning, and swore at me. He threatened to strike me in the eye. We rolled on a stick. In the struggle I struck him with the knife as if I had a stick in my hand, it was not a stab. I was cutting my dinner with the knife. The captain sent for me and asked me how I did it, and I said "He struck me when I had the knife in my hand, and I struck him in the scuffle, and I would strike everyone who struck me."</p>

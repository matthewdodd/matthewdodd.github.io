               <p>William Jackson. On the 24th of Dec. the prisoner brought a hat to me to pawn for six shillings. He came about an hour and half after that to my man to fetch it out, when my man put it on the counter. The prisoner had somebody without the shop door who push'd it open, and the prisoner took the hat up and run away with it, without paying for it. My man run after him, and took him with the hat upon him, and brought him back, and he confessed several such like things he had done that very night.</p>

               <p>I pawned this hat for 6 s. and went back again in about an hour for it. I thought I had money enough about me. I was looking over it, and found I had not enough. I desired he'd take what I had and I would go and fetch the rest. I went out and he followed me and took the hat from me. I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He offered me no money while he was in the shop. When he was taken then he did, 3 shillings and some halfpence, and the hat too, if I would let him go.</p>

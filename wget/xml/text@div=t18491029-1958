One afternoon, about the 10th of last May, I was playing on Clapham-common—the prisoner came up to me and asked me to run—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Pull off your boots," and said he would mind them—Hughes, who was with me, was to run also—we were to start at Clapham Church, go to the pound and back again, and then the last was to have two pence, a knife, and a pair of German silver studs, and the other one six pence—he showed them to us, and gave Hughes the knife to put in his boots, and me the pair of studs to put in my boots, and I left my boots in his charge—we went to the place and ran back again, and when we got back he was gone and the boots too.</p>

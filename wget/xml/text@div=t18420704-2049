                  </hi>. I am single, and keep a chandler's shop in Francis-street, Stratford. On the 29th of June I was in the parlour behind my shop—somebody called, and I went into my shop, and saw the prisoner he asked for a rasher of bacon—immediately he went out I missed the bacon, and told a policeman, who brought it back directly with the prisoner.</p>

Q.</hi> When I came into your shop did riot you state that I had the bacon at the time I was buying a rasher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said you must have taken it before I came into the shop—I did not miss it till you were gone—you were dressed as a sweep.</p>

               <p>about half-past nine o'clock, and saw a soot-bag at the corner of Chapel-street—I watched it, in consequence of what Torrence had said about a quarter of an hour before, and saw the prisoner go up, and put some. thing into it—I went up to him, found the bacon, and said, "You have stolen this piece of bacon"—he said he had not, he had bought it—I asked him where—he said, in the Broadway, Stratford—I took it to the prose<lb></lb>cutrix—she identified it—I offered to go with the prisoner to any place he might have bought it at—he would not go.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his Christian name? -John. On Wednesday, the 29th of July, about half past nine, I went from the New square, Lincoln's-inn-fields, to Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury, home to sleep; on going up the steps I attempted to ring the bell for admission, I believe it was then ten minutes before ten; on going up the steps of the street door I was going to ring the bell, but on turning my head I see the door was on a jar; I then did not ring, but pushed the door open with my hand; at the foot of the stairs in the passage, I see the prisoner at the bar and another man, each with a knife case in their arms, on seeing them three I asked them what they wanted? there was a lamp in the passage, they were under that lamp; on asking them what they wanted the prisoner at the bar, who was nearest me, answered, it is only a mistake; I then said, what do you mean by a mistake, you have been robbing the house, they said they had not, both of them, the prisoner said again it is only a mistake; I asked them what business they had with the knife cases in their hands? they made me no answer; the prisoner attempted to pass me, being first; I stopped himm, and laid hold of him by the collar, and told him be should not go till he could give me a better account of himself; a struggle then ensued, and the prisoner attempting to escape made his escape down the steps of the door; I had still hold of him; his companion was a distance behind at the foot of the steps; finding he could not get from me, he threw down this knife case on the pavement; he then threw back his arms as if he would have struck me, but he did not; on his throwing down the knife case his companion passed, and ran away, on his running away I called out steop thief! and watch! several times; I still kept hold of the prisoner; on my calling out watch, a watchman and a number of people came to my assistance; I delivered charge of the prisoner to the watchman, and at my feet lay this knife case, which I took up and took it into the house, and I found it contained twelve knives and eleven forks, the knife case was broke to piece, I took and set it down, and knocked violently against the door, and two of our maid servants came up; on my first going in to the door I see no marks of violence whatever, the door was in its usual state, and the key hanging on the arm of the chain, where it ususally does; I went up stairs for a pistol, and I searched the rooms, and found nothing material; the same night I missed, besides the two knife cases, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160227"></xptr>trunk; I don;t know what the trunk contained; I went to the watch-house and the prisoner was there, and there was produced to me a spoon which I believe to be the property of Mr. Fonblanque.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you identify any of the property? - The knife case I can; the knife case was on the side board in the front parlour, close to the passage, and the trunk was in the passage up the stairs; I see the knife case before I went out, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a judge of the value of these things? - Not particularly I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that is the knife case of Mr. Fonblanque? - I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had you lost sight of the person, whoever he was, before you got the watch-house? - About ten minutes; from the time that I delivered him to the watchman, and the time that I see him at the watch-house, might be about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave charge of the same person to a watchman? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you whether you did not pitch on a person that did not turn out to be the prisoner at the bar, when you got to the watch-house? - No, I did not, I am quite sure of it; the prisoner at the bar was among a number of others, and he was behind them, and I looked about till I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never pitch on another man first? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Are any of these servant girls of the house here? - They are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you suppose these men got in; can you give any account of it? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that young man, Ellis, did he deliver to you a prisoner, at any time? - Yes, on Wednesday, the 29th of July, past ten o'clock, the prisoner at the bar, on suspicion of breaking open the house, and taking knives and forks; I searched him, and found a silver strainer in his pocket, and two or three keys belonging to his father.</p>
               <p>Q. You have kept the strainer ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Ellis. Does that belong to Mr. Fonblanque? - I believe it does.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed such a one? - I did, from a plate in the closet, in the same parlour where the knives were taken from, it was supposed to be left on the side table where the knife case was.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it? -Some days before, in the closet of the parlour, the crest is exactly the same, a family crest, a helmet.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses who gave him a very good character, said he had been an apprentice to a taylor, and lately had worked with his father in the bricklayering line.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier, and live at No. 167, Aldersgate-street. On or about the 7th of October the prisoner came to my shop, and bought goods to the amount of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he presented this cheque—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—the prisoner wrote on the back of it in my presence—I know it to be the same—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" October 7th, 1841. "Messrs. Hoare and Co. Please to pay Mr. Montague, or bearer, the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on demand. W. <hi rend="smallCaps">JACK<lb></lb>SON</hi>."—(on the back was written, "21, John-street, Clerkenwell") on his producing the cheque, I said it was not customary for us to do these things, but being so small an amount, if he would write the address of the drawer I would not mind it in this case—and on that he wrote the address on the back, in pencil—he gave me no farther account of the parties—I believe he answered my question, that he was Mr. Montague, but I will not swear that—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I—believe at Guildhall you said you gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said nothing of the kind—you gave the address, "No. 12, Finsbury-place," and said I was to send the articles there in the course of the after-noon.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you send them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took them myself—I found, in the course of the afternoon, the cheque was a forgery, and I took the goods with a view of detecting it, if possible—I found no such person as W. Jackson or Montague there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier at Messrs. Hoare's. No person named W. Jackson banks at the house—there is no such account—I do not know the handwriting of this cheque, only from seeing some of the kind before, in different names, but the same handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. A person named Jackson gave me the forged order, which I uttered in the first case; I sent a note to him while I was in the Compter, but he never came; I have been out of a situation some time, but have lived upon my friends, and did not want money; the prosecutor gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in copper, change, and now he swears it is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which is quite sufficient to cause me to be transported.</p>

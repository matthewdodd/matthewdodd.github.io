               <p>Prisoner. I was with her drinking in Tottenham-court-road, two or three days before I was married, I got nearly tipsy, and I told her I was married. Witness. No, he did not - I never knew it; I have been with him there several times, and have taken a glass of ale, but have never been intoxicated - he never told me he was married.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told her the very day, that I had not money to provide for the marriage, and she had better put it off to a future time. Witness. I did pay for the marriage, but I never understood he wished to put it off - I was living in Carpenter's-buildings, London-wall, in service, up to the day of the marriage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. After we came to London she agreed to go to service; I got work at Cambridge - she heard where I was, and, as she was in the family-way, came down to me; being out of a situation I came to London, and she agreed to go to her aunt's - while she was there she was confined. Witness. I had a child on the 19th of January - I did not go to him without his sending for me.</p>

I lived very comfortably with my first wife, and she proved a very good one till we removed to Westminster, when she got acquainted with a man named Mettel - she used to go out with him, and get intoxicated - she came to me, and took away the money I had to provide Counsel with, and left me without; she had this

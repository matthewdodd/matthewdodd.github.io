I am servant to Joseph Gilbert, at 67, Albion Road—on Thursday morning, the 16th June, I got up about 7 o'clock in the morning—I found the pantry-window open, and also the door into the back-yard, and a shutter up against it to keep it open—I missed some pork, and beer, and bread, from the pantry—the beer was in a cask—I had seen all the things safe the night before—I had closed the house up the night before, and the back-door was shut.</p>

About 4.30, on the morning of 17th June, I saw the prisoner with another man, at the back of the Albion Rood, in the garden of a house, a few doors from the house that was broken into—they were looking about, and when they saw me they ran away—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the custody of another constable, about a quarter of an hour afterwards—a chisel and a knife were found upon him—I afterwards went to 67, Albion Road, and examined the back-door—it had been broken open, and the marks on the door corresponded with both these chisels—the prisoner was charged at the station—he said nothing.</p>

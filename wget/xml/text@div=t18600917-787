                  </hi>. I am a cane maker, residing at Friars Mount, Bethnal Green—On Sunday Morning, 2d September, about 1 o'clock I was at Mr. Craigge's house at Friars Mount—a person named Waring came to the door and asked me to direct some person the way to Whitechapel Church—I went up to the prisoner, who was standing a little way from Mr. Waring's door, and asked him where he wanted to go to—he said "I want to go to Whitechapel Church"—I told him the way to it—he said, "When I get to Whitechapel Church, how far am I off from Whitechapel-street?"—I directed him—then he asked me for Church-street, Bethnal Green—I told him, and with that he turned round and called me a b—liar, and a thing, or something of that sort—he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand and made a blow at me with his fist, and in return, I struck him back—he said he would cut my b—throat, and he put his hand to his right hand pocket—I ran from him directly, into my own passage—he followed me—I did not have time to bolt the door, he forced it open again, and by forcing it open he slipped, and I jumped out into the road—he directly gave me a blow over the left eye; I don't know what with—I hallooed out that I had been stabbed—the blood came from my left eye very bad—Mr. Waring came up, and I asked him to take me to a doctor's—the prisoner did not run far, he only went on to the pavement—Mr. Waring and I went down to Church-street to find a doctor—I was taken to the police-station, and there attended to by a doctor—I afterwards gave the prisoner in custody—whilst I was at the police-station the prisoner turned round and said, "I say, old fellow, if I had been sober I should have blinded you."</p>

               <p>Q. Were you robbed at any time of the things in the indictment at any time? - Yes, I lost them from the parlour adjoining to the shop, on Tuesday the 9th of June; I was gone into the bake house out of the shop, while I was going I thought I heard somebody, but when I returned I perceived the prisoner at the bar with five tea spoons in his hand, and a pair of sugar tongs, and the saucer, and he ran out of doors; I ran out and gave the cry of stop thief! and he ran into Bridgewater square, where he was stopped, and he flung the tea spoons down an area, in a court adjoining to Bridgewater-square; I did not see him fling them down; I never lost fight of him at all. A man stopped him who is not in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they picked up in the direction that the man went? - Yes, they were; they were brought back to my house by a person of the name of Dawkins.</p>

            How soon were they brought to you after the man was stopped? - I suppose it may be ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has had the care of them ever since? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were brought back were they delivered to the constable or to you? - They were delivered to neither at first. I was asked to describe the cypher on the spoon, which I did. I received them of the man that found them and delivered them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure the prisoner is the same man that was in your house? - I am positive that is the same man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you a widow? - Yes, I am.</p>

            Whoever the person was, he had got out of the house before you came up with him? - O, dear, no; he was in the parlour, behind the door, when I came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you lost sight of him? - No, I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What pace was he going when he was stopped? - Running as fast as he could, to make his escape from me.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as sure of that as you are of every thing else? - I certainly am sure of it. The man who stopped him, I believe, has some inclination to say what is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. You appeared before one of the justices or aldermen? - Yes, Alderman Plomer, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he committed on the first examination? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a second examination? - He had.</p>

            And perhaps a third? - Only two examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that account before the justice, and say that he never was out of your sight? - Yes. The alderman put it off till another examination, in consequence of the man that stopped him not being there, and then he asked him if he stopped him? and he said, yes; that was all he said.</p>

I directly runs out of doors, and I see the prisoner as if he was raising himself up from the area, he had in his hand a blue white saucer. A man had then got hold of him by the collar, with his shirt sleeves tucked up, but there was another man that came up and took hold of him. I see him throw the saucer away after I walked behind him, he dashed it down.</p>

               <p>I am a watch-maker by trade, I picked the spoons up out of my area, and a pair of plated tea tongs. My house is No. 2, Hart-court, Bridgewater-square. I heard the cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body pass by your house? - I could not, I work up at the top of the house, I heard the gingling of spoons as they fell, as I supposed they were spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go down? - Immediately, and I went down stairs and picked up the spoons immediately, and carried them to the house of Mrs. Robinson, in Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver them to? - To the constable I think I gave them to; I made her describe the marks first of all; I believe they are all odd spoons.</p>

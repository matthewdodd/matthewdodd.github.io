                  </hi>. I live in Parker-street, Drury-lane, and am a smith. On the 2nd of August I was with the prisoner in Long-lane—I had 112 pairs of tips in a bag—we had called at one shop, and he said he had sold one pair-when we came to Long-lane, we went into a public-house, and laid the bag on the table—the prisoner took it up, and ran away, and left me to pay for a pint of porter—I saw him again on the 17th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I gave him an order for six or eight dozen pairs off 3/4 plates—I found him on the 2nd of August, in Drury-lane, with the work, and he gave me the bags. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I deny it—he carried it sometime—he had given me no orders for the tips—I was going out with them to sell—I did not say, "You can look at them, and see if they suit your order"—I had not got them for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. We went to a public-house, and I picked one dozen out that were suitable—I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we went and got dinner to<lb></lb>gether, and some ale, out of the shilling. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I deny it—he dragged my work off the table, and said to the landlord, "I will leave this man in pawn for ten minutes"-! did not authorise him to sell a shilling's-worth at Mr. Cuthbert's, on this order he is speaking about, he took the work and had eighteen shillings for them, and he gave me but eight shi<lb></lb>lings for them—that was another matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had sold a shilling's-worth, and we went and drank, and ate together, and that night I sold eighteenpence worth more, at three-halfpence a pair—they were not worth going about with, and the Alderman ordered me to pay five shillings—I never was fetched to pay it, and them another Alderman ordered me to come here.</p>

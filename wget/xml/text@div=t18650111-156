                  </hi>. I am employed by the Mint—on Saturday, 10th September, about half-past 12 in the day, I was at the Spencer Arms, Dudley-street, Seven Dials, with Inspector Avory and other officers—I saw the prisoner standing at the bar with another man close to him—I instructed the officers to seize him, and said, "Peter, you are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession, have you got any"—I first told him my name was Brannan—he said, "No, what"—I repeated the question frequently—I put my hand into his left hand breeches pocket, and found these papers containing several packets of counterfeit coin, separately wrapped in paper one packet containing five half-crowns, another two half-crowns, two packages containing ten shillings each, and another six—I also found on him several strips of paper, on which was written "Spencer Arms, Dudley-street, from 11 to 2"—a professional card—I asked him his name and address, which he declined to give—he was several days in custody before he gave the name of Peter Clark—the coin is all here, and is about the best manufacture I ever saw.</p>

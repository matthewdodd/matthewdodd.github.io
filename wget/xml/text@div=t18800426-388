                  </hi>. On 24th March I lived in Heneage Street, Spitalfields, and about 1 a.m. I was going through Heneage Street—the prisoner came up and put his hands in both my pockets and took out all I had—after that he knocked me down with his fist and ran away—I ran after him and called out "Stop thief," and he ran almost into the police<lb></lb>man's arms—I had my money, which was all in coppers, in my right hand pocket, and my tobacco box in my left.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no doubt of the prisoner—I identified him by his features—I never lost sight of him—of course his back was to me—he struck my face with his fist, which knocked me down—I was not drunk.</p>

I saw Williams on the night of 24th March, and I saw the prisoner turn round sharp on Boundary Street out of High Street—Williams was calling "Stop thief"—he was drunk—I stopped the prisoner, and Williams came up and said "I wish to give this man into custody for robbing me"—I said "You hear what this man says"—he said "I know nothing about it," and put his hand in his pocket and threw something from behind him—I said to the watchman "Pick it up"—he did so, and gave it to me—Williams recognised it as his at the station—the prisoner was searched, and one shilling and three pence in bronze found on him.</p>

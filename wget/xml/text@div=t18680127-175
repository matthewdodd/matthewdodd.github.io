I am barmaid at the Poulterers' Arms, Cheap-side—on Christmas Eve, about five o'clock, I served the prisoner with two-penny worth of rum—he then asked me to make it three-halfpennyworth, and gave me a good half-sovereign—I gave him three half-crowns, a florin, and 4½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all good—he remained in the bar a few minutes, and then asked me to give him some smaller change for one of the half-crowns; I said that I had not got it—Mr. Evans, my master, gave him change for one of them, which was put down on the counter, and Mr. Evans said, "I cannot take that, it is bad"—a Mr. Perkins, who was standing at the bar, looked at it and said, "I will give you a good half-crown for that, that is good enough," and gave the prisoner a good one for it and he left—on 9th January he came in again about a quarter-past five for twopenny worth of rum; Mr. Evans served him and showed me a bad shilling—I said, "This is the same man who came in on Christmas Eve and passed a bad half-crown to Mr. Perkins"—the pri<lb></lb>soner said nothing.</p>

I am a packing-case maker, of 22, Bartholomew Close—I was is Mr. Evans's house on Christmas Eve and saw the prisoner there—I have heard what the last witness has said, it is correct—I took up the half-crown and thought it was good—I handed it back to the prisoner, who had three half-crowns in his right hand, and that made four—he took it in his left hand, and said "Do not you believe that is a good one?"—I said, "I do," and gave him a good half-crown for it, and put it in my pocket, with eleven shillings—he went out about a minute afterwards—about three minutes after he had gone I found it was bad, and showed it to Mr. Evans—I locked it up and afterwards gave it to a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Poulterers' Arms—I was in my bar on Christmas Eve about five o'clock, and somebody, who I believe to be the prisoner, asked for change for a half-crown—he had asked three or four times, and I got it for him, as we were very busy—he wanted small money, I said that we had none, he said that coppers would do—I gave him coppers—I saw that his half-crown was bad before I touched it, and said, "No, not for that"—Mr. Perkins said, "Let me look at it," and the prisoner handed him, I believe, a good one—I did not notice any other half-crowns in the prisoner's hand at that time—Mr. Perkins said that it was good; the prisoner asked for it back and received it; I said, "I shall not take it"—Mr. Perkins then gave him a half-crown for it, and he walked away directly—I am in the habit of packing up a certain quantity of silver in the till and putting it away—I saw my barmaid take change from a packet of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which my wife had made up that morning, and give it to the prisoner—I had got that silver from the Bank of England, as I do every day, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I handed it to Mrs. Evans, and was there when she made it up—on 9th January I was in the bar when the prisoner came in—I served him, and he gave me a bad shilling—I did not touch it—I told him it was bad, and the barmaid said, "That is the man who came on Christ<lb></lb>mas eve and gave Perkins a bad half-crown"—the prisoner said he did not know it, and put a shilling on the counter, which was returned to him—I gave him in charge with the shilling.</p>

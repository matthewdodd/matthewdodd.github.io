                  </hi>. I am a lighterman. I was on board a hoy called the <hi rend="italic">Mary Ann</hi>, on Wednesday, 14th Jan., it was lying at Pickle-herring-stairs, opposite the Tower, on the Thames—I had a jacket, which I bung across the boom while I went down in the cabin to wash myself—a boy named Riley was in a craft close bandy—he called me, and I came up and missed my jacket that I had hung on the boom—I went on shore with Riley, and he took me to Battle-bridge-stairs, and pointed out the prisoners to me, who were rowing up in a boat—I should say that was a quarter of a mile from Pickle-herring-stairs—I took a boat and came up to the prisoners, and got in their boat with them—I accused them of stealing my jacket, and called, "Police!"but there was no police handy—the prisoners rowed me over to the Custom-house, and threatened to throw roe overboard as they went along—when they got to the Custom-house, they got out and ran away—I took charge of their boat, and gave it up to Mr. Evans the policeman.</p>

I remember the morning when the prosecutor lost his jacket—I was in a boat not far from the <hi rend="italic">Mary Ann</hi>, by Pickle-herring-stairs—I saw the prisoners in a boat, and saw Dockery take the jacket off the boom—Driscoll was in the boat, and there was a third man there—when Dockery took the jacket, he came into the boat again, and then the prisoners and the other man went on shore—I did not see anything more of the jacket—I went and told the prosecutor about it, and afterwards pointed out the two prisoners to him—they were then in their own boat off Battle-bridge-stairs.</p>

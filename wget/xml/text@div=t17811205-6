            .</p>
               <p>I lost a Turkey carpet, the prime cost 6 l. 3 s. we shut shop always at this time of year, at six in the evening; after we had shut up shop, we fastened the door our two selves; this was upon the thirteenth of November; we afterwards retired to a little back room to drink tea; we shut up shop about half after five, or rather sooner; we had double doors; we bolt up and down one of the doors, the other we lock, upon the single lock, and leave the key in it; we leave a candle burning upon the counter, in the middle of the shop. It rained hard a little after six; a coach coming by, the noise struck me as if the street door was open. I said to my partner, the street door must be open; this was a quarter before six; we looked just at the door; we did not go into the street; I saw a man had been in the house, and in the street, coming out of the shop with dirty feet; it rained very hard; I said, he has not been in for nothing; there were two Turkey carpets, one I missed; we shut the door, and locked it, and immediately after we heard a knock against the door, and my partner looking out, saw the thief going away with the carpet upon his left shoulder, and a hair broom in his hand; there was a knock upon the window; it was an unvoluntary knock, by the broom hitting against it; my partner coming out, cried stop thief; he dropt the carpet, I took care of that; my partner pursued him, and took him. I was not bye when he was taken, I staid in Long-acre to take care of the goods; he found him up Rose-street, and took him, he was never out of his sight, he brought him within a minute after.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the prisoner that you saw with the carpet on his shoulder, when he dropt it in the street? - I can't be sure, I took my partner's word for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You can say whether the door was fast or not, you spoke to the general custom of the shop? - I can't say, when we shut the doors we hang the key up behind it.</p>
               <p>There are other carpets that are hung up upon the outside of the door, by way of sign, I suppose? - Yes; those carpets we lost before.</p>
               <p>This man had a long hair broom in his hand, that had given the stroke against the shutters? - Yes, I suppose it so.</p>
               <p>When you saw him with this carpet upon his shoulder, and broom in his hand, he paraded in the middle of the street, was he drunk? - No, Sir; not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>I look upon it there is a cavity, the window projects, the man had not time to go a cross the street with a carpet? - This man hid himself.</p>
               <p>What would have been the value of the broom? - Not above six pence, but the value of the carpet is 6 l. 3 s.</p>
               <p>Mr. STIMSON sworn.</p>
               <p>You are partner with the last witness? - Yes; upon the thirteenth of November last, upon the dusk of the evening we shut up the shop, and fastened the doors, and then retired to the little room at the end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050015"></xptr> the shop to drink tea, thinking every thing secure before we drank the tea, we were alarmed by a noise of a coach going along the street, made us think the street door was open, we heard some person's foot went from and returned to the door again, I shut the door; Mr. Abbot said, there is something gone, there is a Turkey carpet lost; I looked round and said, there is a Turkey carpet gone, within the space of half a minute, or a quarter of a minute; we heard something tap against the shutters; I opened the door immediately, and saw the prisoner crossing the street with the carpet upon his shoulder, and a hair broom in his hand; I said, there is the thief with the Turkey carpet upon his back; I immediately pursued him; he throwed the carpet in the middle of the street, and run up Rose-street, when he came to the top of the street he ran into a coal shed, Mr. Mosely's coal-shed; there is a yard, and about the end of the yard I took him; I never lost sight of him from the first time I saw him with the carpet upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>You are sure that is the same man? - I am very sure it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of one Mrs. Spaightly? - There was a woman called, but I don't know her name.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming from Mr. Spranger's about six o'clock in the evening, the 13th of November; I saw something, I kicked it with my foot before I saw it, I then perceived it to be a hair broom; I perceived a piece of carpeting between two houses; I was rather in liquor; I took it upon my shoulder, I thought it might be of service, I thought it was a carpet that gentlemen put in their passages; I put it on my shoulders; a coach coming by, my foot slipped, I dropt it from my shoulder; two or three people followed me, and cried out stop thief. I ran down Rose-street, being rather alarmed; I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>To Stimson. Was the prisoner in liquor when you took him? - He seemed to be in liquor, he seemed to make it appear so at first.</p>
               <p>How do you mean make it appear so? - He could run as fast as I could, and from his appearance when examined.</p>
               <p>Mrs. STANHOPE sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in St. James's Market, No. II: I lived in Piccadilly thirty years.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar, before the 13th of November last? - Never in my life. I was going along Holborn; who he was I did not know; he was going along in Holborn all the way, he seemed to be in liquor; he saw something and kicked it with his foot, and took something up and put it upon his shoulders, and went into the highway; somebody called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>You was in Long Acre? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That young man was never out of your sight from the first time you observed him, for a considerable distance from the time you saw him take the carpet; do you know whether he did not go into the house of any body? - Sir, I did not see him go into a house any more than I do you go into a house: I came all the way along from Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>And whereabouts did you see this lad? - I saw him go before me, as near as I can guess, to where they turn down to go to the lying-in hospital, and I went all the way to Piccadilly.</p>

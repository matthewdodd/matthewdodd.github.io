                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Robert Watts, a boot maker, at Leyton, in Essex. About 10 o'clock at night, on 11th May, I was in the parlour, having my supper—I heard a noise in the shop—I went, and saw a man crouching down, and just going out on his hands and knees—he had on a light fustian jacket and trousers—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner—I have known him two years and a half—I took him at once to be the person—I looked round the counter when he was gone, and missed two pairs of boots—I went out and cried, "Stop thief!"—I pursued him, and so did Mr. Platten; but his shoe came off, and he could not pursue him—these boots were afterwards brought back, and I identified them as my master's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had no light trousers in my possession, and you never saw my face. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I could not see your face, but I saw that you had light fustian trousers. I gave information that Mr. Watts' shop had been robbed, and I had every reason to believe it was Norton. I gave information to the police about a quarter before 11 o'clock; I came to your house, with the policeman, about a quarter before 12.</p>

                  </hi>.—I live next door to the prosecutor. About 10 o'clock that night, I came out of my shop; I looked at Mr. Watts', and saw the prisoner in the shop—I turned, and saw him run away, and heard the last witness call, "Stop thief!"—I pursued him, but I had only my slippers on; I lost them, and could not proceed—I cannot say how the prisoner was dressed—he had a light coat on—I have known him for five years—I am certain it was him.</p>

From information, I went to the prisoner's house that night—I found him in bed—I told him to get up and dress himself, and that he was accused of stealing some boots from Mr. Watts'—he got up, and put on a pair of blue trousers—I said, "Put on the same trousers you had on last night"—he said he had no other trousers but them, but afterwards these light trousers were given to me by his mother—I had seen the prisoner the night before, with a pair of light trousers, at a public house.</p>

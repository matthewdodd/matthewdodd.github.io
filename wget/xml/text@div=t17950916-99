               <p>Q. Do you recollect being any where on the 6th of July last? - I went to Guildhall, for a warrant for

             and his wife, for beating and abusing me; I met the prisoner at the bar at Guildhall; he tapped me on the shoulder; I was telling a woman that I had with me, that I wanted a warrant, and I never was before a magistrate in my life, and I did not know how to go about it; he said; as I wanted a warrant, he would instruct me how to go about the business. He took me out to <placeName id="t17950916-99-crimeloc565">the Bell, in Basinghall-street</placeName>

I had but three shillings about me; I had a woman with me, and and I sent her for the money; and then he said he would serve the warrant on Mr. Reeves, at five o'clock in the evening, where I lodged, he had a little business to do first.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him where Henry Reeves lived? - Yes; he had put it down on his bench warrant as he called it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on that day, go before any magistrate? - No, I did not; I see no more that day. I left him then; he said he had a little business to do; and I went to the Bell again, and he was gone and told the landlord how he would serve me for making him fill up a warrant without giving him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave him no money? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. You and Mrs. Reeves had a quarrel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any blows past? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got the better? - I got the better, because I got the warrant; she beat me, but I did not beat her.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a good deal agitated after this quarrel; extremely anxious to bring her to justice? - Because I never was used in the manner in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Very anxious to bring her to justice and utterly ignorant how to proceed? -Very ignorant, because I never was before a magistrate in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. And meeting with this person, you begged of him to inform you how to proceed in this business? - He said he would.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he explained to you, that one sort of warrant would be of no use,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160256"></xptr>because of the bail; but the bail resulting from the other would be in consequence of twenty-four hours notice? - No, he did not say any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding this instruction on his part, you gave him no money? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not had occasion to be before a magistrate before, therefore perhaps you are unacquainted that such assistance is to be found in every police office? - I did not. He said he would manage and make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know that he went to Mr. Reeves in order to make it up? - He did; he had money from him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Barnet? - Yes, she was a lodger of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mrs. Barnet and you any quarrel at any time? - Yes, on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I know him very well. I was sent for the 6th of July, between three and five; the servant maid came for me from the White Dog.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the White Dog, who did you see? - I see Mr. Swift standing with his back to a box; I went up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the White Dog public house? - In Widegate-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know on what business you was to meet Mr. Swift at that time? - No, I knew nothing about it. When I came up to him he asked me if my name was Reeves?

             the woman we have just seen? - Yes. And he said, he should not serve it on me because he had enquired after my character, and I had a very good character, that he only shewed it me; I told him it was of no use, I could not read; he said, he should not serve it on me; I told him it was a thing I was quite unacquainted with; and he said, leave it alone to me, he would put me in a way how to get through it. Then first he said I must give him half a crown for serving it, and sixpence to go the next morning to stop the warrant. I was quite unacquainted with the business; I was never before a court of justice before in my life; I cannot read or write English; I gave him the half crown and sixpence; the half crown for serving it on me, and the sixpence if be would stop the warrant the next morning. He then sat down and wrote me a direction for to meet him at the Helmet, in Bishopsgate-street, and what his name was; he gave me the name of Smith; I have kept it over since.(Read by the clerk of the Court.)</p>

               <p>"Mr. Reeves to meet Mr. Smith at the Helmet, to-morrow morning at ten o'clock. Monday, July the 6th, 1795."</p>
               <p>The next morning I and my wife and another woman went to meet him; but he was not come. I could not stop, I was obliged to go to work; I went again about eleven o'clock, and then I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - The 7th of July, Tuesday, the day after. He was just come in, sitting along side of my wife. I went in and told him that I left my cause entirely to him; and just as I was going out of doors, he asked my wife whether she had any money? and he said, if she would give him half a crown, he would take out a cross warrant. I heard that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he ever got this cross warrant? - I never asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your wife gave him the half crown? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it? - No. I see him, again the 8th of July, the day after, then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160257"></xptr>he was in custody, then I gave charge of him, then he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he taken up on your account? - Yes. I met him at Guildhall, and I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Where do you live? - In Widegate-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prisoner very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know that he has a wife and a large family? - That I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you will be as candid to me as you have been to Mr. Knowlys and other people, with whom you have conversed on this subject. I think when he first met, he said he would undertake to make it up for you? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that this woman, Mrs. Barnet, was extramely enraged against your wife, and meant to prosecute you? - No, I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you learned from your wife, or any other person that an assault had taken place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you knew that Mrs. Barnet meant to take up your wife for an assault? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. But Mrs. Barnet did take out a warrant after that? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when Mr. Swift stated the indignation that Mrs. Barnet was in, he persuaded you to make it up? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you was given to understand, what appears in fact, that warrants were out against you, then at last you thought it time to make it up? - We made it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you at the expence of the prosecution? - I know nothing at all about the expence. I am bound over to prosecute, that is all I know of expence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard who is to be at the expence of this prosecution? Are you to be at the expence? - It is out of my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you if any other person, and who? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to you to attend? - I was sent for from the solicitor's office; I had a note.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember which of the constables told you that all your expences would be paid you? - None of the constables told me that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person tell you it should? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - The Solicitor's office told me I believe it was them that we should be paid for our trouble, if she would leave it to them. I never see any constable that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the assurance go a little further in telling you that you should be well paid? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you should be rewarded for the loss of time if you could convict this man, nor you did not say so to Mr. Knowlys? - No, nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though this person did not come at ten o'clock, he came at eleven, and told you that you might safely leave it to him. Did you; in fact, arrive at any trouble after that? - She had the warrant out the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him the next day attending as usual, what appeared to be his vocation? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you have stated that the two shillings and sixpence you gave him was because he would not serve the warrant. Perhaps you know that the most reputable sheriffs office in London takes small fees? - I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you gave this two shillings and sixpence, was there any liquor or entertainment called for at this public house? - Yes, we had two pints of beer; I paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for this two shillings and sixpence he was once negociating this business<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160258"></xptr> with Mrs. Barnet and two days attending you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. So they made Grizzlegog pay for all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You make a heavy sigh, as many a man does at the lawyer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the prosecution and how it is carried on? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are bound over by the alderman, and the solicitor of the City has carried it on.</p>

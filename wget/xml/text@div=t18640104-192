                  </hi>. I am the widow of John McCarthy—on Tuesday evening, 8th December, I had been out on my walk—I went home between 5 and 6, went into my own room, and Patrick McConvey and John Daley were there—they said they should go and have tea, and went down stairs into Mrs. Keefe's room instead of going home to tea—she lives on the first floor back, and I on the second floor front—my husband was in my room, and I made tea for him and my children and myself—I gave him a cup of tea, which nearly dropped from him—he had a drop taken, but I could not tell how much, as he had been out all day—he said that he wanted to go after Patrick McConvey, but I would not let him—he then told me he wanted to go down stairs—I did not prevent him, for I thought he wanted to go to some private place—I sat down to have my tea, and took my baby in my arms—I heard violent screams down stairs, turned the baby away, and went down with a poker, which I laid down on the landing—I Opened the prisoner's door, which was open before, went in, and saw John Daley holding my hus<lb></lb>band by the shoulder, in the middle of the floor—I rescued him—I drew him as far as the door, and Daley shoved him—the prisoner then ran</p>

               <p>violently to the fire-place, took the tongs, brought them down to the door, and hit my husband with them on the forehead—the one blow made two wounds, and the blood spouted out of his face and the side of his head—she looked sober to me—I took in the poker, which was outside the door, and contrived to get him out at the same time—when he got outside the door he dropped his head; he was not able to hold it up—that was after the blow—I said, "John, you are <hi rend="italic">hurted</hi>"—he made no answer—I took him up stairs, got some luke-warm water, and washed his head at well as I could, and the prisoner got a constable, and me and my husband went to the station-house—I do not known how my husband contrived to get there—John Daley and Patrick McConvey were with him—he was at the Police-court two hours, and we were bailed out—we went next day to the Court-house—my husband was let go free, and I was fined 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for striking the prisoner's sister, in the defence of my husband—I had struck her with the poker, as she had my husband by the collar of his coat—I mean the prisoner's sister; not the prisoner—I am sure it was the prisoner who struck my husband with the tongs, and not her sister—my husband went home with me from the Police-court—I then went out, milked the cows, and did the walk, and when I came back he was screaming violently on the bed—I put a bread and water poultice to the wounds—I went next day to the work-house for a doctor, but he did not come back—I went two or three times, and then had to go and gather up half a crown to pay a doctor, who came about 11 o'clock, and gave me some lotion and some medicine for him, and I did according to his orders—the doctor attended him till the Monday, when he went into the workhouse—that was the fifth day—he got out of his mind about 12 o'clock at night, and I was obliged to put him into the workhouse, as I was not able to keep him in the house—on the next day, Tuesday, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I got an account of his death.</p>

I am surgeon to the Holborn Union Workhouse—on Monday evening, 14th December, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was sent for to see the deceased, who had just been admitted into the workhouse—he was quite delirious, his head was very much swoollen, and both eyes closed—he had a wound over the left eye on the forehead—I prescribed for him, but he got rapidly worse, and died between 5 and 6 on Tuesday morning—I made a post-mortem examination, and in my judgment he died from erysipelas of the head, produced from the wound on the eye, and from another wound on the side of the head—the scalp was very much bruised.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does erysipelas very frequently arise from wounds of that sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if not carefully attended—the wounds were not very ex<lb></lb>tensive; they were such as a pair of tongs would make, but the erysipelas was the cause of death—if he bad been attended to immediately, his life might possibly have been saved—he had also disease of the lungs, and of the kidneys, both of which would make the erysipelas more likely to be fatal—drink would be likely to make the erysipelas worse—his drinking before he received the injury would render him more likely to have erysipelas from the wounds.</p>

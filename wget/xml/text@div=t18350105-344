                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Rosier, a poulterer, in Leadenhall-market. On Monday morning, the 1st of December, the prisoner came and asked if I would buy a live pheasant—I said I would—he went away, and brought another man with him with a pheasant in his possession, and having received information that Mr. Alderman Atkins had lost a bird of that description, I went to the Alderman—Mr. Lane came down from there and asked the two men where they came from—they both said, "From East Grinstead"—Mr. Lane turned round to look at the bird, and the prisoner ran off directly—the other ran immediately after him—he was overtaken and brought back, but the prisoner escaped—I am quite positive of his person—I asked them how they came by it—they said they caught it in a wire—Mr. Alderman Atkins and Miss Atkins afterwards saw the same pheasant.</p>

               <p>whether he knew Mr. Alderman Atkins—he said, "No"—I said, "Do you know Halstead, in Kent?"—he said, "No," and they had come from East Grinstead—I happened to turn round to look at the pheasant—it began to flutter, and both the men ran away—one was secured in King William-street—the prisoner made his escape—I have not a doubt of his being the man.</p>

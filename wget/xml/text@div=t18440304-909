                  </hi>. I live in Gordon-square. I was at Drury-lane Theatre on the 17th of Feb., before the doors were open, waiting in the crowd at the pit-door—the prisoner was close behind me, with his hand on my right shoulder—when the door opened, he drew the pin out of the front of my stock—I saw it and felt it—I turned round and followed him—he went out through the crowd—I called out, "Stop him," and he was stopped by a gentleman going into the pit—he fell down—an officer came up, and I gave him in charge—the pin was not found.</p>

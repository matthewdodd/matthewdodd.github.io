On the 29th of March, I received two sovereigns and 10 s. from Mr. Edwards, of Woolwich. On the 30th of March, I had eighteen sovereigns in a bag, made from the pocket of an old pair of breeches; it was tied up. I had received ten of the sovereigns from Mr. Blissett, of Leadenhall-street, and six from Mr. York. I counted them on the morning of the 30th of March, and put them into my right-hand waistcoat pocket.

               <p>"You treated me when I had no money to treat myself, and I will treat you now, as I have money." He said he would have some gin and peppermint; I fetched a quartern from the bar; this was about 11 o'clock. We drank and talked together some time, he came and sat by my side, by the fire-place. I had a pipe which confused me so, that I fell asleep, and about one o'clock, Toogood came and awoke me. I felt and missed the bag and sovereigns. The prisoner was then gone; nobody but him had sat near me. I am sure the bag of sovereigns were safe when I paid for the liquor. He was taken that night by the watchman. I saw him next morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170060"></xptr>and said</p>
               <p>"Eden you have got my property." He said</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was at the Princess Royal, and saw them together; the prisoner sat on his left hand; they sat together for three-quarters of an hour. Matthews fell asleep. Two men came in before that, and went out again; they did not go near him. I went into the back-yard, and while he was asleep, the prisoner came there to me, in about two minutes, and said he was off; I asked which way, he said to Blackfriar's Bridge; I said I was going that way, and we would walk together, we went out together, without going through the tap-room, and went to the King's Arms, Hill-street, Finsbury; he called for a pint of porter, and pulled out 2 1/4 d; I said that would not do to pay for it. He then called for a pot, and shewed me an old pocket, which he took from his left-hand waistcoat pocket, and said he picked it up against Mr. Matthews. It was like the one produced; it was an old pocket; I neither saw gold or silver in it, it appeared to have something in it. I left him there, and went back to Matthews, and he missed his pocket and money. I returned to the King's Arms, and he was gone. He had told me he was going to call at the Pied Horse, Chiswell-street, we went, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did Matthews say liquor had overcome him, and he was quite stupid - A. I saw that he was, they were both drunk; the prisoner made no secret of picking it up.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2nd of February, about six at night, being out on duty in company with Barnard Gleed and other officers in Wentworth-street, in the County of Middlesex, I saw the prisoner carrying a hamper, in company with three others behind him; I stopped him, and asked him what he was carrying; he said, he did not know what it was, he was going to carry it somewhere in Petticoat-lane, he did not know where. I asked him how he came by it; he said, a gentleman gave it him to carry in Somerset-street, Whitechapel; he did not know the man nor where he was to carry it to. As soon as we laid hold of him the others ran away. This is the hamper; I took the prisoner to the office.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the hamper that was in my care.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was out of work; in Somerset-street this gentleman asked me to carry it; I said, I would if he would pay me; he carried my hat. He was walking by me when I was taken in custody.</p>

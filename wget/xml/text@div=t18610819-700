               <p>all the time I was there, sometimes two or three times a day; sometimes there might be two or three days without his coming—I have seen him bring these patty pans with him, none of the other things, only the patty pans he used not to take them out where I was—he used to go into the front shop—I have seen him take patty pans out of his pocket, and after he has gone, I have seen large quantities there that were not there before he came—they used to go in together, leaving me in the back shop—I have also seen sandwich boxes brought by him—I have seen him take them out of his pocket, and give them to Locke—I have never seen Locke give him any money—I have heard Locke talk about money—I have seen Richards call and ask him for the money, and he would say, "Call at such a time, and I will pay you"—Richards would call, and they would go into the front shop together, and he would go away satisfied, without making any remark—I do not remember hearing anything said about prices at any time—I have seen part of a piece of solder that Richards brought, that is all—that was about five weeks, I think, before Locke was taken—I saw part of the letter M stamped deeply in it—part of it had been used—it was part of a square piece—I have never received any myself from Richards—I never had any transaction with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that Locke goes to Sadler's Wells Theatre in the morning to rehearse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he has been there about twice or three times only—I know that he has had a benefit there—when he went there I went with him first, and then I came to look after Blyth—I was a potboy at a public-house only once—I left there because the master turned jealous of me, for which I can give no reason whatever—that is the true reason—I have seen Richards at Locke's place several times, I cannot say how many—I do not know to whom he gave the patty pans when he brought them—I never saw him personally deliver anything to Locke—I do not know whether he has ever delivered anything to Blyth—I was not aware of any transaction between those two—the patty pans that I took to Mucklestone were various sizes and various numbers—I sold them to him for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot say how many there were, nor how much apiece they were, I could not give you a notion; I am a perfect stranger to the trade—I took them in a square tin—they were all put together—they were not numbered, that I am aware of—I only know there was a large quantity—I got the money for them—that was about three months before Locke was apprehended—I had been in his employ for about a week or two—I used to call on him, for business was slack, and he could not afford to keep me on—he merely told me that he could not afford to keep me—I then left him—I still resided with him, but received no money for what I did—I was not dismissed.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 14, Great Charles-street, Black<lb></lb>friars, and am a dealer in bakers' fixtures—I went to Locke's shop and purchased some patty pans and half-quartern tins—first of all, the last witness brought me over some; about two gross, or two gross and a half—they were odds and ends, and I gave 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—there were all manner of things—I bought things on two occasions, once at his place and once at mine—Locke told me he was selling off and was going to take a large shop in the Caledonian-road—these tins are worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gross—they are all made at one factory at Birmingham—I deal at Groom and Barber's, and at Birmingham—I cannot say whether these came from Groom and Barber's—I have not returned those that I bought from Locke—I did not buy any sandwich boxes; nothing but those round patty pans—there were two gross and a half—I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; that is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross—they were dirty and tarnished; they had been in the window for some time—they were not any of them in a new condition when I bought them—if they had been new I should have paid no more for them—it was about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen that I gave—they are hawked about the streets—4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen is their value to me—I do not consider that I bought them at unreasonably low prices at all—3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen, I should say would be an unreasonably low price—I considered that I was giving a fair price for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 113, Goswell-street, as general dealer—I know Locke—I have been to his shop and made a purchase; and also frequently before he opened a shop; before he left his mother—this sandwich box and these patty-pans I purchased of him—these others I cannot swear to; I might have purchased them of him—I gave these things to the officer Smith—there are other things that I bought from Locke which I have sold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you say the price you gave for the sandwich box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I bought it with other things—I bought an odd lot—I sometimes buy twenty or thirty saucepans, and bread tins, and other things—I really cannot give you any notion as to the price which I got that box or the patty pans for—sometimes there would be as many as 200 or 300 different articles—I have heard what Mr. Mucklestone has said about those patty pans—I think 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen is the regular price in the way he bought them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Locke live with his mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; at least, in the same house—I bought saucepans and coffee-pots from him there, and I have often had patty pans, kettles, and bread-tins—I think I have been at his house as many as three or four times before he left his mother—that would be between eighteen months and two years ago—he had working materials and tin in his room, and seemed to work there—it was in the day-time that I went for the goods—I cannot say now at what hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the partner of Mr. Barber, we carry on business as tin-plate workers at Union-court, Holborn-hill—we employ 100 men altogether—Richards was in our employ in August, 1859, and Locke also—I am not quite precise as to dates, but I am sure they were with us together—Locke left us about eighteen months ago—the wholesale price of these sandwich boxes is a guinea a dozen—they are our manufacture; we can swear particularly to them—we also make vegetable cutters—the patty pans are all stamped in Birmingham—it is a peculiar manufacture; that refers only to this plain shape—we get them from Birmingham—the fluted ones we make ourselves; they are made by hand; this is our pattern—I should not like to say that it is peculiar to us—in our printed list the price of the patty pans varies from 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross, subject to discount of course; or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—these vegetable cutters are our pattern, I have no doubt at all—they are, I think, about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a box—the solder is an article that we use rather than sell, but I should think it is about a shilling a pound—it is stamped with the letter M.</p>

               <p>any—I am not aware of the price—we get some of these things from Birmingham—I really do not recollect how much a gross we pay for them—our average profit is not thirty or forty per cent.; we are quite satisfied with less than that—we are wholesale dealers, not retail—these are made by machinery, and the price varies—I was not at all aware that Locke kept a shop in which he sold pans and coffee-pots—he left us to go into business for himself, but I did not know whether it was a shop or not.</p>

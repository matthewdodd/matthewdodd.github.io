               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were not the springs in the public shop? A. Yes. Brian's business led him there occasionally. I had passed him just before. I was about seven or eight yards from him, and he could see me.</p>

            . I am clerk to John Augustus Thrupp, Charles Joseph, and Henry Joseph Thrupp. I received some information from Osborne, which I communicated to Mr. Thrupp. I went away for about ten minutes; I afterwards met the officer, Ballard, who apprehended Brian, and asked him what he had done with the spring he had taken over to Curtis. He at first denied it; we then took him to Marlborough-street, where Mr. Thrupp met him - there was no Magistrate there then - he said he knew nothing about any spring at all, but when Mr. Thrupp requested him to state what he knew about the spring being taken out of the shop in the morning, he said he was very sorry to be placed in such a situation, and if Mr. Thrupp would suffer him to go home, and not lock him up, he would disclose all he knew about it - this was refused; we afterwards went to Church's, in Steven-street, Lisson-grove, and Ballard said he came to apprehend him for taking three springs to Curtis. We afterwards went to Curtis, and Ballard told him he came to examine his shop, to see whether there was a spring belonging to Mr. Thrupp - he asked if Thomas had brought a spring there in the course of the morning - he said, "Yes, it is one of these four here, and Church brought the other three" - we then went to Church's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did not Curtis work for Mr. Thrupp? A. Yes, to repair iron work - he said they had been brought to have bolts put to them; he keeps an open shop, and the journeymen take work there. The springs laid in our sight, but they were not intended to be used, and did not want any bolts put to them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I was employed by Messrs. Thrupps, and apprehended Brian - Mr. Atwell was there, and I said, "You must come back" - he said, "For what?" refused, and hesitated a great deal; I threatened to take him into a shop, and put a pair of handcuffs upon him, before he would come. I then said it was in consequence of having taken a spring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270048"></xptr>from Mr. Thrupps to Curtis - he said he had done no such thing, but on being told so two or three times he said he had taken a spring to be repaired, which belonged to Lady Duff Gordon's carriage, and he had brought it back, and put it on. I asked if he had got it painted - he said Yes. I asked if any person had ordered him to do it - he said, No - this was in the morning of the day I apprehended him. I then went to Curtis, and asked him where the spring was which had been brought in that morning - after some little hesitation, and being told by Mr. Thrupp or myself that Thomas had been seen to bring the spring over, he said, "They are there," and pointed to the side of the shop where some were standing; he said they were brought over for new bolts. I had gone there only for one spring, and I asked who had brought the other three - he said Church; and two or three men, who were at work in the shop, cried out, "They were brought over for new bolts." I then went to another person's house, and came back, and told Curtis I was very sorry he had deceived me, and told lies. We had some conversation, and I told him he had been over to Mr. Thrupp's shop, and had seen the springs, and agreed to give 40 s. for them - he said, with some hesitation, that it was so. I told him afterwards that Church told me so - he did not deny it, but said, "I am sold."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who was present then? A. Mr. Thrupp and Atwell. The springs were without bolts.</p>
               <p>CURTIS' Defence. When the officer came I was hard at work at the anvil - Mr. Thrupp said, "Where is the spring which Brian brought in;" I said, there were four which were brought in. The officer then said, "I have got a warrant to search your premises" - he did search, and asked if I had got any more springs; I told him, I declared to God, by the word of a man, that I had not - Parker, my foreman, then made answer, "Master, there are four springs that were brought in - one by Brian, and three by Church, to be cleaned, and have bolts put in them." Mr. Thrupp then ordered his man to take them to his premises.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Curtis. - I had often seen Brian bring work there, from Mr. Thrupp's - but never saw him bring a spring till this morning; those prings were down by the side of the anvil, where such jobs used to be. Mr. Curtis tried one bolt, and said there must be four made like that for the springs.</p>
               <p>JURY to CHARLES ATWELL. Q. Were the men allowed to take work to Curtis' shop without an order? A. Not without a verbal order from Mr. Thrupp or myself. Brian was in the habit of taking work occasionally.</p>

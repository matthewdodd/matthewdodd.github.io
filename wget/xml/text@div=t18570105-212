                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, F</hi> 17). On 19th Dec., I went to a house in Porter-street, Soho, about 9 o'clock in the evening—I was in plain clothes—before I got there, I saw Phillips come out of the shop, and go across the street—I was then six or seven yards from the shop—I went into the shop immediately—no one had gone into the shop from the time Phillips came out till I went in—there was no one in the shop—there is a counter running the length of the shop, and there is a parlour behind the shop—it is necessary to go through the counter to get to the parlour—I and Radford, another officer, went into the parlour; I found Wallis sitting down at needle work near the fire—there was a table in the room, and on the table was this small box—I said to Wallis, "What have you here?" taking up the box at the time—she made no answer—I looked in the box, and it contained counterfeit money—I took my handkerchief out of my pocket and covered the box round, and placed it on the chair where Wallis had been sitting—after leaving her in the custody of Radford—I then went to the shop door, and Phillips came to the door at the same time—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, I want you for the unlawful possession of counterfeit coin"—he made no answer—I took him into the shop, and into the back par<lb></lb>lour, where Wallis was standing in custody of Radford—Phillips looked at Wallis, and he said, "Who brought that box here?" pointing to the table—the</p>

               <p>box was not on the table then, but there was some needle work—a gown, I believe it was, lay on the table—Wallis did not make him any answer—I said to Phillips, "What box?"—he said, "That box" looking at the table—I did not put the gown on the table—Wallis had thrown her work carelessly on the table when I went in—it did not entirely cover the box—I took the box away, and left the gown there—I took Phillips into cus<lb></lb>tody—I found this iron pot on the fire—the coals were flush with the top of the pot, and the pot was in a white heat—I found this life preserver under the counter in the shop.</p>

I accompanied the last witness to the place, about 9 o'clock in the evening—I had not been there before—I saw Phillips come out of the shop, and then the last witness, and I went in—I went directly into the back parlour, and saw Wallis there, and a box containing this coin was on the table—there was nothing said, but Wallis was given into my custody—the box was wrapped in a handkerchief, and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>Ward's Defence. When I got about a quarter of a mile before I came to Stevenage, this man, three soldiers and their wives, overtook me; they asked me to go to that gentleman's house to have part of a pot of beer; I told them I was seeking after work. I worked at Hendon half a year, I came out of Warwickshire; when I came out of Stevenage at five o'clock. I saw him talking to another man in the street, I asked him if he was going home, he said. no he was going to have part of a pot of beer, I asked him if he knew of any one in the country that he thought would employ me, he said no, he did not know that he did. With that we parted, he made one way with his horse and cart, and I made the best of my way home; I went on Tuesday. On Sunday I met him and another man coming together, with that this here man asked me if I would drive his horse and cart. I told him I was going to London, he asked what he should give me, I told him I would have half a crown; It was not Field that told me so, it was this here other man that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140058"></xptr> asked me to drive the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is the other man. - A. I cannot say who he is, I do not know, he said Field would give me the half crown if he was in town first. I went to Smithfield, I was to go to the New inn in the Old Bailey; in Smithfield I was detained.</p>

               <p>Field left his defence to his counsel, called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Ward called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

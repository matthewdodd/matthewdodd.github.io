On Tuesday, the 6th of February, just before nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our house, which he has frequented for the last twelve months; there were four knives and forks on the tap-room table - I saw the prisoner and another person come along the passage - that person took the knives from the prisoner's pocket; I took the four forks from him myself - I do not know what the prisoner was, nor where he worked.</p>

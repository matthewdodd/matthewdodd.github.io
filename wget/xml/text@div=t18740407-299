                  </hi>. I live at 13, Cologne Street, Stepney, and I am a dipper, in the employ of Messrs. Bryant and May, lucifer match makers—on Monday evening, the 9th March, about 7 o'clock I left my employment, and seven or eight of us retired to a public-house together, at Bromley—we left there after having been drinking together from 10.30 to 11 o'clock—it was a snowy night, and we began snowballing directly we got out of the house—I went slowly on to the opposite side of the way and I saw pri<lb></lb>soner's hat in the middle of the road—deceased struck him, and he said "There, you have assaulted me."</p>
               <p>

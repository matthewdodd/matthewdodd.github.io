                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Joseph-street, Woolwich, and am porter at the dockyard station of the South Eastern Railway. On the evening of 5th May the prisoner came into the pay office with another female; the bell then rang announcing the arrival of a train, upon which I locked the outer door, so that nobody could come into the pay office, and went down stairs on to the platform—there is a gentlemen's room on the further side of the pay office, in which there was a hearth rug, in front of the fireplace, four minutes before I went down—I only left the booking clerk there, and he was shut in the telegraph office—the prisoner was then looking out of the window—I remained about a minute and a half on the platform, and as soon as the train had gone, I walked directly to the door which I had before locked, and found the prisoner there with her hand on the brass knob—she was locked in—she could get on to the platform, but not into the street—I asked her to oblige me by getting on one side, and I would unlock the door—she moved, and as she did so this hearth rug (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dropped down on its end—it was folded up as it is now, but it might have got bigger in its fall—when it dropped she said, "Oh, Lord!" and I said, "Well, it is"—I opened the door, and she went out—I then went into the gentlemen's waiting room, and missed the hearth rug—I spoke to the station master, and then went after the prisoner; she had got about sixty yards, and was in front of No. 10, in the terrace—I called her back—she said, "Are my friends not gone?"—I said, "You must come back"—she asked me a second time, and I said, "You must come and see"—I took her back, and the station master asked her what she knew about it—she said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110146"></xptr>
               <p>she knew nothing at all about it—I said, "You appear quite ignorant of it now, but you would not do it if you were in your proper place"—she threatened to fetch her husband to give us a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>—the station master ordered her away, and ordered me to put her out of the office—I led her out very gently, and when she got out she tore the plaits of my shirt, and caught up some stones and threw at me—she was given into custody.</p>

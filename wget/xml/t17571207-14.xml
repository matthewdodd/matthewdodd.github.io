            . On Saturday after my Lord-mayor's day I found in the bed a water from my child; I asked her what was the matter, and whether she wanted to make water. She said, no, mama, my private part is sore. I took no farther notice of it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175712070009"></xptr> then. On the Sunday night I found her much in the same way again, and thought it might be from the heat of her water, but on Monday morning I examined her, and found a sort of corruption coming from her. Then I said I must know who hurt you. She said, mamy, don't beat me, and I will tell the truth. I said, I would not. Then she said, Mr. Crosby did it, the day his wife went to the hospital, and left me there; he got into bed, and call'd me to him. I went to him. Then he pull'd me to him, and put his c - k to me there, and hurt me sadly; she often went there. I carried her to Mr. Bruce, to know what was the matter with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the injury received before she complained to you?</p>
               <p>J. Reynolds. This was done on my Lord mayor's day. She told me she was afraid of telling me, fearing he should beat her.</p>

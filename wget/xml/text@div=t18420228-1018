On the 3rd of February, the prisoner, Elizabeth Fernley, was in custody—in consequence of which, went to a house in Lamb's-gardens, Bethnal-green—there was no number on the door—I there found the prisoners, James Fernley, William Henry Fernley, and De Soiza—while I was there George Fernley came in—there are two rooms in the cottage, and a little back-kitchen without a fire-place</p>

               <p>—they are all on the ground-floor—I searched the house, and found two china candlesticks, two small cups and saucers, four china jars, two stands, and a miniature-case—on the 8th I again went to the house, and found Haslam, going by the name of "Bennett"—he was lying on the bed—it was between one and two o'clock in the day—I said, "Halloo, what do you do here?"—he said, "My name is Bennett; I know you want me; I saw my name in the paper"—he was in the first room as I entered from outside—he was taken to the station.</p>

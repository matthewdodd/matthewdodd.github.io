            . I am a watchman. On Wednesday morning, the 14th of February, at half-past five o'clock, I was on my beat in the Back-road, Islington, and saw two persons on horseback, riding together; I went between the horses, and said, "Where are you going with those horses?" one of them rode off, and the prisoner, who was the other man, said he was going to Dixon's repository; I asked who the horses belonged to; he made no reply, but jumped off, and run away as hard as he could; I pursued, gave an alarm, and secured him, without losing sight of him; I kept the horse till I put it into Price's stable; I found Mr. Heath, who claimed it; he lives at Palmer's-green, seven miles from Islington; the horse had a bridle on, and I followed him with it in my hand; it had neither saddle, halter, nor cloth; it shyed when the rattles sprung; Mr. Heath saw the horse this morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The horse shying must have taken your attention off him? A. No; I I never had my eye off him; I did not mount the horse; it was darkish - but the gas lamps gave me light enough; he did not run above ten or twenty yards - and nobody else was near.</p>

            . I am headborough of Islington. Lloyd and Bowland gave the prisoner in my charge about half-past five o'clock in the morning; I found 5s. 6d., and a handkerchief, containing bread and meat, on him; and a halter in the crown of his hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Hornsey, and met two men in Hornsey-lane, on horseback; they asked if I would have a ride; and said if I would take the horse to Dixon's, they would give me half-a-crown; and the man said I was to take the bridle, and he would meet me at the Still public-house, as he was going to see his brother at Islington. I wanted to keep straight on the road; but he said, "Cross the lane, you will save a turnpike." When the watchman stopped me, the man was walking on the path, and said, "Jump off;" I did so, and ran after the man who was on the other horse, directly; the watchman sprang his rattle; I called back the man; I did not run to get away, but to stop the man who was with me; there is a public-house called the Still, opposite Dixon's repository; I have had a situation in the East India Company's service for five years.</p>

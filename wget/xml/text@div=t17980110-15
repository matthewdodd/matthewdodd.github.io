               <p>Q. There was nothing in that saltpetre itself, by which you can undertake to swear to it? - A. There is a great difference in the fineness; I believe there is no one in town, but Mr. Strong, in Clement's-lane, and myself, who make it so fine; I cannot pretend to swear to it, but I really believe it is mine, it is remarkably well refined, the prisoner was my servant, and had been so about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at all employed about the places where the saltpetre was? - A. He drove my cart, and had access to every part of the house; he was in my employment at the time I saw the advertisement, he had been with me from July 1796.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you sent him out with any refined saltpetre a short time before the 3d of January? - A.Every week, and almost every day; we have it from the Company's warehouses, in order to refine it, but this was refined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to send your saltpetre out in bags of this description? - A. No; in casks of a hundred weight each to druggists, oilmen, grocers, and other tradesmen, and some in papers of a quarter of a hundred sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. But never sent it out in these sort of bags, which had brought almonds to your house? - A. Never; they were used for getting beans and barley for my horses, or other common purposes, I have had them four years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Your only reason for knowing the bag, is that mark of Smith and company, and the figure? - A. Yes; Smith and company is in red, and the figure in black.</p>
               <p>Q. That name and figure was upon them, when you bought them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And consequently might be upon hundreds besides? - A. It might.</p>

            , in Whitechapel-road, an oil and colourman; on the 28th of December, the prisoner at the bar came into the shop, and offered some saltpetre to sell contained in this bag; I knew him by sight, and had dealt with him before for articles of the same kind, which he brought in a paper bag.</p>
               <p>Q.Refined saltpetre? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Well refined? - A. I am not a judge of the niceties of saltpetre; I have been in the habit of selling saltpetre in London these seven years, it was refined saltpetre; the last time he came, when he brought the bag, I went up and told my master, he desired me to ask him his name, what he was, who he was, and where he lived; I came down stairs, and asked him these questions; he said, his name was Jones, he lived in Brick-lane, and was a saltpetre refiner; I got a pen and ink, and desired him to write it down, and he did; I went up stairs, and gave my master the paper, and told him what he said, my master told me to go down stairs, and tell him he would not buy it; I came down, and told him so, he swore he would not take it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any hint why you refused to buy it? - A. None at all; he said, he would call again for the saltpetre in a day or two, I think, but he did not, the saltpetre remained in the shop where he had left it; I went the next morning to enquire, in Brick-lane, but could hear of no such person there, a saltpetre refiner.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Brick-lane from Whitechapel? - A.Brick-lane comes into Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, if there had been any such person as a refiner in Brick-lane, you must have known it? - A. No; we do not deal largely in it, we do not buy it of the refiners; finding no such person, we applied to the Police-office, Lambeth-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100026"></xptr>Whitechapel, and the officers took the bag away from the shop to the office; I marked the bag with a brush, and sealed it, before it was delivered to the officer with the saltpetre in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much may you have bought of the prisoner at different times? - A. From ninety to one hundred pounds weight.</p>
               <p>Q.Without any enquiry till this last time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any suspicion of him? - A. Yes, we had, but we had nothing to identify it till this bag came, with the mark of E. Smith and Company, No. 13. We could not find any body in London of that name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine Directories? - A. No; but we enquired of tradesmen, both chymists, oilmen and druggists; it was advertised from the office, and on Thursday, Mr. Jones claimed the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.There was nothing particular in this saltpetre, except that it was refined saltpetre? - A. Yes; it is rather larger than common, and of a brighter colour than common, it is finer.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not such saltpetre as you can swear to on account of its fineness? - A. I think I could swear to that in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time it was in your shop, the shop was open to all sorts of customers, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were sometimes in and sometimes out? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. (Produces the property). I am an officer belonging to Whitechapel office: On Wednesday, the 3d of this month, the prosecutor applied for a warrant to search the prisoner's lodgings; he procured a warrant, and in company with Nolan, I went to execute that warrant; I went to the prosecutor's house, in a court in Ratcliff-highway, he gave me charge of the prisoner at the bar, I did not search his apartment; I took the prisoner into custody, and brought him to the office; I asked him what he had been about, that should induce his master to give charge of him to me, the poor fellow fell a crying, and said, it was concerning a little saltpetre; I had not before acquainted him with what the charge was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make him any promises of favour? - A. I did not, I knew it would be contrary to my duty so to do; I asked how he got it, and if any person was concerned with him; he said, no; seeing so many persons concerned with the premises, I asked him how he could get it without being perceived; he said, he took it while they were at dinner; I asked him what he had done with it, and he said, he had sold it at a shop in Whitechapel; I asked him, if he had sold any before; he said, he had sold a little twice, but not so much as this; I then brought him to the office, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before or after Mr. Jones had been to the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He had heard from Mr. Jones what he was taken up for? - A.He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you gave him no encouragement to say what he did? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Jones). What sort of a character did he bear? - A. A very good one, or I would not have kept him; he has a wife and two small children.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bag? - A. I can swear to the figure 13, the saltpetre is as much like mine as it can be.</p>

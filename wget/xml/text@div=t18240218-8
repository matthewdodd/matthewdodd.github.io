            . I am servant to Mr. Carter. I saw the prisoner take a quarter of beef out of the cart. I sang out, nobody answered me; he went away with it. My master missed a quarter of beef - we followed the prisoner, and took him with it on his back. I only lost sight of him as he turned the corner for half a moment - he did not go a hundred yards with it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. There were a great many more people carrying beef in the market - A. Yes. I know he is the man; he had the beef when I took him. I had seen him in the market before.</p>

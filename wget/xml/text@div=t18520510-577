                  </hi>. I am waiter, at the Gardener's Arms beer-shop, in South-street, Camberwell. I went out with beer to Mr. Stanley, a cus<lb></lb>tomer, about a quarter past 9 o'clock in the evening of 20th of April—as I was returning I met the prisoner—he took me by the collar, turned me round towards a gaslight, a little way off, opposite the fence belonging to the work-house, and said, "You are the person I have been looking for for five or six years; you are one of the parties amongst others that have had connection with my wife"—I said, "My good man, you are mistaken; I neither know you or have seen you before, or your wife either"—that was true; I had never, to my knowledge, seen him before, or his wife—I declare, most solemnly, he was an entire stranger to me—he struck me on the bridge of my nose, knocked me down on my back in the road, and began kicking me—he kicked me on the jaw, on the eye, right over the eye, and on the other side of the face, and the ribs—I could not see whether he had boots or shoes on—the last kick that I remember receiving was in the mouth, and my teeth were loosened—he continued kicking me, as far as I know, till some one came up—I became nearly insensible.</p>

I remember the night of 20th April, I was passing through Adam-street—I saw the prisoner strike the last witness—he struck him in the face with his fist, and knocked him down—after he was down he began kicking him—I fetched the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Denmark-hill. On the night of 20th April, I was sent for to the police station, at Camberwell-green and found the prosecutor there—his right eye was perfectly closed and swollen to a great extent, so much so that I could not separate the lid to see if the sight was injured—the other eye was also swollen, but not to so great an extent—the forehead had two lacerated cut wounds—the bridge of the nose was fractured—the bones were riding one over the other—the upper jaw was fractured, and three of the teeth inclined towards the mouth—I replaced them, and since then he has gone on in a very prosperous manner—he had also a considerable bruise on his chest—his ribs were not fractured, there were some bruises on them—I should think his jaw and nose had been injured by a kick or blow—his life was in danger for the four first days, I apprehended erysipelas—he is still under my care—he is now out of danger.</p>

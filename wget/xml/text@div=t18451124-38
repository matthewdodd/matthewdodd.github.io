                  </hi>. I am surveyor to the parish of St. Pancras. I made this plan—it accurately represents a portion of the workhouse—the part called the school—house is a separate building—it joins, but has no communication with any other part—there is a room on the ground floor used as a dining hall—above that is a school—room and sleeping—room—there are separate apartments, for the use of the master, at the east end—there is an area, separated from the burial ground by a boundary wall, adjoining the school—westward is the shoemakers'and tailors' shop, and a yard before that—westward from the tailors' shop if a distinct building, called the oakum room, which consists of a ground floor and a floor above it—there is a yard behind that, and a wall continued from the area—the communication from the lower to the upper oakum rooms is by a step—ladder—there was formerly a communication outside, from the yard to the upper room, by a stone staircase—that has been remove and bricked up on the outside by a nine—inch wall—the yard is covered with iron bars behind the oakum room—persons getting out by that door could walk over the bars, which are nearly on a level with the upper floor of the oakum room—a per—son getting out by this door—way would be a very few inches above the bars—persons could pass along the wall—there is a stone landing, reaching from the area to the boundary wall—the boundary wall is about fifteen feet high from the bottom of the area, about six or seven feet above that landing—there is a flight of steps from the landing into the area—persons could pass from the oakum room door, which had been blocked up, over the iron railing down into the area very easily, by dropping on the stone landing—I saw the oakum room about a fortnight ago, and saw a hole which had been made through the door—way which had been bricked up, large enough for a person to pass through—the door itself had been fastened up, and bricked up outside besides—the hole was made through the part which had been bricked up, but I have not seen the in—terior—I saw the windows of the dining—room and the back area—it had been then refixed.</p>

I was in the oakum room of the workhouse on the night of the 8th of Nov.—I went to bed about a quarter to eight o'clock, and the rest of them came to bed about eight o'clock, in a sleeping room above the oakum room—there were about twenty-eight in the oakum room that night—the prisoners were all there—at eight o'clock the fastenings of the room were all safe—you get into the sleeping-room by a trap door, which is fast<lb></lb>ened outside by a padlock underneath in the work-room—after it was supposed the foreman had left the building, Morrison procured a light by means of a lucifer with oil or something and a piece of cotton—James asked if there was any objection in their going to get some supper or something to eat—several of them said no—I do not know which it was particularly—Bushell and Morrison took a sash out of some of the windows, and commenced undoing some iron bars outside—they did not succeed, and one of the three said they would try the door—Brett, at the time, spoke, and said that in the boys' dining-hall they would find the boys' boxes on the shelf, and no doubt a trifle of money in them, and they would find a cupboard in the boys' hall which contained some knives, and with one of them they might open a cup<lb></lb>board containing provisions at the bottom of the passage, that there was a pair of steps outside the area, and they could go down and make an entrance into the boys' hall—after some time they got the door open, and commenced knocking away the brickwork—they made a hole sufficient to get through, and James, Bushell, and Smith got through the hole—others might have gone through, for, being short of oil, they were afraid it would not last long enough to have a light, and it was put out—they were absent I dare say twenty minutes or half an hour—one of them came through the hole first, and received a box which was handed through the hole—I saw a small bundle in Bushell's hand after he came back—I saw James, Bushell and Smith come in—the box was taken to the bed that Morrison slept in—it was opened, and I saw Bushell take some copper money out and put it in his cap—Morrison took a waistcoat in his hand, and I saw two pencil cases in his hand and some glasses of a magic lantern—I saw something brought from Morrison's bed and given to Brett, who slept with me, and he put it under his</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">James's Defence.</hi> I was an inmate of the workhouse—I was admitted about the 28th of Oct.—I was not allowed all the while I was in the oakum-room to go out—I told Evans the night I came in, that I wished to go out again, and if I was refused to go out, as I had been when there before, certainly should effect my escape, and break all before me—I told him to write my name down as having applied to be discharged—he did so, and brought an answer that the committee would not see me, and I was not to go out—I remained until the Monday after, and then sent up to Mr. Lee for my discharge—he said I should not go out—I sent up again on the Tuesday, and he said I should not go out—I said repeatedly to the other inmates, that if I was hindered in my discharge, I certainly would make an effort with the axe or anything to break down all before me, and escape; I sent up on the following Friday to the committee; I was not allowed to see them or to leave the room; I said I would wait until Saturday evening, as we had a few halfpence to receive for our work, and then we broke out of the room, got into the burial-ground, and effected our escape, through the ill-treatment we received there, which was eleven days; I only had four ounces of meat, and was starved there, and was determined to effect my escape; me, Bushell, and Smith, took some nails out of the door; I opened it by the instruction of Dawson, who told us to try the top of the door; we displaced part of the brick-work; there were two bricks outside the doorway; we took them out; we had to go over a large wall; I, Bushell, and Smith, went out; as we were going along the wall, we saw something on the wall; and as we thought, two men running across the burial-ground; we watched them about a quarter of</p>

               <p>an hour, then returned back into the oakum-room, and stated what we had seen to all the men; we were all alarmed; and 1 said I was afraid to go away then, and I would not go; there was no light in the room; we went to the further end of the room, and communicated what we had seen to two men in the room; they persuaded us to stop, and not go out; 1 said I would stop, and went to my bed to lie down, but in going towards the bed, I passed a box in the room, but who brought it there I cannot say; I was surrounded by several of the men who were rummaging the things about in the box, but where the box went to afterwards I cannot say; I did not meddle with it, and never touched anything in it; after that we went out to see if we could see anybody in the burial-ground; we were outside about half an hour, but we heard nothing, and returned again and went to bed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner Bushell made a defence to the same effect, stating that he was not allowed to see his wife, and being half-starved, and refused his discharge, he was induced to attempt to escape; he also stated that the witness Davis was induced to swear falsely against them, in hopes of obtaining better treatment; and that he had frequently said he had taken false oaths, and thought it no sin.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Morrison's Defence.</hi> They asked me to try to open the door; I did so, but I did not get the light; they always have a light to smoke with; when they went out I went to bed, and the light was put out; I did not go out; a box was shoved through the hole; I turned over on my bed, and several men came round it; it is impossible to say who broke it open, but it was taken out at the hole again; 1 cannot say who by; I got into bed again, and about a quarter of an hour after somebody called me by name; I said, "I am not going out there;" the men in the place said, "Why don't you go out, per<lb></lb>haps one of them have fallen off the wall, and hurt themselves?" Dawson said I had better go out, and 1 just put my head out; the men came back, and said,</p>

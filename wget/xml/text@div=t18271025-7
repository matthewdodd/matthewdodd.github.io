               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said once that I was in the dress that I am in at present? A. I believe I said he had a black waistcoat and light handkerchief, but I spoke to his features the moment i saw him in prison - he had the same dress on before the Magistrate as when he robbed me - it was a blue coat, drab trousers, black waistcoat, and light-coloured handkerchief - I do not think the handkerchief he has on now is the same.</p>

            . I am a police constable of Mary-le-bone. I apprehended the prisoner on the 25th of September, between two and three in the afternoon, on other charges; he was remanded for re-examination, and while he was in custody, the prosecutor came to the office and identified him among six or seven other prisoners in the lock-up room - he denied the charge; I told him if he would tell me where he was on the Sunday night, I would endeavour to get his friends here to prove it, but he declined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday morning I went out to breakfast - I returned to my lodgings, cleaned myself, put on a drab coat and buff waistcoat; I returned to Whitehall to see a friend, and from there went to the Three Tuns public-house, Oxford-street, and waited there for my cousin, I had some ale, and it was exactly ten o'clock when I returned to my lodgings.</p>

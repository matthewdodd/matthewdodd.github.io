               <p>Sharp. More a great many than are here; I can't tell who took them; they were found in her House; my Wife took them with a Warrant; I was not there, but the Constable and my Wife together.</p>

               <p>Sharp. I lost my Pail five Months ago; examining among my Neighbours, and a little Girl that is here told me, that

             had got it; I went up to her Bed to ask her, Whether she had got my Pail? and she made me no Answer. I look'd about, and saw my Things. I said, Mrs Lomas, these are my Things, that old-fashion'd Plate that hung up by a String, &amp;c. She said, Touch the Things out of my Room, and I'll send you to Newgate. Then I got a Search-Warrant, and found these Things; but I have lost a great many more.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner, in her Defence, pleaded, That they were sent by the Woman herself, because her Husband might not break them; and also this Woman, Wife to the Prosecutor, owned her Money.</p>

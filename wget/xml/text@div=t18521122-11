                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Alger's employ. On Thursday, 21st Oct., about 4 o'clock in the morning, I left my master's house with a load of straw—I was to take it to Smithfield, or sell it going along, if I could get a fair price for it—I met the two prisoners in Old-street; Tavener came up first,—he asked me if I would sell my straw, and said he would give me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load for it—I told him I could not take less than 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said a man named Hobbs authorized him to buy a ton of straw, that it appeared to him just as it had come from the barn door, and he was quite sure Hobbs would have it—I had a ton in my cart; fifty-four trusses—Smart was following the cart, which was still going on—Tavener said to me, "Come down here;" that was down Tabernacle-row—we went down there with Smart and the cart—I was by the side of my horses—the prisoners turned up a gateway, where there were folding doors; they came back and said, "Hobbs does not live here, he lives down lower"—when we had got a little further on, Tavener said, "Stop here;" that was still in Tabernacle-row—he said, "He lives just up the street here, leave the horses here"—I called a boy to hold my horses, and told him I would give him a penny—Tavener said Hobbs lived just up the street, and I could go up there with him, and see Hobbs myself—I went with him up a street, which leads out of Tabernacle-row into the City-road—he said, "Don't give any more boys a penny, Smart will stand by the horses"—Smart remained by the cart beside the boy—when we got to the top of the street I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "A little further"—I said, "I shall not go further away from my horses"—he said if I waited five or ten minutes he would fetch Hobbs to me—I waited five</p>

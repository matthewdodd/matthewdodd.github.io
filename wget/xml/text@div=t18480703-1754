                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. On the 5th June, about five minutes to eight o'clock in the evening, I attended to report a meeting at a place called Chartist-hall, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road—after I got there a chairman was appointed—about 200 persons were present then—they increased as the proceedings went on—I should say the greatest number present was be<lb></lb>tween 300 and 400—they were of the lower orders—I should say the majority were Irish—there were about half a dozen women—I took a short-hand note of the proceedings—I have it here—there were several speakers—the prisoner was one—he was announced by the chairman, as Mr. Looney, the Secretary of the Davis Club—he said, "Mr. Chairman and fellow-countrymen, I came down to-night from our Club, in consequence of Mr. Terry, and the other men who are here, informing us that they were about to open a Club in this neighbourhood, to organize the Irishmen and Englishmen of this locality, who are disposed for such organization, and to look for freedom. The chair<lb></lb>man has misinformed you when he introduced me to you as a speaker. I am not a speaker, but I am one who has a dreadful hostility to Lord John Rus<lb></lb>sell; and I will tell you more, I am one of his most practical opponents, I believe, at present in London. I go into every neighbourhood where Irish<lb></lb>men and Englishmen are to be found, and try to get them to become dissatis<lb></lb>fied with his Government; and I will tell you more, I advise them to get arms. And I came here specially to-night to propose a resolution to that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030128"></xptr>
               <p>effect to this meeting, and I will read it to you:—' Resolved—That as God made man, and man made arms, and as it is the undoubted right of every man to possess arms, and know the use of them, and as the possession of them imparts a dignity and importance which none but the possessor knows or can appreciate, we think it right to advise all present to provide themselves with the same, as the best and surest means to repel a foreign foe, a mid<lb></lb>night burglar, or an armed myrmidon of any Government that chooses to set itself up as the oppressor of the people it governs, or the stifler of the public opinion honestly expressed.' But let me tell you that, before I go any further, I am decidedly for moral force"—(here there was some confusion among the audience.)—" My friends, do not misunderstand me. I am for moral force, as far as the force of persuasion goes, when it is adjudicated by justice; but I believe that the Government at present do not act in that manner, and that they are enabled to carry out their measures of injustice, because they have physical force at their hack to succour them. That is my opinion; and I will tell you how we will manage that. Let every man in this meeting, who thinks that is the fact, provide himself with a good pike; and now, particularly now, that the time is coming, when men will be called upon to act the parts of men, and no longer talk and blunder like so many wind-bags, and speak about rights and wrongs with you, and never tell you how you may redress them. New, I tell you how you may manage them. The surest way to avoid all fighting, and all battling, and all murder, is for every man in the country to arm himself; that is the way to manage it. Then there will be no fighting; the Government will see you are too strong, and the advocates of justice will have fair play wherever they are. Now, to be practical, I believe the Government of this country are the greatest traitors this country has got. I believe it is impossible for this state of things to exist much longer, and enable the working men to maintain themselves or their families. I believe it is impossible. All the world seems to heave at this moment for liberty and for justice to the working classes; and now the only man who effectually preached the true doctrine calculated to give the working man the means of living, this man is taken away by the horrible machinations of an unjust and pernicious law, and transported away from us. We have not his fellow. I believe he was the first man who preached and propounded that doctrine, (and I believe it is the only true doctrine,) which is calculated to save the lives of the people"—(a voice "Robert Emmett.")—" Emmett did his business in his day; but men have forgotten Emmett and the teaching of Emmett. Let us not in our day, after such a glorious example, forget the teaching of the master who has been sent away from us. For fourteen weeks he wrote and propounded beautiful doctrines. I would advise you all to adopt them, and to act upon them practically, and let each man go into his neighbourhood—let each man speak to his wife and children, and tell them of the—wrongs we are obliged to endure; and tell them of the millions of his countrymen who have been slaughtered, and when manufactures are at a standstill, and when the aristo<lb></lb>cracy are no longer able to trample on the rights of foreign nations; you will not be able to succeed in getting employment, unless the land is taken away from the robbers who have got it, and given to you. We must not be afraid of the Government. I tell you from this spot I am a republican in heart and soul! In my own Club this is our night of meeting; I shall not therefore inflict any more of my remarks on you, for there are othi-r men who have come here to speak to you; but I tell you to be particular to do this:—Let every ten or twenty of you in the neighbourhood you live in, meet; and it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030129"></xptr>
               <p>your means are very poor, and you cannot provide yourselves with guns or rifles, you can get pikes from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; and, mind you, you can get pistols very cheap. I tell you, as one of your friends, not to misuse them: do not go about the streets. I am opposed at present to street works; I do not like to act such a part; I do not like to go into open-air meetings, or processions: but any fellow who is paid for cudgelling my head in, will find me stiff enough for him; and I can tell him that if he attempts to strike me, he should strike nobody else. Now this may perhaps be my position, or the position of some others who talk to you from time to time; but you" may not all be prepared for such an emergency; and therefore it is I would not advise you to go to these public demonstrations, and hold public meetings, and stand with your hands in your pockets, whilst a policeman comes up with his bludgeon, and knocks you down. They have said in that thing called the House of Lords, that these demonstrations are very bad—that they are very dangerous, for they are a rendezvous for pickpockets. Then I say, let us have no meetings of pickpockets; let the people all adopt this resolution, and we will go to the House of Lords, and we will discard them first: they are pickpockets by wholesale, and not the poor wretch who is driven by hunger and desperation to take a loaf! If you were to go over the list, it would appear the most preposterous thing in the world that the people of this coun<lb></lb>try have been subjected so long to such horrible tyranny, as to be obliged to pay them pensions. I will tell you what you must do: your lesson must be the first principles of justice, to enable you to carry out these things. Go home into your neighbourhoods to-night; do not come to these meetings again until you have taken care to make that proper preparation which you will be called upon to make: and you Irishmen that are here, the harvest that is growing in your country shall never leave it till every man has had plenty of food What must you have felt during the last famine-time, as you passed through the different streets, and as you passed through the different purlieus'—I will say the purlieus, and rat-holes that you were obliged to live in, in consequence of the circumstances in which you were placed. How far better would you be in your mountain homes. Oh my God! how I sigh to be at the foot of the mountain where I was born! In the middle of the plague I went there, because I hate to live in London; and every morning I almost curse my fate because I am content to live here. I say how much better for us all, and Englishmen too, would it be if we were obliged by the circumstances in which our country was placed, to remain at home, where plenty of food, and plenty of labour could be found, instead of coming here into the market to compete with Englishmen, and reduce their wages. Now you Irishmen who are disposed to stop this thing, again I say to you, go into your neighbourhoods, and talk, club tojether, love one another, have no drinking-. Do not follow any man you do not know: do not be led into. riot, disorder, or destruction, by any parties you do not know, or are not acquainted with: destroy no man's property: do not, as the blackguard press of England would fain have the public believe, do not be treacherous, nor permit any pilfering to go on anywhere, to tarnish our movement: and if you see any man do a base or cowardly act, stop him, lay hold of him, because he is an enemy to our common cause. But I will tell you what we shall do. Our people at home this year will, my life upon it, keep the food that is there, until every Irishman has got sufficient to eat. There shall be no more-famines: and then if the myrmidons of the English Government dare to hew them down, by heavens we will be there to help! The press of England, the thunderer, the ruffian <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, says, 'Oh, '—what does it call the Confederates?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030130"></xptr>
               <p>some horrible name, some 'hireling crew!' (a voice, do not dirty your mouth;')—at nil events i: says we are mean hirelings. That is a lie No man who opens his mouth receives a penny of reward; every man pays his own expenses, and he goes everywhere, impelled by nothing but the motive of pure and honest and high-minded patriotism, and to be enabled, if he can to erase the stain which has been placed upon his country by the acts of his countrymen during the last year or two; who have stood by and seen millions of the people hewed down by famine and death! It requires a great effort on our part to restore our country to the position of human nature, because I feel we have fallen far below it; then I say be ready in these times; do not be misled; do not help any plunderer; do not call say great open-air meetings, because they are not necessary; but go wherever ten, or twenty, or fifty of you can meet together; club together, take in the news, read the papers together, know what is going on, inform your minds, and keep yourselves ready for everything; it is a glorious thing, if the times require it, for men to stand up and die for their country; and when the time comes, let me tell you, Englishmen and Irishmen, that if the Government of England do not give the country to which I belong justice, when we are in the position which we will be before three months more, when we are in that position, we will demand justice; and if they do not give it, we will take it; and then Irishmen, as I said before, Irishmen will have a duty to perform, and I hope you will perform that duty nobly; your English friends, the English Chartists, are standing by your side; their cause is a holy cause, it is the cause of truth, and no matter what paltry efforts may be made to try and tarnish it, it will outlive all its enemies, and become the universal law; Irishmen, wherever you meet Englishmen and Scotchmen, be kind to them, they have been kind to me; I have worked with Englishmen five or six years since I have been living here, and I find them very kind to me; I say then let us be very kind to them; let us respect them, and love them, and love one another; our cause is their cause, and the press, and the oligarchy of this country have ever tried to poison our minds against them, and their minds against us; let us do our business then in spite of the vile press, and their hirelings; and though I am speaking in the presence of a great number of printers, I believe I am stating what is as nearly true as possible; there is as base a press in London as ever existed anywhere; I shall now trouble you no more; but I propose this resolution to you, that you should all provide yourselves with arms of some kind; and if you will all fraternize one with another, make your proper inquiries, and you will be sure of the way to every thing, and every thing will come quite <hi rend="italic">aisy</hi> to you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that resolution seconded by a person named Rooney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I believe Looney was still present—Rooney got up immediately, and he had finished his speech before a person could get out of the room—he said: "I feel great pleasure in seconding this resolution; and it would be super<lb></lb>fluous for me to add anything to what Mr. <hi rend="italic">Looney</hi> has said; I will only tell you this much—I will tell you that any of you who are for this reso<lb></lb>lution, should show it by being sharp and decisive—sharp in the time you take to get arms, and sharp in the time you take to learn how to use them; and be decisive when the day enmes for us to strike the blow."</p>

               <p>Repeal meeting—I should say the greater part of the meeting were Irish—there were some Englishmen—it was a public meeting—I did not announce the object for which I went—I went for more reasons than one—I was seen taking notes—every facility was afforded me, no obstruction was offered me; I was treated with respect—after Looney had finished speaking, he sat down, and if he had only sat for two minutes he must have been present during Rooney's short speech—he did not walk out of the meeting without sitting down—I positively swear he sat down, and that he was present when the resolution was seconded—Mr. Doogood, a gentleman from Messrs. Gurney's establishment, and my clerk were with me—we went specially to report the meeting—I saw no disturbance, tumult, or riot—as to tumult, I must add that at the strong parts of the speech there was very loud applause—I call that tumult, when it is very loud indeed, excessive—I have taken notes at the House of Commons, as a short-hand writer—I have heard similar tumult there—by tumult I mean applause.</p>

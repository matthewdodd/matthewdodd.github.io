               <p>Did you know Tickner's person? - Yes; I went up to him and spoke to him, but I don't remember what I said; he struck me so soon that I had not time to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Where did he strike you, and with what instrument? - I can't tell; it was something fixed on wood which cut me.</p>
               <p>Could you discern whether it shone? - No; I judge from the fling of it, it seemed to be fixed into a stick; it hung loose, and hit hard; it was not a long bill, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180018"></xptr> something loose, I think, came round my head, and it seemed to me to be tied to a stick, like a flail; the first blow fell upon my nose, the next on my head.</p>
               <p>Did you discover any body else in the field? - I did not see any body else to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When you received the second blow, what became of him? - I don't know; I was knocked down; I received several blows after I was down.</p>
               <p>Was you sensible of having received several blows on the ground? - Yes; but I suppose that I lay some time on the ground senseless.</p>
               <p>Did you either see, or hear, any person besides the prisoner Tickner? - I thought I heard somebody else when I was down; but I was not rightly sensible; but I am not sure whether I saw any other man or no.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose that you lay upon the ground? - I suppose about ten minutes; I got up; I saw no more of Tickner; I went home and called up a servant, and I was sent to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - A very light night; I saw Tickner very plain; Tickner was a hired servant to Adams; he lived with him as a part of his family.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are, I believe, one of the surgeons of St. George's Hospital? - Yes; Jacobb: was brought to the Hospital on the 17th of January; I was not present when he came; I examined his person, and found a small superficial wound upon the right side of his nose; he had a very large wound upon his neck immediately under the lower jaw; he had eight wounds on the top of his head.</p>
               <p>Do you mean cuts by wounds? - Yes; and one upon his hand, and a small one also in the right brow; I think three were all.</p>
               <p>What instruments, in your judgement, do you think these wounds were caused by? - I think by a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of a wound was that upon the nose, did it slit the nose? - No; it divided the exteguments of the nose; it did not go through the bones of the nose; it was of an oblique direction.</p>
               <p>Court. How far did it penetrate? - It did not go through; there is very little but the skin covers the bones of the nose; it went to the bone.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you call it a cut, or a scratch? - It was a cut.</p>
               <p>Court. Did it penetrate through the skin so as to cut the flesh? - I here is hardly any thing but skin; it went through the skin.</p>
               <p>Did it reach the bone? - I think it might.</p>
               <p>Is it such a wound as will leave any mark? - I think the cicatrix will not be seen in a little time; the cicatrix is scarcely to be seen now; I don't understand it to be a slit of the nose; it was lacerated.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. I can very plainly see a mark on the nose.</p>
               <p>Court. How long do you suppose it will be before that wound is so healed as not to be visible? - There was a month elapsed last Saturday; I suppose that in a fortnight, or a month, it will not be visible; I can't well say what time it will take to obliterate the mark.</p>
               <p>Will the mark ever be erased during the man's life time? - I can't say; there may be some little mark of it discovered upon a close examination.</p>

               <p>I am sixteen years old. I live servant with Mr. Cole, at Twickenham; my master had a couple of tame deer; he brought up one, and he bought another; they used to be kept in the barn-yard; that which was bought would have been two years old next June; they were both of an age; they were very tame. The buck would come and rub his head against any body; the doe was shy to strangers. They were left out in the barn-yard on Christmas-eve; the next morning the buck was missing. There are pails round the yard; I saw them in the yard that evening; sometimes we locked them up of a night. When we missed the buck; we found a great deal of blood at one end of the barn-yard; and there was hair and blood upon the wall where it had been taken over.</p>
               <p>Describe the buck? - He had a dumpty horn; and he had torn his car; and the shepherd cut it half off; it was of a brown colour. The prisoner lived about a quarter of a mile from my master's.</p>

               <p>I lived with the prisoner; upon Christmas-eve Adams and Tickner came home together, between twelve and one at night; upon opening the door, I saw a dead deer lying at the door; it had been stuck; its throat was cut; it had but one horn; they brought it into the house, and both of them skinned it; they kept all the flesh for their own eating, except one haunch, which my mistress carried for a present to London. The skin and the head (except a bit which was given to a dog) were buried in the garden.</p>

               <p>This deer struck my man on the ribbs; he told me of it; we looked over the wall, and the deer ran at him again; he said, he wished I would kill it; I struck it across the throat with my knife, and it lay some time on the ground. After I had killed it; I could not tell what to do with it. Tickner took it up, and carried it to my house, and threw it down at the door. The servant maid came, and asked what we had got, I thought it was a pity after it was dead to let it lie, so we carried it in, and skinned it; and we put the skin under ground.</p>

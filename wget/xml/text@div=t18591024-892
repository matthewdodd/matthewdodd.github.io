I am a town-traveller in the employment of Rock Brothers, and Payne—on a Saturday in the preceding month I went to the shop of Noble—I do not recollect the day of the month; it was the Saturday preceding that on which I went to the Mansion House—I saw several books lying out on a board in front of the shop—I passed on behind that and there I saw a lot of other books in a glass case, all seeming to belong to our firm—Noble's shop is an old book shop—I did not examine the books in the glass case—I saw Noble there, and said to him that he had a lot of goods belonging to our firm marked considerably under cost price, could he inform me who he bought them of? he said that he had bought them of a woman whose address he did not know, but he had it once, which was North Woolwich—I believe he said she came there once or twice a week—he said he would get me the address if I would call down; I said I would do so—I asked the name of the woman; he said he did not know the name.</p>

Rock's—we manufacture very large quantities of these metallic books—we do not make note paper, but we deal in it extensively, the same description of paper as is dealt in by all other wholesale and retail dealers—he did not tell me that the woman represented herself as the wife of a person who made this description of stationery, and that these were lots that her husband could not get a sale for; nothing of the kind—our foreman, Hall, was present—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the city of London constables—on Monday, 19th September last, I went with Mr. Rock to Noble's shop, and saw him there—Mr. Rock first spoke to him—he asked if his name was Noble, at the door; he said it was—Mr. Rock said he wished to speak to him, and we went inside; and he then gave the prisoner his card, and told him that we were two police-officers (that is, myself and Legg); that he understood he had some of his property there—he said that he had a small quantity that he had bought from a woman—I asked him if he knew who the woman was—he said he did not know her name, but she was there on the Saturday night, and he gave the address, 16, Grove-street—I think both I and Mr. Rock asked him then if he would show us what goods he had of Mr. Rock's—he looked round, and put about two dozen books on the counter, and said he believed they were all he had—Mr. Rock then said, "There are a quantity in a glass case outside; they appear to be my property"—the prisoner said, "Oh, yes, there are some in a glass case outside; they are nearly all your property"—they were brought in, and found to be Mr. Rock's property, nearly the whole—I asked him again if he had not asked the woman her name; he said he did not—he said he did not know whether he could find her, but that was the address she had given—I said, "Well, I will give you a fair chance to find her; you get into a cab and go with Legg, my brother officer, and see if you can find the woman"—previous to his going I had asked him if he had any bills or invoice of the goods; he said he had not—I asked him if he had any entry of this in his books; he said he had not, and that he had bought them a few at a time on different occasions during the last twelve months—he then went away with Legg—I told him that in the meantime Mr. Rock and I should look over his stock to see if there was any further property belonging to Mr. Rock—Mr. Rock and I found a small portion more in the front shop—we then went into the back shop, or rather a room at the back of the shop—I have the property here that we found (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are some packets not opened—nearly the whole of this property was found on shelves in the back shop, with tiers of books in front of them—nearly the whole of the property, with the ex<lb></lb>ception of the memorandum books were piled up behind, with a tier of books in front of them—when Noble came back with my brother officer I asked if they had found the woman—I found they had not—I then said to Noble, "You see the quantity of property we have found here belonging to Mr. Rock; I don't consider your account of them to be satisfactory, and it will be our duty to take you into custody for receiving them, knowing them to be stolen"—he made no reply to that—I said, "I shall take you to Bow-lane police station, and take the property with you"—the property was then put in the cab, and Legg and the prisoner went away to Bow-lane police station; but after he had got in the cab I said to him, "I am going to your father's shop, shall I find any of Mr. Rock's property there?"—he said, "Yes; you will find a quantity there which I have given my father to sell for me"—I then went to the father's with Mr. Rock, and received this parcel from the father; it was open about the shop—I packed it up together—there was a large quantity of note paper that had never been opened; about seventy parcels, I think, in their wrappers—I think they had no name on the outside, but there are some marks upon them by which Mr. Rock knows them.</p>

Noble, bookseller and stationer, Commercial-road"—I had not seen that before—that was in one of the packets that has not been opened since we have had it—Mr. Rock can tell you better than I whether it may have been opened or not; the prisoner told me he had received these in small parcels—he did not say the woman represented herself to be the wife of a manufacturing stationer; I am quite sure of that—I did not search for any stock-book on the premises, or any account book at all; nor did any of the other policemen—I cannot tell whether he had any book in which entries of stock were made—I did not think I had a right to look into other persons' private books—I thought I had only a right to meddle with that which Mr. Bock said was his property—I brought away, I think, two reams of ruled paper—Mr. Rock said he was not positive about that being his, but he believed it to be his; that it was the same make, and he thought it was their ruling—I also brought away some bill-paper—I don't know whether this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was claimed by Mr. Rock—if it came out of the basket, it was brought away with the others—but I don't recollect seeing this before—there is a door leading from the front shop to the back room—you can see into it from the street—it is a continuation of the shop—I don't know that I saw any of these books exposed on the shelves—I think some of the note paper Mr. Rock gave me from one of the front tiers—I can't say that the books that were at the back were continued on from where the paper was—my impression is that they were behind—there was a large quantity of books in the back shop—I have often seen books put one behind the other—all the books were in glass cases, both in the front and back shops—they were on shelves with glass slides before them to keep the dust from them—I did not go to look for the woman, Legg did; I went with the prisoner's brother to the father's—I took him to see two women a day or two afterwards, that we had some suspicion of, and he said neither of those was the woman that came to the brother's shop.</p>

               <p>us to examine—that was after he had produced a small proportion of the goods—I saw a glass case outside the door, and in that was a considerable quantity of goods of our manufacture—I asked how he came into possession of these goods; he said he bought them of a woman, but he did not know her name—I asked over what period of time the purchase had extended—I think he said twelve months—I asked if he knew the name of the person—he said he did not, but he gave an address which I forget; shortly after he left in company with the officer, and I proceeded to make a further examination—I found a considerable quantity of goods; nearly the whole was found after they had left, in a back room adjoining the shop—they were in glass cases, and almost without an exception behind printed books, so that an ordinary observer would not notice them—I believe they are all here—there are several which have not been opened; they are in the wrappers as they left our warehouse—none of the note paper has been opened; some few of the books outside the shop were marked at certain prices—here is one marked 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the retail price of which is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and our price to the trade is about 12 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should say that there was about one tenth of the property found outside the door—the value of the whole that I found was about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that would be retailed at a price considerably beyond that—there was a very small quantity of stationery on the premises which I could not identify, perhaps 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, not more—Talbot was a porter in our employment, and I think had been so for twenty years—I do not remember his address, but it was the same house to which I went with the policeman—Talbot had access to our stock; to this class of stock particularly—the policeman went to Talbot's house on a Monday in September—the following day he absented himself from his duty—I never recollect his having done so before without leave.</p>

I remember the prisoner coming to my husband's apartment on the 22d of September last, a little after eight o'clock in the evening. There were others came with him. They came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I believe I had known him five or six months before. I was sitting by the fire when he came in. They broke the shop door down. Three of them did the execution. I saw the prisoner with an ax cut the tackling down, and the silk in the loom. All three did part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. They quitted the house directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was one of them?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I am certain of it. I have no doubt of it, for I saw him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your husband lodge in Mr. Dupree's house?</p>

               <p>M. Edwards. Yes. We had the first floor, a whole floor, a lodging room, and a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner come in at the street door?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come into your room?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. My room door was upon the latch. They lifted up the latch and came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to you?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. They said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts does the shop lie?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. They were obliged to go by me to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop door locked?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. No, it was only latched.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any light in your room?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I had, and they took it from me, from where I sat.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. There were six of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came in first?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I do not know that. It was the first of them that took my light away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. Yes. When they knocked the door down, I could plainly see them all. They were not far from where I was. Three of them might stand between the prisoner and me. I am very positive he was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. What silk did they destroy?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I do not know the name of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it to make?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. It was to make ribbons in the engine loom; that is, a different loom from the broad work.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the ribbons all silk?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. They are. It was in the loom, and there was a great deal more not in the loom.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property was it?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. It was the property of Mess. Dickinson and Graham.</p>

               <p>Mr. Dowell. The loom was my property that was destroyed in the house of Mr. Dupree. On the 23d of September Mr. Edwards came and told me, between nine and ten o'clock, that there had been people there who had destroyed the loom, and cut the work. He said he did not know any of them, but that his wife did. I went to look the next morning, and found the loom cut to pieces, and the ribbon that was made destroyed, as also the rest of the materials. The silk was the property of Messieurs Dickinson and Graham. I was their servant, and gave it out.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that his loom was cut?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I saw his loom on Sunday the 24th of September, and saw that it had been cut. I asked his wife how it came cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it cut in the manner the cutters do?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. That I cannot tell any thing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on the 22d?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I did. I met him in Blue-Anchor Alley, about a quarter of an hour before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. No body at all. We went together to the Two Brewers, in White-Cross-street, and called for a pint of beer. We had not been there long before one Mr. Price came in, and knowing him, I asked him if he would drink with me. He said he would. We staid there till ten o'clock, then we came out, and I left the prisoner and Price at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner and Price in company with you all that time?</p>

               <p>Q. Now another question. What makes you remember the 22d of September?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. It being a rejoicing night, I went out to get a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the rejoicing about?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. It was the king's coronation. I remember it by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not some club or other on that night?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. No. I met him intirely by accident. It was a quarter before eight by the dial when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the dial that day se'nnight at a public-house?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I always do, when I go to a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you do, where there is no dial?</p>

            . I saw Edwards on the Sunday morning. Upon my oath I never told him so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards. He told me so that morning. He said he had not seen any of them for several weeks. He said he did not go so much among them as he did. He said he was very sorry for the prisoner, when he heard he was in Bridewell. This he said as we were parting.</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I came to Mr. Edwards, knowing his things were out; and knowing Fessey was an honest man, I came to know if it was him or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you came to know the right of the thing, because you did not think he was guilty?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I did.</p>

               <p>Riddletale. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That was very material; why did you not?</p>

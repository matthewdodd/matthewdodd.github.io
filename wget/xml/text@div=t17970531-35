             sworn. - I am a printer, in Aldermanbury: The prisoner was my servant, I apprehended the prisoner in consequence of an information on Saturday the 13th of May; I immediately went to his house in Bethnal-green, I found his wife there; I went into a back room, there I found a large quantity of paper, part of which paper the constable took away, a large quantity of printing types, one hundred and sixty pounds, and an Oxford Testament, part of a printed book not bound, called Mrs. Rowe's works, some spelling books, not bound, called printed paper, twenty-five quires of white demy printing paper, and four sheets of gilt post paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310039"></xptr>Q. Are you able to speak to any of those articles being your property? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the prisoner after you had found those things? - A. I went home, and took him immediately before the Alderman; I had left him in custody of an officer at my own house. The moment he saw the officer, he acknowledged he had robbed me, and begged I would forgive him, and hoped I would consider his wife and child; I told him I could not, and ordered the constable to take him away. I had missed various things, particularly large letters that we make use of for handbills, that are stuck against the walls; there is so much paper about the house it is impossible to miss it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Could you not tell whether you had lost paper if you took your stock? - A. We could not take our stock; I may lose a great many reams of paper and not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal pretty largely? - A. I should like to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Possibly you might have sold that paper? - A. I never sold demy paper of that description; some of this paper was absolutely wetted, to be printed upon; and there never was a wholesale paper-maker ever sold a quite of paper ready wetted; I never heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. This man has had some dealings with you? - A. He did buy some books.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not buy some demy paper of you? - A. Before he was my servant he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long has he been your servant? - A. Since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, fell the prisoner at the bar some low demy? - A. Low demy I did fell him, to my sorrow; and several other articles, before he came into my service, to the amount of several pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not some security for it? - A. Yes; I have his father's warrant of attorney, which is not yet due.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Had you ever sold him any types? - A. Never any.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: I went with Mr. Wilkins to search the prisoner's house, those are the things I found in the house; I was with the prosecutor when I found them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkins. It is proper to inform the Court, that my types are cast differently from any other printer's types in the trade; they are shorter in the shank; my predecessor, Mr. Oliver, had his types uniformly cast in that manner, and the most of the letters that are taken were formerly his, part of them have been in my possession sixteen years, and part of them are quite new. I can also speak to them by a particular nick, they are distinguished by either one, two, or three nicks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. With respect to the paper, what part of that paper did you find wet? - A. There are twenty-five quires altogether, and two or three of them were wet. This printed paper is my property likewise, some is printed on one side, some on both sides; I am sure of that which is printed at my press.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have bought demy paper of him, and a great quantity of spelling-books, and psalms and hymns, since I have been in his service. He has taken away some books which are not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wilkins.) Q. Had he any press at his house to carry on the printing business? - A. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the wet paper, did not he wet the paper himself? - A. Oh yes, he might; it is never wetted out of the house.</p>

On the 12th of October I lost two box coats and another smaller coat out of the gig, which had been left safe the night before, and two horse-cloths out of a stable - I have never seen them since.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH NORMAN. I am a labourer, and live at Waterford, near Hertford. On the 12th of October, about seven or half-past seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner offered me two coats for sale - one was a box coat, and the other a market frock coat: I had not money enough to buy them, and he tied them up in his bundle - he took out some bills belonging to Mr. James Dickinson; I had known the coats, as I had seen Mr. Dickinson wear them - I saw Mr. Dickinson about three days afterwards, and told him: I did not read the bills, and cannot say what was on them -I saw no marks on the coats, but the large one was a box coat, a kind of snuff colour; I do not know how many capes it had - it was not new, but it was a good one: I cannot tell whether the collar was velvet or silk - it was the same colour as the coat; I cannot say whether the pockets were inside or out - it was a smooth coat and had an edging round it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Could you swear to that coat from among half a dozen others? A. Yes, I could - I did not notice whether there were any buttons to the sleeves; there were no straps.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the other coat? A. It was a fustian market coat, smooth, like a drover's; I could pick them both out.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON re-examined. Q. What was the colour of the big coat? A. It was a drab; I cannot be positive whether it was bound round or not - it had not a velvet collar: the other was a fustian frock, which I generally wear, with four or five capes to it; the prisoner was out of the way for some time - Norman did live next door to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAMP. I am an officer of Edmonton. I took up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140048"></xptr>the prisoner at Enfield fair, the last day of November - he was here last Session, but he was not tried; I did not know about the coats when I took him - but the prosecutor told me of it in about an hour: I then asked the prisoner, and he said he knew nothing about them: he lived with the prosecutor three or four years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Dickinson saw me several times - he saw me at Kingston fair.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKINSON. Yes, I had seen him, but was a great distance from him - I never saw him near me after I lost the coats.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him before you knew the coats were gone? A.Perhaps I might - I missed my coats one morning, and the same day the witness told me of it; the two horse-cloths were taken to a shop and sold.</p>

            . I saw the horse-cloths hanging to dry on a hedge belonging to another man - it was at Edmonton; the prisoner offered them to me for sale at a public-house, about the 12th of October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have a witness here who heard what was said before the Justice - Norman gave me sixpence and said he would not come up against me, but I had knocked him about.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH NORMAN. I did say something of that sort when they kept bothering me - I do not know whether I said any thing about his knocking me about; I might or I might not.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DODSON. I heard Norman say to the prisoner, after he had been before Mr. Mores, when the prisoner looked in his face and said, "Joe, you know you have foresworn me" - "I know it, but it is because you hit me; but never mind, when I come up I will not hurt a hair of your head:" I said to Jeffkins the officer, "Do you hear that?" and he said, "No, I did not;" Norman gave him sixpence and I said, "If you have foresworn you ought to have your head knocked off;" he said he would make a flaw in the indictment.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH NORMAN re-examined. He said something of that kind, but I did not say "I know I have;" I cannot say justly what I said - I kept telling them not to bother me; I do not think I said I would make a flaw in the indictment, and that I would not hurt a hair of his head.</p>

            . I am a City-officer. On Sunday morning, the 18th of November, I was on the approach to London-bridge, on the City side, about a quarter to eight o'clock - I saw the prisoner Shipps with a bag<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290065"></xptr>over his shoulder, between some new buildings in Miles-lane; I crossed over to ask what he had got, and missed him - I walked towards Cannon-street, and when I got to the top of the lane I saw him and Cain together; Cain had a parcel under his arm and a bag - Skipps still had his bag over his shoulder; I followed them till I saw Evans - I spoke to him; we followed them - he went after Skipps, and I went after Cain, and asked what he had got - he said,"Only a piece of wood;" I opened the bag, and found it was a dial - while I was doing so he ran away; there was nobody to leave the dial with or to stop him, and he got away; I got information, and found him in a house in Fryingpan-alley - I took a pair of shoes off his feet, which the prosecutor identified; I passed down Cannon-street, and met Wilckes with a bag over his shoulder - I stopped him, and asked what he had got; he said I might look - I took him to the watch-house, and found six coats in it, and some boots and shoes; he was dressed in a coat, waistcoat, trousers, shoes, and hat, which are identified by the prosecutors - in his pocket were various articles, which are claimed also.</p>
               <p>JOSIAH EVANS. I am a street-keeper. I have heard Parish's evidence - it is correct; I secured Skipps, and asked him what he had got - he said some plums; I asked what else - he said nothing else; I said, "I shall look in your bag;" he said I had better, if I was not satisfied: I found he had got figs, plums, and nutmegs, in the bag - I took a pair of shoes off him at the watch-house, and he had got some bad coins in his shoes.</p>

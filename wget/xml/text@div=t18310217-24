On the 8th of February the prisoner was brought into the shop with two panes, which I believe to be ours - they are marked S. and T. Ponder; my partner's name is Thomas - the prisoner was a stranger; he said he had been out of work seven weeks, and would beg my pardon on his knees if I would let him go; I know nothing of the previous circumstances.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. I was in the shop; I received information from Hooker and went after the prisoner - I saw him in Monument-yard, about fifty yards from the shop, and the planes laying in the kennel a few yards from him; I asked him where the parcel was - he directly said he had been out of work some time, and had not had any victuals for some time; a person said, "Here is the parcel" - the planes laid in the kennel, in brown paper; I gave him in charge - it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; I was in the shop, but not in front.</p>

I saw Day collar the prisoner, and take him into the shop; I went and took him - he said he was very sorry, and would beg Mr. Ponder's pardon on his knees if he would let him go; he said he was distressed - I searched him, but he had nothing about him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

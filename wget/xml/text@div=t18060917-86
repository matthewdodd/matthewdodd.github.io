             sworn. On the 12th of July in the morning I was sent for to the Royal Oak, I went there, and saw the prisoner with a kind of a blue gown on, which the prosecutrix said was her's, I searched her, I found a duplicate of a petticoat belonging to the prosecutrix; I did not take off the gown, if I had she must have been quite naked; I produce the petticoat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my petticoat, and I am certain the gown she had on is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is the gown, she had lent it me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is my gown, I did not lend it her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix lent me that gown, I never meant to deprive her of it, I had no other intention than to return it her.</p>

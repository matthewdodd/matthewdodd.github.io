                  </hi>. I am a private in the 19th Regiment of Foot—I was on furlough on 2nd December—I slept at a coffee-shop that night—there were four other soldiers there—the prisoner was one, and he slept in the bed with me—I had three half sovereigns, four shillings, and some coppers—when I went to bed, I put my money in my purse in my trousers, and put my trousers under my pillow—the prisoner got up first, and said he had lost five shillings—I then got up and found my money was all gone—I gave information to the landlord, and the officer was sent for—he afterwards showed me my bag.</p>

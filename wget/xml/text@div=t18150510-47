            . Q. Are you acquainted with Mr. Peachey - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your shop - A. I do, on the 3rd of May he came in and asked if we sold table knives and forks; I told him we did; he said he had been recommended by Roberts and May, because they had no goods to suit him; he desired two dozen table knives and forks, two dozen desert, also two pair of covers, to send them to Mr. Parsons, Hanover-street, Hanover-square, past the church; he desired a bill and receipt to be sent with them; he said, he was only a servant; he had not the money, or he would pay for them. I was not well satisfied, and I took the goods myself to Mr. Parsons, where he had ordered them; I there saw a servant; she told me there was no such thing ordered there. I desired her to ask Mrs. Parsons, and she sent back the same answer. When I was returning with the knives, I saw him waiting at the corner of George-street, Hanover-square, he was standing; I conceived he did not notice me. I returned home, and desired Samuel Hains, the boy, who is here, to take back part of them, thirty-seven knives, and thirteen forks, and go with them to the door of Parsons; Hains took them, and I followed him; I observed the prisoner meet him in George-street, he spoke to him; they walked a little way together; he spoke to the boy again, and took the goods from him; I then ran up, and secured him; I brought him home into our shop, and Mr. Peachey soon went with him to Marlborough-street office.</p>

            . I was employed by the last witness to carry some knives and forks to the door of Mr. Parsons Hanover-street, Hanover-square; as I was going along George-street, the prisoner came to me, and said, a pretty fellow your master is, not to send the knives before; he said, come along; I followed him a long way towards Dr. Parsons's house; then he turned about, and took the parcel from me; he said, come along, he was before me; then Mr. Huxley came up, and collared him, and took him to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he got from you before Huxley came up - A. Not above two or three yards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent to order them by a young man, who told me he lived at Mr. Parsons; he desired me likewise to bring them with me, and not leave them at his master's house, but to wait for him, and meet him at the corner of the street; I told him I would; but I could not wait no longer for him, therefore I was going home with them.</p>

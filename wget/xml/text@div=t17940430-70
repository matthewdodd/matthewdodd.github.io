               <p>On the 24th of February, Mr. Oliver of Holborn, sent two pieces of printed furniture, to my shop, to be glazed; they went home by two o'clock, and one of them was missing, on enquiring I could not find it in the shop; it contained twenty-eight yards; I missed it out of my shop, Blue Boar-yard; I had seen it about twelve o'clock in the morning, of the 24th; I missed it about half after one, I recovered it about three I suppose, in a manger, in an old stable, in Blue Boar yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the stable belong to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recover it by any person leading you there, or by accident? - By making a search for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300119"></xptr>Q. Did the prisoner work with you? - He did, before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had he quitted your service? - I suppose three weeks or a month. When I found that piece again, I took that piece out, and put another in its stead,I went to Mr. Oliver. The prisoner came forward into the stable, about seven o'clock, and took it out, and I see him with it under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the stable? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come out of the stable? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the stable? - I suppose about half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him bring out any thing when he came from the stable? - I see him bring out this piece of callico, and the man laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that a piece of callico was found in the stable originally, and the man who put it there, you knew nothing at all about; therefore any body else might have put it there? - The prisoner went exactly to the place.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether that piece of callico that was originally in the manager, you did not take it away, and substitute another in its place? - I did, I always said so.</p>

               <p>I am a porter to Mr. Atkinson; at seven o'clock in the evening, the 24th of February, my master he desired me to go into this stable, where he had found the property, that he had missed out of his warehouse; I was not there above a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner came in, and went along through the stable, to the manager, and I thought I heard him making a noise with straw in the manger, he then turned out again to the stable door, and as he came up out of the stable, I laid hold of him, with this piece of cotton inside of his coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. All you know is that you was set by your master to watch who should take away that piece of cloth; which your master had put there for another piece that he found there? - I watched there, but I don't know who put it there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 26, Peel Street, Kensington—on Sunday night, 31st October, about 11.30, I was at the Prince of Wales, having a glass of ale—the prisoners were there—I got talking to Davey, and gave her a glass of ale—we all came out together—I stood talking to Davey in Prince of Wales' Terrace, and the two male prisoners came up—one of them, I think Beamish, knocked me in the eye, and knocked me backwards, and Lee fell on the top of me, kicking me—then the three of them came on top of me, and picked my pocket of my watch, a silver chain, a spade guinea, a fourpenny piece, two keys, and a seal, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. besides, which I had in my left-hand pocket—they then went away, leaving me senseless—I remained so for about half-an-hour, as I thought—I then got up, and went straight to the police-station, and gave information—I gave the constable a description of the prisoners—I am quite sure they are the persons—I have known them for the last seven or eight years.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). The prosecutor came to me at the station on the Monday morning, about 10.30, complained of having been robbed, and gave me a description of the persons—in consequence of that description I apprehended the prisoners—I took Davey first—I told her she was charged with robbing the prosecutor of his watch and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a seal, a fourpenny bit, and a watch guard—she said, "I laugh at that as I do at other things"—I took the two male prisoners a few minutes afterwards in the Prince of Wales public-house, Church Street, Kensington—the prosecutor had pointed them out to me—I told them the charge—they said one to the other, "This is something good "—in taking them to the station Beamish kicked me very severely on the legs—I have seen the three constantly together.</p>

About 11.30 on this Sunday night I saw Davey in Victoria Road, Kensington, running in a direction from where the prosecutor was robbed—Beamish and another one were with her—I am not able to say who the other was—I did not see his face—they were about 50 yards from Prince of Wales' Terrace—about 20 minutes to half an hour after they passed me, I saw the prosecutor—he was bleeding very much from his eye and the back of his head—he made a com<lb></lb>plaint to me and gave me a description of some persons—I have seen the procures together before.</p>

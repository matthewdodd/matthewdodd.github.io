The prisoner was in my employ for six or seven weeks previous to the 22nd of March—it was his duty to work as journeyman in my shop, and take orders there—he slept there—on Saturday night, the 22nd of March, I saw him at the shop, at half-past seven o'clock—I went again on Monday morning, the 24th, between nine and ten o'clock, and found it closed—no one had the care of it but the prisoner—I got in by means of a key which opens the back door in the passage—I found the gas was alight in the shop—I missed 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the desk, a coat, a pair of trowsers, two pairs of</p>

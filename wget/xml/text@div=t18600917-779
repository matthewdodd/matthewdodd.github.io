Collard's in Camden-town—I assisted him out of the cab and he went into a beer-shop—I afterwards saw him with Messrs. Collard's clerk—the clerk came up and said to him, "You are drunk; what have you done with the van and horse?"—he replied, "It has brought me home"—I was in his company altogether about twenty minutes—I should say he was positively drunk in my opinion.</p>

I live at 41, Judd-street—I saw the deceased, John Kingston, thrown from his cab on the 18th—I was standing at my own door about a quarter to 7 o'clock, which is within thirty paces of the Euston-road—I saw a van coming down Judd-street without a driver—I ran out and should have succeeded in stopping the horse, but a gentleman from the opposite side ran out with an umbrella, which he put up in the horse's face; the horse ran on one side and came in collision witj the cab, and the van horse mounted on to the top of the cab horse, and I believe the shafts of the van struck the man in the side and he was thrown from his seat under both the horses, the horse of the van and the cab horse—I any my son extri<lb></lb>cated him—I called a cab and assisted in taking him to the Royal Free Hospital in Gray's Inn-lane—he died within a few minutes after he was there—I saw that he was dying before we got there.</p>

               <p>—the van was coming down the centre of the road, and by the shouting everything had cleared out of the way—had it not been for the person with the umbrella, I believe there would have been no accident, for I should have succeeded in stopping the horse in a few minutes—it was not going at I a great rate; it was a fine horse—the cab was not in the middle of the road—it had driven on one side, as everything had, so that there was a free passage for the van to go down—I should think the horse was going at the rate of about eight miles an hour; I have horses of my own—the cabman had drawn up on the left hand side of Judd-street, from the Euston-road, the same side as my house—he was not standing still when the horse went over him; he was coming up; he pulled across the road out of the way, but still continued driving—I did not see him before he pulled across the road—I saw him in the act of crossing to the right side—he drew up nearly to the kerb before the accident—if the gentleman had not put up his umbrella the van would not have touched him—if the cabman had remained on the side where he was at first, the van would not have come in collision with him, unless the man with the umbrella had started the horse on the other side; he would have continued his career and gone direct into the cab; but as the cabman got out of the way the man with the umbrella swerved the hone—if he had remained where he was and no umbrella had been raised the van would have come in collision with the cab—the man having raised the umbrella, if the cabman had remained where he was no collision would have taken place—I saw the man raise his umbrella—I got out of the way, seeing that—the cabman was then driving across the road, clearing himself from the track—if he had remained where he was the accident would have happened if the horse had not swerved—if he had remained where he was in the first instance no accident would have occurred—there were other vehicles in the street, there were cabs behind, but they had all cleared away, and made a complete channel for the van to go down—I did not see the prisoner at all.</p>

            . I am a labouring man, and live in Castle-ride, Castle-place, near Castle-alley. On the 23rd of June last, I was in Joseph Smith's premises, who then lived in Castle-alley; there is no number on the door - I was at work on his premises all that day; he had a taxed cart there and harness - I was cleaning the harness that afternoon, inside the gates, in his warehouse or shed; Smith was not at home that afternoon, but there was a cartand a van belonging to him, both at home that afternoon - they never were absent from the premises; there is no entrance for a cart or horse but through the gates, and they were not open all that afternoon - I was on the premises all the afternoon, but at dinner time; if any goods had come and a cart had been backed into these premises, I must have heard it; there was no cart came near the premises in my hearing - there was no room for any cart to have come into these premises for the cart and van which were there; I know Allum - he lived in Castle-place; I cannot tell the number - I know the house; it is up in the corner, in a narrow part.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where do you live now? A. At No. 10, New Market, Finsbury. In October last, I lodged in Castle-ride, Whitechapel; I made an affidavit for Mr. Smith to get him bailed, by desire of Mr. Harmer's clerk - Mr. Smithers went down with me; this was in October last - the trial did not come on here till November; I was here, but was not called as a witness - I came by my own wish, to see my friend done justice by.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you stated in your affidavit that you were there all day, that Smith was not at home, and that it was impossible he should have received the goods? A. Yes, I stated it at Mr. Harmer's; I know the premises very well, and no cart came near the premises that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever taken into custody on these pre- premises? A. Yes, I was; I cannot tell the day - it might be on the 25th of June; I was charged with letting a cart out - the man who hired it came as I was going to bed, and wanted a cart to bring a box to the Bull-inn, Aldgate; I do not know whether there was a cart let out, for driving of which, I was charged with stealing goods.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You made this affidavit - was it for the purpose of Smith being let out on hail? A. Oh no, quite different - it was not to procure bail for him, it was to tell the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not that Smith might, by your telling the truth, he let out on bail? A. No, to tell the real truth - I know no other reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will give you five minutes before you go into the dock; look at that paper - upon the oath you have taken, was not that affidavit made by you for the purpose of getting Smith let out on bail? - answer that question. A.What question, Sir? I mean to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not trifle, or I will commit you to Newgate - Did you make that affidavit in order that he might get out on bail? A. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will ask you one more question - When you were stating the facts in favour of Mr. Smith, in order that he might go out on bail, did you mention a word that he was not at home on the 23rd of June? A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Read it - Now, when you were sworn for the purpose of Smith being let out on bail, did you mention one word about his not being at home on the 23rd of June? A. I said as that represents, and no more.</p>

On the 23rd of June I was looking out of my apartment; I saw a large towncart turn up Castle-alley, and it backed down Castle-alley again, to the bottom of Castle-place; it was then very near to my window - it was about a quarter-past five o'clock; there were two large packing-cases in it, two large bags, and a sack - the cases had large letters on them; the first thing that was taken out of the cart was a canvas bag or sack - it was carried to

               <p>Cross-examined By MR. BODKIN. Q. All this you saw very distinctly? A. Yes, I was at the window when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110127"></xptr>cart first came down Castle-street - there were two or three men with it; I did not notice whether one bad a whip - there was one man had hold of the horse's head, and two were at the tail, taking out the goods; one of the men took out the bag, and carried it into Allum's - I cannot say whether they knocked at the door; I did not see Allum - I did not see the other packages taken out. I went away from the window - I have lived a year and three months there; I know Smith by sight - I was not at his trial; I did not want to have any thing to say in this business, but I was subpoenaed about a fortnight ago.</p>

            . I am landlady of the last witness. I was at home that afternoon - I saw a large cart from five to six o'clock - I was in my front room on the ground floor- I saw the cart turn the corner of Castle-place, and go up Castle-alley as far as Smith's gates - it remained there a few minutes, but the gates were never opened - the cart then backed down Castle-alley, and up Castle-place - Allum lived at No. 4, Castle-place - I did not see what was done with the contents of the cart, but it passed my window in ten minutes empty - I had seen two large boxes and a sort of canvas bag in it - I never saw the officer - I saw him bring a man afterwards to measure Smith's gates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time of day did you see the cart? A.Between five and six o'clock - I was at my own window - Mrs. Warner made a remark about it - I saw some men with the cart, but I cannot say how many; there might be two or three; there was one at the horse's head to back it - the cart made a great noise, the stones are very rough there - I do not know whether any one on Smith's premises must have heard it, I never was there - I told what I saw to Mr. Frost, a neighbour, but I was not called on the trial.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Which way did it pass when empty? A. The same way as it came, down Castle-place, and I suppose down Castle-street, but I did not see it - I had seen it go up Castle-alley as far as Smith's, and then back into Castle-place - I did not tell this before Smith was tried; it might be a week, a fortnight, or a month after he was tried - when I was in at Mr. Frost's, and several neighbours were there talking about it; Mrs. Warner called to me, and said, "Mrs. Gray, do you see that large cart going up the alley?" I looked, and said Yes - I heard of Smith being taken up, but I did not state what I had seen, and I should not have come now if I had not been subpoenaed.</p>

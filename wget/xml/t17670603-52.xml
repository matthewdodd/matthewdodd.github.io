            . I am mother to the child, she was eight years of age last March. I left the prisoner in care of her and two other children on the 13th of May, a boy of three years of age, and a girl between eight and nine months. I found soon after the girl was not right; I examined her; she told me about the prisoner, and what he had done; I was struck with terror, I could not examine the part, I only examined her by speech; then I called

               <p>Mr. Thomas. I am a surgeon. The prosecutrix sent for me on the 21st or 22d of May to look at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030040"></xptr> her daughter; I inspected her, and found she had got the foul disease, her private parts were much enlarged and lacerated, and she had a great discharge.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the child was actually penetrated?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Seemingly there had, as much as a child of eight years old could admit of.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the foul disease be communicated without a penetration?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Not to such a child as that.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a greatdischarge, of what kind?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Of the same as most venereals are in 8 days standing. After I had examined the child, I examined the prisoner at the bar, I found he had a gonorrhoea; I asked him how long he had had that distemper; he told me about four days; I asked him how he could injure such a child as that; he said, no, that was all his answer.</p>

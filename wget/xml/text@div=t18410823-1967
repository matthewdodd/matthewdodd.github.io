                  </hi>. I now live in Little Britain, before that I lodged at Mrs. Young's, No. 7, Poland-street; die prisoner was servant at the house. On the 27th of June, I missed a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from a pocket in the lid of my trunk, and a sovereign from a little brass box—I immediately called Mrs. Young—she called the prisoner—I told her what I had lost—she said she knew nothing of it—I pressed her to tell about it—Mrs. Young told her to kneel down, and say before God, that she knew nothing about it—we both said so to her—my money has not been found—I said she had better tell the truth.</p>

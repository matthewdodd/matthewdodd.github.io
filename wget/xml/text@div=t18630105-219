I am a cab-driver, of 10, King-street, Commercial-road, Lambeth—about twenty minutes to 1 on the morning of 8th Decem<lb></lb>ber, I was driving my four-wheel cab in Parliament-street; Mr. and Mrs. Emanuel and their daughter were inside, and Amelia Adams and a child were sitting by me on the box—I was on the near side going towards Charing-cross—two omnibuses going towards Westminster, had passed just before me, and a Hansom's cab, driven by the prisoner came, meeting me on the wrong side, going at the rate of twelve or fourteen miles an hour—I hallooed as hard as I could, but he took no notice—I do not know whether he heard me or not; the rain was coming down very hard—he struck my cab on the near side of the dash-board; between-my cab and the pavement—it upset my cab, and knocked us all off—I called for help, and a constable came and pulled the child out and took her to the hospital—she was not quite dead then—her name was Harriet Amelia Adams—Amelia Adams was also injured; she was in the Hospital with the child—she is the person I describe as my wife—I saw the prisoner a few minutes afterwards, but can hardly tell whether he was drunk or sober, for I was worried.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-proprietor—on the evening of this accident, I was being driven in the prisoner's cab, coming from Westbourne-grove and going to Camberwell—he took me up near the Royal Oak, about two miles and a quarter from the scene of the accident—a collision with another cab took place in Parliament-street—my cab was going towards Westminster-bridge, and the other cab towards Charing-cross, on the near side—it crossed from behind two omnibuses which were going towards Charing-cross, and got on the off-side of my cab, which caused the collision—the four-wheel cab came from behind the omnibuses, and seeing the Hansom coming down the road, of course it went to cross to its wrong side, which it did, and ran against the near shaft of the Hansom, and then the four-wheel went on the wrong side and <hi rend="italic">toddled</hi> over.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it turn off when it saw the Hansom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe it saw it, because there was an umbrella up, but when he did see it he crossed on his wrong side, and the collision took place—the Hansom struck the four-wheel on the near side of the dash-board.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although it crossed the Hansom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the near side shaft and the four-wheel dash-board came in contact with one another, causing both points to meet at the same time—the collision took place on the near side of the Hansom, which side struck the four-wheel cab on the near side of the dash-board, we will term it the left side.</p>

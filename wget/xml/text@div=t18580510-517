On the morning of 26th April, I came to the Old Bailey, to see the execution—I was standing at the top of Skinner Street—there was a great crowd—I had a watch in my pocket, attached to a ribbon—I found the prisoner's hand in my pocket, and looked down, and said, "You thief; you have got my watch"—he held out his hand, and I took my watch from his hand; it was silver gilt—I seized him round the waist; he got away from me, and went about a yard—I did not lose sight of him—I caught hold of him again round the waist, and gave him in charge—the watch was broken from the ring—it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

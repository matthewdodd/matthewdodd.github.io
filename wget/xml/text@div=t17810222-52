Upon the 7th of this month, about half an hour after nine in the evening, as I was sitting in a room behind my shop, I saw a man's hand take my wife's cloak off the back of a chair, and I saw that it was the prisoner; I shouted out stop thief! and ran after him; I caught him four or five yards from my own door in the street. I charged him with having taken my wife's cloak. He said he had not. The neighbours then said he had thrown it down when he came out at the door. I laid hold of his collar and brought him back, and some of the neighbours brought in the cloak. I sent for a constable. He always persisted in denying that he had it. I am sure the prisoner is the person who took the cloak.</p>

               <p>I was going by the prosecutor's with some oysters. Somebody said there was a person lurking about that house. I and two or three more stopped to watch; I saw the prisoner go into the house and come out again, and drop the cloak just at the door as he came out. I picked it up and carried it in. The prosecutor ran out and secured him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">considered that in some sense the money was received on account of Mr. Wiggins, because if it was not paid over, he was liable; on the other hand, certainly, no debt was due to him: he was rather inclined to think it would not do; but he would not withdraw it from the Jury, he would reserve it if necessary</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">further submitted, that the allegation that the moneys embezzled were the moneys of Wiggins, was not supported; and unless it was alleged to be the property of Wiggins</hi> non constat, <hi rend="italic">but that it was the property of the prisoner himself, and, of course, he could not embezzle his own property.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Scott, who keeps a lodging-house in Grace's-alley. On 2nd Feb. the prisoner, prosecutor, and two other foreigners came and lodged at our house—the prisoner had no trunk, but the other three had—I have heard the prosecutor called by the name of Jacintho Nunez De Costa, and he has answered—he lodged a fortnight with me—I only knew him for that time—on the Tuesday after they came, the prosecutor made a complaint to me, and on the Friday after, my sister showed me this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and I observed a dent in it where it had been pressed open by a knife—I had never seen it before—I heard De Costa tell the prisoner that he had taken his box and money, and I asked the prisoner to lend me his knife, and asked him and the prosecutor to go up-stairs with me—he lent me this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we went up, and when we got up to the room-door, the prisoner said, "It is no use begin<lb></lb>ning about the money again, because it is all settled," and he said that De Costa had said, "Never mind it," he should not get it back again—I said to the prisoner, "How did you know what I was going to say to you?"—he said he knew very well; and I said, "Then you took it"—I went for a policeman—I saw the knife compared with the dent in the box—I think it had beep opened with that knife—De Costa said it was his box, and the prisoner said he saw him put the money into it on Sunday, and put it into the chest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness's sister, and live with her. On the Sunday before I was before the Magistrate I saw the prisoner in the room where the boxes are kept—I told him he had no business there, told him to leave, and he did—on the Monday after, he came and asked me for his money, as he wanted to go away, as he had got a ship to go to Liver<lb></lb>pool in—he had left 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with me—I told him he could not go on the coast without a register-ticket—I saw him again in the room that day, and he had got De Costa's chest out—on the Tuesday De Costa came and said he had lost two sovereigns—I told him there was no one in the house but his shipmates, and it must be among themselves—me, my sister, the prisoner,</p>

               <p>prosecutor, and another foreigner went to the room, and the prosecutor turned his chest out, and said he had lost a little box—I told him the pri<lb></lb>soner was at his chest on Monday, and the prisoner said, "You are a d-d liar!"—my sister said if any money was lost, it was best to have a policeman and search—the prisoner was interpreting what was said to the prosecutor, and the prisoner said he had told De Costa, and he said, "Never mind"—he had spoken to him in a language I did not under<lb></lb>stand—the policeman and the Portuguese Consul came on the Wednesday, but no one searched—I was examined before the Magistrate, and signed a paper, but I do not think this is it—(<hi rend="italic">the deposition,—part of this being read stated.</hi>)—"The policeman came next day and made me search")—we asked the policeman to go up-stairs and search, but I did not—the prosecutor's chest had been forced open—on the Friday, when I was making a bed in the room where the boxes were, in which an Italian mate had slept, but which had only been made up the night before, I found this box under the palliasse—the box was not there the day before—I told my sister; and the prisoner, prosecutor, my sister and me, all went to the room together—I saw my sister try the knife to the dent in the box, and it just fitted it—my sister went for a policeman, and while she was gone the prisoner told me if I sent him to prison he would stab me when he came out, and asked me to give him the box, which I would not do.</p>

The prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge, and I told him he was charged with stealing two sovereigns and this box—he said he did not take it—I asked whether the knife belonged to him; he said it did—I asked whether he had lent it to any person; he said no, not before he lent it to Mrs. Scott that morning—I asked whether he had been in the room where the chests were; he said he had, but had nothing to do with the box or chest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer and live at No. 43, Great Wild-street. On the night of the 16th of May I was in the shop and heard a noise as if something fell down—I fancied it was my wife come into the parlour—I looked and saw a person at the window—I went to the parlour,</p>

               <p>and when I got near to the parlour door I saw the prisoner going towards the street—I called to my wife for a candle, and saw this decanter lying across the step of the parlour door—I then missed a decanter-stand from the parlour—I knew the prisoner, but did not know his name—I went to the door and saw him in the road—I told him I had lost a decanter-stand—he said I might search him, I should find none (I had left my shop alone, except the person I had seen at the window, who came in and asked the price of a bone) this decanter had been moved from the parlour to the door—there is a passage for the lodgers by which the prisoner could get to the parlour—I saw him near the parlour door, but not in it—he was in the passage and the decanter was about a yard from him—it had been on the bedstead behind the parlour door—some person must have gone round and taken it—there was nobody in the parlour, and the decanter must have I been moved by some person who had been in the parlour without my orders—I missed a decanter-stand which we have not found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the prosecutor's house. On the night of the 16th of May, I was going out through the passage, and met the prisoner coming in by the passage—that would lead him to the parlour door—I returned in two or three minutes, and I heard something fall in the parlour which appeared to be near the door—I saw the prisoner within the parlour—I looked him full in the face for a moment—he was brought back just afterwards—I could not see the whole of the parlour, but I saw nobody there but the prisoner.</p>

            . I lived with Mr. Treachey, an attorney, in Clement's Inn. Both these registers are signed in the prisoner's hand-writing; Mr. Treachey's daughter is one of the witnesses to this last register. There were some proceedings instituted by Lady Cockburn, to recover some money settled upon her on her separation from Sir James, supposing that Sir James was dead, but when she heard he was living, the proceedings were abated; this was shortly after her marriage to the prisoner - I take this account from what she, herself, said. I have often seen her and the prisoner together. The proceedings were stopped afterwards.</p>

            . I knew the prisoner and his wife nine years and a half ago - they were living together. I heard her say that she had been Lady Cockburn. I saw her about ten days ago; I do not know where she is now, upon my oath - she called at my house, and begged I would attend the examination at Marlborough-street; I do not know where she lodged: I have not been at her house or lodgings this nine years. I do not know where she lived, and have not seen her since Friday week.</p>
               <p>CAROLINE BARTLETT. I married the prisoner at Mary-le-bone church, in February, 1819. I was a widow then. I had the prisoner taken up on a charge of bigamy about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You had been trying your hand at a divorce before that? A. No; I do not recollect that I had - I applied to Mr. Green, an attorney, for some redress from the ill-treatment I had received. I know Mr. Metcalf and Mr. Green, I employed them to try to get redress. I sent for the prisoner to give me lessons on the guitar - I was recommended to him - that was not the recommendation of Miss Boswell - I do not know her. He had been giving me lessons about four years before we married.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did you not know he was living as a married man with Lady Cockburn, and notwithstanding that you married him? A. I did hear of it, but it was cleared up before we were married - his solicitor cleared away every doubt - I was informed it was a void marriage, and it was not till after that that we were married.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been to his house while Lady Cockborn was living with him? A. Yes, I had; but the matter was left to the care of Mr. Treachey, and I relied on that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Mr. Treachey was Mr. Ventura's attorney? A. Yes; and I was given to understand that there was something illegal in his marriage with Lady Cockburn. The prisoner obtained landed property by his marriage with me - it still remains. I have sold one house since I was married and we had jointly the produce of it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not have the whole of the money yourself? A. No; so far from it, I had to apply to him for 6 d., and was refused. The estate produced 300 l. per year or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he married you was not be in possession of 400 l. or 500 l. a year, which he gave up? A. Yes, he did; but it was not entirely by my desire; we went to live together in the country - my furniture and effects remain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130060"></xptr>with me, but the plate has been parted with - he sold some, and I did endeavour to have some for myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I married Lady Cockburn she deceived me - I met her in great distress, and gave her a few shillings. I then lent her 20 l. or 30 l.; and then she contrived to drive me to marriage; a day or two afterwards Mrs. Bartlett came to my house to buy an instrument - I was not at home - she and Lady Cockburn were in the parlour some time, trying instruments; and then she came again, and met me at home, and begged me to play and sing. She has often been with Lady Cockburn and her brother to play. I then went to Kensington to give her some lessons, and they gave me some Spanish cake to take home to Lady Cockburn. In about two years I found that Lady Cockburn had been married to Sir James Cockburn; I received information that Sir James Cockburn was in Scotland, and desired her to se- separate from me directly. After a year or two Sir James Cockburn came to London, and I went to him - I told him all the particulars. I parted with Lady Cockburn, and met with Mrs. Bartlett, she knew the whole of these particulars.</p>

            . I am a Baron of Nova Scotia. I have been in the army, and a great deal abroad. I married in 1791 to Miss Frances Green, in Ireland, on the 19th of May, to the best of my recollection. I married her as a single woman. In consequence of certain occurrences we were separated; and proceedings in Chancery were instituted. I understand she is now living, but I have not seen her since 1793, when I embarked on board Lord Hood's fleet.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any other Sir James Cockburn at that time? A. Not that I know of. I cannot tell her age - she might be nineteen or twenty. We were married at Limerick, in Ireland, at the parish church, where she lived.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked at Marlborough-street of producing the brother of the lady, Mr. Green, who was a Magistrate of the county, and that he would come immediately to attest the matter of the marriage? A. I did not say so - I said I understood he was a Magistrate, and possessed 3000 l. a year. I never corresponded with him in my life, nor have I seen him since 1793 - he was a trustee to a deed which I made.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I have been the solicitor of Lady Cockburn, sixteen years; she is the lady who married the prisoner; she introduced Mr. Ventura as her husband. In 1822, she applied at my house to request I would open a correspondence with the trustee, under the marriage settlement of Sir James - I transacted money business between Sir James and her on one occacasion, in 1822 - Sir James and Lady Cockburn were at my house the same day, but not together, and signed a release - Lady Cockburn came first, and signed an authority to me, which I have in my hand.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES COCKBURN re-examined. I have not seen Lady Cockburn since 1793 - I transacted the business just alluded to - I know this paper is her writing - I am positive it is.</p>

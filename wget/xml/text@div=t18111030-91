I asked him to help me to take them, he would not, I told him I saw the man take it out of the cart; I then asked the baker to watch these men while I got assistance to take them, which he did, I ran back to the cart and saw the carman. I asked him if he had lo t a box he said he had, I told him to come to me, I knew were the man was, we went back to where I had left the men, and they were gone, the baker stood in Boswell Court, told me which way they were gone, I ran after them through the court, which leads into Clements Inn, the soap was on the curb of the railings there, and the prisoner a little on the left, I ran and took hold of him, and the carman took the soap, the other man got out of the way.</p>

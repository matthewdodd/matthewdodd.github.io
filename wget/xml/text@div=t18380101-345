                  </hi>. The prisoner is my daughter—I live at No. 13, Little Swan-alley, Coleman-street—I am an Irishwoman. On the 6th of December, from nine o'clock in the morning, until half-past ten, she quar<lb></lb>relled with me, and struck, tore me, and bit me—I have considered her out of her mind these four months, as she has been before—I never placed her in confinement but once before, that was at the Compter—she is not in her right mind, to the best of my opinion—I was sitting at work, and she stood up on the table, brought out some work, and began to pick it in pieces, and throw it in my face—she said, "This is fish, mother, it is fowl, here are the feathers"—I said, "Be quiet, I cannot do my work"—she said, "If you say a word I will <hi rend="italic">serve</hi> you out"—she flew at me, tore me, and kicked me a good deal—we got into the passage, and I called for my landlady, and then she got my finger in her mouth—I screamed out, and my landlady screamed "Murder"—a policeman came, and took her in charge—she was only two days at home with me, and I have not had an hour's peace—I had given her into custody before, but did not go against her—I do not think she did this in malice—she laughed at me, and said she did not hurt</p>

               <p>me—I believe she did it from a deranged state of mind, not being right in her head—she was a very good girl before she became in this state—she was always in a situation until she was taken ill in May—she has been ten weeks in the hospital—she has been at home with me ever since—I do not know what disorder she was in the hospital for—she was very ill and bad in her chest—she had a great giddiness in her head, and was <hi rend="italic">romancing</hi> and talking—she was turned out of there for ill behaviour—she will sometimes sit and laugh an hour together without saying a word, and she will cry sometimes, and sit all alone, and not have any victuals to eat—she would not sleep at night, but be going about ther oom and laughing—I am told she does so now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's landlady, and live in Little Swan-alley. When she first took the room, her daughter (the prisoner) came home ill—she went to the hospital, and came home again—she used to run about the kitchen and stairs <hi rend="italic">romancing</hi>, and after that she used to beat her mother very much—I used to say, "Why are you so cruel, Mary, to your mother?"—she said, "I am not mother does not use me well"—I said, "Yes, she does"—she would say, "Well, I don't hurt my mother," but I have taken her off her mother repeatedly—I consider her more like a de<lb></lb>ranged person than any thing else—she would lay in the kitchen the whole night, and lay on the stairs, and not get out of our way, and if spoken to she would laugh at us—I knew her before, and then she used to seem a very quiet, modest girl—I am certain she is now out of her mind by her conduct.</p>

I have come from Giltspur-street—the prisoner has been in custody twice before—the matron and surgeon both considered her quite insane—her conduct has been very violent, and she has been locked up to prevent violence being used to the other prisoners—I have not had the same opportunity of seeing her which the matron and surgeon have—her conduct was that of an insane person without any motive to provoke that conduct.</p>

I pulled off my clothes before I went to bed - I had put my watch into my waistcoat pocket, the money stated was in my pantaloons pocket - I put them in a chair by the bed side, and my waistcoat I put below the bed-tick altogether - I went to bed and fell asleep, - I cannot say whether Gregory came to bed to me - I awoke within a quarter of five o'clock in the morning; my watch and money were all gone - I got on my clothes and went down; I found Sadler in bed in the lower part of the house; I asked him for my watch and money; he gave no answer, only a groan or two, and turned himself over - I had handled him to awake him - I am quite sure - I told him I had been robbed of my watch and money; I got an officer who went up stairs with me - I then left the officer there; I was not present when Gregory was taken, but I described her to the officer - I am sure she is the woman.</p>

            . (police-constable H 105). The prosecutor described Gregory to me, and said he had been robbed; I went to the house with him, and searched the bed and room, but found nothing; I then went down and found Sadler in bed - he rents the house; he said he knew nothing about it, and he could not be answerable for what was done in his house. I took the servant who had the letting of the bed down to the office; and my brother officer took Sadler; he still said he knew nothing about it, but when we took him to Lambeth-street, he sent for me into the cell, gave me the key of his door, and told me where the watch was - I went and found it under the pressbedstead where he had been; it was wrapped in an old handkerchief; Mr. Powell who took this handkerchief off the prisoner's neck, is gone to Maidstone.</p>

               <p>Gregory's Defence. I unfortunately fell in with this good man, who asked me to take him home, which I did - he asked what he should give me, I said I should leave that to his generosity, he called the woman up and gave her one shilling and sixpence for the bed; he then gave me two half crowns - he asked me to lay down with him, which I did, for a little while; he then said I might go where I pleased; I went the next morning to get two gowns out of pawn, and as I was returning, the officer took me. I left the prosecutor asleep in Sadler's room - I ordered them to fasten the door; he had his watch safe when I left him - I had no more than what he paid me.</p>
               <p>Sadler's Defence. The prosecutor came to me and said, that girl has taken my watch; I said I will go and see if I can find her - he went out of the house and came back with the officer, who took me to the station-house, where I remained till eleven o'clock - I was then taken to Lambeth-street; as we were going into the office, some other person went in, and we staid in the passage; two women stood there, and one said to the other, "I was told the watch was under the drawers;" I was glad to hear that, and I sent for the officer, and told him of it - he asked me to give him the key which I did, and I was rejoiced to think that the gentleman would get his watch again; the officer knows there is not a word untrue in what I have stated.</p>

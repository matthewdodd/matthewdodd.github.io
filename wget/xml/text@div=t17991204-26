               <p>Q. He does not sell by small articles? - A. He does not sell by retail at all: On the 28th of Novamber, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I observed him coming up the court towards the accompting-house door, where they enter into the warehouse; at that time he was much intoxicated, and as he had been once so before, I paid him his wages for the whole week, and desired him to depart from Mr. Maxwell's warehouse, but he did not immediately go away; about half an hour afterwards I observed him upon the first floor, leaning upon the counter; I did not say any thing then, but went up stairs to the other story, in the warehouse, where I remained some time, perhaps half an hour, looking over some rhubarbs, with

            , one of the porters; Collins went down, and I was called down by Collins, between three and four o'clock, they had carried the prisoner down to the foot of the stairs upon the ground floor; they shewed me several articles mentioned in the indictment, under his clothes, (repeats them); I saw part of them taken from him, but some had been taken from him before I came down; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040019"></xptr>were the same kind of articles that were in Mr. Maxwell's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You never dealt by retail? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. But you have sent out samples by retail? - A. No; Mr. Maxwell does not deal with druggists, but sends packages to the West-Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not take servants without a character into your house? - A. It has not been customary.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been with you two months, and because he got drunk the second time, you discharged him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear to any of those articles? - A. No; I examined the nutmegs, and found about a pound missing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of Mr. Maxwell's porters: On the 28th of November last, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner was rather intoxicated, he was putting up some jars, I told him I thought he was intoxicated; between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw some nutmegs fall out of his pocket, and that led me to suspect him; they were in a paper, forty-six in number, weighing six ounces; I found five phials of essence of peppermint about his body, with some lint between his waistcoat and his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep peppermint and lint in the warehouse? - A. Yes; there was a bottle of essence of peppermint in his breeches, and I cannot say what besides; I think there were some other things round his body, his pockets were completely full; all the things in this box were found about his person, (producing them); here are three bottles of magnesia that have got a figure of three upon them, in my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the rest, do you believe them to be your master's property? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These are quack medicines - now will you venture to swear that they are worth one farthing? - A. They cost money.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bottles had you marked with a figure of three? - A. A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sold a great many with that mark upon them? - A. Mr. Maxwell has; they were made up but the week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, whether he has sold any or not, he is not here to say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The young man cannot swear to the marks on the bottles.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Oxford-street. I was a publican, but am now out of business. At half-past twelve o'clock on the night of the 30th of March, the prisoner Birmingham ran after me in Ox<lb></lb>ford-street, and asked me to treat her—the public-house were shut up—she asked me to go to a friend of her's which I did—that was at the corner of Crown-street, Soho—knowing her as an old customer, we went up-stairs—I was in the room about seven minutes—she was with me all the time—I was not quite sober—there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. given for some drink—that</p>

               <p>was all I had—I had only that shilling, and it was given to get something to drink—I believe I gave it to the girl—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther the room was to be paid for—in a little time I found I had lost my watch—I accused Birmingham of stealing it—she declared she had not got it—she was in the room all the time—no one else was there—she said, after a little while, that if I would give her a sovereign she would find the watch; she dare say it was on the other side of the room—we looked about, and could not find it; we had been there ten minutes, waiting for the liquor to come—I had not got a sovereign—I sent for a policeman, and searched the place; and a person came and searched the prisoner—the property was not found—she then went away, and the next day I issued some bills; and on Saturday I found the watch pledged in Char<lb></lb>lotte-street, New-cut; and from information, we traced Birmingham to live somewhere in Westminster—on the Monday morning I went down with a police officer, and met her—I gave her into custody—I had been spending the evening in Tottenham-court-road with a number of friends—I left them about twelve o'clock—no one could have had this watch from me before I got to Crown-street—a moment before I went into the house I looked at the watch, and it was twenty minutes past twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Birmingham</hi>. He paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the room, and offered me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not think it worth while to tale that—I was going away—he then accused me of stealing his watch; and on the Thursday a young girl he had been with before brought me this watch, which my aunt pledged for her—there was a stout girl walking with him in Soho-square. Witness. There was no other girl with me that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Farrand, a pawnbroker. On the morning of the 31st of March, Hollinson brought this watch to me—she said it was her husband's, and her name was Jones—that she lived in Peb<lb></lb>ber-street—I was not satisfied—I watched her, and when she got a short distance, the other prisoner crossed to her, and she gave something into Birmingham's hand—I asked her back—she came, and the other prisoner came back to my door—I said, "Where is the money?"—Birmingham then gave the money back—I found it was right—I then sent a young man with her, to see if she lived as the stated, at No. 23, Pebber-street—he gave her the money, and came back—it was in consequence of what I said they were given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I met Mr. Sheldon on the 12th of April, and from information we went and found the watch in Charlotte-street, New-cut—we then went to Pebber-street, but could not find the parties; and then we went to where Hollinson said she lived—we went to No. 25, Pebber-street—I am sure of that—we got information there, and went to New Pye-street, with the woman belonging to No.25, Pebber-street—I went up-stairs, with the aunt of these two prisoners, and saw them sitting at tea—I had nobody there but myself—I said "I want you about the watch"—Birmingham said, What watch?—Is the watch found?"—I said, "Yes"—" Who does it belong to?" said she—I said, "Sheldon"—they began to cry, and said what could I do—I said I could do nothing—I would see Sheldon—Birmingham gave me twelve shillings and some duplicates—I said "I will mind these;" I look it to Mr. Sheldon, and he said I had done wrong—and on the Monday I went with him there, and took it back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Birmingham</hi>. I gave you twenty-nine duplicates and twelve shillings—you then asked the landlady if she could let you have a sovereign—I took my things to pawn—I took even my stays, and he said that would do—you</p>

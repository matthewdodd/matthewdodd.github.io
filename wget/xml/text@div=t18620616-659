                  </hi>. I did live at 2, Poppin's-court, Fleet-street—I am a carpenter—about half-past 6 o'clock on the evening of 16th May, I was in Fleet-street, looking at a man with some owls—I felt some one press me, and something at the same time at my waistcoat pocket—I turned sharp round, and saw the prisoner standing behind me—I asked him what he was doing—he said nothing, but turned round and gave something to the man with the owls, and whilst so doing he let the bow of the watch fall—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I looked round for a policeman—he walked quietly away, and I followed him, and gave him in charge in Shoe-lane—I am quite sure it was he who dropped that bow—I saw his hand move round my side, where my watch was—that was when I felt the pressure.</p>

I took the prisoner on the evening of 16th May about a quarter to 7 o'clock in Fetter-lane—he was walking fast towards Holborn—I saw the prosecutor just after; the prisoner passed me; he said, "That man has stolen my watch"—I ran after she prisoner, stopped him, and told him he was charged with stealing a watch—he said, "Me do such a thing? it is a mistake altogether"—the prosecutor then came up alongside of him and said. "You did steal it, for saw this bow drop from year hand"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, and a common brass ring—he gave me a false address.</p>

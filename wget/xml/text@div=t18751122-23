                  </hi>. I am a clerk in an insurance company, and live in Boy son Road, Camberwell—I was at Ludgate Hill station on Saturday afternoon, the 30th October—the station was crowded; I made an attempt to get into the train, and saw my chain hanging down—I exclaimed "My watch is gone"—the prisoner ran away and I followed him immediately—no one else was running at the time; I saw him in custody of one of the Company's servants.</p>

I heard the cry "Stop that man," and I was stopped.</p>

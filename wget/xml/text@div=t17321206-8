            . I look after the Dog-house Bar. About six at Night the Prisoner came into the House, and desired me to let him warm himself by the Fire, for he said he had been with a Cart to Edmonton, and was very cold. He beg'd an old Pair of Shoes, upon which, I took Notice that those he had on were very bad; but I did not give him any. He staid till eight o'Clock, and then went away, and I shut up the Door as usual, and went to Supper at the Green Man on Windmill-Hill, and after Supper I returned to the House at the Bar, and went to Bed: Next Morning the Taylor came to mend my Breeches, which I had left in my Room overnight before I went to Supper, and there was two gold Rings, a Guinea and a half, and 2s. and 6d. in a brass Box in the Side-Pocket. I look'd for my Breeches but could not find 'em, and at the same Time I mist my Hat and my Shoes. Searching farther I found the Prisoner's old Shoes, which were tied with Packthread, at the Door, and the Cellar Door was split in two. The Shoes made me suspect the Prisoner. Next Week I met with him. He confess'd that he broke the Cellar-Door with a great Stone, and then thrust the wooden Bolt back, and got and took the Goods; that he had pawn'd the Hat in Golden-lane for 6d. and the Breeches in Turnbull-Street for a 1s. He went with me to those<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060005"></xptr> Places, and found them there. He had my Shoes upon his Feet.</p>
               <p>- Thompson. I took the Prisoner in Coleman-street. I knew him before, and had heard there was a Warrant out against him. He had pilfer'd some Things while he had work'd with me there. I tax'd him with robbing Mr. Sims. He at first denied it, but afterwards own'd that he broke the Cellar-door open with a Stone, and had pawn'd the Hat and Breeches, but said he was drunk when he did it.</p>

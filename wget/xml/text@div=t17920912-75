               <p>I was employed by the India Company; the prisoner worked with me six weeks, and two or three days; these three pieces are part of the lining of the reservoir; we had finished the building, and this new lead was the lead of the reservoir. I opened the pieces at the mansion-house, before the man had his examination, and the pieces are the exact length.</p>

               <p>Look at that lead, and see whether there is any way of identifying it. - I cannot swear to that lead.</p>
               <p>Do you think it possible now, for people on their oaths to identify it? - I do not think they can with a safe conscience.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of lead is that? - It is sheet lead.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was there not such lead used? - There was sheet lead used at the reservoir.</p>

I am a pawnbroker at 297, High Street, Chatham—on 21st December, about 7 in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop in company with another soldier of the same regiment—they came in to look at a watch—the other soldier left, leaving the prisoner in the shop—he took out a label and asked me if it was silver—I said "Yes, but not of the best description"—he said "I have got some more," and be pulled a purse out of his pocket and produced five more—I imme<lb></lb>diately sent for the police, and detained the prisoner in conversation for about half an hour, weighing the labels and talking on different subjects; in the meantime he picked the things off the counter and went out—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the labels—they are worth about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he offered them for sale for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I keep the Golden Cross beerhouse in High Street, near Mr. Randall's shop—on Friday, 21st December, from 15 to 20 minutes past seven, the prisoner came into my shop in company with some others, and went into the singing room; while he was there I had information given to me by the police, in consequence of which I noticed the prisoner's actions—he left the room and went into the back yard; there is no closet there—he remained there about twenty minutes—he then returned and went into the singing room again—I went into the back yard to see what there was there, and saw a lump of mess there—I got some water to wash it down, and washed it down the drain, thinking no more about it—in the morning a police sergeant came and asked me something, and we went out and found one of these labels, and then found the remainder down the drain—I picked them up and gave them to the sergeant.</p>

Samuel Slater, a private in the 30th Regiment, was apprehended at New Brompton on a charge of breaking into a house. I was told to turn out his kit, and on opening some socks of his that were rolled up I found six silver labels; I took them down town to see whether they were silver or no. I went into Mr. Randall's and asked him if they were silver; he said 'Yes, but of the worst description, ' so I came out and threw them in a back place at the Golden Cross, as I thought they were of not much value.</p>

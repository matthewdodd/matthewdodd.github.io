             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you the first person that made an information against the prisoner? - I was, I believe.</p>
               <p>Do you or not claim any reward for the discovery? - I entirely disclaim every reward be it what it will, I do not come on that account.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I work at various kinds of work. I have a patent for stamping paper; I work coffin-place work; and numbers of other articles I manufacture besides. I live at No. 16, Fleet-lane. I was at the Fleet, on the 7th of June, to and fro all the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was there any mob assembled there? - No great deal before nine o'clock at night. About nine I was intimidated left the Fleet should be burnt down; as I expected if it was my house would be burnt; I went to the Fleet, and went through into the yard to the bear. I stood on the steps, and saw seveveral people throwing fire into the cellar. Their number not being many, I went up to them to try to prevent it.</p>
               <p>What number of people were there? - About thirty people upon the bear, there was a large bonfire made upon the bear.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the bear? - It is an area belonging to the Fleet, the yard. There was a very large bonfire in that when I went in. I stood on the steps and saw several throwing fire into the cellar windows. I went up to them to see if I could do any thing to prevent it. The first person who came up to me was the prisoner; I knew him very well by sight though I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Did he live near you? - I did not know where he lived till last Monday was se'nnight, when he was taken up. When he drew near me I knew him very well by sight. I went up to him and said, What in the name of God can induce you to have a hand in this horrid scene! I know you very well by sight, what can be the reason of burning this building! Upon my telling him I knew him very well. He put out his hand; I shook hands with him; he said he knew me very well by sight. While I was talking to him I saw some others withinside the cellar taking up the fire which was thrown in, and going somewhere else with it, but where I could not tell; afterwards there were five or six boys assisting in throwing in the fire, but the prisoner did not throw in any after I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you seen him throw in any before? - Several times before I came up to him; the wood on the fire was taken from the bonfire and thrown in.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the prisoner take it from the bonfire and throw it in? - Yes, several times, as well as the boys. The fire was taken into a room near the centre of the building, one of the back centre rooms, under the coffee-room. After speaking to the prisoner in the manner I have described, I turned my head and saw that room begin to be in a light.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - Talking to Mr. Rowley by the bonfire near the cellar window. I immediately turned from the prisoner. I went and looked into the window; the flames seemed to break out very vehement in a short time, which I believe was occasioned by some combustibles; I ran immediately and alarmed the neighbourhood. We got two engines into Fleet-lane; the wind sat favourable, and my house was not burnt down.</p>
               <p>Was the Fleet prison burnt down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell this to any person? - Yes. On the Friday I went to the Bell, in the Bell Savage-Inn-yard to Mr. Groves and Mr. Dyer, the two turnkeys, as I understood he had been a prisoner in the Fleet, and represented this matter to them, but they could not recollect any such man. I was taken ill of the gout and confined a week. When I got up I applied to them again. I could hear nothing of him till last Monday se'nnight, then I learnt his name. While he was a prisoner in the Fleet, about a year and an half ago, there was an advertisement put into the newspaper for a wet nurse for a child;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280181"></xptr> the wet nurse was sent to the Marquis of Granby, a publick-house in Fleet-market; Mr. Rowley was at the Marquis of Granby. He had put in the advertisement and there were a number of women applied that after noon, which caused me to sit a few hours to see the joke, as it caused a deal of fun to the company.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago? - About a year and an half</p>
               <p>Was this done out of a joke? - No, he took in the women one by one into the parlour and examined them; some how or other there were about forty came that afternoon; it caused a good deal of laughter in the company. I recollected the circumstances; the landlady that kept the house now keeps the Clifford's-Inn coffee-house. I went up to her on Monday se'nnight and asked her if she remembered such a circumstance? She said, yes, very well. I asked her if she remembered the man's name? She said yes, Rowley, but did not know where he lived. She recommended me to go to Mr. Atkinson, the oilman, on Ludgate-hill. She said he had, she believed, him in his book and could tell. I went from thence to Mr. Atkinson's; he told me he lived in Westmoreland-buildings, and kept a chandler's-shop there. I mentioned this to the principal officer belonging to Bridewell-precinct, that I had found such a man, who I had before described; he advised me to go to Alderman Wilkes, or some other alderman to give information of the man. As I was going thro' St. Paul's Churchyard, I thought if I gave information of a man I was not certain of it would be wrong, therefore I called upon Martin, the constable, and we went to his house. He stood behind the compter. I told Mr. Martin that was the man, and that was his prisoner, and he took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person? - Yes; I know his face as well as any man living, but I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What is your business? - Stamping of paper.</p>
               <p>At Warwick you followed some other business, I believe? - I did not live at Warwick to follow any business.</p>
               <p>At Birmingham? - If you ask me a pertinent question I will answer you, but not if you ask an impertinent one; you called me a scoundrel before the alderman.</p>
               <p>This is not the first man you tried your hand at since the proclamation came out? - There was another man taken up.</p>
               <p>When was you ill after the fire? - Till last Monday se'nnight.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was known to every man in your neighbourhood? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>He was a Fleeter and so are you? - I am in some respects, and in some I am not.</p>
               <p>When he did this it must be notorious to all the people in the Fleet? - It was a laughable business to the company.</p>
               <p>You applied immediately to some of the company to know this man's name on the Thursday or Friday or Saturday? - It was so long ago I did not know what was in company; I knew the woman of the house made some remark upon it.</p>
               <p>She is not here I suppose? - No, I suppose not.</p>
               <p>You went up to the man as you knew him very well by sight? - Yes, and he knew me very well.</p>
               <p>You went up to him and said, you are of all men the lad I should expect to be guilty of this action? - I said he was the last man that would be guilty of such an action I thought only ruffians and villains would do such a thing; I thought he was too reputable to be guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to know he was reputable if you knew nothing of him but by sight? - From his appearance, he had a black coat on.</p>
               <p>A man in a black coat might be a villain as well as a man in a blue coat? - To be sure; I thought he ought to have more wit and more grace than to be guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>You did not go into the Marquis of Granby's-head after nine o'clock? - No, I did not at all.</p>
               <p>You do not know who was assisting the landlord to remove his goods? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know who was assisting Hall to remove his things? - What Hall.</p>
               <p>Hall keeps the tap, don't he? - I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280182"></xptr> know Hall at that time; I have not been in since he kept the tap.</p>
               <p>Is not this cellar Hall's cellar where the tap was kept? - While he kept it, I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Is it not the cellar belonging to the tap? - No doubt of i t; I suppose it must be Hall's cellar if he kept the tap.</p>
               <p>The back of your house is towards the Fleet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Yet you was busy going to the Fleet instead of taking care of your own house? - I went to see if the Fleet was likely to be fired.</p>
               <p>I understand you have disclaimed all reward from this proclamation? - Yes, and did before the alderman. Ask me any question between the king and the prisoner I will answer you, but these quibbles and silly questions are of no consequence.</p>
               <p>You did not take up this man till you was better? - I described him; I told Groves he was a tall man, pretty much pitted with the small pox, with a good deal of fresh colour in his face.</p>
               <p>That was the description of the man, a tall man, pretty much pitted with the small pox, with a good deal of fresh colour in his face? - That is the very man.</p>
               <p>Any thing else? - I do not recollect any thing else.</p>
               <p>Then the only description you gave of this man was a tall man, pretty much pitted with the small pox, with a good deal of fresh colour in his face? - The chief description I believe; I do not recollect any thing more particular.</p>
               <p>How came you not to describe him by saying that was the man who put in the advertisement? - Who knew the advertisement till I applied to somebody who knew the man.</p>
               <p>Did you say a word about his advertising for the wet nurses, which brought forty women together? - I think I did, I do believe I did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did, or not? - I cannot swear it, I rather suppose I made that remark.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was that advertisement well known in the Fleet; did Groves know of it? - I do not think that he did.</p>
               <p>It made a great deal of fun among the company, forty women got together in a publick-house in the Fleet? - They came and went; they were not any three of them there together.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time frequently go to see any of the prisoners in the Fleet? - I had not been in the Fleet above six months before the fire happened.</p>
               <p>This must make a noise in the Fleet? - It was a momentary matter over a draught of porter.</p>
               <p>It was not a momentary matter, it lasted you in your memory above a year and an half? - By that means I found the man out.</p>
               <p>Why did not you mention it to Groves whether he knew it or not?</p>
               <p>Jury. Was your application to Groves before you was laid up with the gout? - Yes; on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Did you give such a description that he could offer you any assistance in finding out the man? - They considered my description and could not recollect such a man.</p>
               <p>Who kept the tap when you was in the prison? - I was not a close prisoner; several persons kept the tap. Newton kept it when I was there.</p>
               <p>Did Hall keep it? - No, he has not kept it many days.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did Hall keep it on the 7th of June? - I do not know who did keep it, I did not frequent the house; Hall I understand took the tap last week.</p>
               <p>What place does Hall keep? - The Marquis of Granby's-head, I believe.</p>
               <p>Who kept the tap in the Fleet when the fire was? - I know nothing of that I do not know the man, I was not in the Fleet for months.</p>
               <p>Court. You said Hall kept the tap when the fire was? - I heard he did; I do not know, I was not in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What clothes had I on? - A black coat.</p>
               <p>- GROVES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the turnkey at the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Was you in the Fleet on the 7th of June? - I was in the gateway, I was not within side.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280183"></xptr>What happened to the Fleet? - It was burnt down.</p>
               <p>Completely burnt down? - Yes, entirely; I do not think there is six-penny-worth of wood left in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Eyles's apartment burnt down? - Yes, entirely.</p>
               <p>Did you see Pickering any time after the burning of the Fleet? - Yes, I did; I think it was on Friday; he came and asked me if I could recollect a man who was a prisoner with me about two years ago; he said he was a tall man, and very much pitted with the small pox, and of a fresh colour. I asked him do you know his name? He said no; that is what I want to know. I said, then it was impossible for me to recollect a man so long ago; so many came in and out that I could not recollect.</p>

               <p>Did he say what this person did? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Did he afterwards? - He came once or twice afterwards, and asked me if I could recollect him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When he first applied to you he did not tell you what he meant to charge him with? - No. He said he was in the yard.</p>
               <p>He said nothing about the number of women coming about the wet nurse's place did he? - He said nothing to me about it.</p>
               <p>How long have you kept the tap? - Between twenty and thirty years.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear of this story before? - No, never. That was at the Marquis of Granby's-head, I understand.</p>
               <p>You never heard of this story? - No.</p>
               <p>Who kept this tap? - Mr. Hall, he has taken the Marquis of Granby's-head now.</p>
               <p>He only came the first time to endeavour to find out his name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He seemed more anxious the second time after the proclamation came out? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you the first time what he meant to charge him with? - No.</p>
               <p>If he had described this man as such a notorious offender should not you have endeavoured to find him out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has Mr. Hall kept the tap? - Some years.</p>
               <p>How long was Pickering a close prisoner - He was not a close prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you know much of Pickering? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know any good of him? - I never heard any harm of him that I know of; he was born in the town where I was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- LONGFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a hat-presser opposite Newgate.</p>
               <p>Do you know Rowley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him the night the fire was in the Fleet? - Yes, and in the day time. I was upon my own leads; I saw a great smoke; I went down stairs and said there was a great fire. When I came down the people came along and said the Fleet prison was on fire. I went down and Rowley went with me.</p>
               <p>How long was he with you before he went down with you to the Fleet? - About half an hour, I believe. We went down to the Fleet-market to see if the Fleet was on fire, that was after nine o'clock. There was a great conquest of people; we did not go in; the mob was very great.</p>
               <p>What did Rowley do? - A gentleman came and shook him by the hand and left him and went up the market. He said he would go into the publick-house, the Marquis of Granby's-head, I believe it was, and if they wanted any assistance he would assist them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are sure as to the time? - Yes, it was after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to remember the time? - I went to the Fleet-market thinking to buy a mackarel; I went up the market and looked at Mr. Langdale's, the clock struck ten; then I went home.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Rowley? - Three or four months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What clothes had I on? - I think to the best of my remembrance, but I was very much frightened, I believe a fustian frock or fustian coat.</p>
               <p>Had he a black coat on? - No such thing. I never saw him but once to my knowledge in a black coat in my life.</p>

               <p>Did you see Rowley on the night the Fleet was on fire? - Yes, he came and asked me if I knew his face and if he should assist me to remove my things? I thanked him, and accepted the offer. That was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - About four or five months.</p>
               <p>Mr. COX sworn.</p>
               <p>Rowley has been my tenant about twelve years; I always looked upon him to be an honest industrious man; he has a very large family.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known Rowley about seventeen or eighteen years; he was servant to me about six years. I have entrusted him with great property at many different times. I always found him to be an honest good man.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALDRIDGE sworn.</p>
               <p>You are I believe one of the Common Council? - I am. I have known the prisoner about ten years; he has an exceeding good character or I would not have appeared for him. The character I have heard of Pickering was the reason of my attending; a former partner of Pickering's sent for me.</p>
               <p>What is Pickering's character? - I am very sorry to give any man a bad character, but he has a very bad one.</p>
               <p>What is Rowley's character? - A very good one.</p>
               <p>- JACKSON sworn.</p>

               <p>The prisoner is my near neighbour, he is a very honest industrious man; he has brought up five or six children in a decent manner. I have known Pickering twenty years; he kept a shop in Birmingham; his general character was that he was a coiner or a guinea coiner. I am well informed he has been tried for it.</p>
               <p>What is his character good or bad? - A very infamous one.</p>
               <p>- WEATHERSTONE sworn.</p>
               <p>I know Pickering to my sorrow.</p>
               <p>I need not ask you whether he bears a very good character? - A very bad one, a very infamous once, he obtained money -</p>
               <p>Counsel. You must not enter into particulars.</p>
               <p>Pickering. If you know any thing against me tell it?</p>
               <p>Wheatherstone. I keep a publick-house, the Hole in the Wall, in Kirby-street; he belonged to a benefit society which was kept at my house; he got money from the society on false pretences, and was scratched out for it. On the next club night he came into the room unperceived; when he was observed he was desired to withdraw, but he refused, and they let him stay. The next club-night there were fifty guineas to be paid to a widow if they had enough in the box; there was enough. Pickering came and desired all the money might be taken out of the box to see if it was according to the clerk's book. It was told down in rows, ten guineas in each row. Pickering swept the money off and said it belonged to him. A scuffle ensued, and he got off with nineteen guineas of it. We took him to the watch-house. He brought actions against me and the stewards, and put the club to three hundred pounds expence. I was in the room when he took up the money.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. My lord, I give up the prosecution.</p>

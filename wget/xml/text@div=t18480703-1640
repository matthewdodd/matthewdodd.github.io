                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Fox, Nicholls, and Co., the proctors employed by the executors. I engrossed this probate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from this will, before 9th Dec. 1841, before the will was deposited in the public office—that is the practice—after I had examined the probate with the original will, I took it for registry to Doctors' Commons; I have no memorandum of the day, but probably it was deposited two or three days before the grant of probate, which bears date 9th Dec, 1841—I have now looked through the sheets of the will separately, and as far as I know it is in the same state as it was when it came to our hands—I took more notice of this will than I do of wills generally, because there were several alterations and interlineations in it when it was first brought, and they are here now, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030006"></xptr>
               <p>there was an affidavit annexed to the will accounting for those alterations, which is here now—the testator died 2nd Nov., 1841—the will was in one possession about a fortnight before it was proved—I believe it was deposited with us by Messrs. Watkins and Hooper—every sheet is not signed and attested, but the initials of the witnesses are to the principal part of the inter-lineations, not to all; and there is a memorandum at the end, "I declare this to be my last will and testament, contained in this and the nine preceding sheets"—there are nine preceding sheets—shortly after the wills are deposited in the public office, it is the duty of one of the clerks to attach the whole by a silken string, and also to attach a seal—when I engrossed the probate I took a memorandum of all the alterations and interlineations, but I did not pre<lb></lb>serve it—we prepared an affidavit from that—I examined the affidavit—it was made by Mr. Mundell, a notary—I did not accompany him to swear it—it was sworn on 24th Nov.—it had been prepared a day or two previous—the will would probably be in my custody from the time the affidavit was prepared—I have access to the chest where the original wills are placed—after finishing the engrossment, I deposited the original will in the Prerogative-office, most likely about 1st Dec, two or three days before the probate would bear date—there was about a week or ten days between the preparation of the affidavit and the deposit of the will at Doctors' Commons—during that time it was in a chest in our office; I myself deposited it there—I have no doubt whatever that it is in the same state as it was when I engrossed the probate from it—there is apparently nothing that is different from the stats in which I deposited it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to the record-keepers at Doctors' Commons. It is my duty when an original will is required to be produced in a Court of Justice, to take it from the proper record-room, and deliver it to the wit<lb></lb>ness who is to produce it—this will comes from the strong-room of the Pre<lb></lb>rogative Court of Canterbury—I took it myself from that room this morning, and delivered it to Mr. Rawood—when wills are delivered in from the senior Stamp-office clerk, to the clerk of the current or unregistered wills, he puts on them a seal, all the sheets being attached by a silken cord—that would be done before the will was registered—I cannot say that no portion of it could be abstracted after that, because it has been done when anything informal has transpired; the clerk has been requested to take it apart, and put on a fresh seal—it could not be done without the knowledge of the parties at the office.</p>

               <p>that account—we never leave any person alone with the will—we take the same precaution with a professional person as with a stranger—when wills are copied, they are given out by the record-keepers to the copying-clerks, who take them to their own desks to copy, and there is a person appointed to take them from the clerks in the evening—they are not taken out of the office—they could not possibly remove any part of it—the seal is there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have resided at Lam<lb></lb>beth all ray life—I am solicitor for the Rector and churchwardens and some of the other officers there. On 13th April last, whilst in my own office, I was taken into custody on a warrant, charged with forging the will of my father-in-law, Mr. M'Gowran—Girdlestone was with the policeman who had tie warrant—I was detained at the station-house that night, and was taken before a Judge next morning, who immediately admitted me to bail—Swan was there in the outer chamber, and Girdlestone went before the Judge—he opposed my being bailed, and said that the Judge had no power to do it—I attended before Mr. Justice Coldridge, when my two brothers-in-law, Messrs. Francis and James M'Gowran, applied to be admitted to bail—they were in custody on the same charge—it was opposed—Saunders, Girdlestone, and Swan were there on that occasion together—they did not go before the Judge—they were talking together in the outer room—I saw them for a very short time, as I was obliged to go away—I and the two Mr. M'Gowrans surrendered here on 17th May last to take our trial—Mr. Huddleston ap<lb></lb>peared on the part of the prosecution—Girdlestone, Swan, and Saunders were called on their recognizances by one of the officers of the Court—neither of them appeared—the Court, on the proposition of our counsel, postponed the case for a time—it stood over three quarters of an hour—they did not then appear, and the Judge directed the Jury to acquit us—we were all three obliged to stand in the dock—on the application of Mr. Clarkson, the Court ordered the brief for the prosecution to be impounded, and Mr. Huddleston handed it to the officer of the Court—I married a daughter of Mr. M'Gow<lb></lb>ran's, after her father's death—I was paying my addresses to her during her father's life-time—he was a very old friend of mine and of my father's also—his family consisted of two sons and two daughters—his two sons are persons of property, the elder one the more so—one daughter, named Smith, is a widow, who had five children, one of whom lived with the deceased—the other daughter, Sophia, is my wife—the deceased also had a niece, who married Girdlestone—she was living at the time of the testator's death, but</p>

In the beginning of Sept. 1841, I was employed by Mr. Barton to prepare a will for Mr. Francis M'Gowran—I went according to his directions to see Mr. M'Gowran—I knew Mr. Barton, and as he was engaged to. Mr. M'Gowran's daughter he wished me to go as his friend—I think I saw Mr. M'Gowran at the. latter end of Sept. 1841, I received instructions from him which I took down in writing at the time, at his bed<lb></lb>side—these are the original notes which I took at that time (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I drew up the. will on those instructions—this is the will (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I read it over to Mr. M'Gowran after it was prepared—it was. engrossed by Mr. Charles Mullens—the draft was read over to the testator—I attended thrice—there were alterations made in it by his directions—Mr. Clay, the family surgeon, was present when the will was executed—he came in at that moment—it had then been read over, and the alterations made-they were made at the testator's-desire in the engrossment—I afterwards made the affidavit, which is now attached to the will with reference to those altera<lb></lb>tions—there seemed to be some few alterations with reference to Mrs. Girdle<lb></lb>stone's property; for instance, "Southwark" is substituted for" Westminster," "such" instead of "each"—there is no alteration in the effect of the will, as far as Mrs. Girdlestone is concerned—the whole of the alterations are in my writing, and have my initials to each in the margin—Mr. Clay's initials are there also—all the alterations, and tie initials, were on it at the time the testator executed it—the testator signed the final sheet—my initials are to each sheet, so that no sheet can have been substituted—there is writing of mine on every sheet—not the least alteration has been made since it was executed—I am certain it is in exactly the same state now as it was when it was executed by the testator—I am one of the attesting witnesses.</p>

I was requested to attend to witness the execution of his will—this is the will (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—my initials are on each of the sheets—the testator was of sound mind and memory at the time he executed it—I saw both Girdlestone and Swan three or four months ago, to the best of my recollection, at ray surgery—I think Girdlestone asked me whether I had ever made any affidavit respecting the will of Mr. M'Gowrari, and 1 said no, I never had—he then asked whether I would have any objection to make an affidavit to that effect—of course I was very indignant at my name having been forged, as I supposed, and I said. "No"—he told me that an affidavit had been made in my name respecting this will, but I find none has been made—I made the affidavit before a Justice at Wandsworth—he did not say what he wanted it for—he called on me again a day or two after, and wished me to go before the Grand Jury to. prove that I had made the affidavit, but I said I would not; I thought. I had done sufficient in making the affidavit—he said be would try and do without me; that he was going to indict Mr. Barton and the Mr. M'Gowrans for forgery—Swan was with him at that time.</p>

Q.</hi> When he came to my house he said, "Now, Girdlestone, I will forgive you the 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this Writ of Error, and make some arrange<lb></lb>ment to pay the rent; and if you don't like that, I will assist you in throw<lb></lb>ing the property into Chancery; or if that will not do, I will make the children wards of Chancery;" I said, "I do not see my way clear in either of those courses; if you like to give up the property to the children, quietly, we can settle it;" he said he would not do that; and that was all that was mentioned. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Every word of that is false, on my oath.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 13.) I was on duty at Hammersmith, when Girdlestone and Swan, who were in company, desired me to go to Mr. M'Gowran's house and execute a warrant—they produced the warrant to</p>

               <p>the sergeant on duty at the station, and I went with them—Girdlestone and Swan went into a public-house, about three doors off, and 1 went to Mr. M'Gowran's—I found him at home, and told him what I had come about—I went with Mr. M'Gowran, Girdlestone, and Swan, straight to the police-court, as the Magistrate was sitting then—Girdlestone and Swan said, "That is the villain; we will transport him "—I allowed him to walk by my side, as I had known him fifteen or sixteen years, and knew him to be a respectable man, and a man of property in the place.</p>

On Wednesday, the 8th of January, a little after six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner Heaphy came to my house with another man—I cannot say whether it was Connor—I saw them go past the bar up stairs to the first-floor—I do not remember seeing Toye—I did not see any body else go up stairs—I saw one of the party go out at the door afterwards—I just saw his back in going out—I heard him come down stairs, and there was another came down at the same time—my boy came, and gave me information, and I went up to the first-floor front room three or four minutes after I had seen the man go away—I missed from that room a decanter and four salts, and from the adjoining room nine ivory balls, which have been used for bagatelle, but not since I have been there.</p>

I was before the Magistrate, who said; "I forbid you to make application to any gentleman's service"—I said, "What am I to do, sir, to live honestly?"

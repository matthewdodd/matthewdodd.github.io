            , East Indiaman - A. I am. I had the command of the ship on the 11th of July last; she was lying in the docks, Black wall. In consequence of information, I went into the hold to make a search; I discovered pieces of nankeen chests throwed about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any nankeen - A. I did not. I afterwards made another search with Captain 
               <persName id="t18120916-128-person1084">Saunders</persName>
            , the two prisoners, and Bushel; this was between eleven and one. We searched in the hold, and in the hawl-up-deck. I told the prisoners I had found the papers that wrapped up the nankeens. We found the papers in the gun-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoners - A. White was an officer of the excise, and Best is an officer of the customs. They were sent there to take charge of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing on that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how much nankeen ought to be on board - A. I cannot say. There ought to have been seventeen chests in that ship, and there was one missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the contents of nankeen - A. Generally an hundred pieces. On Monday we searched again, Captain Saunders, Mr. Harwood, and Brown and Bell. I only searched on the gun-deck. I was present when two pieces were hauled out from under the half-quarter, on the starboard side; they were in a bag, and the bag appeared to be a birth-bag; it had a broad arrow mark upon it, and two letters. It was concealed behind the pinnacle, in some ballast which had been knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that spot where the nankeens were found any body's birth - A. No; but abast Best's, the custom-house officer's birth. The prisoners were both there when it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing about it - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Best there - A. Not to my knowledge. On our search we found some papers in the gun-room; the papers were such as usually nankeens are wrapped in. White said, that he had nailed a piece across part of the bulk-head, which had been broken.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was that part which he described he had nailed a piece across - A. In the hawl-up-deck.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the hawl-up-deck in respect to where the nankeens were placed - A. The hawl-up-deck was in the hold. You go against the hawl-up deck to go into the hold.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the prisoners made acquainted with this loss - A. They must; it had been a public talk.</p>
               <p>Q. You repeated your search again on the Monday - A. Previous to which, Best informed me, in the presence of White, that they had seventy-two pieces in their possession; pointing to a place where I understood they had found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that place - A. Between the mainmast and the pump-well, in the hold. We do not stow nankeens there; we stow them in the aft part of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. When they pointed to this place, could any nankeens have been seen there, if that quantity had been there - A. It must have been seen there before.</p>

            ; on the 11th of July Best was there. I am not certain whether White was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it known to White what the subject of that search was - A. Undoubtedly it must. We searched in the hawl-up deck, and in the hold. We searched the aft part of the hawl-up-deck, in the gun-room, which is part of the hawl-up-deck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hold completely searched - A. No; by no means completely searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you searched between the main-mast and the pump-well - A. Not particularly; it was superficially searched on the Saturday. Nothing was found on that day, except the packages; there were a great deal of lumber and no people to move any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did White make any observation during the time - A. There was a hole through the bulk-head into the gun-room, which had been stopped by a board, and nailed over.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person have access to where the nankeens had been deposited, through that hole - A. No; there was no regular way through; they might have got through that way. It was stopped at another part; there was no communication. The nankeens were in the hold; this was on the deck. They said they had nailed it up themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the search on the Monday - A. I did; both the prisoners were present while the search was making that day. There was a pretty good search on that day; and, before the search began, it was known that the seventy-two pieces were in their possession. I did not hear it first from them. I asked them both if they had found the seventy-two pieces. They said they had found it near the pump-well; that they had taken the opportunity of the people being at breakfast to hand them up the hatch-way, and conveyed them to their cabins, as a seizure, on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160073"></xptr> Monday. Clark reported it to me. I went to the spot and saw them taken out; when they were taken out, White and Best were present. It was at a place close to the bulk-head; at a place where the seventy-two had been deposited. I asked them where they found it, and where the remainder could be. They told me they had got them up the hatch-way; no one saw them take them up.</p>
               <p>MES CLARK. I am in the employ of the East India Company; I was present when the nankeen was found. I found it, as described, in the cabin that Best lodged in; both the prisoners were there before I hauled them out. When we came on board, Best asked me what we were come to do? I said, to look for the nankeens, He said, he had seventy-two in his possession, and he hoped they would be all found.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more pieces found - A. There were four pieces found afterwards.</p>

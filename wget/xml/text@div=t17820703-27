               <p>Which Weston? - The prisoner at the bar. Afterwards, the women went away in a great hurry, as if they were going a journey; they wanted a coach, and desired me to get one. I looked at the stand; there was none: I went to get one, but they were gone before I returned. A little while after, as I was sweeping the passage, I heard a noise of violence; I turned round, and saw Mr. Lapierre, and

               <p>I know the prisoner. I was coming up Cock-lane, with a sack of peas, from the market, about eight o'clock, on the 2d of July; I cannot tell within half an hour, over or under: I was going to Silver-street, with a sack of peas, from Fleet-market. I was going up Cock-lane; that Gentleman (the prisoner) was running down. Some people were making a noise after him; he turned his head, and said, a parcel of fools were making a noise after him. Then the people cried out, Stop thief; upon which I threw the peas down off my knot, off my head, and went up to him, and catched hold of him with my left hand. He said, Let me by, or I will blow your brains out; he took an oath of it. He had no sooner spoke those words, but the pistol went off, over my arm; I turned my head on one side, but it wounded my neck and chin. I held him' till the people came up, and a gentleman knocked the pistol out of his hand, and took it up.</p>
               <p>What was you wounded with? - I apprehend, a ball.</p>
               <p>What makes you think it was a ball? - Because it took me in one place.</p>
               <p>CROSS EXAMINATION.</p>
               <p>Was you loaded when you laid hold of him? - I throwed my peas down off my knot, and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Was it not in consequence of your discharging yourself of that load, that Mr. Weston fell? - No, he was not down at all.</p>
               <p>Where was the pistol? - He had it under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030026"></xptr> his coat; I don't know whether it was in his hand, or pocket. Immediately as I laid hold of him, it went off over my arm.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose, at the time you stopped Weston, he had the pistol in his hand, or his pocket? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>It might be an accident, this pistol going off? - No, he said, he would blow my brains out, if I did not let him go.</p>

               <p>I am a broker. I heard the cry of Stop thief; I crossed the way. The prisoner was running; I made a catch at him, and had hold of his collar. He clapped a pistol to my forehead; I don't know whether it did not touch my forehead: with that, I turned myself round, and he got from me. He ran, and I followed him, 'till he was taken in Cock-lane by Davis; I was almost by Davis when he collared him. When Davis had hold of him, he took his hand up, and fired at him; whether any words passed I cannot say; he had it in his hand all the way he ran. I called to Davis, and told him he had a pistol.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to fire at him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What report was it? - A very strong report, for so small a pistol. I came up, and knocked the pistol out of his hand; we secured him, and delivered him to the constable, Mr. Catchpole.</p>
               <p>CROSS EXAMINATION.</p>
               <p>At the time Davis met the prisoner, he had a sack on his back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The peas were on his back, and the collaring and firing were all at one time? - I cannot say that, whether he had thrown the peas off his back, or not.</p>
               <p>Whether the pistol going off was not in consequence of the sack of peas falling upon the man? - No, it was not; the peas fell on the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Are you confident, at the time these two men met, the sack of peas was, or was not, on Davis's back? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you, the pistol did not go off accidentally? - No, by pulling the trigger.</p>
               <p>Designedly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- CATCHPOLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I had this pistol (producing it) from the hands of Mr. Wallace: on Tuesday morning last, about a quarter after eight, a messenger came to tell me a man had shot at a person in Cock-lane .</p>

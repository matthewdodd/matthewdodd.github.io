                  </hi>. I live in Shakspeare's-walk. On the 3rd of May the prisoner came into my father's shop for two halfpence for a penny—I gave them to him—he went out and stood by the window—he then came in again and had a halfpenny loaf, which he put into his pocket, and was going out—I asked him for the halfpenny, and he threw it at me—he then went out again, and came in for a halfpenny-worth of cheese—he went out up the highway, and I went into the back-room to sweep the hearth—I then saw Ladeley's boy taking a 71bs. weight—(he has not been caught yet)—he took it from the coal-cellar, which is in the shop—I held him by the neck—he said, "I have not got it, that boy has got it," pointing to the prisoner—I let him go, and then they all three ran down the street, and laughed at me—there were three boys—I saw the prisoner on the other side of the way, with the pot under his arm, before I let the other boy go—I went to look for our pot, and it was gone from the shelf at the back of the counter—it had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper in it—the prisoner could have got into the shop without my-knowledge, while I was in the back-room—I called my mother down stairs, and told her—I was standing at the door when I saw him with the pot in his hand—Ladeley's boy was then outside the door—I had let him go—we have not either got pot or money back.</p>

I was going down the Commer<lb></lb>cial-road, and a boy came up to me, showed me the prisoner and two more boys, and said he had stolen a half-pint pot and some money from Mrs. Driver—they ran away—I took the prisoner on the 7th of May—I found 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

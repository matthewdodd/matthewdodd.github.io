            . I was drinking a pint of beer in St. James's Street, the prisoner was there at the same time talking about a top of a tankard he said was sent to him, to get it melted down. I told him he'd loose by that, and said, I would either buy it, or get him a chap for it: I suspected it was not honestly come by, and therefore went immediately and got a warrant from Justice Manly. I took Mr. Tomb, the constable, with me, and we told the prisoner he was a Jew, and would buy it, if he had the body, but it was not worth while to buy that alone. Then he went with us into a room in Angel-court, St. James's ; there he took the body of the tankard from off a place, among some old rags. Then we discovered our intent, and took him before the justice. The prisoner said there, he bought it in Holland for 10 l. 15 s. at a place called Bushey, in Brahant. We searched him, and found a discharge from the army in his pocket, by the name of

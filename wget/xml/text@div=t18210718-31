On Monday morning, the 25th of June, I was awoke between five and six o'clock, by the nurse. I got up, and found the kitchen-window was forced up by some instrument, and the bolt forced off; a piece of the pannel of the inside window-shutters cut out, by which the parties were enabled to remove the bar, and get in. There were some embers of wood burnt out, laid on the kitchen floor under the window - it was loose wood, like matches; and there was the mark of a lighted candle having been placed against the wainscot. The wood I suppose was burnt there to give them a light - not to set fire to the house. I found a piece of candle on the parlour carpet, not half an inch long. I missed a variety of articles which were all looked up the night before. The kitchen window was safe the night before. This property was all gone.</p>

            . I was nurse at Mr. Jacobs. I went to bed about twelve o'clock the night before; every thing was then safe - I got up about five o'clock, I did not go down stairs till half-past five o'clock, and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180016"></xptr>found the parlour door open, and the house robbed. The front door was open; it was fastened the night before with two bolts and locked. I found the kitchen window pushed up, and a piece cut out of the shutter; the kitchen clock was stopped at the hour of three; it was not down; it went again when I set it going; it had been stopped purposely. The locks of the parlour doors were forced open.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I took the prisoner on the 25th of June, at Mr. Lambert's, the Silversmiths, in Coventry-street, about one o'clock in the day - I found the plate stated in the indictment there. I asked him if he had ever sold any plate there before - he said he had, about six weeks previous. I asked whose it was - he said it was his own, and he had it from his father. I then asked him how he came by this which he was offering for sale - he said that was his own property likewise, and that he received it from his mother. I then searched him, and found a snuff-box in his waistcoat pocket, with the prosecutor's name in it; a gold seal, and a small metal seal; and a lock, apparently of a desk, in his breeches pocket, and three duplicates - one for the flute. He said he found them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lambert. The prisoner offered the spoons and forks for sale, on the 25th of June, between twelve and one o'clock - suspecting him, as he had sold plate six weeks before, we begged him to leave them to ascertain their value. He returned in half an hour - we had an officer ready, who took him. The plate is worth 6 l.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the property, on the 26th of June, of one Simpson. I had bought household furniture of him two months previous. I left it at this house for sale, as I wanted the money, to go to another sale. I pawned the flute, as I wanted money to go to market. When I went back I was detained - if I had stolen it I should not have returned. I paid for it in the presence of a respectable witness, named Bartholomew.</p>

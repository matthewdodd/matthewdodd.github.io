On Saturday night, 12th Jan., at 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoner kick a young woman at Fox-court—I afterwards saw that same woman dead—I have no doubt it was the same—the prisoner kicked her in the stomach, and she fell back—it was a hard kick—there were two young women there—they picked her up—she fell down again—I did not hear her say anything to the prisoner—I heard him say to her, "Now then," when he kicked her—he appeared to be sober, and so did she—I saw no other person touch her, or use any violence to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 9, Bell-court, Gray's Inn-lane. On Saturday night, 13th Jan., I met the deceased, Mary Kelly, at half past 11 o'clock, and I was in her company till ten minutes past 12—it was at the corner of Fox-court; we were in a public house, and I was ten minutes with her outside, when we came out—we came out of the public house at 12 o'clock—there were other persons besides us came out; two men and a woman—I do not know who the two men were—as we came out of the public house the prisoner was outside, and directly we came out I saw him come up, and hit her on the side—I did not hear him speak before he struck her, nor did I hear her say anything—he had not been in the public house while we were there—it was with his fist that he struck her; he made a punch at her—it was a hard blow—she fell against the door place—she did not speak for about ten minutes, and then she said, "Oh, my God! I am dead"—I left her and went away; I left her standing at the end of the court—she was not leaning against anything, but standing the same as I am now—I left her with a young woman named Donovan—I did not see her again alive—she appeared to be well before she received this blow from the prisoner—she was sober, she had not received any violence from any one whilst she was with me, before the prisoner struck her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the hospital in Gray's Inn-lane. On Sunday morning, 14th Jan., a little after 1 o'clock, the de<lb></lb>ceased was brought there dead—I afterwards made a post mortem examina<lb></lb>tion,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290050"></xptr>
               <p>assisted by Mr. Savory—I examined the cavities of the body, the head, the thorax, and the abdomen, and found all the organs healthy, but bloodless—in the cavity of the abdomen, extending from the left side down<lb></lb>wards to the front, and also into the pelvis, I found a large clot of blood; the portion that I removed weighed about eighteen ounces, but that would not represent the whole; the fluid portion was not included in that—I found a laceration of one of the veins of the spleen, a branch of the splenic vein—I believe the greater portion of the blood, which was evidently venous, came from the splenic vein; but I would not undertake to say that a portion might not have come from some other vessel or vessels, which are very small—considering that all the organs were perfectly healthy, I am not disposed to say that the hemorrhage came from any diseased vessel or organ, but having heard that a blow and kick both had been received, and that they corresponded with the situation of the hemorrhage, and with the lace<lb></lb>rated vessel, I am induced to believe that the hemorrhage which produced the death, was the result both of the blow and kick—a blow and kick, in such a position, might have produced that injury—I have no doubt that death was caused by that hemorrhage, and I believe that the hemorrhage was caused by violence, as far as the evidence goes—my reason for saying so is because the organs were perfectly healthy—I saw nothing which would naturally, and without some violence, cause such appearances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you examine the external surface of the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, corresponding with the internal hemorrhage—I did not observe there any marks of violence—that is not essential, although it is often found—a vessel may be ruptured from other causes than external violence—I do not think that drinking would have anything to do with the rupture of the vessel; but if she fell on the spot, where the clot was found, I should say that might account for it—a person in the habit of drinking is not more subject to injury from violence than a person of sober habits; there is no connexion whatever between the two—the rupture of that vessel would not be caused by great excitement—vessels of the brain may give way in those who have been accustomed to drink hard, and from excitement, but not a vessel in this situation—we scarcely ever find those vessels diseased so as to produce hemorrhage—it does not always follow that the internal injury is immediately near or under the external violence—it may some<lb></lb>times be in the opposite direction—I do not think that violence on the right side, in this case; could have been the cause of the rupture of the vessel on the left—a blow on one side of the head might produce its apparent effect on the opposite, but I should say not on the body—I do not see any physical impossibility to it—there was nothing on the external surface to indicate where the blow had been inflicted.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a fruit-stall in Covent Garden-market. On the morning of 29th July, about half-past five o'clock, the prisoner came, and bought some peas—he gave me five shillings and a fourpenny-piece—I told him three to the shillings 1 did not like—he said, "Give them to me, and I will go back to my old woman and fetch some more, if they are not good"—I did not see where he went, but two porters and the beadle fol<lb></lb>lowed and took him with the bad money about him.</p>

I saw the prisoner come to buy the peas, and heard Drinkwater say, "Here are three shillings I don't like"—he 'gave them to the prisoner—I asked him to let me look at them—he would not—he was neither sober not intonicated—I went with another man and took the shil<lb></lb>lings out to his hand which the officer has got.</p>

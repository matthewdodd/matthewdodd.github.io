               <p>JOHN HALEY sworn. - Q. What business do you follow? - A. Not any; I have been in business; I live in Marylebone-street, Golden-square: On the 12th of August, about three o'clock in the morning, I had been out to spend the evening, in Rose-street, Covent-garden, with my friends; I staid rather later than usual.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time in the morning, perhaps you were not quite sober? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to swear to the person of a man? - A. Yes, I was sober enough to identify the person; I was going home from <placeName id="t18030914-110-crimeloc634">Rose-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. What had you in your pocket-book? - A. A two-pound note, some memorandums and a silver pencil-case.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not sober enough to resist him, I suppose? - A. No; I said, you have got my pocket-book; he made no reply, but knocked me down, and ran off; I halloaed out, watch, stop thief; I called, watch, stop thief, a second time, and the watchman called out, I have got him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was taken immediately? - A. Yes: the watchman asked me what I was robbed of; I said, he had robbed me of my pocket-book; the prisoner said, he had no pocket-book, nor he did not know me; the watchman searched him, and found none upon him; the watchman said, he thought he saw him drop something, before he crossed the way to lay hold of him; we all three went over to look, and on the iron railing of a window in King-street, we found the pocketbook; I said it was mine, and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Your pocket was picked first, and you was knocked down afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140088"></xptr>Q. There was no force used to you till after the pocket-book was taken? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Your name is Haley, and you live where? - A. In Marybone-street, Golden-square.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it? - A. About three in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you had spent the evening? - A. I cannot exactly tell you myself.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you can identify the man? - A. I won't swear positively to his person; the only thing I can swear by, is his dropping the book at the place.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you did not see? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever robbed before? - A. Yes; I was robbed the same evening of my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where you were robbed of your watch? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: About three o'clock in the morning, I heard that person cry out, stop thief; I then looked, and saw nobody in the street but the prisoner, coming down the contrary side of the street that I was going up; I called out, stop, and then he dropped his hand down from his breast, as if he dropped something, but I could not discern what it was; he was crossing the street when I grasped hold of him; I brought him over to the same side of the street that I was walking on, and kept him there till the prosecutor came up; he desired me to search him; accordingly, I put my hand into his pocket, but only found some halfpence; I then said to the prosecutor, if he has taken your pocket-book, we will go up the other side of the way, and perhaps we may find it; I took the prisoner on the other side of the way, and at the same place where I desired him to stop I picked up the pocket-book upon the iron railing; I then took him to the watch-house; I produced the pocket-book to the constable of the night; it contained a two-pound note, and other papers. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>(The note and pocket-book were identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming home from spending the evening; I heard a cry of stop thief; I walked up, seeing the watchman in the middle of the street, and asked him if he knew what was the matter; he desired me to stop, and I did immediately; a man then approached, and addressed himself to me, saying he had been robbed; he did not say I robbed him; I asked him by who; the watchman said, there was no other person in the street but me, and then he said, it must be me, and I was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

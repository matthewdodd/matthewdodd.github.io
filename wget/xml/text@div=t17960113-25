             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Trebeck. I am a corporal in the first regiment of guards, 3d battalion: The prisoner was a private soldier in our regiment; on the 2d of December last; the prisoner called upon me about seven o'clock in the morning, I cannot say what day it was; I believe it was in December, near six weeks ago now.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day of the week it was? - A. I cannot; he came to measure me for a pair of breeches; he is a taylor; he came in a hurry with the breeches, and asked me to let him leave a bundle, which he said contained his working things, and his goose was in it; he left the bundle, and told me he was going to Dr. Beckwith. the surgeon of the battalion, to do a coat for him; the bundle was left in a corner of the room, and I did not take any notice of the bundle that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other bundle of that sort in your house? - A. No, nothing of the kind; I did not particularly observe the bundle that day, because I was going upon duty at the Tower; I saw the bundle after it was left, but I cannot swear that I saw him chuck it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that bundle was not there before? - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from duty, did you see that bundle there? - A. I saw it the next day, and I told Serjeant Batty that I thought that bundle was the prisoner's regimentals, and that he was going to be absent, and I thought proper to look into it, which I did in the presence of the Serjeant; I took my knife and opened the bundle, when I opened it, I was very much confused, and found linen in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Wet or dry? - A. It was moist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take particular notice of any part of the linen? - A. I did then, and had an inventory of the things; there was a number 6 upon one of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130043"></xptr>sheets which I carried home; I carried every thing in the bundle down to the Serjeant Major's; I took them into his room, shewed him what I had got; he told me to leave them there, and as soon as he he came to my house, to bring the person to him, which I did not, because the next morning he was going on duty; the linen was left at the Serjeant Major's from the Thursday till the Monday, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name? - A. Serjeant Major Mason.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the linen again? - A. To the best of my knowledge it might be about five days, four or five days, I cannot rightly say; I saw it at the Serjeant Major's house; I don't know whether it was the same linen or not, I carried it from the Serjeant Major's to Mr. Cruden's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Mr. Cruden's, did you look at the linen? - A. I did not, for this reason, that there were gentlemen there, and they looked at them themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the linen you carried to Mr. Cruden's? - A. I cannot swear to it; Mr. Cruden Satisfied me for carrying them, and I thought no more of it till I was called upon again.</p>
               <p>Court. You must identify the linen; here is a considerable chasm in the evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure they were out of your possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Serjeant Mason is? - A. I cannot say where he is to-day; he is sometimes at the Tower, and sometimes at the other end of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he subpoened?</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot stir a step without him.</p>

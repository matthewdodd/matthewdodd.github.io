On Saturday, the 25th of May, I went to bed at half-past one o'clock in the morning - the shop was shut up about five minutes after twelve o'clock. I was the last person up, and secured the house myself. I rose about eight o'clock next morning - it was daylight; and found the shop window was nearly stripped of every thing; the till had been tried, but not successfully; boots and shoes were taken from eight different parts of the shop. The window grating was forced up, the persons could then enter, and get through the cellar and up the stairs into the shop, without hindrance. I lost the property stated in the indictment.</p>

I ascertained they lived at No. 71, Crown-street; we took them there, up stairs, and Holding produced the key of the padlock, which was on the door, and the key of the common lock, and unlocked the door, and there we found the two pair of shoes, a crow-bar, and some skeleton keys.</p>

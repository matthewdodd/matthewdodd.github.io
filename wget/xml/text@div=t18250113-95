            . I am the wife of Daniel Etherington. On the 20th of December, we moved from Tyler-street, to a lodging, at Mr. Swale's, <placeName id="t18250113-95-crimeloc494">Marshall-street, Carnaby-market</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have two rooms? A. Yes; and was in one or other of them all the time, and the door between the two rooms open; the house is full of lodgers; another person has a third room on that floor; the money was put there about three o'clock, and he came about a quarter past; it had been brought from our other lodging, in a box - I have never said that I had not seen it under the carpet, or that I was sorry I had said so.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When had you last seen the money? A. Not since the 19th; but I saw the cotton it was wrapped in, under the carpet, when he was coming up stairs; he could have taken it without our observing him; both rag and money were gone.</p>
               <p>DANIEL ETHERINGTON. Our goods were moved to Marshall-street, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning. I took the money out of the box, but did not open the cotton - I put it on the mantel-shelf, and put it under the carpet, about three o'clock, and have no doubt of the money being in it; and in a quarter of an hour the prisoner came to put up a bed - I helped him, but left the room, about four times; he was nearly half an hour there; and when he left, at tea-time, we went to look for the money, and missed it; nobody but him and us had been in the room - there is no door to that room, on the landing-place.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you drink tea? A. About a quarter to four o'clock; we had not left the room at all - I went after him immediately, and found him at his master's shop, about a quarter of a mile off; no money was found upon him, or at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor bought a bedstead, at my master's - I carried it home, and fixed it up; there was no carpet in the room.</p>

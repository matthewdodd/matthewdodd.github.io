               <p>Q.Were you in liquor? - A. No; I had only drank one pot that day.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to say, then, that you were perfectly sober? - A. I had no concern in liquor at all; when I waked I found my breeches unbuttoned; I might be asleep about an hour; and a woman said directly that I was robbed; I saw my watch just before I fell asleep, and the woman of the house likewise.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to look at your watch in the public-house? - A. I had come from Romford with a drove of pigs; when I waked I missed my watch, I have never seen it since; there was no other person in the house but the prisoner and the woman that waked me; he offered to let me have the watch again directly, if I would give him a leg of mutton and trimmings.</p>

               <p>Q.Was that woman the landlady? - A. Yes; when I waked the prisoner was gone; I took him the next morning, at the Three Compasses, about half a mile from where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>- BROUGHTON sworn. - I heard the prisoner say that the prosecutor had got a watch, and he would have it; that was the same afternoon that the man was robbed; I was in the next box to the prisoner; I saw the prosecutor lie down and go to sleep, and I fell asleep too in the adjoining box; the prisoner was in the tap-room at that time; I did not wake till the people were all gone, the landlady awoke me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Which was the nearest to the prosetor, you or I? - A. I was; the box parted us.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Castle: I saw the prisoner get out of the box that he was in, and go to the box that the prosecutor was in, and lie down; he had not lain there long when he came to the bar for a glass of gin, and went out immediately; I awoke the young man, his breeches were unbuttoned, and I asked him if he had not lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the prosecutor drank any liquor? - A. No; he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know the last witness? - A. Yes, he is a young man of very good character, he lives servant with a brother of mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not you in the tap-room all the time that I was lying in the box where the prosecutor was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your back turned at any time? - A. No, but I did not think of taking any account of what passed; I might be asleep myself, for it was after dinner, and I was sitting down, having nothing to do, leaning upon the table with my hand before my face.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you sitting or standing at the time I was lying in that box? - A. I was sitting by the fire side, in the box opposite to them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near were they to each other? - A. There was a table between them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. There were two men at dinner with that man, and after he went to sleep I saw them unbutton his breeches, and I told them not to do so, but to leave him alone; I mentioned that before the Magistrate, and they could not be found, one of them his name is Thomas Bolton, I do not know the name of the other.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were two in company with me, but they went away before I fell asleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Donkin—on the evening of 13th April, about 10 o'clock, I went to the deceased's house, and remained there for about an hour and a half—the deceased, my mother-in-law, Mrs. Stevens, and myself were in the room—I believe he was about to be married to my mother-in-law—the table was set for supper—the deceased was a teetotaller, but I should say he was a very passionate man—he was sober for all I know—a knock came to the door, and the prisoner came in—I had never seen him before—he and the deceased had some conversation—I could not hear what it was; it was rather quarrel<lb></lb>some—a daughter of the deceased came in, and directly he saw her, without a word being said, he took up a glass of ale that was on the table and threw it over her—he then took a knife up to his son; he took it away from him; I got in between them, because the father seemed very spiteful to his son—I said to the deceased, "Do be quiet," and to the prisoner, "Don't strike the old gentleman"—he began to strike his father, and I took the lamp off the table, fearing it would go over—the prisoner punched his father on the side of the head, and he fell on the fender insensible—the prisoner then took the tongs and struck his father on the side—I should say it was a blow enough to do anybody a great deal of injury—his sister said, "Come away, you have done enough"—I was frightened and left—the deceased was then on the ground, on the fender—the sister had been standing at the door, half way in the room and half way on the landing—I went out and met a policeman—I saw the deceased again on the Sunday in bed, and he seemed very ill.</p>

I saw Mr. Walker standing on the landing; he was not in the room—I can't say whether he saw what was going on; Mrs. Walker did—it commenced with the father throwing the ale in Mrs. Walker's face—I don't think the son would have struck him but for that—I did not see him put up his hands and threaten to fight his son—I did not hear the prisoner tell his father to sit down, as he did not want to have any row—I did not see the father take a brass candlestick and throw it at Mr. Walker, or take up a poker and say he would knock the</p>

At the time in question I was living at 58, London Street, Fitzroy Square—I had been living with the deceased about five weeks—I was in the lodging 120, Whitfield Street, with him and Mrs. Donkin on the night of 13th April, between 10 and 11—I was to be married to the deceased the next morning—a knock came to the door—I opened it. and the prisoner walked in with a cigar in his mouth—he said to me "Who are you?"—I said "You know who I am; I am about to be your father's wife very shortly"—he gave me a very forbidding look, and hearing his father say what a forbidding man he was, I went out to look for a policeman—I returned in about a quarter of an hour and met the prisoner coming down the stairs—I took hold of him by the neck cloth and attempted to give him into custody—a policeman was with me, but he said he could not take the charge as he had not seen the blow struck—I said "I expect there is murder"—I did not see any mark on the prisoner's face—I went into the room, and Mrs. Taylor was in the act of placing the dear old man against the mantel-shelf—he said "Lizzie, I am a murdered man"—he complained of his side—I wanted him to go to the hospital; he would not—a doctor was sent for after five days—he was very bad during that time; but he was a very healthy, strong man, and he fancied he could do without a doctor, and he went out and came in—on Good Friday I fetched Dr. Harding, who came and bandaged him up—he died on the Friday following, the 17th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road—I saw the deceased on Good Friday—he was lying on his back in bed, complaining of a good deal of pain about his ribs—I put my hand under his back and felt a fracture—he had been spitting a little blood—I put up the fracture in the usual way—I examined him—he talked to me for some time—I did not see the fracture; it was behind—I felt it with my hand—the two ends of the bone must have separated a little during the week when he was not attended to—the difficulty of breathing was caused by the fracture—a little inflammation of the lungs had set in, which increased very much—I continued to attend him—inflammation crept on the lungs in consequence of the fracture, and he died ultimately from the inflammation of the lungs on the 27th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. If he had fallen in the struggle over the fender across the ribs, that would have been sufficient to break the ribs—I heard that he went to work the day after he received the injury—I saw no sign of</p>

                  </hi>.

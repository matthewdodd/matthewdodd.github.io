               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. How long has he worked in Mr. Taylor's employ? A. About three years, and had a very good character - he had 10s. or 12s. a week.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Wardour-street - this watch was pawned with me on Monday, the 20th of October, between one and three o'clock, by the prisoner, in the name of William Scott; I am confident it was him, because he came a second time the same day, after we had closed business; and said he had lost the duplicate of the watch, and wished me to detain it, if it were brought to me - I would say nothing that night; the next day the prosecutor came and said he had received a letter, saying it was pawned at our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the value of it? A. It is worth altogether about 7l.; I lent him 2s. 6d., which was all he asked - had he asked more, it would have aroused my suspicions; I cannot fix the time more accurately than between one and three o'clock - I was in the shop all day, and may have had two hundred customers; but this was a remarkable case, it being pawned for 2s. 6d. it excited my attention.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you call to mind your recollection of his features? A. His asking 2s. 6d. lulled my suspicion; I have said excited my attention - he came the second time between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; I have always named that hour, and never said it was between nine and ten - Mr. Harrison, my master, said that; I heard the prisoner say at the office he would account for where he was between nine and ten o'clock; nobody said "Then we must provide for that, or any thing like it;" I said it was between eight and nine - I went to Taylor and Beaumont's factory to point him out; he was the third man who came out, I recognized him by his countenance and dress - he had a blue coat and corderoy trowsers; there were ten or fifteen men - he came into the box when he pawned it, and I saw him as he went out at the door; I have not advised him to plead guilty - he was advised, but said he was not guilty, that he never saw me nor the watch; when he came at night, he came to the private door, and there was a very strong light over the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Harrison present when the prisoner came a second time? A. No; I saw his brother at the office, and he is here - I have no doubt of the prisoner being the person.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker, and work at Messrs. Taylor and Beaumont's factory. I know the prisoner, and recollect his being at the shop on Monday week; he was in the shop till one o'clock, when he went to dinner - he dines in Red Lion-street, Old Cavendish-street; the shop is in Brook-street, Bond-street - I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230106"></xptr>there again when I returned, at five minutes before two - I do not know the precise time he returned; he complained of his head aching that afternoon - he staid till five o'clock and went to tea; I returned at half-past five, and found him in the shop then - he worked till eight o'clock - we went together across the square to Regent-street, and then down Oxford-street to the Middlesex-hospital; he turned to Tottenham-court-road, and I wished him good night; that was his road home - he lives with his father in Camden-town; it would take him about twenty minutes to go to his father's - he is very steady in his habits; I never was in the loft the watch was taken from; I know nothing of its being taken - I was not present when my master urged the prisoner to acknowledge having taken it; several of our men wear blue coats and corderoy trousers - I know nothing about an anonymous letter.</p>
               <p> - SUPTON. The prisoner works under me at the shop; I recollect his being there on Monday week - he left at one o'clock, and told me he returned at half-past - I saw him again three minutes before two; I did not see him asleep - he is an honest hard-working lad; the loft the watch was in, is an open loft - trades-people pass through it.</p>

            . I work in the same shop; I recollect seeing the prisoner on Monday week; he returned from dinner at twenty-five minutes past one o'clock - he goes to Old Cavendish-street with his father to dine, as it is too far to go to Camden-town; I should think it would take him half an hour to go to Cavendish-street, eat his dinner, and return; I think I may venture to say he could not have gone to Wardour-street and eaten his dinner and returned; I heard no offer made to him about this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What day was it that he returned at twenty-five minutes past one o'clock? A. Last Monday week; it is my duty to attend the front-shop while the men go to dinner, to watch when they return - I have my dinner at two o'clock; two other men came between one and two - they were Green and Burn; Green came first of these two - there was no particular reason why I should notice the time the prisoner returned; but he generally does come about that time - he never takes his full hour, not one time in ten.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father, and work for the same master, but not in the same factory.

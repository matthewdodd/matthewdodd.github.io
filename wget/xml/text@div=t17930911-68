               <p>I know the prisoner is the man that stole the things; I was not present at the time.

               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards? - Not till I took him myself; I took him at Hampstead; I live at <placeName id="t17930911-68-crimeloc376">Bell's-court, Gray's Inn-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had he the things on him? - Only the shirt on his back. There is nobody here but myself; the constable has got the shirt, he is not here; I have been after him this morning, but I cannot find him. When I took him he said he did not do the robbery; he worked with me off and on two years.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to go away and leave your master's service? - I went out to seek for work. He told me he could not employ me; he only employed me a day or two, or three, now and then; he could not any ways employ me for a constancy. I have not a friend in the world.</p>

               <p>LEVI COWEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner. Last Sunday morning I met him, and he asked me if I wanted to buy any goods; I told him I did; with that he took me home with him to his house in Petticoat-lane, and shewed me nine sixpences, five half crowns, and three shillings; he asked me six shillings for them. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out half a crown; I told him I had not money to purchase them; he told me to leave the half-crown, and bring the three shillings and sixpence before twelve o'clock, and I should have the goods; with that I went and acquainted Tipper, Mayne and Purnell, who are officers, of it. I returned and went up into his room about twelve o'clock, and the officers staid below.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the officers before you went to the house? - A Mayne marked three shillings and a sixpence, and gave them to me to make up the money, and they searched me; I had nothing upon me but that three shillings and sixpence. When I came to the house, the officers staid below, and I went up into the room, and saw the prisoner with a child on his lap, and a woman paring potatoes; he asked me for three shillings and sixpence, and took out of his pocket a paper of the money, five half-crowns, nine sixpences, and three shillings; I gave him the three shillings and sixpence, and he gave it to the woman. When I entered the room there was a frying-pan on the fire, and some base metal in it; the officers then came in, and searched me, and found the five half-crowns, the nine sixpences, and three shillings; they searched the prisoner, and found three sixpences upon him; the woman was putting the three shillings and sixpence in her pocket as the officers came into the room, and they took it from her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. This is all truth you have been telling us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by when the prisoner said this to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It all depends on your credit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went again and found him above stairs, and he gave you the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were the officers not to go up with you? - A. Because, if they had come up, he would not have given me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up stairs, and the officers came up to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170056"></xptr>Q. The officers had so good an opinion of you, they searched you before you went up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they search you? - A. They searched all my pockets and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible for you to conceal this money that the officers might not find it? - A. No; I don't know where I was to put it but in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not have put it in your bosom, or somewhere where the officers would not find it? - A. I am not such a lad as to do that.</p>
               <p>Q.What are you? - A. A Jew, and sell lemons and oranges.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always give the same account of this transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the same account to the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the Magistrate you got only seven shillings and sixpence. - A. Yes; I told the Lord Mayor seven shillings and sixpence; that was a mistake which I immediately corrected, as soon as the words were out of my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you correct it till the officer told you? - A. As soon as I said seven, the officer said nine.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer said nine, and then you said nine? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for doing this? - A. For the public good.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer. On Sunday last, between ten and eleven o'clock, the last witness called at my house, and, in consequence of an information from him, I sent for more assistance. I went to Houndsditch and joined Tipper. I took three shillings and sixpence out of my pocket, and marked them, and gave them to the last with 1s. I stroked him down, to see that he had no more money. I did not put my hand in his pockets; he said he had no more, only two in halfpence; I did not feel the halfpence; then we went to a ginger-bread baker's in Petticoat-lane; we let the last witness go up first in order to complete his bargain; in the course of a minute we proceeded up two pair of stairs. As soon as we entered the room, we saw the last witness, the prisoner, and the woman; there was a frying-pan close by the fire, and a piece of metal in it of some sort; I then perceived something in the hand of the last witness; he put his left hand into his left coat pocket, I immediately caught hold of it, and out of his hand I took a paper containing five half-crowns, three shillings, and nine sixpences; I asked him where he got this money; he immediately said he had it from the prisoner; the prisoner did not say any thing; I put the money in my pocket; I am clear it is all counterfeit; I have been in the habit of apprehending persons with bad money; I then proceeded to search the prisoner, and in his left hand breeches pocket I found three base counterfeit sixpences; they are not finished, they want rubbing and putting in a liquid; they are not in a state for circulation. (The money was all produced, and handed to the Jury).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the woman? - A. I did not, I was engaged with the prisoner and the last witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. These sixpences are not such as could be passed off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You rubbed down the witness Cowen before you went to the house? - A. I did not put my hand in his pocket; I asked him particularly if he had any more money</p>
               <p>Q. If he has sworn that you put your hand in his pocket, he has sworn that that is not true? - A. Certainly; for I did not put my hand in his pocket.</p>
               <p> - PURNELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with the last witness and Tipper, on Sunday morning, to the prisoner's lodging; we went up stairs, and Mayne searched the first evidence, and found some bad money in his pocket; I saw the woman putting something in her pocket; I went and took the three shillings and sixpence out of her hand; it was the same that Mayne had marked.</p>
               <p>Mayne. There is one particular shilling I can swear to, it has a dent in it; I marked them all.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you mark them? - A. With a sort of a scratch with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe that three shillings and sixpence to be the same you gave to Cowen? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by saying these sixpences are not finished; they appear to have been in circulation? - A. They have been in circulation; they are not in the state they have been at first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. I understand that you are paid by the Mint for your trouble of attending here? - A. I don't know that I am; I have never been in the business before.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mayne). There is good pay, I believe, for attending here? - A. No, not sufficient for taking a man out of his business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am now, in this present situation, an innocent man; I never saw the evidence before in my life till he came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mayne). These things were in a paper? - A. They were in a brown paper, in the hand of the first witness.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way were they put up; were they solded up? - A. No; they were all loose together.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your son fit to be believed upon his oath? - A. I would not take his oath for three halfpence; he has taken so many false oaths.(The prisoner called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mayne). Q. Was it in the hearing of the prisoner that Cowen said he had the money of him? - A. Yes, certainly it was in the hearing of the prisoner.</p>

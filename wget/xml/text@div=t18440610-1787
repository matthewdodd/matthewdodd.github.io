                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live in John-street, Vassal-road, Brixton. The prisoner married my sister—he was out of work some time ago, and I allowed him, his wife, and children to remain in my house for about six weeks or two months, without paying any rent until he should be enabled to get work—I used to keep my money in a little box, locked up in a chest under our bed—I saw it about nine o'clock in the evening of the 14th, and there was then 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I had put it there to pay my rent with—on the 16th, I went out about half-past four to my work—I came home about eight to breakfast, about twelve to dinner, and when I came home at night the prisoner was gone—he had given me no intimation of his leaving—he did not come home that night—I sus<lb></lb>pected something might be wrong, and my wife missed the money—I directly went to the station, and gave information of the robbery—on the 2nd of May, I received a letter of which I took no notice—a friend came to me last Saturday week, and in consequence of what he said, I met the prisoner that evening at Kennington church, and gave him into custody—the person who came to me was with him.</p>

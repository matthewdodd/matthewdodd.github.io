                  </hi>. I live in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury; I am one of the Committee of American Bondholders. About half past 12 o'clock on 9th Nov. I was going to the Bank; when I came to Thread<lb></lb>needle Street there was a great crowd, and the prisoner Harrison came facing me, and I felt his hand in my waistcoat pocket, tearing off my watch from my guard—I at once seized him, and called the police—a policeman came almost immediately, to whom I gave him in charge—from the time I felt his hands at my breast I never let him go—he struggled very hard—a gentleman at the same time pointed out Hunter as being the party whom he had seen receive something from Harrison—I did not see Hunter, for he was behind Harrison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Stock Exchange. On Lord Mayor's day I was opposite Finch Lane, in Threadneedle Street; there were a great many persons—I saw the prisoners there—I felt a pressure behind me; I noticed the prosecutor making his way through the crowd—Harri<lb></lb>son came to him with his hands closed towards him, and in a second or two the prosecutor called out that he had lost his watch—I saw a great many persons behind Harrison, pressing on to his back—he held down his hands, and the prisoner Hunter came and stooped down, and took hold of each of Harrison's hands, and something passed from him, and it was handed amongst others that were there—I could not see what it was—I pointed out Hunter as the person I had seen take something from Harrison; I said that was the man that had received the watch—at that time Hunter was trying to make his way out of the crowd; I pointed him out, and he was taken.</p>

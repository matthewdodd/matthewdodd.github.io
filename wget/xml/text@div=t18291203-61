               <p>JAMES PAGE. I am a shoemaker, and work for Mr. James Taylor. On the 11th of November the prisoner came into the shop, and asked when Mr. Taylor would be at home - I said I did not know; he said "He was to look me out a pair of boots, but you can do it; "I shewed him some, and while I was engaged in the front shop with a gentleman - he went into the back shop, and I heard the case creak; the prisoner then went out, and I said, to him as he went," Will you come again?" he said, "Yes, at dinner time;" I called him back, and said, "Will you come again or no?" he said Yes, and ran off; I pursued, and took him in Glasshouse-street with these two pairs of ladies's boots in his hat.</p>

On the evening of 2nd Dec., about seven o'clock, I was in the Bethnal-green-road—in consequence of some information which I received, I went to 18, Ramsay-street, Bethnal-green; I there saw Jane Parnell in bed, on the ground-floor—she had a bandage round her neck, and a strapping on her chin—she was in a very excited state; I would not say she was intoxicated; she was calling out, "Oh, George, George, don't"—in consequence of information which I then received, I went to 34, Ann's-place, Bethnal-green—I am not able to say, of my own knowledge, whether or not the prisoners lived there—I found the female prisoner there—I asked her if her name was Edith Hopwood—she said, "Yes"—Sarah Dearn, who was with me, said, "That is the woman"—I then told her that I wanted her for cutting a woman's throat—she said, "Oh, dear! I have not been out"—I then took her into custody, and said I would bring her before the injured woman for her to identify her—she said, "Oh, I won't go; take me to the station"—I took her to the place where Parnell was lying, and told her to look at the female prisoner—she did so, and said, "That is the woman"—I then took her to the station—after I had taken her there the male prisoner came in—the witness, Henry Hogan, came in afterwards, and said to the male prisoner, "That is the man who was with her"—the male prisoner said something to that, which I believe to be a denial, but I do not recollect his words—I found no blood on either of the prisoners—I afterwards examined the place—I found no marks, or anything of that kind.</p>

               <p>and the man had masks on—I cannot form any opinion whatever as to who the man was, only by the back of him—after some struggling two of the persons left, the man and Mrs. Hopwood—I did not go up to the spot; I went in-doors—before that, and before they ran away, I saw a person on the ground; it was Mrs. Parnell—she came in to me a few minutes after the struggle—I was then in-doors, in my own room—she came running in and fell in my arms—she was almost out of her senses—she exclaimed, "Oh, Sarah, Sarah! Mrs. Hopwood has cut my throat"—her throat was cut, and her chin, and her throat was bleeding all over her—I sent for a medical man, and afterwards for the police—I knew where the prisoners lived, and I afterwards went to their house with the policeman—the officer went in, the female prisoner came down, and I pointed her out to the officer, who took her into custody—he took her to my house, and into the room where the wounded woman was lying.</p>

               <p>the weavers use in dividing their silk in making their velvet—they have a very sharp instrument, which is sometimes protected <hi rend="italic">so</hi> that it cannot cut beyond a certain depth—I know that weavers have a cutting instrument that is protected so that it will only do a certain quantity of mischief; but it is not an instrument that will allow of three incisions in one place—it must have been used three times if that was the instrument that was used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice the position of the necklace that you took off with reference to these wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I hardly know how to answer that question, because the wound being directly across the throat the necklace would hang directly across the throat too, and the neck<lb></lb>lace was as near as possible over the wound at the time I saw it—I believe that the necklace had protected the throat <hi rend="italic">to</hi> a certain extent—it was a red coral necklace, with small beads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you speak to her when you first saw her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was not in a fit state to be spoken to, for she was insensible at the time I Saw her; she appeared <hi rend="italic">to</hi> be so to me—I dressed the wounds—I have stated before that there was no danger from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A person might of course inflict such a wound themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, because the depth of the incision was on the right side, unless a person was left-handed, and then they might do so—that is not the only reason I can give; it is also from the appearance of the wound at the time, which it is almost impossible to describe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said before that it was impossible for you to say how the wound was inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With what instrument it was inflicted; most decidedly I cannot say that at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would have very little doubt, from the character of the wound, that it probably was not with a razor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not, nor with a sharp knife—the wound was not of that character—had it been with a razor the wound must have been a great deal deeper, and of a different appearance altogether; it was either with one of the instruments which weavers use, or with a three-pronged fork, which, if the edges had been very much sharpened, would have made a similar kind of thing—I am merely giving that as a suggestion, but I do not know any instru<lb></lb>ment that would account for the parellelness of the lines I saw—the three lanoets of a cupping instrument would have done it—that would be the kind of instrument that would do it—that is what I mean to describe—they were clean incisions, not jagged.</p>

               <p>informed, Mr. Tomlin is a master-bargeman—I bad left work on 2nd Dec, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, and I went down to a turning at the corner of Abbey-street; there I waited till between six and seven, and I saw a male and female standing opposite a gateway, looking at a house opposite the gateway; and then I saw the female, the <hi rend="italic">prosecutor,</hi> come out of the house, and go into the gate—as soon as they saw her come out they <hi rend="italic">sheered</hi> on one side, and a few minutes afterwards the prosecutor came down the gateway, and went down the first turning on the right—before they got about six yards down they both made a run, and made a sudden stop at the corner of the turning—I saw the prisoners <hi rend="italic">go</hi> down the turning, but I did not see any more of them till I saw them at their own door—I saw nothing of the affair at all—it was down Ramsay-street that I saw them follow the woman—I know the two persons, but not by name—it was that male and female (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the prisoners</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had they masks on at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They did not have masks on them when I saw them—it was between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not pressed over and over again as to whether you worked for Mr. Tomlin, and did not you swear you did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I swore I worked for a man that worked for Mr. Tomlin; that was what I stated before—I live in Ball-court, Playhouse-yard, No. 22—I was asked about that before—I do not swear there are twenty-two houses in the court, because I do not know how many houses there are in the court—I never looked at the number on the door—my landlord says it is No. 22—I do not know that two persons have been to Ball-court to inquire after me; yes, I heard it at the police-court—I never looked at the number on the door—I have heard it called No. 22 by my own parents—my parents live there—my step-father's name is Clark—my deposition was read over to me, and I was asked if it was correct—this is my mark.</p>

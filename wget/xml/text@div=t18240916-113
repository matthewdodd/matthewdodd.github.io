               <p>SARAH BURFORD. I am nursery-maid at Mr. Grisewood's, of Finchley. The prisoner worked there as <rs id="t18240916-113-deflabel624" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

I was at Barnet-fair last Tuesday week, and saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160042"></xptr>him there with a handkerchief on his neck, which I could swear to - we named it to mistress next morning. I got a constable, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This gentleman has a family of children - A. Yes - I have seen them with handkerchiefs in the house and garden; they might drop them about, and they be picked up afterwards; we wash our own linen, and it is in my care.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took up the prisoner in a building near the Green Man, public-house, Finchley-common; he was on a scaffolding, and had the handkerchief on his neck - I took it off, and saw G. G. on it - he did not say how he came by it. Finchley is about five miles from Barnet.</p>
               <p>JAMES CONWAY. I went with Frost; when Frost called me to assist him, the prisoner knocked me down in the road, and swore he would not be handled by any man - the handkerchief was then taken by Frost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not give him a twist or a wrench to make him retaliate - A. No. He did not strike Frost. I have laid informations before Dr. Owen and Sir J. Willis, as a common informer; they were done at their request.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that they were always at their desire - A. Yes, at all times - to the best of my belief.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner strike you - A. No; he said he would not be handled by any mortal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not resist you - A. No, but Conway attempted to take hold of him, and then he said he would not be handled; he showed no violence till he was taken hold of: I used no violence to him. I saw Conway fall, but I do not know whether he was knocked or pushed down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the handkerchief, and had worn it several times by the house - if I had known to whom it belonged I should have returned it.</p>

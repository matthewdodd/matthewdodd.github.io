               <p>When did you see this horse unhurt? - About eight at night before, on Wednesday the 25th, I saw him at ten the next day, with his side cut, so that you could almost see his guts.</p>

               <p>What is it? - Fear of hell fire.</p>
               <p>Then mind you speak nothing but the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100060"></xptr> truth? - I had been at market that morning the 26th of June, I had got him out of the waggon and was going to put him up.</p>
               <p>Why did not you put him up? - Going along Russel-street, just by the cross-way, about five in he morning, I met three men they were coming on the cross-way, and this prisoner pulled a knife out of his pocket he struck at the first horse, which he missed, and then cut the second horse in the flank; I never spoke a word to him, nor he to me, nor to any of them; I saw him pull the knife out of his pocket and run towards the horse and cut him; it was quite light, I saw two men and I called them, and I told them of it, and one of them brought the horse back to the market, and the other went with me and took the prisoner, we took him by the corner of the piazza, there was a jack-ass boy and a lamplighter quarrelling and fighting, he run away, and we lost sight of him for a little bit, but I soon saw him again, I was sure he was the same man, I observed him before he came up to the horse, he was dressed in black cloaths, and a pair of leather breeches, we took him almost directly after the knife was found upon him, I was not lame then, the horse has got over it now, thank God, it was a black gelding, but his coat was rather turned dark brown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The knife was drawn in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before he came up to the horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He had no quarrel with you, or any body belonging to the horses? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he know who your master was? - No, I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>The horse is very well now? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was coming out of Covent-garden, the 26th of June in the morning, about a quarter before five, or five o'clock; coming along, seeing the prisoner cross the way from where the coaches were, I believe it to be Russel-street, the sun arising, I saw a knife in his hand, and glittering by the sun shine, I saw him go up to the second horse and make a push at him with a knife, the boy directly cried, he has killed my horse, he run away from the horses and went into a croud of people that were fighting, I sprung the man, I kept my eyes on him, I never lost sight of him, directly a gardener said, I shall take care of you, that you shall go before a magistrate, to give evidence against that man, says I, he is a very cruel fellow.</p>

               <p>Court. Did he appear to be drunk? - I really cannot say that he was quite sober, he was but a little in liquor, or he might be sober I cannot say, I saw him taken, he was dressed in a black coat or dark grey; I am sure it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What arose you so soon that morning? - I went to buy some herbs in the market, six bunches of peppermint and six bunches of balm to make tea of; I had them under my arm at the time.</p>
               <p>Whoever the person was, he was in black? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he had any quarrel with any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the horses obstruct his way? - He went across the way to the horses with a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>He was drunk? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did he know the owner of the horses, or the boy? - Not that I know of, he was going along quietly as I thought, and he went up to the horses and stabbed the second horse; he crossed the foot way, it was not his nearest way.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be in liquor? - I cannot say, I think he must be quite reasonable to cross the way and go up to the horse and stab him.</p>

               <p>You that deal in horses, you that are hackney men and kept him as a coachman, could have observed his tenderness to his horses in general? - He always used my horses well, to think that ever that lad would be guilty of such a cruel affair as this, he is so very tender over horses, I am sure if he was in his sober senses, he never would have attempted such a thing.</p>

               <p>I am a peruke maker, I have known the prisoner from his infancy, I should think from my knowledge of him that he was far from any cut of inhumanity; was he in his senses, I would rather think him more effeminate than cruel; I never heard of any cruel act of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen: The crime of which the prisoner is charged, is a capital offence, you will judge in the first place, whether he is the man that committed it, and in the next place, whether he did it wilfully and maliciously: There seems to be no doubt about his being the man.</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Baron HOTHAM.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood Council for the prisoner, Moved the Court on the Tuesday following, in arrest of judgment, the act saying, whoever shall wound any cattle, not whoever shall wound any horse, mare, or gelding, under which description persons guilty of offences against horses, are always discribed, for that act of parliament states, that whoever shall destroy any number of horses, mares, or geldings, shall be ousted of his clergy, which was amended by the second and third of Elizabeth, whereby it is declared that any person feloniously stealing one horse, mare, or gelding, shall be put from his clergy, in the same manner as if he had stolen more; now the words are in this statute, unlawfully and maliciously, shall kill, maim, or wound any cattle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron HOTHAM. I have found a note of a case of the King and Batty, tried by Mr. Justice Blackstone, at Abington assizes,</p>
               <p>"and it was afterwards resolved by</p>
               <p>"all the Judges, that horses or cattle within</p>
               <p>"this act, which is the thing set out as an</p>

               <p>"second, which makes killing horses a</p>

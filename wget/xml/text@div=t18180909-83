On the 9th of July about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house, and asked for a quartern and a half of gin, which came to 6d; he gave me a 1l. bank note, I asked him his name and address? he said his name was Johnson, and that he lived in Hare-court, Aldersgate-street. It struck me that the note was bad, by his coming so far, and passing several other public-houses before he came to mine; there are several between mine and Hare-court. I wrote his name and address on the note in his presence(looking at it)-this is the note he gave me. I gave him 19s. 6d. in silver. Mr. Cornish was in the next room. Before the prisoner went out I communicated my suspicions to him, leaving the prisoner in the shop. I showed Mr. Cornish the note, I was five or ten minutes before I returned to him, I put the name on the note before I left him; I gave him the change after I returned from Cornish. I requested Cornish to follow him, which he did, and brought him back about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I asked him what he had done with the silver, he said it did not matter to me what he had done with it. I told him it did matter, as it was my money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you took the note to Cornish he returned it to you, you came and said you could not give change. When I said I could not have the gin, you returned to Cornish, and then sent your daughter out for change - A. I only went into the room to Cornish once, and returned in five minutes, I sent my daughter out for change while I was with Cornish, I returned and gave the prisoner the change; I never said I could not give change; when I first took it, I said, "I was afraid I could not," and then showed the note to Cornish - He said he thought it a good one, I said I thought it was not; he advised me to take it. I sent my daughter for change, I went out of the private door myself, and gave her the change to bring in. The note was never out of my possession. I did not want change.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for doing that - A. I thought it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>JOHN CORNISH. I am a butcher, and live in St. George's-market. While I was in Mrs. Taylor's house, the prisoner came in-Mrs. Taylor requested me to look at the note; I said I would follow him - I went out and saw him - I did not see the bottle with him. He went into Aldersgate-street, and went up to a man who stood at the corner of Hare-court; both went down the court together. I followed him; when they got to about the middle of the court, his companion looked round at me-they then quickened their pace. I was within ten yards of them, and asked a woman if that was Hare-court, his companion again looked round. They went out of the court into another alley on the right, and there I saw the prisoner give some silver out of his hand into the man's hand, it appeared about 16s. I went up to the prisoner and told him I wished to know something about the note that he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090038"></xptr>passed; his companion walked a little way, and then ran. The prisoner said, "Search me." I then repeated my question; he again said, "Search me." I told him he should go back with me, he refused. I took hold of him, we had a scuffle and I tore his coat. He then said, "You have torn my coat, I will go back with you; but do not handle me." When we got to Mrs. Taylor's, I said here is the man; I gave him in charge of a man while I went to look for the other man. I returned and searched him, but found nothing particular on him.</p>

On the 11th of May, the prisoner came to my shop and bought a piece of cheese, which came to 2s. 8d. or 3s. 8d.; he paid me a 1l. bank note. I asked his name and address, he said, "Chapel, No.22, Mitchel-street, Brick-lane;" which I wrote on the back of the note in his presence (looking at it), this is the note. I have no doubt of his being the person. I did not know him before.</p>

The day that I took the note, I went to the address and saw the name of Chapel on the door, and was satisfied.</p>

            . I am clerk to the magistrates at Guildhall. I was present when the prisoner was examined about the note uttered to Mrs. Taylor. I wrote his examination down, he did not sign it - He was told he need not say any thing to commit himself. I read what passed over to him at the second examination. I cannot say whether the first examination was read over to him on the first day (reads). "1st examination, Thursday, 9th of June. The prisoner admitted that he went to buy the gin, and said he took the note last Friday of a man named Johnson; he did not known him, but he said he lived in Hare-court. He denied speaking to any body after he left Taylor's. On being asked where he lived, he said he lived no where at present, but slept last night in Drury-lane." On the 13th of July, he was examined again, Taylor and Cornish were examined (reads)."Prisoner admits that he had the bottle, and it was in his bosom at the time he was taken. He does not deny having the note, but did not know it was bad. He does not know Johnson, but he took it of him in Smithfield-market." King was then examined on that day (reads)."Prisoner said he does not know him at all, he is mistaken; he never wore a frock-coat in his life; that he was at work mending harness on Whit Monday, and then lived with his father, who is an aged man, but he did not wish to tell where, lest it should come to his ears."</p>

I went into two wine-vaults with him, when he tendered the note; he went into another in Aldersgate-street, and came out laughing and said it was droll that he could not get change. He sent me to get change at the prosecutrix's; he said he did not like to go in as he owed her a score, gave me the bottle and told me to get a quartern and half of gin, and put my own address on it, I refused - He told me to put his, which I did. The prosecutrix took the note to the gentleman, I observed him hold it up to look at it; she brought it to me and said she could not change it. I said I could not have the gin, she returned to the gentleman, and sent her daughter for change-who returned without it; her mother sent her again, she brought it. When I came out I observed Johnson on the opposite side, he beckoned to me, I went to the corner and offered him the buttle and change - He told me to wait there till he returned; the man came and took me.

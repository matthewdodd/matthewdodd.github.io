I am barman at the Duke's Head, Norton Folgate—about half-past 7, on the night of 16th July, the prisoner came in there with a woman; an old man came in first—the prisoner said to him, "What are you going to stand for the old girl and me; will you stand some port wine?"—the old man said, "You must drink the same as I have"—that was spruce, and some spruce and hot water was ordered, and paid for—the old man then left, and the prisoner asked for a bottle of ginger beer—he produced a sovereign, and I put the change on the counter—a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, a florin, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was just going to put the sovereign in the till when the prisoner said, "This is not Watt's ginger beer; I like Watt's; give me back my sovereign"—I gave it him back, and he and the female walked out—I did not see him touch the change—I picked it up, and found the half-sovereign was counterfeit—it was not the one I had given him—I ran after the prisoner—he was walking down White Lion-street—he turned round, saw me, and ran away, leaving the female—she turned up a court, and I captured her—another young man ran after the prisoner and caught him in a cab.</p>

I am a hackney carriage attendant at the stand, High-street, Shoreditch—on the evening of 16th July, the prisoner walked up, got into a cab, and said to the cabman, "Strand, quick"—the last witness then came up, and said that he wanted him—the prisoner wanted to get out of the other side of the cab—we followed him up Shoreditch and secured him.</p>

On the 20th of April, I had been with a friend, I was going back to the coffee house; being a stranger to the place, I enquired the way of the prisoner, she said she would shew me, and took me into several gin shops, to get me a lodging; she said they were gone to bed where I was going; she told me I had better go with her; she took me up stairs in a yard; I pulled off my coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. I was not tipsey, I was what you call comfortable, I knew what I was about. She blew the candle out and left me in the room; she took my coat, waistcoat, braces, and neckcloth; the people told me I had better not go out; I told them if I was a countryman, I was afraid of no man; I unbuttoned the door and jumped out; I ran into the next house, the watchman was sitting there, I called him to my assistance.</p>

               <p>Q. You were in a house. - A. I went in for a light; he told me he had been robbed; I went after the girl, I found her sitting at the bottom of the street with the salop woman, with the things in her apron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This gentleman went up stairs with me, I was never in such a place before; I insisted upon his not taking his clothes off, as I did not know who was in the room; he would take them off, and insisted of me taking care of them; I said you had better put them under your head; there was but a little bit of candle, I said I will go and get a candle, I put them in my lap, I could not get a candle; the salop woman said I have got a candle at home; I sat down at the door with her, while the candle was fetched. The gentleman and the watchman came up, they said I had robbed him of his things; I did not intend to robbed him of his thing.</p>

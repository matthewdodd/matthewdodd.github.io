                  </hi>. I am an attorney, I have had business in which the prisoner was concerned—I think I sued him twice for breach of contract, and twice for recovery of a debt; he was a horsedealer near Rugby—I kept my horse, which I drove myself, at Osborne's in Gray's Inn-lane—I very often saw the prisoner there—I knew him to frequent that place—I never had any quarrel or difference with him; in the latter part of April, or the beginning of May last, I had instructions to sue him for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at the instigation of Messrs. Tattersalls'—I waited till I saw him, before I issued process against him—I saw him at Osborne's—he at first said, Mr. Tattersall said he would not pay the debt, because it was a hone which turned out to be a roarer—I saw him again, and he promised to pay in about a fortnight—I waited till the time he mentioned and long after, till 21st June—when I issued the writ, I kept it, I did not send it to Rugby—I met the prisoner on 27th June, at Osborne's—I said I had waited all that time, and had been at last compelled to issue the writ, and I would not send it down if he would accept service of it in London, which he agreed to—on the afternoon of the same day I gave him the writ, and saw nothing more of him till 13th July—he did not appear to the writ, and judgment was obtained on 2nd Aug.; I saw him some time after—execution was issued, but was not sent</p>

               <p>down—I do not know whether I saw him until after I had ascertained that he had filed his petition—at the time 1 served him with the writ I said, "To show you I do not wish to put you to expense, pay it now without the expense of the writ, and I will take it"—he filed his petition under the Protection Act—I was instructed to oppose it by Mr. Phillips—the amount of his debt was I think 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 3rd Nov., while these proceedings were contemplating, I was at Osborne's in conversation with Mr. Banks, the junior partner in Mr. Osborne's firm, in the yard close to my horse; my servant was holding my horse, which was in my gig—I went into the count<lb></lb>ing-house to speak to Mr. Banks—I was in the middle counting-house, and Banks and the defendant in the inner one; there are three—the moment I entered, the defendant said, "Mr. Tawney, you have served Banks with a subpoena"—I had not done so, and told him so—he said he was indebted to me for all the opposition—I told him he was wrong, that he would find he was opposed by other persons than my clients—he offered to lay me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would not be opposed by any party but me—I told him I did not lay wagers at all—he said he was quite satisfied there would be nobody but me—I said he was quite wrong, and he would be opposed by other persons, and he insisted on knowing for whom I was going to oppose—I said, "That is my business"—he said, "If I had given you such an answer, you would have said it was impertinent"—I said, "Very well then, you must charge me with impertinence"—he had asked the question in a very authoritative tone—that was all the conversation that passed—he passed through the inner counting-house towards the yard—after I supposed him gone, I went into the outer counting-house to speak to Mr. Banks, and there I saw the prisoner standing with these two hunting-whips in his hands (<hi rend="italic">produced, one had an iron hammer for the handle</hi>)—he held the cane-handled one towards me, and said, "Take that"—I said, "Why am I to take it?"—he said, "You take it"—I said, "I shall do nothing of the kind"—he walked out of the counting-house with the iron-handled whip in his hand, and walked a few yards from my gig which was standing at the door—I saw him wrap the thong round his hand, so as to make it quite tight—the lash was twisted round his hand—I waited some time by the door—I could hardly believe his assaulting me is my state of health, and I waited some minutes to give him time to reflect—I then proceeded towards my gig, and as I was about to step into it, I felt several blows on my back and shoulders from behind—I had nothing is my hand to defend myself with—after he had struck me several times, I turned round and put my hands up to my head—Mr. Banks came, caught him round his waist, pulled him away, and said, "Good God! Harvey are you mad"—the prisoner dashed Mr. Banks away, as if he had been a child—he seemed very much out of breath, and leaned against the front of the counting-house with the whip in his hand—I said, "You will have to account for this"—he said, "Yes, I know I shall have to pay for it, and I am d—d if I do not give it you; you accused me of stealing your pencil-case"—I said, "I never accused you, or thought of such a thing"—I got into my gig, and when I was in, he gave me a tremendous blow on the back—I staggered on, and he kept beating me all the time with the same weapon—I did not see anybody take him away again, he was behind me—I was obliged to stand up, as I am now—I was in great pain in sitting down, and as soon as I had started my horse I felt a blow on my head which stunned me—the stunning was momentary, and 1 felt him beating at my head—the reins got from me, and the horse ran out of the yard—the prisoner pursued me quite into the King's-road—my groom is quite a little boy—I</p>

               <p>saw the defendant going down the yard—I sent the boy for a policeman, but before the policeman arrived he had escaped—I went home—I was not attended by a medical man that day—I got very bad at night—I was very sore from the bruises, but did not feel it affect me internally till night, when I thought I should have died—I sent for my surgeon—I am labouring under a disease of the heart—the defendant knew that; he had frequently conversed with me about it—I am still suffering dreadfully under the effects of this outrage—my arm is in a sling—that is from a blow I got when in my gig, in turning round to save my head.</p>

I shall be much obliged if you will give this letter to Phillips; this is a letter which he asked me to write"—I said I was going another way—I had never said anything more about the pencil-case before he struck me—I did not go before any Magistrate, I was too ill to attempt it—I was at the Insolvent Court afterwards for a whole day, but that would not excite me like this—I went behind his back before the Grand Jury—my medical man told me I must be as calm as possible—the prisoner disputed the account at Tattersall's altogether—he never offered me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

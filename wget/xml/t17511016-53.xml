I was at Gosport at the time the horse was lost; it was a cart horse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160029"></xptr> worth 6 l. or upwards; he is now at the White Lion at Islington; I have seen him there. I went to the prisoner in Bridewell, who told me he never did such a thing before, and that he was out of his senses. I had trusted him with my horses and other things; he never wronged me before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pullin. I met a man that had but an indifferent character with the prisoner, who was leading this horse; the other man asked me if I would buy the horse; said I, what do you ask for him? the prisoner said, seven guineas. I saw the horse had but two shoes; I bid him three, if he could find me a sufficient voucher; he said the horse was his own; I gave him sixpence earnest: then I said, I will not deceive you, I believe the horse to be stolen, and if you have more in your gang tell the truth, and I'll be favourable to you; he said he came honestly by the horse. I delivered the horse to the hostler (this was at Islington) and went to Justice Chamberlain with the prisoner; he seemed to be an ignorant fellow; we got him some victuals and drink. I believe he was half starved, he had but a halfpenny in his pocket; then he said he took the horse out of Mr. Thomas's field himself; that his master owed him some money, and that he did it for want, saying, sometimes his master would pay him two shillings, but never pay him all that was due, and what he took would hardly keep him alive.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was it?</p>
               <p>Pullin. It was a black gelding, with a star in his forehead. He is now at the White Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thomas. Is your horse which you lost such as this witness describes?</p>
               <p>Thomas. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you owe the prisoner any thing?</p>
               <p>Thomas. To the best of my knowledge, I do not owe him one farthing; as to making any particular reckoning I could not, he owed too many little scores up and down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was ignorant of what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is he out of his senses at time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. To me he appears as if he was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a joiner. I and the other prosecutors were at work at some houses, at East Ham—on Christmas Eve I left, and went home to spend the Sunday—we left our tools in the house where we were at work; we left at 4 o'clock—the tools were left under a desk, in a small office in the house where we were at work—there is a lock on the office door, but it was not locked—we returned to work on Wednesday, 28th Dec, and the tools were gone—some of these tools produced are mine—they were shown to me before the Magistrate; I knew them again—my name is on my tools—my tools and the tools of the other men were all in the basket together, when they were shown me before the Magistrate.</p>

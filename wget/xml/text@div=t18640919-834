                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Pinkerton—the prisoner was at one time in my service, managing my business—my husband received some imprisonment during that time—the prisoner has from time to time asked me for money, and frequently annoyed me—I did not give it him—he was paid for his services while managing my business—he has made use of threats on many occasions—on 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August, I had been collecting rents as usual, and as I was coming down Cow-cross-street I saw the prisoner—he spoke to me—I asked how he was getting on—he said he was doing very badly; he had no work, and he asked me for money—I said No, I should give him none; I had to work hard, and he must do the same—he said, "I will knock the front of your b——skull in"—I was trying to escape from him, but before I could do so, he came on my left hand side and struck me with a brick on the bead—he struck me several times before any assistance came—I became insensible—I was taken to the hospital, and continued a week an out patient.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How many years have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four<lb></lb>teen or fifteen years—my husband was tried here about eight years ago—I afterwards put you in a shop to manage it—I bought everything—I did not pay the rent; you did—it was next door to mine—I had nothing to do with it after you got possession of it; you took good care of that, to do me out of the money I had laid out on it—after my husband came out of prison he accused me of being too intimate with you, from your assertion; the people in the neighbourhood did not tell him so—you wrote a letter to me attempting to extort money—I did not think it worth while to vindicate myself from the charges you brought against me—I had business dealings with Mr. Coward, of Guildhall-chambers, and you sent him an anonymous letter containing the same charges—I took no proceedings to vindicate my<lb></lb>self—I can't remember what the charges were; it might have been the crime of abortion—I never wrote any letters to you, or appointed to meet you—you have occasionally met me, and have many times tried to extort</p>

LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any truth in the insinuation that you procured abortion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; or in the assertion that I ever had criminal intercourse with the prisoner—I never heard anything of it till he was out of the business—he has ceased to manage that business for seven years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there on the evening of 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August—she had a small scalp wound just above the forehead; just below it was a severe bruise, with considerable extravasation of blood underneath the skin, like-wise a black eye—she remained an out-patient till Saturday, 27th, when I found her much worse—she had symptoms of inflammation of the mem<lb></lb>branes of the brain coming on—she remained an in-patient for a week; she then got much better, and was discharged, and again became an out-patient—she is much better, but still remains in a very weak state—the inflam<lb></lb>mation was caused by the wounds—they were such wounds as might have been inflicted with a brick-bat, or some blunt instrument—the wounds them-selves were not severe—if remedies had not been promptly applied the inflammation might have been fatal—the wounds were slight, and nearly healed when the inflammation set in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you apprehend any danger at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not till five days after—the inflammation would not be caused by excitement.</p>

I took the prisoner—I told him the nature of the charge—he said he would do it again; he would do for her; he did not care if he got six years for it; he should have satisfaction—I saw the prosecutrix before she was taken to the hospital—she was bleeding very much from the head.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Who gave me into your custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two young women had got hold of you by the collar—I received the brick from a witness named Rickman, who is absent—the prosecutrix appeared stupified—she came to the station and charged you—she did not hesitate about it—I don't remember her saying she would be too clever for you in the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that the prosecutrix was desirous of getting him out of the way; that he only struck her with a small piece of brick, not the large piece produced.</hi>

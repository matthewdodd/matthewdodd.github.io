            . The prisoner came into our shop, and bought a pair of stockings for 1 s. 6 d. at about four o'clock on Thursday the 5th of April: she went away, and came again about six o'clock; she then agreed for a pair of white worsted stockings, and another pair; when she came to pay for them, she said, she had not money enough by 7 d. she had a little boy with her; she went out; I looked round, and missed half a dozen pair out of the window; they were tied up in a brown paper, which had my husband's mark upon it.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker. I live in Petty-France. I have two pair of stockings, which I took in of the prisoner the 5th of April, between seven and eight o'clock; she told me they were a customer's of mine,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250037"></xptr> that did not chuse to come themselves, and they must be put in in her name, for she was to fetch them out: they are new; they have no mark upon them; but I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who brought them.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Layton. I cannot swear to them: I missed two pair of the same sort.</p>
               <p>To Skinner. Do you know who these stockings were delivered to in Mr. Warmsley's shop? - No: there were five or six people in the shop.</p>
               <p>To Layton. Who did you get the stockings from? - Justice Durden: I believe he had them from the woman, but not in my presence.</p>

               <p>I bought the stockings of a man that sells them in the street.</p>

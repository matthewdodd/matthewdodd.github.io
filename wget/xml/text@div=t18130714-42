            , about one in the day; he was then alive. I attended him until he died. On the Tuesday morning following he died. The 26th was Saturday; the Tuesday was the 29th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after his death open his body - A. I did not. I think his death arose from a fever which always attends a mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that mortification occasioned by any wound - A. There was a wound on the leg.</p>

               <p>Q. Had that wound in your judgment produced the mortification - A. I should conceive that the wound was of such a situation that without some other cause there would not have been a mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. Would there have been a mortification if there had not been a wound - A. I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you impute to that wound upon the leg that the mortification that arised from that wound was from the diseased state of the body - A. I compute it entirely arised from the diseased state of the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body in that state that a mortification would have come on if there had been a wound - A. I think if his body had not been in that state there would have come no mortification from that wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his state of body such that without any blow there would have been a probability of a mortification - A. I am not acquainted with any circumstance likely to produce mortification without a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which part of the leg was it - A. Nearly between the ankle, and the knee rather on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge by what means that wound was produced - A. I should imagine by the blunt edge of a hard body: the kick of a shoe might produce it.</p>

            . Q. Did you see an affray between Roberts and Cope - A. On Tuesday evening, the 22nd of last month, I saw the deceased, Cope, strike the prisoner, Roberts, when Roberts had a child in his arms. The deceased struck him violently on the nose; his nose bled profusely. The prisoner put the child down, and struck the deceased with his fist. I then saw the prisoner take the deceased by his collar, and he dragged him into the street. I saw no more.</p>

            . I saw the affray between Roberts and Cope. I saw the prisoner and the deceased struggling in the rood for the space of half a minute, they were then parted by a woman. I saw them both endeavouring to throw one another down. I cannot say whether Roberts kicked Cope or not.</p>

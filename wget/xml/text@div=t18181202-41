            . I am the wife of last witness. I went out at half-past nine in the morning, locked the door, and all the property was then safe. Most of it was in a chest which had the key left in it; the things were worth 30 l. My husband came home first, and discovered the robbery. I have seen nothing since, except a handkerchief, which I found in a cradle in the prisoner Herbert's room, where the officer took him. The prisoner, Cunningham's, father lived in the room over me, he used to come to see him often. The morning we were robbed, Cunningham passed three or four times, while I was in the cellar, he was in the house, and asked me what o'clock it was. He passed me at the time I was locking my door. When he asked the time, I told him it was nine; he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am too late." Instead of going to work he went up stairs and staid with his father. The next day he absconded - He afterward surrendered himself.</p>

            . I live in Whitecross-street, Moorfields. On the 27th October I was coming out of Lion-court, Grubb-street, about five o'clock in the afternoon, it was near Nowland's house. I saw Herbert pass me with a great quantity of men and women's clothes hanging loose on his arm. He came in a direction from the prosecutor's. I followed him into Chiswell-street, I missed him for a moment, and caught sight of him again; Cunningham was then with him, helping him up with the clothes. I said to Cunningham, how careless that man has got the clothes, he said, Yes, and looked confused. I said, It is Mr. Cunningham, he said, Yes. Herbert crossed over, and endeavoured to put the things up himself. I said again, he is carrying them very careless; Cunningham said, he is just at home. Cunningham walked on by my side, I turned round and missed him, he was stooping down rubbing his legs. Herbert went up Whitecross-street. Cunningham staid and watched me, to see where I was going. I stood against a post to see if he followed Herbert, which he did; he kept a little distance behind him. I lost them in Whitecross-street, I saw the glimpse of a red cloak among the things. I also saw a piece of blue chequered cotton, and the knees of a pair of breeches among the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You first saw Cunningham in Chiswell-street - A. Yes, helping the man up with the things. I did not know the prosecutrix before. Cunningham lodged with my sister-in-law.</p>

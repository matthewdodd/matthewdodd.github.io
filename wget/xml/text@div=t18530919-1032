                  </hi>. I live at Plumstead-terrace, Kent. On 26th Aug., between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I was in a coffee-shop, in Wellington-street, Woolwich, in company with some sergeants of Artillery, taking coffee—the prisoner was not in our company at all; he was not in the same room as we were—I and one of the sergeants of Artillery had a discussion about English and Scotch; I said that there were as good Englishmen as Scotchmen; upon which the sergeant struck his hand on the table—my wife was there, and, in consequence of what passed between the sergeant and me, I and my wife went down stairs, and went out at the door—I had not got a yard from the door when I was struck right above the eye with a stick or umbrella, and knocked down—I called out, "They have knocked my eye out"—I became insensible for some time—I beard my wife moaning and crying—I went to Guy's Hospital, and am still an out patient—I had not spoken to the person who struck me—I do not know who struck me.</p>

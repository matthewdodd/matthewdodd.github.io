                  </hi>. I live in Jamaica-terrace—the prisoner was a plumber in my service. On Monday, the 25th of April, I sent him to do a job for me at the Bull Head Dock, on board the <hi rend="italic">Bathurst</hi>—he went on with the job till Friday, the 29th—about 18lbs. of solder was required to do the work—on Friday, the 29th, I went to the work, and found a much greater quantity of solder had been taken away from my premises than had been used—(I had seen him take away 1qr. 9Ibs. in the first instance)—I examined the pot, to see what was left in it, and found a great deal less than I imagined there ought to have been—there was scarcely sufficient left to make a joint with—I saw the prisoner's bag lying close by, and found in it three ladle cakes of solder—I immediately took up my ladle, tried the ladle cakes in it, and it fixed exactly, so that I had every reason to presume that the solder was mine—it had no right there—I left a person to watch the bag, and went outside, intending to intercept the prisoner as he left the premises—in about half-an-hour he came out, with<lb></lb>out his bag, and I allowed him to pass—I then went, examined the bag, and the solder was gone—I immediately followed the prisoner, but he had got too far a-head of me—about ten o'clock next morning my book-keeper called, and told me something; in consequence of which I took a police<lb></lb>man with me down to the job—the prisoner had gone to the ship—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him there, and charged him with stealing the solder—he said it was all used in the job—I weighed the remainder, and found 21lbs, short—I then asked him what he had done with the three ladle cakes that were in his bag the night before—he said he had left them in the poter's lodge—I said, "What, in your bag?"—he said, I said, "Where did you find your bag this morning?"—he said, "In the porter's lodge"—I said,</p>

            (to Slater) What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Slater. On Saturday Night last, about an Hour before dark, the Prisoner took two Books off of my Stand; one is call'd Milton's Paradice Lost, the other, a Poem in 12 Books, call

             Collection of Thoughts, Moral and Divine.</p>
               <p>Q. When she took them, how far did she go with them?</p>
               <p>Slater. She went away with a Purpose to carry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260013"></xptr> them off, for she saw nobody there. I had that very Day lost another of these Books .</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the Stand was you?</p>
               <p>Slater. One or two Doors from it. She met me with the Book under her Cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon that?</p>
               <p>Slater. My Lord, I stopp'd her. I charg'd her with having my Goods. She shuffled, and ask'd what I had to do with her. And I caught these two Books from her, and I got her into a House .</p>
               <p>Q. And what had she to say for herself?</p>
               <p>Slater. That she had done nothing amiss, and if she had, she desir'd to answer for it. And demalt I would not use her ill, and the like. She was very bold in her Expressions. I took her before the Justice; the Justice ask'd her if she had nothing else to live upon but this; she answer'd, she had two Children, and was oblig'd to follow this Employment to maintain them .</p>

            (to the Prisoner) Would you ask him any Questions? He says he saw you take these two Books from the Stand in Holborn. That he met you coming up towards him. He took them from you, and you confess'd you was forced to do so. Now make your Defence .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I was just going from the Stall and I saw a Gentleman with a Plaid Morning Gown; and I ask'd him where the Gentleman was that belong'd to the Books. I had one Book in one Hand and another in the other ; and had a Design to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you want to buy the se Books for?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. To read.</p>
               <p>The Court put the Prisoner to read Milton, but she did it but very indifferently. She said she was a poor Woman , and could read Welsh better than English.</p>

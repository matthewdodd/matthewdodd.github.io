He worked at the fellmonger's; this was on Easter Tuesday - there were five or six persons in the house - I cannot tell who was there when I was asleep; I was drunk- I had seen my watch an hour before; I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KNOX. I was in the public-house. The prosecutor was very drunk, and fell asleep; the prisoner took hold of him, and shook him; he appeared to do all he could to awake him, and then he drew something from his pocket, but I could not see what - the prisoner could walk.</p>

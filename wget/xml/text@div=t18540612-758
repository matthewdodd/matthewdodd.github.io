This signature, "Edward Clay," in this book, is in the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing—he has been in my service about two years; it was his duty to purchase goods—he had no authority to purchase any goods, which were not required in our establishment—he ought to write orders for goods in a proper order book; this is the order book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I think I engaged him myself—lie ought to sign his name here, under our name, which is printed, and copy the order on the counterparts; the order would then be torn out, leaving the counterparts—there were strict orders given to him—when he had given an order and the goods came in, it was his duty to mark off the invoice, and sign his initials to it as having received them—we did not require any drill on 18th March; I did not give him authority to order any from Hewitson and Co., nor did I see any—if any came I might see it, but I do not say that I should—he did not bring the order book, showing me any such entry—I never saw this invoice for it, until he was in custody—it was his duty to take this other order book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), into the City with him—there is no order in it of any drill having been obtained of Messrs. Hewitson on our behalf—the first intimation I had of it was when the statement came in from Hewitson, about the end of April—that was after the prisoner was discharged—I did not give the prisoner instruc<lb></lb>tions to order any lawn from Messrs. Crawford and Lindsay, nor did we receive any lawn from them that I am aware of; I have looked through the order book, and do not see their name—no invoice was brought to me by the prisoner respecting it—I did not see the invoice of it, till the pri<lb></lb>soner was in custody—he had authority to order some goods, but none of these things (<hi rend="italic">The umbrellas and parasol</hi>)—I did not see the invoice of these, till after he was in custody—he had authority to order the shirting, and I had instructed him to get me a pair of curtains, but the other things he had no authority to order—I recollect the curtains being sent, but not the shirting; I do not see any order for them in the order book—he left our</p>

               <p>the prisoner hag got stockinge for me; I have not shared the lots with him—on one occasion he got some stockings for me, and what I did not keep he was instructed to return, but he said he would keep them for himself, and he charged himself with them in the books—I do not think that that was a man of the name of Croxton—I know that there were some stockings which ought to have been returned to Sturt's, which were not returned, and I believe the prisoner obtained them, but I do not recollect now—he and I have not obtained goods together, and had some of them entered to my account, and some to his—I have no recollection of that occurring—I am speaking of children's socks; I have no recollection of any other instance—I have had handkerchiefs and scarfs, and had them debited in the books, and the prisoner has had part of them; he kept some which were to be returned, and allowed another young man in the house to have others—I allowed that to be done on their being charged regularly—that occurred this year—he has got scarfs and handkerchiefs on several occasions, but whether he has kept any for himself I cannot tell, without looking at the accounts; I have not looked—I know Farden and Co.; some goods were obtained by the prisoner from them some time ago, and appropriated to my use—they were either entered in the books, or else I paid for them; I cannot say which it was—I was not pressed for money—I cannot charge my memory as to whether I paid for them at the time—I cannot say whether they were paid for last September—I do not know the amount—I have not got the books here—I have no doubt that this transaction was entered in the books; I cannot say, because I have never looked—I do not know whether there were some goods for the prisoner too—I do not recollect some mantles being obtained of Jones and Co., of Wood-street, for my wife—I think she accom<lb></lb>panied the prisoner to choose some mantles—they were returned—I did not give the prisoner leave to keep one—he got a waterproof coat for me last year: that was paid for in ready money—the prisoner had to Select goods for the firm; he had not to consult me upon every lot of goods he pur<lb></lb>chased—he constantly purchased goods, which I sold without their coming into the house at all; and to customers of his own seeking and finding, whose names were not on the books of the firm until the goods were sold—he has extended the business of the firm; I cannot say to what extent—he has not nearly doubled it—I should think he has increased it to 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say exactly whether I mean 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the amount I charge him with altogether is 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he left on 10th April; he had given notice to quit on the 3rd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe he has had the indiscretion and impropriety to go into the service of a rival firm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Broughton and Co.—they are in the same business as we are—when he was given into custody he was in their service—I do not think that he first of all gave notice at Christmas last—many of the servants in the establishment did not say that they should leave if he left, nor was he pressed to stay; he said he should leave if one of the travelers stayed—that traveller was turned away—I said that I did not wish the prisoner to go, so I discharged the other—I should think that that was last Christmas—he gave Mr. Firman notice to quit, on 1st April, and on 10th April I called him up stairs, and said, "If you will give me a receipt for your salary up to 1st April, I will pay you"—he did so, and I paid him the balance of his salary; he had had several sums on account during the month, and some things were standing against him in the books—I said that several things were irregular in the accounts which I was paying that day, and I should hold the salary to the end of the month—there were several accounts</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185406120056"></xptr>
               <p>of which the invoices were missing—I held the salary, and have not paid it yet—it is 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is about the amount of the goods in the indict<lb></lb>ment, but there are goods standing against him in April, to the amount of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that there were goods standing to him in April.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Beyond the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave him out of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is for goods had from us, which is entered in the books; goods charged to us, but obtained from other warehouses—I mean to swear that that does not form part of the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I charge him with—I say that it is altogether 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and not 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have kept the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the scarfs, handkerchiefs, and other things; just ex<lb></lb>plain this; here is, in pencil, "Supplied to Woods?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Those were some things which the prisoner allowed one of the travellers to take away; I found that out on the day he left, while I was settling with him—I found it out by a statement of Welch and Margetson, which I got at the end of March—it did not include the scarfs and handkerchiefs, as it was only an amount—the prisoner had had the invoice of the goods; he showed me the invoice on 10th April—I was aware before that, that he had obtained the scarfs, because some of them he had got for me—I do not know how many; two or three, I think—he brought them to me to look at; I chose what I wanted, and the others should have been returned—I did not know till 10th April that they had not been returned—I did not know how they had been distributed—I did not know that the man Woods had had any—I had had some myself, and my father had had some—I did not know till 10th April what had been done with the rest—in consequence of that I charge this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the prisoner—I do not know under what circum<lb></lb>stances this black satin is charged; our chief clerk knows that—I cannot explain this entry, "I piece of print, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" or this six yards of black silk velvet, or any of these items.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have not you seen this yard of black satin which you cannot explain, adorning your wife as an apron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it is only seven-eighths of a yard—I am not aware that my wife wears this very seven-eighths; I will not swear that she does not—I swear that one of these scarfs which I have charged the prisoner with, is not in the possession of my own brother—my father had one—my brother is charged with what he has had—the scarfs on this bill do not include one which my father has got; I swear that—I did tell you just now that my father had one, but not one of these—Hussey did not have any of these scarfs—I have charged the pri<lb></lb>soner with the scarfs that he has supplied to Woods; there were two or three—Woods had left our employment some time before, and that is why they were charged to the prisoner—Woods' salary has not been paid; I do not think there is anything due to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not he called frequently, and tried to get money due to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not seen him; he has called, I believe; Mr. Clay has told him that there is no money due—he called once—when I heard that the prisoner was in another employment, I most likely instructed my attorney to write a</p>

               <p>letter to him—I instructed him to proceed—I do not recollect instructing him to write a letter—the prisoner came to my house, and told me he was most anxious to meet everything—I did not take that opportunity of giving him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You waited until he had remained seven or eight days longer in his employment, and then did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left that to Mr. Dalton—I did not hear, in the meanwhile, that he was obtaining very considerable orders from Messrs. Broughton and Co.; I heard that he was in their employment as town traveller, seeking orders—I do not recollect hearing that he had obtained orders from some of our old customers; I heard that he called on some of them—I have no recollection of telling the prisoner's brother that if the prisoner would give a written undertaking not to go into the same trade, I should take no steps against him; I did not do so—I said nothing to the prisoner or his brother about any undertaking—I have not the slightest recollection of saying anything to the prisoner's brother about it—I will pledge my oath that I did not make any such proposition to the brother—I have no recollection of saying anything to him about the pri<lb></lb>soner going into Messrs. Broughton's employ—I pledge my oath that I did not suggest in any way a written undertaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Or an undertaking of any kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of any<lb></lb>thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first hear that he was in Messrs. Broughton's employment; was it before or after you had that communica<lb></lb>tion with him, in consequence of the letter you wrote? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Before that—I wrote a letter myself before instructing my attorney; this is it—<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> ("London, 53, Strand, May 4, 1854. Sir,—From invoices, of which we have been just furnished with copies, you appear to have been purchasing goods on your own account, and having them charged to our firm. If you do not come and satisfactorily explain those matters, we shall direct our solicitors to proceed against you for fraud—Firman and Son")—I under<lb></lb>stood that Woods called once; he sold for us on commission, and since he left, a great portion of the goods he sold have been returned, and he would not be entitled to any commission upon them—when he called, Mr. Clay saw him, and gave him an explanation, and I never heard of his calling since—the stockings and other things were entered by the prisoner on the day he left—I do not know how long before that they had been obtained—before he left, I did not know of his having obtained any goods whatever for his own purposes on our credit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer.

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Messrs.

               <p>me to do so—the next time I saw him he gave me the paper; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is in his writing—when I saw him again, he asked me whether I had done it; I told him that I should not do so—he said that Mr. Firman and his brother were acquainted with his having the goods, and I told him he had better settle it with them—he gave me no reason for asking me to make the entry—I never mentioned anything to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I have been in the service of Messrs. Firman nearly five years. I have examined the books of the firm with regard to these articles; I find no entry in the order book of any of the orders having been given to these parties; no orders have been given—I was not aware of his having obtained goods of Messrs.

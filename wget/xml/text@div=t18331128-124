             (police-constable N 96). I was on duty on the 16th of October; the prosecutrix came to me and said she had been robbed, and she gave me these duplicates - I was about a week looking for the prisoner, but could not find her; she then came and gave herself up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she say she was ordered to pawn them by the young man? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young man ordered me to pawn these things; and when she missed them she said if I would get them back it would do. I pawned them in the name of Marriott, which is my name.</p>

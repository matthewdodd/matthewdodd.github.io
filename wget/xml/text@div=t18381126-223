                  </hi>. I am servant to Lieutenant Saville, of the Royal Artillery; I am a private. On the 16th of November my master sent me to Woolwich—I was to return next morning—I got up between four and five o'clock on the 17th, and went to the Coach and Horses public-house, to get a pint of beer and a glass of gin, about half-past five o'clock—the pri<lb></lb>soner came in while I was there, with another young woman, and two men, dressed as sailors—they had something to drink—I got into conversation with the sailors—they asked me to drink at different times, and I became quite insensible by drinking with them—when I awoke I found myself is another public-house, the Duke on Horseback, in a room on the ground-floor—my watch, seal, and guard, a sovereign, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were gone—this is the watch I lost—it is my property—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in High-street, Woolwich. I went to the Coach and Horses on the morning in question—I saw the prosecutor there drunk—I remember the prisoner coming in with others—they drank together, and the prisoner left the house with the prosecutor, to go home together—I afterwards saw them at the Duke on Horseback—they had a quartern of rum there, and I partook of some there—the prosecutor pro<lb></lb>duced a sovereign, and told me to pay for the rum—he laid it down, and before I could get hold of it, the prisoner took it up—she put it down at the bar to pay, and took the change herself—the prosecutor fell asleep there, and the prisoner tried to awake him—she took the guard off his neck, with the watch to it, and took it to the bar, to be taken care off till the man awoke—she was gone when he awoke—she did not give the prosecutor his change—he was in the parlour.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 17th of November, I went to find the prisoner, and met her, in company with two or three females, about half-past ten o'clock, about half a mile from The Duke on Horseback—I heard her say before I took her, that she should pull out her watch and see what o'clock it was—one of the women said, "You had better not, for fear you should break it"—I went up, and took it from her bosom—I found 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on her—I charged her with stealing the watch—she said, "Oh, let me see the man, I think I can make it right with him"—that she could make the sovereign up with the man, if she could see him—she had been drinking the knew what she was saying.</p>

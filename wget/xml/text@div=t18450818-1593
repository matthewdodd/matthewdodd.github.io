                  </hi>. I am a cattle-dealer. On Tuesday, the 30th of July, I had a mare with a white graze down the face—I took her to Ha<lb></lb>denham, near Thame, in Bucks.—I saw her between nine and ten o'clock, and missed her on Wednesday morning about five, also a bridle and saddle—the prisoner lives next door to me, and rents under me—I did not lend him the bridle or saddle—I have since seen my mare, bridle, and saddle, at Edgware.</p>

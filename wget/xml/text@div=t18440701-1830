                  </hi>. I am a general dealer in fish and fruit, and live in Glass-house-yard, Gravel-lane, near Black friars-road—I had been out late at night on Friday last—I went out about half-post ten, intending to go to Islington, to see my brother, but it was later than I expected, and I returned—-1 had a pint of beer in Holborn, and that was all I had—I was returning home Saffron-hill way, about a mile from my residence, as near half-past one as possible—as I turned the corner of Union-court the prisoner came up close to my side, and struck me a blow in the mouth—I had heard somebody walking a few steps behind me before that—he then knocked me again in the stomach and knocked me down, put his hand down, and attempted to pick my pocket—I kept my hand on my pocket, and he kicked me after I was down, in the side, and attempted to kick me again, but I caught hold of his legs—it was after he kicked me that I felt his hand towards my pocket—I held my pocket as well as I could—I felt his hand a little way down inside my pocket, which was unbuttoned, but I did not lose any money—I kept hallooing to the. policeman all the while—he said he would knock my bbrains out, but I kept on calling police as hard as I could, and held him by the leg—he beckoned to two more, who were at a distance off—they came a little way to assist him, but seeing the policeman coming they ran back—I let go of his leg, and ran towards the policeman—I heard the prisoner call to the other two, "Look sharp "—when the policeman came he ran away as hard as he could, and when I saw the policeman I ran after the prisoner to get hold of him—he ran down an alley leading to Field-lane—there is a little yard there, and I found him concealed behind a door in that yard—I pulled him out, and gave him into custody—I had about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in my pocket—I was quite sober.</p>

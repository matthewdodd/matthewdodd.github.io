               <p>an opportunity of going round to see what it was before I made the accusation; he then gave it another kick for a yard, or a yard and a half, and then stooped down, and threw it under the packing utensils; I was still unwilling to accuse him, and let him go to breakfast; when he was gone, I examined it, and found it to be a pair of trowsers and a shirt; I had the highest opinion of the man, and I believe, till then, he deserved it; I then marked them in the presence of my lad, and put them where I took them from, knowing the prisoner had no business in that part of the shop, that if he took them I should have abundant confirmation; when he returned, he went to the packing stool, stooped down, and laid the articles upon the counter where there was less suspicion; I then sent for an officer, took the prisoner into custody, and searched his house, where I found the other articles mentioned in the indictment; upon the person of the prisoner's wife and daughter, I found a shawl each.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. I was in the parlour of the Black Horse public-house, in York-street, Westminster, on the 23rd of July, taking some refreshment—the prisoner sat on my right hand—he was quite a stranger—I had changed a sovereign, and received seven half-crowns</p>

               <p>and two shillings—I had paid some money away, and had the rest of the half crowns and some other silver in my right-hand pocket—I felt my dress move several times on the side where the prisoner sat, but I did not suspect him, till a person told me I was robbed—the prisoner was taken and searched in my presence, and four half-crowns, one shilling; and two pence found on him—I am confident I lost them out of my pocket.</p>

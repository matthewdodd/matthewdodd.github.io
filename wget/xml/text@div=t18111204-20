            . I am constable of St. Bride's About half after two the prosecutor brought the prisoner in the watch house, he charged her with robbing him of three one-pound notes, the prisoner, said she had not robbed him, she was very much in liquor. The young man put down the notes, I took the numbers, and as I was folding the notes up the prisoner snatched them out of my hand and put them in her mouth, I saw the notes in her mouth, I went to take them out, she bit my thumb, swallowed the notes, blood and all. I never got the notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I put a bit of paper in my mouth I thought it was my commitment, I never swallowed the notes at all, I spit the paper out of my mouth. I think paper is dry eating without something to drink with it. The prosecutor has got three pound note to appear against me.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutor.) Have you received three pound - A. No.</p>

I heard she was in trouble, and that she was innocent of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040022"></xptr>robbing the man. I immediately went to a public house in Covent Garden. I gave two pounds to the prosecutor's friend, he said he was afraid of taking it himself, but to give it to his friend and he would not appear. I have got a pound of silver now in my pocket, he said he was afraid to take it, for fear of the constable.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He wanted to put the money in my hand, I would not take it, he gave two pound to a man that I know nothing of. I had seen the man before. As to the other pound I am certain I never received it, and I will take my oath I never saw the notes that that man took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that man. - A. I do not know his name, it is a man that I saw down at Croydon fair. I dont know where he lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect to receive the two pound after the trial is over. - A. He promised to meet me at a house in Covent Garden.</p>

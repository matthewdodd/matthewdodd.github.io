                  </hi>. I am a mantle manufacturer, of 76, Greeham Street—I sell cloth cuttings to Mr. Burt, and a large quantity to Mr. Herbert, three or four tons a month—when we are busy we sell small cuttings once a fortnight or once in three weeks, and large cuttings two or three times a year—Mr. Herbert has been taking both during the last 12 months—I have known Champion ever since Mr. Herbert has taken the cuttings, but I only remember seeing Catherall once—I had written to Mr. Herbert to send and fetch the cuttings away, and on 19th August the prisoners came at a little after 12 and brought bags with them—I showed them up to the third floor, and left them there with my boy 12 years old—there were only small cuttings there, which they packed—they Were there half or three quarters of an hour—four cutters were also in the room, Kingwell was one of them Mr. Newton the foreman was also there—they were about five hours altogether packing the cuttings—these are some of the small ones (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when a bag was full it was sent down to the next floor, and afterwards tied up and weighed—the whole bulk was about 25 cwt in 22 bags—they fetched 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Herbert owed me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I asked the prisoners if he was coming down to pay me—they said he was coming at 5 o'clock, but he did not, and I refused to let the bags go—I said that if they were not fetched in 24 hours I should sell them, as they were obstructing the passage—Mr. Herbert did not come till the next afternoon, and during that time I had asked Messrs. Mallett to fetch them away, which they did next morning, Wednesday, August 21st, about 10</p>

               <p>o'clock, and these large pieces of cloth were sent back, which I charge the prisoners with stealing—this piece measures 3 1/2; yards—there is no pretence for calling them cuttings, they would each make a child's jacket—none of them are small cuttings—two of them are large cuttings, but not the other four—no large cuttings ought to have been collected that day—we had none ready for sale—these six pieces are worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. These are not cuttings, they are pieces of cloth; but we should sell them for large cuttings, though they were not ready for sale—my men returned from dinner at 1 o'clock—I had only seen Catherall once before—the cuttings which filled 22 bags were taken from two rooms, and from under the cutting boars—similar cloth was lying on the cutting boards at the same time, and a small piece, half or three quarters of a yard might fall among the cuttings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cutter to Mr. Taylor—on Monday, 19th August, I was there after dinner from one o'clock to 4.30, when I went to tea—while I was there I saw the prisoner filling bags with cutting—I cannot say when they left or whether they had finished when I went to tea—during the time the cuttings were being put in the bags I missed about two yards of cloth from my cutting board—that was about three or four o'clock—I complained to the foreman about it, and I think the prisoners must have heard me—a search was made, but it was not found—we throw the small pieces which we cut off under our boards—Catherall shoved the pieces out from under the boards with his feet, and then put them into the bag which Champion held—they were clearing under my bench at the time I missed the two pieces—after they are pushed out they take them up in as large handfuls as they can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. My board is not against the wall; it is the middle one; it is about two feet from the floor, and a person can go underneath—Catherall laid down on his back and shoved them out with his feet, and then gathered them up in armfuls—after I had cut the piece that I missed I folded it up into a small compass like this, and marked it as ready to cut.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. It was marked in the same way as this—there was more than a hundredweight of cuttings under my board—some bags were already filled when I missed it, and some were being taken out—I never chalk any pieces which become cuttings afterwards—I chalk no large cuttings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Taylor's foreman—on 19th August I was in and out of the cutting-room all the afternoon—I have to look after the men and see how they are getting on—Mr. Kingwell made a complaint to me, and I looked for a piece of cloth—I told both the prisoners we had missed it, but did not tell them the size of it—I had one bag unpacked, but did not find it in that—directly I got out on the landing the top part of another bag was pulled out by the prisoners, and Catherall produced this piece of cloth. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Champion called him to account, and told him to be more careful—Catherall said that it was a mistake, and they laughed it off—that piece came from the back of where I stand, at one end of the top room in which the prisoners packed first—there is perhaps a yard between me and the wall—there was a large roll of paper behind</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187809160069"></xptr>
               <p>me, on which the piece of cloth a yard and a half long was lying in the morning—I did not notice whether it was there when I came back from dinner, as I had no occasion to use it—small cuttings had to be taken from under the double board at which I stand—anything which will not cut children's jackets we sell as large cuttings; they are passed to me and I place them on shelves, but I call these remnants—no large cuttings were on the floor on the 19th except what was on the roll of paper—this three and a half yards is a large remnant—I cannot say where these other five remnants were, but they ought to have been on the shelves—I place them there once a week when they accumulate—if I saw large cuttings on the floor I should pick them up and place them on the shelves—if they are handed to me I place them by my side—they have no business on the floor; if the men have short ends left, similar to this, they hand them to me; we have no large cuttings till the end of the season, and then what will not cut children's clothes we consider long cuttings—I do not call the pieces I put on the shelf, cuttings, but remnants—if during the packing there are pieces of paper or string among them the packers remove them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I occasionally pick up large pieces from the floor; they ought not to be there—when I put them on the shelves they ought to remain there for the season—this piece was found in the middle of the second bag—I have said "It might have fallen down among the cuttings"—I did not miss the 3 1/2; yards till the 21st, when I had occasion to use it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mallett and Co., of Caledonian Road; they buy cuttings—on 21st August I got 22 bags of cuttings from Mr. Taylor, and found these six pieces of cloth in three of them when they were unpacked—the largest piece was in one bag alone, and the other five were in two of the other bags—they were returned to Mr. Taylor next morning—we do not ordinarily find 3 1/2; yards among cutting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I counted 23 bags, but I believe I counted an empty one in mistake; on a second counting there were 22—I have been employed in the same kind of business 12 or 13 years—I have found two yards among cuttings collected by us, but not often—when I find large pieces I send them down into the counting-house to have it ascertained where they come from, and then they go back—frequently in the hurry of packing pieces or cloth may be gathered up with the cuttings.</p>

I am a piece-dealer, at 122, Brunswick Street, Hackney—I am in the habit of receiving pieces in bags, and on one occasion I went with Mr. Herbert to clear Mr. Taylor's premises—you get the goods into the bag in the best way you can; sometimes we have the bag on the ground, and the cuttings are pushed into it without taking them in our hands at all—I generally begin by holding the nose of the bag down to the ground and force the cuttings into it, and then we shake it and put more in, and when it gets half full we take them up in our arms—we do it as quickly as we can, and there is very little room in Mr. Taylor's premises, only just room for the bags to pass in the principal room, in which there are six boards—the boards are near each other; there is just room for the men to work—it frequently happens that large cuttings are returned among the small ones, and various other things; on one occasion I found a large pair of shears, with brass handles to fit round the hand, among the cuttings—they were the property of Mrs. Simmonds, of East Road, and they were returned to her.</p>

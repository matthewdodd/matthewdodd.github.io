               <p>At what time was it when you was robbed; - The 29th of May, 1787, I went into the city to make enquiry and give directions about some very particular things being advertised, a great part of the robbery having then been discovered, and a person concerned in it, sent out of the house, in order that he might not be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>It was before then of course, that this robbery was committed? - It was.</p>
               <p>When was you able to ascertain the articles that were missing? - The day we first discovered we had been robbed of bank notes, was sometime previous to the 29th of May, I do not recollect the particular day.</p>
               <p>Were those articles stolen that were enumerated in the indictment? - I did not hear it read, but there are a great number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You heard them on the former trial, madam? - I did, they were correct then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you ever seen since that time any sort of article, that is mentioned in that indictment, that you think you can identify, that was taken from you either at or before that time? - I think I have; I went into the city that day, and very unexpectedly learned that the robbery was more considerable than I had an idea of; I had when I went out, missed one extreme fine shawl, which being able to ascertain from having a pair of them; in consequence of making these discoveries I was detained till between nine and ten at night; when I returned the prisoner opened the door; he told me with visible surprize and confusion, that Mr. Sullivan, was alarmed at my absence, and waited dinner till seven o'clock; Mr. Sullivan then proposed having two constables and taking him into custody; I proposed waiting till the morrow; concluding it could not be him, as we had placed so much confidence in him; the servant who slept in the room with him was cautioned by us not to mention it to him; but in the morning when we went out to Bow-street, supposing that the prisoner had no suspicion that we had discovered any thing, we left him in the house and the house-keeper, and in about half an hour he was gone; when I went out, I believe I said to him, Attrill, do not you open the door this morning, let Collins, she was the housekeeper, and she, but a few days before, brought me a thousand pound note found on the bed, therefore she was perfectly unsuspected; I believe we went to Bow-street about ten; immediately after we got to Bow-street we sent to apprehend the prisoner; when I returned from Bow-street the constables were I think there; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100106"></xptr>was gone, I never saw him again from that time to the present moment to my knowledge; they sent for me down to the room below and desired me to look into the box which they had broke open; it had been stripped of every thing but rubbish; at the bottom I remember seeing some old cards and shoes; the constable or some person standing by, perceived some linen in a corner of it; they took it out, and immediately upon looking on it, said this is a part of some of the fine linen; it was cut into small handkerchiefs like neck-handkerchiefs for a man.</p>
               <p>How many are there? - I really do not know, and there was I believe a cambric one among them; I could ascertain Indian linen, but any thing of European linen I could not, therefore I do not claim the cambric.</p>
               <p>Then, madam, you are enabled to say whether this parcel found, was or was not your property? - I certainly am; that was so very trifling that I suppose the value not to be worth half a crown; but we lost I suppose not less than 5 or 600 l. at least, according to the duties paid at the India-house, exclusive of fourteen hundred pounds bank notes, and a lottery ticket which was a prize and was received two days afterwards; these were pieces of fine cloth that were washed in India, in order to preserve them to bring them to England, they had been sent to the India-house, and had paid duty as sheets.</p>
               <p>How long had this man lived in your house? - He had lived I believe a twelve month, or a month or two more, I cannot exactly ascertain that.</p>
               <p>Was he a servant entrusted in the family? - He was insomuch, that though those bank notes were lost out of Mr. Sullivan's writing drawing where this man chiefly went, yet he was not suspected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. The prisoner at the bar, Mrs. Sullivan, had lived in your service something more than a twelvemonth? - I believe he had.</p>
               <p>You know, madam, of course, having attended here before, that this is a capital charge? - I do not know any thing about it.</p>

               <p>It is fit you should know, madam, that this is for a capital offence, and therefore affects the life of the prisoner, if he should be found guilty; you never saw him from the time he went away, till this time? - Never, without in disguise.</p>
               <p>He has been advertised long and frequently as a felon, with a reward for his apprehension? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he taken at all? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may know, that in May last, this man, charged with a capital felony, gave notice that he would surrender? - I do.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may know, too, madam, that it was stated upon your part, that the time was so long since that you were not then prepared for the trial? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Do you know, that, in consequence of such an objection, he gave bail for his appearance at the then next sessions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know, that at the then next sessions he was ready to come, and it was put off because you had sprained your ancle? - I had such an accident.</p>
               <p>As soon as you had recovered that accident, this man has attended, day after day, to surrender himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he now surrenders? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you hear of Sadi's death, madam? - I really cannot tell; I was in the country; I first read it in the newspaper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, he certainly was dead long before the notice of surrender.</p>
               <p>You say the prisoner was much intrusted in the family, so much so, that though the bank-note was lost out of a place to which he had the principal resort, he was not suspected? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Sadi was convicted of stealing that 1000 l. bank-note, among other things? - No, sir, he was not prosecuted for that, but for 400 l.</p>
               <p>Sadi had been suspected, in truth detected,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100107"></xptr>a fortnight or three weeks before the day you went to Bow-street? - No, sir; Sadi had been suspected, and was sent to a friend in the city, to have him sent by the first ship; the butler was intrusted to take him into the city.</p>
               <p>Sadi had been a servant very young in your service, quite a child? - He had.</p>
               <p>He was a very great favourite, a very much indulged servant in your family? - He was.</p>
               <p>He was in the nursery, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe, since the prisoner left your service, madam, you have expressed a great wish, that he might be hanged? - I do not know that I have; I may possibly have said, that I hoped he would be taken, and I hoped he would meet with his deserts.</p>
               <p>So you never desired any body not to repeat those expressions? - Me! no, sir.</p>
               <p>Never sent Mrs. Collins, or any body, with any such message? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Then you never commissioned Mrs. Collins to carry any such message? - I never entered into any such conversation with Mrs. Collins.</p>
               <p>After this robbery, and the flight of Attril, whether to any person you have used frequently expressions of that sort, that you hoped he would be hanged? - No, sir, I never did; I never conversed with my servants.</p>
               <p>Then, of course, you never desired any person not to repeat those expressions? - I put myself under the protection of the court; Mr. Garrow confuses me so, I do not know what to do.</p>
               <p>Has it happened to you, madam (in the great quantity of things that of course you have) sometimes to have mislaid articles yourself, of which you have suspected persons of stealing? - I do not know; the great quantity was very much diminished.</p>
               <p>Have not you taken articles of your own wearing-apparel out of the room where they were usually kept, and laid them down in another room; and afterwards, when there were enquiries for them, they were found there? - None of these things.</p>
               <p>Has not Mr. Sullivan cautioned you against those hasty suspicions? - A pocket-handkerchief, or shawl, or such articles, may have been mislaid.</p>

               <p>It has been a subject of remonstrance, I believe, sometimes? - I do not know it has.</p>
               <p>Do you remember a particular instance of Mr. Sullivan's linen being put into a bag, in the butler's care, after it was worn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect some shirts having been stated to be stolen out of this bag? - Never; perhaps the circumstance you are speaking of, may have happened in the laundry-maid's account, in looking out dirty linen, but never any charge of them being stolen; for, till this great robbery, I never suspected any person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Madam, when your suspicions fell upon Sadi, you removed him to Sanders's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The discovery of the 1000 l. note was well known in the family? - Yes; I ordered the prisoner to take him to Sanders's.</p>
               <p>And that was to be the removal of him for ever out of your family? - Yes. (Mr. Newman said, Sadi died the 9th of December.</p>

               <p>My Husband is Butler of Gray's-inn; on the 3d of May, in the morning, Mr. Attrill came to me, when I unlocked the door, and asked me how I came by the key of the hall door; I told him, Mrs. Sullivan brought it up to me to bed, overnight.</p>

               <p>Court. Was it usual for you to keep the key of the hall, or of the street-door? - No, it was usually left in the hall-door, for any thing I ever knew; Attrill returned back, and went into the back-parlour; he did not ask me any thing more at that time; that morning, he brought chocolate to breakfast;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100108"></xptr>when Mrs. Sullivan forbade him to answer the door, he walked up and down in the passage.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the servant that usually answered the door in the family? - Mr. Attrill and the footman.</p>
               <p>Was it known that Mrs. Sullivan was gone to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did she go? - About twelve in the day; Mr. Attrill went up to the door, and stood there the space of ten minutes; I staid with him; then I came away, when I observed Mr. Attrill was going away, that was in the laundry, he changed a dark-coloured coat for a light one.</p>
               <p>Then he came out of the pantry? - He took off his hat, it hung on the press; when he saw me look at him, he came to me to the door; I said to him, Mr. Attrill, would you chuse any thing to eat? and he said no, and shook his head; and he returned into the pantry again, and put on his hat, and went up stairs; then he went into the hall; I followed him up stairs, and he stood at the door, with his hat laying in the hall-window; then he walked across Mr. Sullivan's back-room; then he walked across the hall, and shut the door after him; I looked after him up and down the street; I did not see him; there is a stleet almost opposite; as soon as ever I heard the door shut, I ran up immediately and opened the hall-door, and looked up and down the street, but could not see any thing of him; it was, as near as I can guess, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after this that the officer came from Bow-street; I never saw the prisoner from that time till this sessions; I saw boxes in the pantry that belonged to Mr. Attrill; I did not know whose boxes they were, any further than by seeing the things taken out of them; there was one box there, and one in the butler's pantry; the box that the officer opened I had not seen the prisoner use.</p>
               <p>Whose box was it, do you know? - I cannot tell, It was a box I saw opened, but I never saw Mr. Attrill make use of it.</p>
               <p>Court. In what room was it? - His bedroom.</p>
               <p>Did any body else lay in that room? - Alexander Crouch, who is a witness, he was the footman; when the officers came, they searched that box and the box in the pantry; the box in the pantry was the box that the two handkerchiefs were taken out of, that Mrs. Sullivan said she knew; that was the box that stood in Mr. Attrill's room; I did not see Attrill use either of the boxes, only one was in his pantry and the other in his bed-room.</p>
               <p>Were there any shirts or clothes of the prisoner's in the box? - No, not in the box; there were some clothes of his hanging in the bed-room, there was no linen of any kind in the box, further than the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>You was the person that found the 1000 l. note, and gave it to Mrs. Sullivan? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. There were two mens neck handkerchiefs found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which a man might put into his breeches pocket, I suppose? - Yes, I suppose he might.</p>
               <p>This prisoner, however, when he went away, is supposed to have left this evidence of his guilt in the house ready, in order to convict him - you live still in the family of Mr. Sullivan? - No, sir, I left it the first of last September, 1787.</p>
               <p>Then from that time, probably, you have not had an opportunity of conversing much with Mrs. Sullivan? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, before you did leave the service, any expressions of Mrs. Sullivan's, respecting Attrill? - No, sir, only mentioning what she had missed.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear her say whether she wished him hanged or not? - No, sir, I never did.</p>

               <p>Why, that witness you understood to be a witness for the prisoner? - I did not know at first, whether she was to be a witness for Mrs. Sullivan, or for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Now I may certainly ask you the question, I believe, that I asked you before; was not that observation produced by her saying, that she could state expressions of that sort of Mrs. Sullivan's?</p>

               <p>No, she did not.</p>
               <p>What led to your making that observation? - She said, she did not know what she was coming to say, or what she could say in his behalf, as she had not lived in the house but a week with him.</p>

            , and who was present? - No one but herself.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Beale, who was the butler after Attrill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with him since you knew that Attrill was to be tried? - To be sure, I have spoke to him here at the sessions.</p>
               <p>Have you ever said any thing to him about what he was to say or prove? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you might say to him, that, to say as little as might be, would be best? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you undertake to say you never did? - I never knew he had any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Did he never tell you that he should prove the expressions of Mrs. Sullivan's of the sort I have mentioned? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell him in any conversation, that it would be better not to mention those expressions of Mrs. Sullivan's? - Mr. Beale was in court when I came in.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sullivan. He was there just now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it is of no use for me to ask you now what you have said to Beale, as I cannot call him.</p>
               <p>Court. I think if Beale goes out of court now, it would be too hard not to call him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I certainly shall not call him, with the observation upon him of being in court when he was ordered to be out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. In what situation was Ann Townshend? - She was house-maid; she was one week and two or three days with Mr. Attrill, and ever after in the country.</p>
               <p>Were the family in the country when she was there? - They were not there at first; I left her in the service.</p>
               <p>Court. There was only one housemaid? - Mrs. Sullivan has her own maid.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Sullivan use to converse much with her house-maid? - Not to my knowledge; my business lay below, so that I do not know either one way or the other.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at Bow-street when Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan came there; but I went on the 30th of May, about the middle of the day, rather the earliar part; I was to open the boxes that belonged to the prisoner; I did not find the prisoner; I opened the boxes, and Mrs. Sullivan, herself, picked out these things.</p>
               <p>Were the boxes full or empty? - Why, they were almost full of one thing or the other, of his own things.</p>
               <p>What things? - There were boots, and linen, and shirts, and handkerchiefs; a great many things were left behind; these are the things Mrs. Sullivan picked out.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to say whether there were shirts or linen there? - I did not see any shirts in the box I broke open; there were three boxes of the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That waistcoat is certainly not in the indictment; and I contend these handkerchiefs are not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true, that there was nothing left belonging to the prisoner, but that there was abundance of wearing apparel? - There were many things.</p>
               <p>And of all the great number of things, these three handkerchiefs were pointed out by Mrs. Sullivan? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In whose possession have they been ever since? - Mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you recollect which of the boxes these handkerchiefs were found in? - I cannot recollect which of the boxes at this time; I had not the boxes in my custody till he surrendered.</p>
               <p>Then do you recollect what was in the same box where it was taken from? - I believe one handkerchief was in the box; and the waistcoat, and the other two handkerchiefs I had from a little box, which was not locked.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what boxes these neck handkerchiefs were taken out of? - I cannot recollect which of the two they were taken out of.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sullivan. Two of them I believe to be cut out of the fine linen, what are called sheets in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any mark upon them? - Here is the initials of the prisoner's name and the numbers, one of the marks is A, No. 2, and the other is A, No. 4.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sullivan. They are cut from a piece of cloth (that was called sheets) of thirty-six yards, cut into pieces at two or three or four yards for the convenience of sheets, and they are passed at the India-house as sheets, they were for the purpose of making linen, and are uncommonly fine, I could not buy such I believe in England; I had them made, all the linen that was brought to England was made for me, they are like what I lost, and I have some pieces remaining with which I have compared them, having considered it a good deal, having lost it so long.</p>
               <p>What description of cloth is it? - It is long cloth from Madras, it is known in England by the name of calico.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Just as much by the name of Madras long cloth.</p>
               <p>Court. There are in the indictment four remnants of Cossa cloth and three remnants of calico.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sullivan. Cossa cloth it is not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In the shape of neck handkerchiefs you certainly did not lose these? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you had a great deal of linen made for your own use that you brought home? - I had.</p>
               <p>It was of a peculiar fineness? - It was.</p>
               <p>And you lost some of that fineness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know of your own knowledge, whether ladies of considerable fortune returning from India might not have some of Mrs. Sullivan's pattern, or that gentlemen might not have sent it to make presents? - I believe I could not buy it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100111"></xptr>No, very likely not; but if I meant to do a very gallant thing, I should order some of Mrs. Sullivan's long cloth to give away?</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any gentleman on the Jury that is well acquainted with this article?</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. My Lord, my brother brought home a great quantity from India which I cannot by my eye distinguish from this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I could say that my brothers have sent as presents to their sisters and mother, some that I believe to be equally as fine as that, I can say that upon oath, and I have no objection to be called as a witness.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, I think it would be carrying zeal for public justice a great way to convict upon the identity of that linen; you see that there are circumstances in this case that weigh very much in point of suspicion, and that would press extremely strong against the prisoner in evidence, if any one article had been found in his possession which could be clearly and indisputably proved to be the property of Mr. Sullivan, I should then think it my duty to observe pretty strongly upon many of the other circumstances of the case; but most certainly the evidence in the case, as it now stands, is not sufficient to convict any man without finding some property clearly proved to be the property of Mr. Sullivan; now this being the only thing which Mrs. Sullivan can identify, though I have not the smallest doubt but Mrs. Sullivan is sure they are hers, and though she is very probably right, yet it is also certain that the best judge may be deceived in linen, and I think it would be going a great way to convict him on that; the circumstance too of its being made up and marked with his name, there being no precise time when that was lost, weakers the case; if you feel it too much on the proof of this property to convict the prisoner, it will be unnecessary in that case to take up your time further, if you have any doubt remaining I will go through the whole of the case.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is perfectly unnecessary, my lord, we are all agreed.</p>
               <p>Court. There is one circumstance, gentlemen, in evidence before you give your verdict, let it hereafter operate as it may in point of law, which you may very properly make a part of that verdict, you may find that he fled for it, I think there is full evidence of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was long before any charge was made against him, surely it is a novel practice.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a part in point of law of every verdict; now can you upon your oath find in this case that he did not fly for that cause.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I agree that the form of recording a verdict in all criminal cases is this, that he is guilty and fled for it, or that he is not guilty but did fly for it, or did not fly for it; but the universal practice has been that the second finding has been a conclusion from the first finding, and I believe it has never occured in modern times after finding the party is not guilty of the principal charge that the jury have found that he fled for that principal charge; if the jury are satisfied he is innocent, they cannot either in point of evidence or common sense, or consistent to law, to find that for that charge he fled.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Garrow, are you aware how far the converse of that argument will go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if you hold that in point of law, it cannot be that a man should fly for a charge of which he is innocent, I shall leave it to the jury whether he is innocent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In point of law it may happen, but I state that it is an outrage on that common sense which a jury exercises, to say that in a case in which they are perfectly satisfied the man is innocent, that he fled for it.</p>
               <p>Court. The jury have not said, that they are perfectly satisfied that the man is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100112"></xptr>innocent, and I should think, I dealt very hardly by a prisoner, if ever I put the question of guilty or not guilty in that form to a jury; I hold the direct contrary, that they are to find him not guilty, unless they are perfectly satisfied that he is guilty: now I can receive that, as conclusively binding them to find, as against a man, if the flying and guilt are relative terms; then I ought to have left that circumstance more strongly to the jury; but I can never suffer it to be argued, that a jury, upon this evidence, are not at liberty to find one way or the other with respect to his flying; for in all cases it ought to be taken, and it is no answer to say, that it is entered by the officer as matter of form, because they ought, in all cases, to have the question asked. In this case, I shall direct the officer to ask that question of the jury, distinctly, when he takes the verdict.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. Gentlemen of the jury, how say ye, is

               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. Did he fly for it.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are of opinion that he fled in consequence.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Sullivan. There were some other things, madam, found in this man's box, that were not included in this indictment; are any of them such as can be clearly identified? - There were other things found in his room, but unfortunately the constable did not take them away with him.</p>
               <p>But I mean any thing that can be clearly proved to be the property of Mr. Sullivan? - There were, but they are not detained.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You may think yourself very fortunate in the event of this trial, provided you make a proper use of that event. I will express no opinion with respect to you at present, inconsistent with the verdict which the jury have found; the jury by that verdict have declared you are not sufficiently proved to be guilty of this charge, I will therefore not impute that charge to you; but your conduct has been so suspicious, that an innocent man should take care that his future conduct should be free from all suspicion, and if your future conduct is so, this verdict will be happy to you, if otherwise, perhaps, it will be the contrary.</p>

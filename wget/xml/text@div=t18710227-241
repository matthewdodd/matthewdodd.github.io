On Friday, 27th January, about 8.30, I was in Deptford Road, Rotherhithe, and saw the prisoner carrying a bundle under his arm—I looked at it, and followed him for about 200 yards—he saw me, and quickened his pace—I found I could not overtake him by walking, and as he turned the corner of the Union Road I com<lb></lb>menced to run after him—he looked round, saw me running, and he ran, too, and threw the bundle he had into the road—we ran about eighty yards, and he suddenly turned into a very dark turning—I was about six yards behind him—as I turned into the court I saw him standing in the gateway—coming from the main street, where it was very light, into this turning, it was rather dark, and I could not see as well—I tapped the man on the shoulder and said "Where has that man run to?"—his back was towards me at the time—he said "Down there"—he turned his face towards me, and I recognized him us the man I was pursuing, and I told him so before he had finished telling me the question I had asked him—I took him into custody—a boy handed me the bundle afterwards, and it contained these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

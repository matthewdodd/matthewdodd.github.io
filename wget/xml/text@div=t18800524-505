After engaging with Mrs. Smith I got some drink and went home, and my husband got Mrs. Smith's address out of my pocket Next day I promised to meet my husband in the evening, but I did not do so, and my husband came to Mrs. Smith. I told him I was going to sleep at Mrs. Smith's. He came again on Sunday evening, and that was how the arrangement was made for the jacket to be taken. It was by his wish that the jacket was taken"—I say now that I did not arrange this with my husband—all I said at the police-court is not untrue—I did not make the agreement with my husband to take the jacket—it is untrue that it was done with his wish—he told me to go to Mrs. Burton—there was no con<lb></lb>versation between me and Mrs. Burton as to how long I would leave the jacket; there was no leaving, it was sold out and out—I have been con<lb></lb>victed of stealing twice, and once for drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When he commenced as a collector in London, had he to work up these collections? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he gave me a slip, a copy of the book, and I looked only at the sum-total at the bottom—I did not add it, only looked at it—he gave in his book at the end of every six months—I believe an application was made to go through the books since he has been in Newgate, and it was said that they would be sent to his attorney, but not to Newgate—he might have to walk fifteen miles to earn five shillings—he had to collect from about 1, 200 people in a week, I believe, and all of those were introduced by himself—I was in Court when he was acquitted last Session (<hi rend="italic">see Vol.</hi> 58, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 550)—there was one indictment taken, and he was acquitted on that—he was acquitted yesterday—there are different members named in this indictment to what there were yesterday—the evidence is exactly the same excepting that they are different columns; these are casual cases—we could, not bring 1, 200 people to prove them all—the society's income is about 80, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the burial-fund—I can't say what the expenses of management are—I have nothing to do with the balance-sheet—I have not seen Mr. Tidd Pratt's report of this society—I mean to swear that I do not know the expenses of the society; nothing except my own—I have not heard complaints made by members of the enormous expenditure in salaries and so on—the prisoner was written to by me, and he attended at once—I heard Mr. Stevenson say there were errors in his accounts—the prisoner did not then say, "Yes, there are; we are all liable to error"—he said there were errors in his book—I think the words were to this effect, "I know there are errors in my book, and that is the reason I object to go round"—he would not go with me at first to the customers—I said, "We are deter<lb></lb>mined to find them out," and he said, "Very well, I will go round with you"—I wanted to go round with him, because he would not tell us who the members were—I prosecute here for the society—I don't know whether, if he is acquitted on this we shall go on with another trial—we have found dis<lb></lb>crepancies amounting to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was about stating the manner in which we found the discrepancies out, but I was stopped—I did not tell Mr. Metcalfe that there was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. defalcation yesterday; he did not ask me the question—</p>

               <p>he had the books before him—I did not say it yesterday, because we only had a certain number of witnesses, and we could not prove it—it is the duty of the auditors to go over these books—they are sent to Liverpool in a systematic way, and are audited at our general office there; the auditor does not come up to London to do them—I heard the learned Judge allude to fivepence which the prisoner had credited to himself—I have not looked at that since—I knew yesterday that fivepence was credited in his favour—I don't think it was unfair to the prisoner to have kept that back—if the question had been put to me I should have answered it in the way I do now—I know a great many things in this case which I have not uttered, which would per<lb></lb>haps be disadvantageous to the prisoner if I did utter them; I swear that—when the member does not pay, the prisoner would put a cypher in his book and on the card.</p>

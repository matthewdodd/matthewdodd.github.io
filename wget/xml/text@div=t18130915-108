            . I am the father of the last witness. On the 7th of September, a little before six in the morning, I saw the prisoner with a bed on his back in Broad-street; St. Giles's; he was without shoes or stockings; I said you are padding the hoof, if you have far to go you will want shoening; he said I shall, like a horse. I saw him put the bed in the private door of the Southampton Arms, Tottenham-court-road. I went with another constable to the Southampton Arms, after I found the bed and things were my son's; the prisoner then said that he had been robbed by the woman that belonged to the room; he took the things out of spite. These are the things.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A woman took me to that room; she robbed me of three pound eight shillings; I, out of vexation, took these goods. I was destressed to the utmost.</p>

I put up at the three tuns at Croydon on Thursday night; there was a box and a trunk. On Friday morning about four o'clock, I discovered that one had been cut off; I saw it the night before.</p>

I live in Kingsland Road; I asked them how they came by them? as I did not like the appearance; they said, two men had got them under a hedge; and that upon seeing them, the men ran away, and left the two bundles behind them; and therefore they took them up, and thought them a lawful prize. They said, they would fetch them away on Monday; all the prisoners were together; they all equally joined in the request: these things in the bundle are what they delivered to me.</p>

            . On the 5th of April, about eight o'clock, I saw this young man and an old man watching about Mr. Marshall's door; having suspicion I stood and watched them till the prisoner entered the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of the person of the prisoner. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open. - A. I cannot tell; I saw him go in, I stopped at the door till he came out; he came out with four pieces, two dark and two light ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there lamps in the shop that you could see. - A. I could not see the pattern, I could see the colour; the two dark ones were at his side, and the other two under his arm. I went into the shop and gave the alarm to Mr. Marshall, he pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them taken. - A. No, I went of my errand about ten doors farther in the street, and before I returned the man was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man. - A. Not till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that you saw the next morning the same that you saw go in the shop. - A. Yes; the prisoner is the same person.</p>

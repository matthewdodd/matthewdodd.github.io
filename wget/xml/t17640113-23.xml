I took hold of them, and carried them to the watch-house: a woman came, and desired to look at their shirts; I opened their waistcoats, and the moment she looked at them, she said, Lord have mercy upon me! poor creatures, I am sorry for you. We carried them before the Bench of Justices, and they were committed: (He takes up a waistcoat and one of the shirts) these I took from Billet's back, and the other things from off Bevas, (one shirt, 2 waistcoats, and one pair of stockings.) I was desired to assist the officer in carrying them to New Prison: the prisoners were pretty much in liquor when I took them. Billet swore he would sell his soul and body and all for a groat, nor did he care if his body was thrown in the street to the dogs.</p>

I remember on 20th Feb., in the Court in Guild<lb></lb>hall, the case of Ingham and Primrose being tried—the prisoner was examined as a witness on the part of the plaintiff; I administered the oath to him—at the time of his examination, he had this bill in his hand—I heard the question asked of him as to the state of the bill when he first received it—hesaid it was perfect; to the best of my recollection he said he received it at the Surrey County Court, in satisfaction for a debt of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I heard him asked where he had kept the bill—he said in one of the middle pockets of a pocket book, which he produced from his pocket at the time—as far as I can recollect, this is the pocket book he produced—I heard him asked to explain how the bill had become pasted together, and he said, just before he presented it, he found it was worn into two pieces, and he took it into his office and pasted it, or joined it together; that he received it just before it became due, and I think he said something about going to Liverpool, and wanting some money—I have here the notes of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the drawer of this bill—it has been in two pieces—I delivered this bill to the defendant—this is the County Court sum<lb></lb>mons—Idelivered this identical bill to the defendant—I had put this piece of gum paper on it at Mr. Davis', in Milk Street; I asked Mr. Edwards for a bit of gum paper—after it had been gummed together, I produced it to Mr. Smith, to Mr. Shepherd, and to Henry Wigg—that was before I delivered it to the defendant—the original object of its being drawn was to get it dis<lb></lb>counted—itwas in my possession for that purpose—Mr. Primrose accepted it for that purpose on the day it bears date, 16th March, 1857—I afterwards returned this bill to Mr. Primrose, at the latter end of March, or the fore end of April—he asked me if I had got it in my pocket—I gave it him, and as soon as I gave it him he tore it in half—that was in Lawrence Lane—one part fell on the ground; I picked it up and put it into my pocket—I said, "That won't do for me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Between the time of the bill being torn and you delivering it to King, had you any communication with Primrose on the subject of re-issuing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think I had, before I gave it to King—when I took up the bit, and had the two pieces, I said to Primrose that I would not deliver it up till he brought the other back—he had a cross bill—I do not believe he was any party to my giving the bill to King at the Southwark County Court—I am quite sure that when I gave this bill to King, it was in its present state, except this small tear—it was pasted together—I believe this is the paper that was delivered to me by Mr. Davis' clerk.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050121"></xptr>
               <p>let it go out of my hands to any other person—I asked Mr. Smith, a builder—Iasked Mr. Wigg, and he said it would not do, being defaced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But what attempt had you made to discount it before it was torn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was filled up in Mr. Hill's office—I never tried any one but Mr. Hill, to get it discounted, before it was destroyed—I believe Primrose was present—Iasked Mr. Hill, then and there, to discount it; and he said he would keep it a day or two, and see what he could do—he gave it me back—Primrosewas not present when he gave it me back—I think I did not try to discount it, except with Hill, till it was destroyed—I think not—I cannot bring it to my memory—I cannot tell how long after Hill refused to discount it I saw Primrose—I and he were trying to raise money—I cannot tell how soon afterwards I told him of this—I was staying in Blossoms Inn; and he came and called me out—I believe I had told him before that, that I could not get the discount—the bill was torn at the bottom of Blossoms Inn Yard, in Lawrence Lane—he tore it in two pieces; first one fell on the ground, and then the other—I took the two pieces and put them into my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say "This is an unsafe place for two pieces of paper to be left; I will take care that they shall not come to any harm?" or did you say "I shall not give these up till you return the other bill?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might say both—Itold him I would not allow that until I had the other back—I cannot recollect whether I said a word of that when I was examined in the Court of Common Pleas—Primrose and I went up to put in a plea, in tie action by Ingham against John Primrose—I came to prove that the bill was torn—I believe I was the only witness examined for Primrose; I believe I said, when I was examined as a witness, "I picked up the pieces and put them into my pocket, saying, it was better not to leave such things in the street"—I told Primrose I would not allow the bill to be torn—I do not remember that I said in the Court of Common Pleas that I would not—I spoke to Primrose about re-issuing the bill, before I gave it to King—I saw Primrose a few days afterwards—I did not see King in the counting house; I saw him, and gave him the bill—I cannot tell how long before that I had seen Primrose; I saw him on 2d April, and gave him a 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—that was after this bill was torn by Primrose, and before I gave it to King—I am sure I cannot tell whether anything passed between me and Primrose on 2d April—I told him what I had done by paying it to King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me this moment that it was before you paid it to King? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect what I did say—Primrose lives at No. 8, St. Martin's Lane—King served me with a writ in Sept.—I and Primrose applied to a Judge for leave to defend the action—I was served with a writ, and Mr. Primrosesaid he was—he and I went together to the Judges' Chambers for the purposeof being allowed to defend the action; he and I both made an affidavit—the action was tried in February, at Guflhall—from the time that I and Prim<lb></lb>rose made the affidavit, till the action, I do not recollect that I told Mr. King one syllable about tearing the bill—I gave instructions to the attorney what to put in the affidavit—I think I told him to say in the affidavit about tearing the bill; I will not be positive—I told him to put in the defence the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not be positive whether I told him to say one syllable about tearing the bill—I cannot say whether I said that I bad pasted this bill together without the knowledge or authority of Primrose, and issued it again without his knowledge—I cannot say whether I swore I had committed a frand—I do not think I had any additional piece of gum to use besides what was on the gum paper—the bill was folded in a square, I think, as it is now, except this little tear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the London Hospital—on Saturday, the 1st of June, I saw James Patten walking out of the hospital into the drying grounds, where the prisoner was cleaning a bedstead—I heard him ask his father to assist him in with some bedsteads out of the drying ground, where they were washing them—he refused to do so—deceased said there were three or four bed-steads to be taken in—the prisoner's father said" I ain't going to help you "—with that deceased walked from where he was standing and struck the prisoner's father three times with his fist on the left ear—the prisoner was then about eight or ten yards from them—the prisoner left where he was cleaning the bedstead, picked up this bar of iron (<hi rend="italic">producing an iron leg of a bedstead</hi>) and struck the deceased one blow, and he fell—I picked him up—he made two attempts to get at the prisoner afterwards, and I prevented him and advised him to go up to the receiving-room and get his head dressed—he walked there himself—I did not take him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the deceased having hold of the old man by the throat—I was about eight yards from them—the father's back was towards me—he is rather an old man—I saw the first blow struck—about ten or eleven seconds elapsed from the time the first blow was given by deceased and the blow that was given by the prisoner with the weapon—it all occurred momentarily—I did not notice that the prisoner tried to strike deceased's arm—at the time deceased was coming away from prisoner's father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the London Hospital—on the 1st of June the deceased, James Patten, came into the hospital—the nurse told me that he had tumbled over a bedstead—I examined him—I thought at first that he was only suffering from a laceration of the scalp, and I sent him out—he walked about and showed no symptoms for some time—he was brought back speech<lb></lb>less and paralysed on the right side, and I found a compound fracture of the skull—he was then trephined and the fragments were raised—he died in the hospital on the 5th of June—on the Wednesday I made a post-mortem examination—he had a depressed fracture of the parietal bone—there was effusion of blood at the base of the brain, on the right hemisphere—that might have been caused by a blow—the effusion of blood was the cause of death—the trephining would not increase the effusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The arteries, or vessels of the brain were some what degenerated—I should think the wound was due to a blow—the effusion would be a natural consequence of the blow; it would not have taken place else—there was not disease enough to cause it; if there had been more disease it is possible that effusion might have resulted without the blow—I think I can say positively that effusion resulted from the blow—he was a strong muscular man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer R</hi>). I took the prisoner in custody on 3rd of June, and charged him with a violent assault upon Patten—he said it was a very bad job; he did not mean to hit him on the head; he meant to hit him on the arm.</p>

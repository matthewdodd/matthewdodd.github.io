            . The prisoner at the bar and I went out together a house-breaking, for about six months last past, particularly last August, we got a hatchet, which we had laid by for that use; we went to look for it, and it was taken away about the 23d or 24th of August; then he said he could carry-me to a place where we could get a chisel, and that would do as well, so we went to this shop, and broke open the prosecutor's chest. I took out forty-one 36 s. pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the shop before?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I never was at it before nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go with the prosecutor afterwards?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, I was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know it was the prosecutor's chest?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I know no otherwise but by the quantity of the money, and the disposition of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We spent it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you of it?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I had about thirty of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have so much more than the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He did not know that I had so much. I took some out of it for my self, and the rest we shared.</p>
               <p>Q. Who broke the chest open?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He did, and I found the money; he took some tools.</p>

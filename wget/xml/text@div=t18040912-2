               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you made any application to the prisoners on the part of the prosecutor, that if so much money was paid down, there would be an end of the business? - A. I heard him say, if he had his money, and was paid for his coat, he would drop it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable belonging to the Public-office, Shadwell; I was sent by the Magistrate with the other officer; when we came into the house, they were all dancing; as soon as I came into the house, the prisoner Harris ran out of the house at the window; I brought her back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search either of them? - A. I did not; we had enough to do to get Mrs. Beard to the Office.</p>
               <p>Beard's defence. He came into the house with Williams; I was not present at the first beginning of it; I know no more of it than though I had not been there; a woman brought me a letter, I was talking with her, and when he came down stairs, they said he wanted to go away without paying the lady a compliment.</p>
               <p>Johnson's defence. The gentleman went up stairs; when he came down, I was in the yard; he came into the yard, and got scuffling about my clothes; I told him to let me alone, and pushed him from me; he had been up stairs about two hours.</p>
               <p>The other prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Finch, who keeps the Cock public-house, at Clapham. About a quarter to twelve o'clock, on the night of the 29th of October, I left a cash-box containing 15 sovereigns, and about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, on a chair in the tap-room—we were about putting the persons out of the house—I was the last person up, and shut the people out—I did not let any one in—I went up stairs without returning to the tap-room—I missed the cash-box at seven the next morning—the prisoner Cooke slept in the house that night—he was not a regular servant-we gave him no wages—he did odd jobs about the house—he was discharged next day, but not on account of this—he came back to the house after<lb></lb>wards, but was not in any employ—I have known Hardman some time, and always understood him to be honest till this time.</p>

I was on duty at the police station at Clapham, on the 20th of November, when Cooke was there—a man named Laing came in—there is a wooden partition in the station—I was on one side the partition, and Cooke and Laing on the other—I could hear what passed between them—I heard Laing ask him if he did not know who committed the robbery—he said at first he did not—Laing said, "Did not you take the money and the cash-box, and you and Hardman divide it between you?"—Cooke replied that he did, that he went into the tap-room about seven o'clock in the morning, and saw the cash<lb></lb>box on the chair, that he took it away up the yard, broke it open, and took the money out of it—he said he kept 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. himself, and gave Hardman 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he hid in a place where they cleaned the knives, that he fetched the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. away another day, and he gave his sister a part of it—he said he had the cash-box in the cowshed, under the straw—after I heard that I sent for Mr. Finch, who came and charged him with stealing it—I believe Laing is a labourer, a cousin to Cooke—he lives at Clapham—there had been some inquiry about some new clothes which the prisoners had.</p>

Hardman delivered himself into my custody on the 24th of December—I cautioned him against saying any thing to criminate himself—he said he wished to tell the truth—I said, "About what?"—he said, "About that affair of Cooke's and the cash-box"—a person with him advised him to say no more till he went before the Magis<lb></lb>trate—he afterwards said he knew nothing of the robbery, but he went to Acre-lane with Cooke in the morning, and in going home Cooke pulled out a bag and gave him two sovereigns—he was afraid to take them at first, but he did, and he afterwards gave him two more sovereigns—he said he was afraid to take them, but having no victuals he took them—that he went to New Bond-street to see Cooke's sister, Cooke gave her some of the money, and then they went to a lodging, where they stopped a fortnight—I stated all this before the Magistrate—I believe it was taken down—he said all I have stated now in going along to the station, all about Cooke giving him the two sovereigns—the sister lives in service in New Bond-street—he said this before he went to the Magistrate.</p>

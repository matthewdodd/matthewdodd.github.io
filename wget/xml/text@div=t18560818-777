                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Kesterton, coach builders, of Long-acre. It is part of my duty to take in every carriage which is sent to repair, and take an inventory of everything in it before the parties who bring it leave the place—on 9th June, about 12 o'clock in the day, a carriage came in which had been to a wedding—there were two "cushions in it—it was left at the back of the factory, in Wilson—street—in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I went back, and missed the cushions—they were covered with silk, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe this to be it, but there is no mark on it.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It ia not an uncommon covering? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the pattern, but the colour is—it was a new carriage altogether—it had only been out for four hours—this silk appears to have been used for a cushion covering, from it's general outline and shape—it is rather wider in front than behind, and hero are holes where the tufts have been—a small strip has been cut off round the edges, to get it off of the cushion—here is a selvedge edge at one end—these two pieces are not the same size, but they bear the same proportion to each other as the fore and hind cushions do—they were made at Mr. May's, who supplies our place with materials—he is not here to show that he has not supplied other places with the same materials.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Edwin Kesterton. I recollect two cushions being missed on 11th June—I have not the least doubt that this silk formed part of the covering of the cushions of the carriage—it was made expressly for us, and therefore I do not think it could be used by other people.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policesergeant, F</hi> 17). On 24th July I found this silk in a box, which was locked, in the prisoner's front bedroom, the same box as the linen—there were five boxes there, and I took some linen from every one—the prisoner's wife produced the key—she went down to fetch it into the room where her husband was—I followed her, and she came out with a bunch of keys—George Stedman, 158 F, was in the room where her husband was—he is not here.</p>

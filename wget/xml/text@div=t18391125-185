                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge in King-street, Tower<lb></lb>hill. On the evening of the 25th of November, I had been paid off from the <hi rend="italic">Hercules</hi>, Queen's ship, at Sheerness, and took 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I came to London and went to the White Swan public-house, between nine and ten o'clock that evening—the prisoner came in, I had never seen her before—she asked me for something to drink—I said I wanted nothing to do with her; but she stopped and I told her she might drink out of my pot—I drank rather too freely, and all I remember is, that I found myself next morning in the watch-house, my tin case was gone, and my sovereigns which had been in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner disputing with a cab-man about his fare, about two o'clock in the morning—the cab-man demanded 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner put her hand into her bosom, and said she had lost it—I heard something jink in her bosom—I asked her what it was—she said it was his discharge (pointing to the prosecutor who was drunk in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and asleep)—I took from her this tin-box, and found it contained three sovereigns and a seaman's discharge—I took her to the station-house, and she was asked by the sergeant if she had any more—she denied that she had, and said he had given it her to take care of—she was told she would be searched—she then said she had five shillings—she took down her stockings, and two half-crowns and a shilling dropped from her.</p>

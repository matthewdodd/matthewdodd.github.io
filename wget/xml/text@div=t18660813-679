                  </hi>. I am cab inspector at the Ludgate Station of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway—on the 10th July, in consequence of information, I went to the top of the incline at the Ludgate Station, and saw three boys on the line between Skinner Street and Seacole Lane—a train was about leaving at the time—I got into the guard's break van at the end of the train, and on the way down the incline I saw the prisoner take a brick in his hand and place it on the metals—I saw him pick up a second and place that on—I also saw him pick up a third, but before he had time to place that on I jumped out of the van and caught him with it in his hand—on the way to the station he told me he had only laid one brick on, and would never do it again—the boys must have climbed over a wall eight feet high to get on to the line.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe there is a great quantity of dirt against the wall, is there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—from the top of the mound to the top of the wall it is nearly eight feet high—there is no other part of the wall that the boys could get over—I saw three boys on the line—this was about a quarter to eight in the evening—the train that I was in was going from four to six miles an hour—I looked out of the door—the boys were before</p>

               <p>me on my right, as I was going along—the van I was in was at the end of the train—I had to look along the side of the train—when I first saw them they were about 200 yards from me—when I jumped out I was about four yards from the prisoner—the other boys ran away—some of the houses there overlook the line—the people in the road cannot overlook it—the prisoner is between eleven and twelve years of age—he seemed very much frightened.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take him on the line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—he had a brick in his hand at the time—the placing of the brick on the line might endanger the train.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Clark, and live at No. 7, Bear Alley, Farringdon Street—on the evening of the 10th July, about eight o'clock, I was looking out of my first window, from which I have a distinct view of the line of railway—I saw three or four boys on the wall looking over the line—there is a little place there where they can get up and stand on the wall and get over—I saw two on the line—one laid a brick on the line, and he got away, but the other who did not lay the brick on the line was taken; that was the prisoner—I am sure he did not place the brick on the line—I saw him taken into custody—the other boy ran up the steps and got away.</p>

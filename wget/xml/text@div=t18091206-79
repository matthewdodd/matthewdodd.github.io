            . I let a house to Mrs. Birch for thirty pound a year, with the fixtures, a range, and copper. The prisoner married this woman, she lived with him a fortnight or three weeks, and then she ran away from him. On twelfth night I had the key of the house given me, by the prisoner's son, the prisoner had gone away and locked up the house. The iron range and copper, he had pulled out of the brick work and sold them; he said, he had a right to take them away, as he understood his wife had bought them.</p>

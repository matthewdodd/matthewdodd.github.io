                  </hi>. I am a tea-dealer, and live on the Pavement, The prisoner was my town-traveller—he was to collect moneys for me, and take orders three days in a week—the orders were made up, and a bill of parcels, and it was his duty to take them to the customers the next morning—if he received money it was his duty to bring it home and enter it in the cash-book—I have the book here—no one in particular kept it—it is the book to which I used to refer to see what money had been paid—if the prisoner received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Mr. Denyer on the 7th May he has not accounted for it, or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Brant—I believe the prisoner left on 30th July, bat I was ill.</p>

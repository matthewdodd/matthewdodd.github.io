                  </hi>. I reside at 82, Bishopsgate-street, and am a linen-draper—this print (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my property—it was safe on 23d June about 8 o'clock, as near as I can recollect, and about five or ten minutes afterwards I saw it in the constable's possession—it waft brought back to me—I had seen the prisoners loitering about the outside of the shop about five minutes before I missed the print—I had occasion to go out merely across the road, and on my return the print was stolen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 656). I was employed by the prose<lb></lb>cutor, on 23d June, to watch the premises—about a quarter-past 8 I saw both the prisoners and another man pass by the shop—they came back again and passed the shop a second time, and went towards Spital-square—about a quarter to 9 the two prisoners came back and looked in the window for a short time, the male prisoner standing a few yards off—the woman went into the shop, where there was a shawl hanging about three yards in the shop—she held it out with her right hand, so as to hide the persons behind the counter—the man followed her, and lifted the right skirt of his coat and put it over a piece of print—he then ran across the road to Acorn-street, where he turned his head, and seeing me behind him he threw them down and run up Acorn-street very fast—I ran after him—be was about to turn into Skinner-street when I caught hold of him—he threw himself down, and when on the ground he caught hold of my right leg. and tried to bite it, and was very violent—I stooped down to relieve myself of him, and he said, "You b—, I will scratch your eyes out"—while I had him on the ground the female pri<lb></lb>soner came up and called me everything she could lay her tongue to—she said, "You b—, you will kill the man"—she said, "I saw who took it; it was not him at all"—other constables then came up, and she made herself scarce</p>

               <p>—I saw her on the following Saturday at the Spitalfields station, and charged her with it—she said she knew nothing about it—I saw her afterwards at Bishopsgate-street station, and she said, "I picked up the print and gave it to a woman"—I had seen the prisoners together about three-quarters of an hour before she entered the shop—I have no doubt about her being the woman—the print was about two or three feet in the shop on the left-hand side—there is a lobby somewhere about three yards long; a window turns round in the shop, and the shawl was hanging close inside the shop—the female held the shawl out, so that no person could see from the inside of the shop—the prisoner followed her in behind and lifted the tail of his coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in St. George's-row, Pimlico. On the 15th of April I was at the King's-head public-house, and left there between twelve and one o'clock in the morning to go home—I did not see anybody when I turned my back from the door—I then received a blow in the back part of my head, which cut a hole through the back of my hat, and wounded my head—I cannot recollect anything more, how many blows I had, but my head was afterwards wounded in several places—when I came to my<lb></lb>self, I found myself on my back, holding the prisoner by the legs—I cried out "Murder"—a policeman came and I gave the prisoner in charge—he was taken to the station, and I to St. George's hospital—my wounds were dressed there—I remained there until Friday, and came out as an out-patient—my head I was wounded, and cut in two places—at the back and on the crown, and several bruises on the back part—they bled a great deal.</p>

I am single, and live at No. 4, Ship-court, Horseferry-road—on Wednesday, the 15th of April, about one o'clock, I was passing the King's-head public-house, and saw two men standing against the door—I I heard them say something, in consequence of which I waited to watch them—they</p>

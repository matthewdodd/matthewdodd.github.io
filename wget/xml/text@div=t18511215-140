                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner coming out of Mrs. Bowman's shop on 29th Nov.—he turned to the right, then crossed the road, turned to the left, and walked very fast—I went into the shop and heard something—I came out and followed the prisoner; when he had got about forty yards, he turned down a street and put up his hand to the top of some palings—he then stooped down and put his hand to his shoe, as though he was tying it—I went to him, took hold of his arm, and said he must go back with me to a shop where he had passed a bad sovereign—as I was going back he said, "What good will it do you to take me back; who are you?"—I told him he would know that presently—an officer came and took him, and I and the officer went to where I saw the prisoner stoop, and found the loaf on the step of a door—I examined the rails, but found nothing there.</p>

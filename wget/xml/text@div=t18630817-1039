                  </hi>. I am a single woman, living at 26, Bemberry<lb></lb>gardens, Pimlico—I know the prisoner by sight—I first saw her on Thursday, 30th July, on board the steamer <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi>, coming from Hamburg to London—I was asking the steward if I could have a berth, and he said I could have the bottom one in the fore cabin—the prisoner was sitting opposite, and she said she had no berth and she had no money to pay so much for one—she said she had paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and had only one left to go to London, which she showed me—I was very sorry for her, and then she wanted me to say she was my friend, and allow her to sleep with me—I said, no, that was not right, but I would make her comfortable by the side of my berth—I had a purse containing six sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in my bosom, and when I went to bed I put it under my pillow, and fell asleep—the prisoner was then by the side of my berth—about half an hour after I awoke, I missed my purse—I had not left my berth before I missed it—I searched for it, but could not find it—the prisoner was the first person I spoke to about it. and I told her I had lost it, and what was in it, and asked her if she would be kind enough to assist me to look for it, which she did for about a minute, and she then said, "My head is very dizzy, I must go up on deck"—she went, and came down again very ill in about a quarter of an hour—I could not find my purse, and began to be very ill myself—I com<lb></lb>plained to a gentleman about my loss on the Saturday after—amongst the silver in the purse, there was a shilling which was very much rusted and discoloured, rust-colour—when we arrived in London the prisoner was searched on board the ship—I then looked at the money which was found upon her and recognised the rusted shilling—I was not present when any questions were asked her about it—she remained in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in all the voyage.</p>

On 2d August between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning, I was called on board the <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi>—from something the prosecutrix said to me, I went into the fore-cabin and saw the prisoner—I told her she was charged with stealing six sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver from a purse belonging to the prosecutrix—she said, "I don't know anything about it"—I said, "Have you got any money about you?"—she first said "No" and afterwards said "Yes"—I asked her to let mo see it; she said that it was nothing to me—I said, "I</p>

               <p>am a police-constable and you must let me see what money you have got; if you do not do so, I will have the female searcher to search you"—she then put her hand in her bosom, and pulled out a gold watch and chain, and this purse containing six sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I had previously asked the prosecutrix in the prisoner's presence if there was any portion of the money she could identify—she said there was one shilling tarnished and rusty—she did not identify it at that time, it was not there—the captain afterwards gave me these five shillings—I showed them to the prosecutrix and she identified this one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not seem to have said anything about this conversation with the prisoner before to day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are some slight mistakes in those depositions which I have pointed out before—my deposition was read over to me and I signed it—I did not tell them then that they had made any mistakes, but I have seen them since—I saw them in the clerk's office—I have been twelve years in the force—I said I found three half-sovereigns—the woman charged her with stealing two—the shilling which the prosecutrix has identified here to-day is not one of those shillings which I took from the prisoner—I received it from the captain.</p>

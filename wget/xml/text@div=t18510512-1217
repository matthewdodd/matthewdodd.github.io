                  </hi>. I live at 3, Warren-lane, in Woolwich parish. On 6th May I fastened all the doors and windows, and about nine o'clock went to bed—I got up next morning, about half-past seven, and found the back and front doors wide open, and the window-shutters torn away from the hinges., and made into four pieces—I missed two shirts, a handkerchief, a towel, some bread, and other articles, from a cupboard, where I had left them safe the night before—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—I consider them worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 122). In consequence of information, on 7th May, I went with Sergeant-Major Hadnill to the Marine Barracks, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him if he was with a young girl between one and two o'clock that morning—he said, "Yes"—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing two shirts, and other articles, from a house in Warren-lane—he said, "You are mistaken; I know nothing about it"—I said, "I have reason to believe you do, and I must see your knapsack"—he said, "I have nothing there"—I said, "I must go up and see"—going up to the barrack-room he said, "I have got the things in my baggage"—I searched his baggage, and found some of the things there, and some in his bosom, and Hadnill found some—he then said, "I must have made a mistake, and got into the wrong room"—he afterwards said the girl had robbed him of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; she was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi> Gladwin asked the prisoner whether he was with a girl last night—he said he was—Gladwin asked what the girl's name was that had robbed him—he said he could not tell—Gladwin said he should take him on suspicion of breaking into a house in Warren-lane, and stealing several articles there—the prisoner denied it, Gladwin said he should examine his knapsack; and on going towards the room he said, "I did so, and have the things in my baggage"—we went to the room, and the articles were found in his baggage, except the handkerchief, which was in his bosom, and the razor and loaf on the shelf—when the; bread was found I said, "This is not bread that is served out for your use?"—he said, "That is one of the loaves I took."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has he been in the regiment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nineteen years—I have been in it sixteen years—I cannot say whether I have known the prisoner all that lime, as be may have been at sea—I am sent here by the commanding-officer, and have extracts from the Court-martial book—he was tried on 18th Aug., 1849, for improperly obtaining a pair of boots, and making away with them—he was also tried after that for absence, and making away with a pair of boots—I never saw him drunk—I did not see him when he came in on this morning; I cannot say whether he was drunk; he was not reported so by the sergeant of the guard—he had had a pass for the night.</p>

I am a coachmaker's labourer; I live at No. 19, White-horse-yard, Drury-lane - I saw the child that evening sitting on the step of a door, in York-street, Covent-garden, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock - there were two respectable persons talking to her; I went up, and she had no shoes on - my wife keeps a little shop, and sells children's clothes, and shoes, and toys - the prisoner came there that night, and offered this pair of children's boots or shoes for sale; I asked her what she wanted for them; she said, 1s. - I asked if she would not take 9d; she said, no, she would take 10d. - I looked particularly at them, and said they would not suit me - she took them out and I followed her to a pawnbroker's with them; she took them just inside the door, and I gave her into custody, on suspicion that these were the shoes belonging to the child I had seen in York-street.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had found the shoes in Monmouth-street.</p>

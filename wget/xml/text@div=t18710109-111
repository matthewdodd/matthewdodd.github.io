               <p>at the door, Davis answered it—I said "Do you know that man?" (<hi rend="italic">painting to the prosecutor</hi>)—she made no answer, but walked into the parlour—I fol<lb></lb>lowed her, with the prosecutor, and Detective Taylor and an interpreter—I began searching the room—Davis had this purse in her hand—I asked her what she had got there—the male prisoner, who was present, said "That money is mine, it is what my wife has earned by prostitution"—Ann Handy was there, and a man not in custody, and a female—the prisoners are re<lb></lb>lated, they are mother, son, and daughter—I said to George "Who is your wife?"—he pointed to the female not in custody, and said "Her"—she then said "It is my money"—George Handy said "No; 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it is mine, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is yours"—Maria then said "It is my money"—I took the purse, counted the money, and found 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English gold, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and a penny—I told the three prisoners they must consider themselves in my custody, for robbing the prosecutor of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other property—on the way to the sta<lb></lb>tion Maria said "It is no use telling you a lie, it is what he gave me to have connection with me in different ways"—I asked her how much; she said "All you have got"—after they were charged at the station, Maria, who was sitting on a bench separate from the other two prisoners, dropped this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then went back to the house, searched the front room thoroughly, and in a basket under the window I found the life-pre<lb></lb>server, covered up with some old clothes—I went into a back room occupied by a young man not in custody, and unlocked two drawers of a chest with the key which Maria dropped at the station, and found a quantity of female's under-clothing; also a black jacket and a Paisley shawl—I unfolded the shawl and shook it, and these two pocket-handkerchiefs fell out containing 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English gold, a 100-franc piece, and a 40-franc piece, which the pro<lb></lb>secutor identifies—there were some red stains and some white powder on the handkerchiefs—to the best of my belief I have seen Davis wearing this shawl and this black jacket—the landlady said, in the prisoners' presence, that the front room was occupied by the two female prisoners, and the ante-room by the male prisoner, who was about to leave in a week—I have known Davis living there eight or nine months.</p>

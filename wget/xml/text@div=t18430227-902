                  </hi>. I live at No. 21, Quaker-street, Bethnal-green. On the 21st of Feb. I was in Birdcage-walk, and met the prisoner in company with another man, who was carrring a spinning-wheel—they went about two hun<lb></lb>dred yards after my seeing them, and pitched the wheel down at the corner of an alley—they saw me watching them—I saw the prisoner make a com<lb></lb>munication to the other, by which I knew that he saw me following them, and I heard the man say, "I have done with it," or, "I will have no more to do with it," and he went towards Hackney-road—they were together when the man pitched it down, and said, "I will have no more to do with it"—he went one way and the prisoner the other—I went after the prisoner, and told Sarah Birch to keep her eye on the wheel—the prisoner walked a few yards and then ran—I ran, calling, "Stop thief"—he was stopped about two hundred yards off, but a man let him go before I got up—I afterwards conveyed the wheel to Nelson and he claimed it.</p>

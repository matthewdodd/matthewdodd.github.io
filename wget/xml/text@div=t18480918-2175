I live at Nottingham-place, Commercial-road On 8th Sept., in the evening, I was going into Fieldgate-street, and was accosted by some one—I turned suddenly round, and was struck on the back of my head with a blunt instrument—I called out, "Murder!" and fell insen<lb></lb>sible—I recovered, and missed my watch and seals, and found my pocket which had had four sovereigns and one shilling in it, turned out—they were safe five minutes before—the guard was left round my neck—Benjamin came up, and gave me my watch, without the seals—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

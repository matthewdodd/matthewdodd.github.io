On Tuesday the 10th of this month, master, mistress, and all the family, went from our house at Chelsea, in the evening, to London; there was nobody in the house but the prisoner and I, besides a little child about three years and a half or four years old. I went to bed about eleven, and, as near as I can guess, about twelve the prisoner came to bed to me, and with his pulling me I awaked and struggled with him as long as I could. No person could ever struggle more than I did to get away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room did you lie?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I lay in the kitchen all the while I lived there. He did me no harm in the kitchin, upon my word. I ran from him about four o'clock, or a little after, in the morning, up a pair of stairs as high as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he naked, or had he his cloaths> on?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. He was naked in bed, and had nothing on but his shirt. He got in while I was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he used to lie?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. He usually lay in the hall. He followed me up stairs immediately. There he insisted upon lying with me. I begged it as a favour, with good words, that he'd go away. He said said, he would lie with me; we were both naked at that time. There was a bed in the room; he got me into the bed by violence, under the clothes; I called out. There he had carnal knowledge of my body, without my consent; upon my oath it was not with my consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I was very wet and very bad. My body was penetrated.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in bed before he had knowledge of your body?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I believe not a quarter of an hour; it was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out in the kitchin?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I did, and above stairs too, but there was no help near. I applied to Mr. Brown, a lawyer, the next day in the morning, and told him how I had been used.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not apply that very day?</p>
               <p>M. Acres. I could not, because there was nobody to take care of the house but myself. I can't say he beat or abused me that way.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination, she said, she had lived ten months in the family; that during the time till this affair they had lived together as fellow<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260034"></xptr> servants in good harmony; that there was one

            , a fellow servant. That she had no regard for either any more than fellow servants. That she had never declared to any person that she had had improper familiarity with either of them. Being asked whether she had not owned she had with Lisk, to Mrs. Johnson, she answered, she never did say so, and if Mrs. Johnson is willing to say that she has said so, she is welcome; be it to her conscience. That Mrs. Johnson's child lay with her that night; that she does not know what the prisoner was left at home for; that Lisk lay at the bottom of a long field; that after the child was in bed, she sat up a little time; that she said she was cold after supper, and the prisoner offered her a dram, and she refused it; that she drank a little rum and water in a silver cup, which he gave her; that this was in the hall, where she unpinned her handkerchief and gown only, then went into the kitchin and went to bed; that he had business to do in the kitchin, and was backwards and forwards after she was in bed; that he was only in his shirt when he came into bed; that he was in bed with her from about twelve to four. He behaved in a very rough manner there, but no harm done. The child slept all the while, for what she knew; that she struggled as much as possible to keep him off; that she cried out above 3 times; that she was a chaste virgin before that night; that there was a lock upon the dining-room door, and the door where she ran to up stairs had only a button on the inside, by which she thought to secure herself, but he was at the top of the stairs as soon as she; that she endeavoured to hinder his putting her into the bed; that he put her in between the sheets; that before the bed was not turned down, as she believes, but said she was in such an agony and fright, she could not tell exactly as to such things; that when she was in bed, it was past her strength to get away from him; that what he did was against her will in any consideration whatsoever; that she could struggle no longer, and did not consent. Being asked if he laid violent hands on her, she replied no more than to get his will of her; that he lay with her but a very little time after he had got his end; that when the gardner and coachman knocked at the window, about six, he went away from her; and she, at the same time, was in a great agony, crying; that she does not know whether, just at that time, he was in the bed with her or no; that she came down into the kitchin quick after him; that not he, but she, opened the door to let them in; that she had put on only one petticoat in the kitchin before she opened the door; that immediately after she went up into the room above stairs, but could not tell for what. Being asked whether it was to put the bed to rights; she replied it was not. That the prisoner came down, and went to his own bed; that the prisoner got up, went to town, and left them together; that she told Lisk of it, soon after which the coachman was brewing; that she went to Mr. Brown, a lawyer, the next day, by Lisk and Mr. Saunderson's advice ; that she made no complaint to master and mistress, and that Mr. Brown told her it was better to say nothing.</p>
               <p>Being asked what she told the justice about marks of lost virginity, she replied: She said there were none, which she said she meant upon the sheets, but she found such on her own linnen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge I have laid with her in common. Here is a witness that has seen me in bed with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. M - . The prisoner has behaved extremely honest ever since I have known him. I have trusted him with large sums of money. I cannot conceive he would force a woman. I once went into the kitchin, about two o'clock in the morning, and called him by name; I saw him get off of the bed, but whether he was in bed or not I know not; she said, as he got off of the bed, Richard, how can you do so? I was before Justice Fielding; there she swore there were no marks of lost virginity. I do not remember whether she said upon the sheet or shift, but in general; and there also I think she said he had his clothes on while in the kitchin, and that he struggled with her between four and five hours. I am certain of this, as I am of any thing in the world. Then she said she got from him, and he undressed himself before he went up stairs to her. This she swore there. She likewise said he was with her a little better than an hour up stairs. The justice asked her how he came to leave her so soon; her expression was, she would not let him stay any longer.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examina tion he said, He had known the prisoner to be in the kitchin, where she lay, frequently at late hours, after she was in bed, for things he has wanted.</p>
               <p>Mr. N - . I was before Justice Fielding on the 17th of October, and among other questions, Mr. Fielding asked her if he was naked in the bed in the kitchin; she said he was not, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175210260035"></xptr> in his clothes; and that after she went up stairs, he went into his own room, undressed himself, and went up stairs naked. She likewise added, he lay with her an hour and a quarter up stairs, and that he would have lain longer, but she would not let him. He also asked her if there were marks of lost virginity, either on the linnen, or sheets; in the alternative, she did declare there were not. This question was asked upon her saying she was a perfect virgin before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Johnson. I have lived twelve months in the family the 30th of July. I had been at Rotherhithe, and when I came home this girl was crying. I asked her what she cried about; she replied she had with John ; I asked her how she came to be so foolish as to pitch upon such a fellow as he; she answered, she had passed many a favourable opportunity before, but could not account for this. I told her that I supposed it was not the first time; to which she replied, I never have lain with any but him, and I would not have my mother know it for the world.</p>

I asked her the reason of her swearing against the prisoner; she answered she would not have done it, but that he said she lay with John, (I don't know his surname) a servant in the family, and she could not tell how to be revenged of him in any other shape, than to swear a rape against him.</p>

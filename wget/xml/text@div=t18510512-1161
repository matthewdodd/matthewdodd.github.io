                  </hi>. I live in Field's-buildings, Houndsditch. On 22nd. April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner near Shoreditch Church—I was sober enough then to know what was going on, but do not recollect much after meeting her—I had two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, some coppers, and a shilling or two in my right-hand trowsers pocket just more before—I went with her to a public-house—I do not recollect anything till I got to the station—I called for some wine, but only recollect drinking a very small portion of it—I do not know what I paid for it—I did not give the prisoner any money—I did not miss my money till I was at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. On 22nd April I was at tire Halifax Arms, Mile-end New-town, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor there sitting together; the prosecutor was intoxicated—he appeared to be asleep, and incapable of taking care of himself—I saw, the prisoner put her band into his trowsers'-pocket and take something out—I laid hold of her hand—Mrs. Gascoyne came, and I saw her take some money from the prisoner's hand.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Gascoyne, the landlord of the Halifax Head, Princes-street, Mile-end New-town—the prisoner and prosecutor came there about half-past eight o'clock, and called for a quartern of port wine—they went out while I drew it, and were away about ten minutes—they then returned, and the prosecutor took part of a glass of wine—there were three females at the door, and one of them fastened on the prisoner's clog, and she asked the prosecutor to treat them to some gin—I saw the prisoner take something out of the prosecutor's pocket—I seized her hand, and took out a half-sovereign—a policeman was sent for, and she was given into custody—Meehan was not able to take care of himself, and I would not let him go without a policeman—when he first came he was not so intoxicated as he became in a few minutes after drinking the wine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines at Woolwich—on Sunday, 7th September, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I went into the tap<lb></lb>room of the Freemason's Tavern—I met Fishpool there with Lee, and Lacey with another girl—Fishpool asked me to pay for a pot of beer for him—I did so—he then asked me to pay for some gin for the girl, and the other one that was with him; and I did so, for some gin and cloves—I paid for several pots of beer, and four half-pints of gin for this girl and the other—there were six or seven in the room altogether—Fishpool afterwards asked me to have supper with him—I went, and he asked me to send for some beer, and I gave him half a crown—he asked me to have some supper—I said I did not want any—Fishpool said I was to give him my watch and chain, and money to take care of till Monday—I had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my Pocket when I went out, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I said I was quite capable of taking care of it myself—I had had some beer, but I knew what I was doing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220117"></xptr>
               <p>—I would not part with it to him, and he came to me and took it off me, whether I would or no, and said he should not let me stop there with that on—I said I was not going to stop there, I was going home—he said he should have the watch and the money and take care of it till the morning—I would not let him have it, but he forced it off me—he took the guard off in my neck and the purse out of my pocket—there was a white handled knife in my pocket, and they went to a box under the bed and pretended to lock it up, and said it would be all right till the morning—Lee was sitting on the bedside at that time—she went down stairs and came up with Lacey—Lacey asked me what I was doing there—and I said I should have nothing to do with him—he tried to get me out at the door—I said I should not go for him—he then kicked me and tried to get me outside—I said I should not go till <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> gave me my watch and money—they kicked me outside, and I sat down outside—a girl came up and asked me what I was doing there—I told her that they had taken my money, and I was going to sit there till I got it—she said, "Knock at the door," and she knocked—Lacey came, and I asked for <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—he said <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> was not in—I said that I knew he was, and then he kicked me out again—I identify this watch, knife, and gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as mine.</p>

I am single, and lived in the same house where the prisoners lodged—I remember going up stairs on Sunday evening, 7th September, and seeing Robert Clarkson sitting outside the door—he made a complaint to me, and I saw him rap at a bedroom door—Lacey answered it—I did not see Fishpool—Lacey kicked Clarkson three or four times, and pushed him down staire—I saw him lying down stairs—he was not insensible—Fishpool and Lee were in the same room with Lacey—I saw the policeman come to the house—previous to that I had seen Lee come out of the room with a bonnet in her hand—she went to No. 7, on the other side of the way, to Ann Burnett's room, and then came back into her own room again, where Lacey and Fishpool were—I did not see Ann Burnett at that time—I saw her ten minutes before this happened, at the bottom of the alley.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover, and live at No. 5, Broad-yard, Turnmill-street. On the 5th of September last, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I was at Friern-Barnet—I was coming out of the park, between Whetstone and Barnet—it is a field adjoining the road, called the park—I had a lot of beasts there—before I was pulled down I saw a whole lot of people standing against the gate—I knew none of them but the pri<lb></lb>soner—I have known him by sight for twelve months before—I had just crossed into the middle of the high road, and was thrown down five or six yards from the gate—I had passed the man, and the prisoner followed me, took me round the neck, and threw me down right in the middle of the road—by threw me in the road, and held me by the neck while the others undid my things—he came from behind—I am certain he is the man, from seeing him before—he blinded my face—I saw him as he caught hold of me, and I saw him as I lay on my back—thirteen or fourteen of them came round me—the prisoner knelt on my neek, and held his hands over my eyes, while the others ransacks me, he choked me so, that I could not breathe scarcely—mythings were all pulled down, and my breeches turned right over</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010021"></xptr>
               <p>my heels—it was after they had done the mischief to me that they unbuttoned my breeches and stripped them down all over my feet—that would prevent my running—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1/4., 1 knife, a pair of scissors, and a tobacco-box, about me—I lost every thing; my from my breeches pocket, and the other things from my jacket pocket—I had no smock-frock on—I felt them fumbling in my pocket, and every thing was taken—no<lb></lb>thing was left in the road; they even took stick which I was minding my cows with—my neck was as black as it could be for a fortnight after<lb></lb>wards, with their kneeling on it—I never heard them speak at all—I got nothing back—I did not see the prisoner again till last Thursday, when I saw him in the New Prison, Clerkenwell—he was not shown to me—he was among a number of other prisoners, and I picked him out—the prisoners were all put in a line, thirteen of fourteen, and I picked him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prionser</hi> Every thing he has sworn is false—he says it was in Friern-Barnet; and it was in Barnet, in Hertfordshire, where he was robbed. <hi rend="italic">Wit<lb></lb>ness</hi> I know the place very well, but do not know which county it is in—it was between Whetstone and Barnet, very little way from the tenth mile<lb></lb>stone on the high North-road—I do not know Fryern-Barnet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol on the northern road. I know the park and the gate the witness speaks of—the parishes join there—I am not certain whether it is in one parish or the other just there—it is in the high road—the prosecutor gave me information on the morning this happened, and complained of robbed—he particularly described one man, and another as short chubby man, besides—in consequence of which, I gave him information of the prisoner being in custody—last Wednesday I went with him to the New prison, and told the Deputy-Governor my business, and a line was formed in the yard—the prisoner was near about the centre of the others standing with the other prisoners—as soon as the prosecutors saw him, he said, "That is him, the tall man in the smock-frock"—he picked him out directly—the prisoner did not hear what he said that I know of—he might be twenty yards from him—it was a little after one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi> If he had a description of me, it is strange he could not find me—I live in the place he is patrol of, and I have never been from home. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> I knew the prisoner, but did not see him for more than two months after—he is a man I seldom saw, and I have seen the witness but once since—I did not know where to find Mills—I understood he was a job drover—I did not know he was Biggs' regular employ—but when I searched the prisoner on another case, I found a knife in his pocket, which I suspected was the prosecutor's, and I went to Biggs' men to inquire where he could be found.</p>

On Saturday, the 13th of February, I had ten sheep safe in my field; on Monday morning I was informed one was lost; I went and found the whole carcase of a sheep at Payne's shop, the butcher - it was hot; the watchman, Hall, shewed it to me; it appeared to be very badly cut up. I went to my field, and found the skin. I am sure it was the skin of my sheep. The carcase was compared with it - I am certain the carcase belonged to the skin. The head was left in the skin, and so were the feet. The bones of the legs corresponded. The prisoner said he found it in his road from Colnbrook.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 15th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at Hounslow, with a bag on his back, and asked him where he came from? he said from Colnbrook, and he was going to London; I asked him what he had got there? he said it was only a few blankets which he was going to take to his wife. I told him to put them down for me to see them - he did so, and said,</p>
               <p>"Watchman, I have only got a bit of meat, which I found in the road; I have got the price of a glass, you may as well take it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170028"></xptr>and let me go." I secured him, and took the bag to a butcher's shop, where Keene saw it; there was the carcase of a sheep in the bag - it was quite warm.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CRANAGE. I missed the sheep, and gave the prosecutor information.</p>

I am working for a ship chandler, and live at 28, Fauston Place, Rotherhithe—I am a Norwegian—on Monday night, l7th September, I was at the Black Horse public-house, Rotherhithe—I went in about 11 by myself—the prisoner came in after me with two of his mates—the prisoner asked the barmaid for a pot of beer—she served him with it, and asked them in Norwegian, in the best way she could, to go in and sit down—Reeves, who was sitting by my side, said "Andrew, you can speak Norwegian to them, tell them to please go in and sit down"—I got up and spoke to them in Norwegian to please go in and sit down—the prisoner got angry—he said he did not care for English or French, Norwegian or Swede, he could talk all sorts of language—he said that in English—one word brought on another—he said he had been to China and round the world—I questioned him as to what part of China—he said he had been to Hong Kong and Shanghai—I asked him if he had been to any more places in China—he said he had not—I told him I had been to more places round the coast of China—he got angry and challenged me out to fight—I said I would not fight—he asked me five or six times over to go out and fight with him—at last he went out and I went out just behind him—just as I stepped off the kerb Brown, who was standing behind me, said "Andrew, look out, he has got a big knife in his hand"—shortly after I stepped off the kerb out into the middle of the road the prisoner stabbed me at the side of the temple, and I fell right across the kerb—that is the last I recollect—I had not struck the prisoner—no blow was struck before he stabbed me—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Union Road, Rotherhithe—on the night of 17th September I was sent for to the Rotherhithe police-station—I there saw Brown and Wilson, Brown first—he had been brought there in a cart—he was in a very exhausted condition from the effects of a stab in the abdomen—there was not much blood from that wound, but at intervals from the mouth—he appeared to be dying, and I therefore requested the inspector to take his deposition, I thought the case so serious—I attended to him at the station, and accompanied him to Guy's Hospital, expecting that he would die on the road—I visited him there during the next three months four or five times—the wound was a punctured one, just below the breastbone; it had gone upwards and somewhat outwards, and from the symptoms which I observed sub<lb></lb>seqnently in the hospital it must have injured the small intestines, penetrated the diaphragm, and wounded the liver and lungs—the wound must have been between four and five inches in depth—in dressing the wound I had occasion to pass my finger into it, and my left forefinger went easily the whole length—it was just such a wound as I should expect a knife of this description to make—considerable force must have</p>

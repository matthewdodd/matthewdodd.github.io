On Friday, the 7th of January, the tax-gatherer called for 1l. 17s. 6d.; I paid him, and left some silver in a bag, which I put on the rum cask, behind me, while I served two or three people - it contained half crowns, shillings, and sixpences, but I cannot say how many. When I turned round it was gone; this was about one o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner was at that time taking dirty pots up stairs, and bringing down clean ones; she came down in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. I said, "Eleanor, have you moved my bag?" she said she had done nothing of the kind; I said nobody but I and her had been in the bar - she said she knew nothing of it - my brother came in at that time, and sent for a constable; eight pence was found tied in her handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the office and remanded - I was taking her to prison - I said nothing to her, but she told me she was very sorry for what she had done, and if I would go to the house, and look under the club-room stairs, I should find the money, for she had put it there; I went, and found the bag under the stairs - it contained the money stated in the indictment; it was among a parcel of old rubbish.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this said quite voluntarily? A. Yes; she said nothing of having done it in a joke, or that the appearance of the officer had frightened her, and prevented her returning it.</p>

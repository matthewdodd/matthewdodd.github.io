            . I live at Ealing, in Middlesex, and am a collar-maker - I occasionally buy horses for slaughter. On the 25th of August, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and told me he had a horse to sell; I asked where it was; I went with him, and saw it about a mile on the road, towards Hanwell; I gave him a guinea for it, and sold it to Mr. Ford, of Sharpe's-alley - Galloway saw it there; it was the horse I bought of the prisoner - it was a blind brown rusty mare; I am sure I bought it of the prisoner - I never saw him before: we walked a mile together to see the mare; I told him to bring it home to my house, and I would pay him, which he did, and I paid him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope the Jury will take it into consideration, and be as merciful as they possibly can.</p>

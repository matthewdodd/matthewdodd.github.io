                  </hi>. I am a cap-manufacturer, of Union-street, Borough—the prisoner was in my employ—it was his duty to cut out materials for caps, and give them to the cap-maker—he had access to the stock—I received in<lb></lb>formation, and on the 18th Oct. watched him, had him taken in charge, went with the policeman to his house, and found all these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had sold him none of them, nor authorized him to take them away.</p>

I took the prisoner on 18th Oct.—I went with Mr. Smith to 22, Belvedere-place, Southwark-bridge-road, and found this property produced—Mr. Smith claimed it—the prisoner said the buttons came from Ansell and Elliott's, and that he bought the materials for this child's dress of Mrs. Smith—those were the only things he gave any explanation of.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how she came by her death?</p>
               <p>Sadler. On Wednesday morning, the 21st of October, about half after eight in the morning, I sent the prisoner into the kitchen to breakfast; he had not been there above the space of a minute before I heard the report of a pistol very plain; I looked upon it then to be the watermen at the stairs, so took no notice of it; in about another minute, the prisoner came running out of the kitchen into the shop: he clapped his hands together, and said, what have I done! I hope I have done no great mischief; I immediately replied, good God! have you been letting off a piece without knowing the contents or consequence of it; to which he answered, yes; I ran for a surgeon immediately without ever looking at the deceased; when I returned I found her in the parlour with her right eye out; I took it to be hanging upon her cheek; she said what has your wicked boy done to me? I said Jenny, how did the accident happen? she said it was no accident, but that he said he would shoot her; she repeated the words two or three times. The surgeon looked at the wound, and then advised me to send her to the hospital, which I did; then I secured the boy. When we came before the magistrate, he said he was putting the pistol upon the shelf and it went off by accident. The next morning I went to the hospital to see the deceased; I told her what he had said; she said it was false, for he pointed it to her; I asked her, did he point it to your stomach, breast or face? she said he pointed it to my face, and said he would shoot me; that she desired him to lay it by, and it went off immediately. I found this powder and these flints, (producing them) in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177212090028"></xptr> his box among his clothes in his bed room facing the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose was the pistol?</p>
               <p>Sadler. It belonged to a boy in the neighbourhood; the prisoner borrowed it but the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is he?</p>
               <p>Sadler. About sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any quarrel between them?</p>
               <p>Sadler. There was never any to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. She said he pointed it to her, and said I will shoot you; was that a boyish trick, or what?</p>
               <p>Sadler. He took it from the place where he lay when he went to breakfast, pointed it to her and said he would shoot her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the pistol was loaded with?</p>
               <p>Sadler. Powder and wadden.</p>
               <p>Q. There did not appear in her face any kind of mark but of powder?</p>
               <p>Sadler. No, not as I learnt.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of wadden was it?</p>
               <p>Sadler. Paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the deceased if there was any quarrel between them?</p>
               <p>Sadler. I asked her if there had been any that morning; she said no.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he behaved himself?</p>
               <p>Sadler. Always very well; I have nothing to say against him in that respect. This is the pistol (Producing a large horse pistol.)</p>
               <p>Q. Will it stand upon a half cock?</p>
               <p>Sadler. No. He said he borrowed it for the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it will not stand upon a half cock?</p>
               <p>Sadler. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy when he came in to you seemed much frightned?</p>
               <p>Sadler. Yes; he seemed rather hurried and agitated, and said he hoped he had done no great mischief.</p>
               <p>Isabella Brown. I was sitting in the kitchen with the deceased the night before this happened; the prisoner brought the pistol into the kitchen, and said he had nothing to ram it with; he cut a bit of stick and charged it with powder and wadden; then he brought the pistol to me and shewed me with his finger how much he had put in it; I asked him how long he had had it; he said about an hour; I bid him take care what he did; that was all that passed; he took the pistol and the lamp into his bed room; the deceased desired him either to give her the light or put it out; he told her he would not for such a scotch whore; she desired me to speak to him; I begged of him to put the lamp out or give it the deceased; he would not; therefore I went up stairs, and told my mamma, that he had a light and a pistol in his bed room; she came down stairs, and desired him to put it out, he said he would put it out when he had done with it; she said she would not stir till he had put it out, for that not only themselves but all the neighbourhood might be blown up. The deceased was at the stair foot; she said he had put it out.</p>

            . I am a neighbour to Mr. Sadler. About half past eight in the morning of the 21st of October, my boy, who was at my door, told me he heard the report of a piece that had been fired at Mr. Sadler's; I heard the shrieks of somebody; I went over to Mr. Sadler's; I saw the deceased standing against the parlour door; there was something hung out upon her right cheek, which appeared to me to be her eye; she said, madam, what shall I do? he has ruined me for ever: I said Jenny, how came it about? she said he threatened to do it, but she did not think he would be so wicked; the boy was in the shop; I asked him how he could be so wicked to do such a crime; he told me he did not think it would hurt her; he went in and got a cup or bason; I asked him where he was going; he told me to my house, to get some sweet oil to rub her face. I never saw the deceased afterwards.</p>

            . I am a peruke-maker. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177212090029"></xptr> to the hospital that day when the accident was done; I asked the girl whether she thought it was maliciously done or not; she said if she thought so, she should wrong her conscience very much: I did not stay to hear any more conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about any quarrel between them?</p>
               <p>Palmer. No; I asked her some questions of that sort; she seemed to say the boy and she had always lived upon good terms. I saw her again that day week; she died near a fortnight I believe after the time I saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sadler. Can you speak to the occasion of this woman's death?</p>
               <p>Sadler. I heard them say that the wound she received was the occasion of her death; I saw her the Wednesday before she died; she died on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she appear when you saw her?</p>
               <p>Sadler. Very low to what she had been; then there was an inflammation begun in the jaw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other part besides the eye appear to be wounded?</p>
               <p>Sadler. No; I apprehend it went up into her braid?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the occasion of her death?</p>
               <p>Sadler. That wound: I apprehend the socket of the eye was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the body after her death?</p>
               <p>Sadler. Yes; there was a piece taken out of the top of the cheek bone and the socket was broke in one or two places.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine to see whether any part of the wadden had penetrated the skull?</p>
               <p>Sadler. No.</p>

               <p>It was entirely an accident; I loaded this pistol over night with gunpowder and a piece of paper, and laid it under my bed; in the morning I took it from thence, with an intent to let it off at the wharf, over against my master's; just as I got my foot upon the step of the door, my master desired me to come in to breakfast, and for fear he should see it I put it down by my side, and took it into the kitchen; I said to the maid I had a good mind to let it off in the yard, only my master would hear it; she bid me lay it down; I did not point it at her; I was going to put it upon the dresser shelf; I had it between my finger and thumb to put it up and it went off, and struck me upon the eye, and knocked me backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sadler. Is that true?</p>
               <p>Sadler. His eye was bleeding.</p>

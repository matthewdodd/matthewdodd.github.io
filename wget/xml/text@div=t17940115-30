             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of December last, I went to enquire for my husband at a Mr. Brown's, he lives in at a place called Pelican Stairs, down at Cox's-lane, it was between eleven and twelve in the day; I went to see if my husband was gone to Wapping, I did not find him there; two men were there, the prisoners at the bar. I am quite sure, they are the two men Mr. Brown's is a public house; one of them told me, that he knew my husband, and that he had worked along with him three or four days, Thomas Whellum told me that; he told me, that he expected my husband was coming into the house; I told him, if I thought my husband was coming into the house, I would stay half an hour, and wait upon my husband. I came out of the house to go home at the end of the half hour, and they followed me out; they asked me, if I would go, and have share of a pot of beer? they expected my husband every moment; they asked me to go into the sign of the Crown, in Fox's-lane, to take a part of a pot? and I did go in, and sat down, and I went out, and came back again, and I found them both there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you out in all? - When I came back, that man, Whellum, told me, that he was sure my husband was coming, and he insisted I should wait for him; I told them after wards, I would go home, it was then about three o'clock; because if my husband went home, I had got the key, and he could not get in; I went; they followed me out of the house, both of the prisoners. We staid there till about eight o'clock; in coming out to go home, the landlady of the house, asked this prisoner in the brown coat, Whellum, whether he should see me safe home to my own husband? he said, he knew my husband very well, and it would be no trouble to him at all, to see me safe home to my own husband. I went up, to go home the broad way near the church, up Fox's-lane, both the prisoners were with me. When I went up the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150082"></xptr>street, I knew my way to my own house, and they told me, they would take me a nigher way home; they took me up into David's-lane, and from there, they told me, they would take me a nigher way; and they took me into a rope ground, which has no thoroughfare. When I came there, one in each hand drove me down the steps, both of them. They asked me, what I would give them, if I had got any money about me? I told them, I had two shillings in my pocket, I would give it them, if they would let me go home to my own place to my husband; it was between nine and ten at this time; they cut my pocket off, and took the two shillings, I cannot say which. One held me, while the other took them from me. I had nothing but the two shillings in my pocket, and the key of the room; they took my bonnet, my handkerchief, and apron, and cut my under petticoat off; the man, Whellum, in the brown coat, stripped me of my things, and the other held me. I asked them, why they served me so? and they knocked me down, and ran both away together; I called out, murder! for some time, and I saw nobody coming, and at last, a young man came, and took me up first, and a woman came to assist him, and they took me home to my husband's place.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your goods again? - I saw them a week after that, almost a week, on a Thursday, it was a Friday they robbed me, and Thursday next the goods were found, the two officers found them going to be pawned; I saw them in the hands of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not, of your own knowledge, know what became of the goods, till you saw them in the hands of the officer? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all your know of the matter? - That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how you passed your time from ten o'clock in the morning till eight at night? - I went there about twelve in the day, to Mr. Brown's, to enquire for my husband, he is a labouring man, he works on board a ship, I drank a little with the two men, I was not all the while with them, I was twice out and in, I cannot say how long each of those times; I was twice out, if not three times; the first time half an hour; the second time a quarter of an hour; and the third time the same.</p>

               <p>Court. All the three times together would make about an hour; therefore there were seven hours spent in the two public houses.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor had you drank? - I don't know what was drank, I did drink along with them.</p>
               <p>

            What did you drink, gin or beer? - There was both gin and beer drank, I cannot say how much, two or three pots called for to my knowledge, but there were more people drank along with them than me, I did not drink much of the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How much gin was called for? - A quartern of gin when they came in, and a quartern when they went out. I had two glasses of gin, and drank some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you received the blow, that knocked you down in the rope ground? Whereabouts on the body? - On my cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in this part of the country? - Five years; I came from Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you was perfectly sober at this time? - I was drinking along with them, and I was sure that they meant no good in keeping me. I was not so drunk but I knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150083"></xptr>very well what they meant, but the fright made me sober quite.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did you go with them if you was afraid of being knocked down by them? - They told me that they would see me home, and they would not use me ill; I was afraid of going along with them, when I went out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. How comes it, as you was desirous of getting home in the day time, that you did not go home, as you had the key in your pocket? - This prisoner in the brown coat said, that he was very well known to my husband, and that he was coming in every moment there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they keep you there seven hours in this manner? - I was not seven hours with them; it was twelve o'clock when I got there, and I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. If you felt a pressing desire to go home to your husband, why did not you go home? - I said that I wanted to go home several times.</p>

               <p>I am the constable of Shadwell police office. On the 25th of December, I was applied to by one Lewis Lloyd, who informed me, that his wife had been robbed a few days before, by two men, and that he knew where to find one of them then; accordingly I and Webster went along with him, and called at a house of Mr. Ramsey's, he keeps a public house, the bottom of Fox's-lane, Shadwell, where Lloyd's wife was at that time, he told us the house where we might very likely find one of the men; we went into the house and saw a man, answering the description that he gave, it is situated near the end of Wapping Wall, very near the other public house. I found the prisoner Whellum there, standing by the fire; the woman came after us and pointed the man out, and said, that is one of the men that robbed me; the woman went back to her husband; we took Whellum into custody, and called at Ramsey's as we were going to the office, to take her and her husband up with us to the office, and I found this bonnet and apron at Whellum's house, here is one callico handkerchief, and another silk one, and one flannel petticoat, I found at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lloyd. They are all my property, I bought them and paid for them, I made my apron, and petticoat, and handkerchief. They were the things that were on me the 20th of December.</p>
               <p>Aberley. Whellum's wife informed me, that she had sent a woman, of the name of Last, to pledge the handkerchief, petticoat, and apron, at a pawnbroker's, in Whitechapel, but could not tell where. I found her at a pawnbroker's, nearly opposite the London Hospital, in the Whitechapel-road; I happened to go into the right pawnbroker's shop, where I found the woman offering the things to pledge, the pawnbroker had got the handkerchief in his hand then, and informed me that she had asked three shillings, or three shillings and six-pence for them; I see they were the property as was described, and I took her into custody, and took the goods.</p>

Mr. Aberley, some time after that, asked him where he lived? and he told him, he gave the right direction; we went then, and we asked his wife where such things were? she denied them; says I, I am come from your husband, and I must have the property, and she opened a chest in the room, and we found this bonnet and this apron; his wife said it was not her bonnet, that it belonged to the woman that was gone to pawn the other things; I stayed in the house while Mr. Aberley went and brought the woman back with the other things. He in the smock frock, Miller, was taken on Saturday following, between five and six, in a lodging house, and accordingly the justice asked him what he had got to say for himself? he said it was not him that robbed the woman, it was the other man.</p>

            . I was in at Mr. Rayner's house, St. George's, Middlesex, a public house, and a fellow servant of mine came and called me out, there was some body crying murder! I went out, after I came out I heard some body halloo out murder! and I went down the rope ground, Mr. Thompson's, and I went down the steps, and I saw a woman laying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she close to the steps? - About a hundred yards from the steps. I went to her, and when I helped her up, her pocket lay on the ground, and my fellow servant he picked her pocket up, and I helped her up the steps to a woman, Catharine North, and helped her over the road, and she sat down along with the woman, while I was drinking the remaining part of my pint of beer, and then I went home with her, and she seemed to me to be in liquor; she told me what she had lost, but she did not seem property to have her senses; she told me where she lived, she lived in Cox's-court, she gave a rational account where she lived and whose wife she was.</p>

             and another were helping the woman up the steps, and I went to them as they were helping her up the steps, they could not get her up at first, and when she got up, she said, she had been robbed, and I saw the pockets, there were no strings on them; I took her home, I took her from these men, there was a woman come by there with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150085"></xptr>a lanthorn, and I looked at the woman, and there was the breadth of a shilling knocked off her face, and I put my apron up to her face; she told me that she lived in Blue Anchor-alley, Cox's-court, and I accompanied her home to her own habitation.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 20th of December, these two men and woman came into my house, it is in Fox's-lane, a public house, I think, to the best of my knowledge, it was about eleven in the morning, they stayed all the day, till about eight o'clock, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had they been drinking at that time? - They had porter to drink for the most part; I cannot recollect how much, I know of four pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drank the four pots of beer? - There were more in company, but whether they invited them to drink with them I cannot say, there were people came in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect any thing of the gin that they drank? - I served two quarterns of gin, I know no more; that makes half a pint.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing in their conversation and discourse? - I did not, I did not give any attention to what passed between them. When they left the house I said, take care of the woman, she appears to be in liquor; they said they were afraid of that, they knew the woman very well, and they would take her home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Whellum. When I was going out of doors this woman sat asleep, drunk, and this gentlewoman said, I don't know whether she can walk or not, and this man, Miller, said he would take her home; she made answer and said, to my husband; and he said, yes; that is all.</p>

               <p>I was in company with the officers at the time the man was taken up; I was not with them when the things were found; I heard Miller say he was in company with Whellum when he robbed the woman, but he could not help his robbing her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Whellum. I was waiting for a craft to come in, I was waiting at this house from nine o'clock, thinking there would be an answer come for to go to work again, just before the clock struck eight this woman came, and she asked if her husband was there? and she came up to me, and she said she thought she knew me, and I made answer and said to her again, you may know me, but I don't know you; says she, I think I knew you when you worked at Mr. Perry's dock, at Blackwall; I told her it might be so I had worked there; she made answer that her husband lived at No. 5. Blue Anchor-alley, and that he came from Poplar; I said, I think there is a man that comes from there, he works along with me, and if it is the same he will he here in a minute or two; and so I advised her to wait, but he did not come in, he had got a job; then this woman came up and stood before the fire side, and said it was very cold; I made answer to her, will you have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150086"></xptr>glass of gin? though I don't know you, you shall have one if you will; and she went and took a glass of gin; then she came back again to the fire side and drank part of two pots of beer; after nine o'clock I said, I would go home to my wife, and we all came out together. When we came to this gentleman's house, Mrs. Ramsey's, just as we got to the door the woman said, what will you give me to drink? if you will give me anything give it me now; Miller answered, will you have part of a pot of beer? I said, I cannot stop, because my wife is very big with child, and I want to go home; after that I granted to go in and have a pot of beer; we had one, two, three, or four pots of beer and a quartern of gin; after I had paid for that liquor this man wanted something to eat, and he went out for a two penny loaf and half a pound of cheese, for something to eat, then afterwards we had another quartern of gin; then after that we were talking to one another, we heard a man playing the fiddle, she calls this man in, and would have him play; after that she goes to the shop across the corner, where she wanted a pair of garters, and wanted this man to buy her a pair, and told him that he should tie them on for her, if he would buy her a pair, but he would not; after that she came and called me out, and asked me if I would buy her a pair of garters? and if I would buy her a pair of garters I might have connection with her, if I would; I made answer I had a wife at home, and I was not used to such work as that; she said she did not come after a man as her husband, it was her brother; she said she lived at No. 5, at Poplar, and that she lived along with another woman at No. 5, at Poplar, at the White Horse, and they carried on the trade and business of a disorderly house, and asked this man and me if we would go home with her? I told them I would not have any thing to do with it; after that she persuaded me to go into the yard behind the house to be great with her; I told her that I would do no such thing; after that she called me out to the door, and told me that she did not like this man; she said she had some knowledge of me, but him she did not know, and desired me not to let any of her things go from her; after that we sat down by the fire again, I wanted to go and see my master, to see if there was a craft come in, and I went down to Mr. Brown's, and I went in and stayed for the valuation of an hour, and could hear no answer, for there was no craft come in, and I came back again to settle my reckoning at the gentlewoman's house, there were two quarterns of gin to pay for, that she had drank at the time that I had gone; she called me over to this shop I spoke of before, and wanted me to have connection with her, and buy her the garters; I told her it would not do for me, that I had a wife that laid very sick at the time, and that what I spent was enough; I told them my expences were as good as five or six shillings that day, and that I could not do it every day; I had four-pence halfpenny left in halfpence, she took it up from my hand and put it into her own pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Miller. I was in company with her, please your worship during the whole time drinking part of the liquor, she asked me to go and buy them garters, for her, so I went out along with her, I would not buy any garters for her, she came in again when I would not buy the garters, and she asked this man, and he would not, he bought no garters for her; so she came back again, and we sat and drank, I know no more than when we were going home this man asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150087"></xptr>to go along with her to see her safe home, and I went along with her.</p>

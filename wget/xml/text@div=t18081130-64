            . I met the prisoner on the Sunday that he said he was to leave his master, in Wilson street; I asked him to tell me how my account was; he told me it was sixteen pots and a pint; I then informed him he was wrong; I should not pay him then; I desired him to call on the Monday following. He did not call on the Monday; I believe it was on the Wednesday or Thursday evening he called; he was then paid seven shillings and eleven penee halfpenny; he said my account was right, fifteen pots and a pint, and one shilling and sixpence for liquor. I always kept an account against him. I do not recollect the day of the month; it was the day that he went from his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Perry, what day was it he left you - A. I believe it was on a Sunday unbeknown to me; I had hired another man, but I had not discharged the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had you received this seven shillings and eleven pence halfpenny - A. I had not; he had never brought it to account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The customers owed me so much I was afraid he would be angry; I was turned away without an hour's notice.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I returned from the country I found he was gone away; the bills not paid amounted to three pounds eighteen shillings. I sent a note to him by the lamp lighter that he knew, if he would come it would be all right; he did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave - A. Very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave Mr.

             a month's warning; I settled with him except five shillings and ten pence; I told him I was agreeable to stop till all was settled if he was agreeable. Soon after he got another man; I was willing to have all things meet with him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Is the account between you and him settled - A. There are eighty seven pots he took out unsettled.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had given him time, do you not suppose that he could have settled this business - A. I offered him all the time in the world; he would not come forward.</p>

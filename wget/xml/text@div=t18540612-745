                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of No. 6, Leman-street, White-chapel. The prisoner was in my employ at a salary of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter—it was his duty to receive money and cheques, on my account—if he received this cheque, he never paid it over to me—it is crossed—I do not know how it got paid, not through my banker—this is the invoice I sent with the goods; this receipt is in the prisoner's writing, and on the back of the cheque, in his writing, is "Mr. Farr."</p>

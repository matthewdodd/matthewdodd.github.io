            . I am a constable. On the 19th of February I accompanied the prosecutor to Mr. Stokes, a batter's shop next door to his own; I found the prisoner and took him into custody - I asked where he got the clothes he went to pawn: he said he had pawned nothing - that he had been to pawn them, but they were stopped: I took him up stairs, and found in his box five duplicates, and on his person 12s.; I have no duplicate dated the 8th of February - he told me the clothes were given to him by John, the boy next door, that alluded to the clothes the duplicates were for - he said he had them from John; that the first money he had from John was 5s., and afterwards he had 2s. - I asked if he did not know they were stolen; he said after the first time he did think so, but at first he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he had received them from John and pawned them? A. Yes, he had received them of a morning before his master came to the shop; that he received them at Whittingham's shop from the boy, and went from there and pawned them; I understood him that when the two were cleaning their windows, John gave them to him; he said he received them at the door.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Lancashire gave me the property to pawn; he said they were given to him instead of wages - I did not know they were stolen, or I should not have pawned them in my own name.</p>

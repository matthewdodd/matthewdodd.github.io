On the 28th of November, at twelve o'clock in the forenoon, I told him that I could keep him no longer, and my wife gave him a few halfpence to leave the house, and take his things. The same evening, it being dusk, he came in and concealed himself, privately, in the backroom. I keep a green-shop. At twelve o'clock an alarm was given; I came down, and went into the shop, and found the shutter down, and missed a great coat, and 5 s. in halfpence. I found the coat at Shadwell office. I had seen it hanging on a nail, about half-past nine o'clock, before I went to bed, the door was then shut. I could find nobody in the house.</p>

I crossed over to him; he saw me. and ran about twenty yards up the street. I then took him. I also saw some things in his breast, and asked how he got them? He said they were his own. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner and the property were brought to the watch-house. I found a pair of trowsers and a shirt, stuffed in his bosom. I asked whose they were? - He said they were his own. I then found a coat, which he said was the captain's wife's. I afterwards heard of the robbery, and sent for the prosecutor, who said that the prisoner had lodged with him, and broke out of the house, and claimed the property.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Then your family consisted of yourself, your wife, and the prisoner? A. Yes, that was all - I took these two £10 notes from Mr. Martin, for the furniture of my house in Frith-street, on the 9th of May; I put them into my purse the same day- I don't allow my wife the use of my keys; she is in a childish state; she is a weak woman in the head, which arose from a paralytic stroke in the head - I never found that my wife had been trying a key to one of my drawers, and broken part of it in the lock - I had not looked at these notes from the 9th of May, till I missed them on the 16th, when the prisoner had run away - I had gone out every day except Sundays - I had no friends to visit me; we have been there but a short time, and our friends have not come there - I cannot undertake to say that no friend had called on me, but they had not gone up stairs - I go out to buy all the provisions except the bread, which the baker brings, but he does not come into the garden - I cannot fix on the date on which I lost any of my property, but I missed it on the 16th - the prisoner had left my service on account of her father and mother being ill with the cholera morbus, and she returned; but not with my consent; my housekeeper took her in - my housekeeper left me on Easter Monday; she wished to go away because I wished to buy every thing myself, and she had been in the habit of buying when in London, but I thought I could buy things cheaper, and so I did - the prisoner did not leave me to go to pay her cousin a visit - I undertake to state, that she ran away; she left me without notice, and did not return.</p>

            , he lives at No. 2, Ball's-pond-road, and is a milkman, I knew the prisoner, as Mr. Lucas's servant; about nine weeks ago - (I think it was early in May,) she came one evening to my house, and asked if I knew where there was a jeweller - I said there was a new pawnbroker's-shop opened, and I wentthere with her, she bought a pair of earrings which came to eight shillings, she then went home- she afterwards asked me to go to tea with her sister, and on Sunday the 12th of May she came to my house, and came into the bed-room with a small bundle in her hand, which she placed on the table and asked me if I was ready - she said she had purchased two flannel waistcoats for her father; who was much troubled with the rheumatism, and she had given five shillings a piece for them- a little before four o'clock she lifted up the waistcoats, and took a small bit of paper from under them, which contained a sovereign and one shilling and sixpence - she asked me to put it into my purse, as she had neither pocket nor purse, which I did, and a little before four o'clock, we left my house and walked as far as Shoreditch Church- she then said she would ride, and she asked a coachman what he would take her to Parker-street, Drury-lane for - he said, three shillings and sixpence - we got in and went there to her father's - and in the evening we went to her sister's - between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, she engaged a cab and returned to Ball's-pond turnpike, it came to two shillings and sixpence - I gave her the sovereign at her father's; she paid for the coach and gave me the remainder of the change to take care of till we returned home - this was on the 12th, and on the 13th she came to my house at half-past two o'clock, and said, she wanted change for a £10 note for her mistress - I had seen her mistress twice - I took the note out of her hand, and said, I did not think I could get change, but I would send and see; I sent my servant to the barn, and told her the young woman at No. 9, Brunswick-place wanted change - the girl returned in about ten minutes, and gave the change to the prisoner - I did not have it, but I saw gold on the back parlour mantel-piece; the prisoner then asked me if I would go with her to have a tooth drawn, I said no.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then I suppose on the 13th you went to Mr. Lucas? A. Yes, I went every day, generally in the morning, but sometimes I call in an afternoon - I supplied milk every day till Mr. Lucas dismissed me, in consequence of the note being changed at my house - I did not tell Mr. Lucas on the 13th what had been done, because I did not know but it was for her mistress - I had no suspicion - I did not know Mrs. Lucas was a weak woman - I believed the prisoner brought it from her because she said so - I had supplied the house with milk before Mr. Lucas came to it - the earrings were a low price I thought - I did not see the flannel waistcoats.</p>

            . I am servant to the last witness - I remember the prisoner coming to her house on the 13th of May, and asking my mistress to get change for a £10 note for her mistress - I was standing by at the time; my mistress told her she did not think she could, but she would send and see - she gave the note into my hand to go to the barn - I went there and saw my master - I said "The servant at No. 9, is come for change for a £10 note" - my master took it into the barn, but did not get change there - we then went to the King's Arms - I waited outside, and he went in - when he came out of Mrs. Wicks's, he gave me nine sovereigns and two half sovereigns, and I went back and gave them to the prisoner - she went into my mistress's backroom, and said to my mistress "Will you mind this?" my mistress said "No, mind it yourself" - the prisoner then said"I will throw it down here on the floor" - I made answer"Don't throw it down, put it on the mantel-piece" - she then put nine sovereigns and a half on the mantel-piece and took a half sovereign away - my mistress did not hear her say this as she was in an agitation, because master was not come in from the barn - it was a quarter after three, and they always go before three with the milk - the prisoner then asked my mistress to go with her to have a tooth drawn -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040040"></xptr>she said she did not like to see any one's tooth drawn, and then she asked her to let me go - and I went - she had the tooth drawn, and paid a shilling and changed the half sovereign - we then went to a large comb-shop facing the Bull at Kingsland, where she bought a purse for one shilling and sixpence, a pair of snaps for five shillings, and a comb, and she had not money enough to pay for them, as she had bought a hair brush and two side combs at Mr. Rogers, where she had her tooth drawn - she then sent me to my mistress for half a sovereign more - I went home, and my mistress gave me the nine sovereigns and a half, and said, "Take that and give it into Mary's hand for I don't like to have any one's money but my own" - I went and gave it her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had not often seen £10 notes? A. No, I never saw one before - I should not know the note again - I lost sight of it. I have heard my mistress say, she thought this was Mrs. Lucas's note, and I heard the prisoner ask my mistress to take care of the money because she was going to have the tooth drawn, and when I went back I found the money on the shelf - it did not strike my mistress to go to Mr. Lucas- she was all in an agitation - my mistress was in the shop when the prisoner said, if she did not take the money she would throw it on the floor - my mistress could not hear her very well, but I told my mistress what she had said - I did not go to Mr.

             that night - I did not say anything about it till the custom was taken away - Mr. Lucas came on the Sunday morning, and asked my master to let me go and show him where the note was taken, and on the Sunday after that he stopped the milk.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You say you thought this note was Mrs. Lucas's, but you saw the prisoner change one half sovereign and then another half sovereign? A. Yes, and I told my mistress of it - I cannot say what my mistress said - the prisoner did not tell me to say nothing about it - I heard on the Sunday that Mr. Lucas had lost his notes; when my mistress went to the house with the milk, and then Mr. Lucas came to our house, and said, My servant has run away and taken two £10 notes, my mistress said "She brought one here for her mistress," and told him where it was changed.</p>

               <persName id="t18330704-28-person365">
                  Charlotte

             - she said no; I asked if she had lived with Mr. Lucas - she said no, she had not; a woman in the house said, "What a wicked story-teller you are, your name is Charlotte Beazley;" I then asked to look at her box, and she told a little girl to get her box - she brought a box down, and the woman said, "That is not your box;" I then requested the woman to go up stairs with the prisoner and me, which she did, and pointed out a box, which I requested the prisoner to open - she did open it, and took these drops of ear-rings and this necklace in her hand, and walked off and tried to conceal them; I took them, and found in her box this piece of linen and this pieces of calico; I took her to the station-house, and asked her where she had put her luggage which she had brought from the country - she said at her sister's - I went there, and found some dirty linen, but nothing relating to this indictment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe these are such articles as she would buy to wear? A. Oh yes.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Dalston Road. I recollect a young woman coming to our shop, at the latter end of April or the beginning of May - she bought this piece of cloth, a black silk dress, and some other things; I cannot be upon my oath but to the best of my belief it was the prisoner - they came to about four pounds, and were to be sent home to Ball's-pond.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Don't you think it was before the 10th of May? A. I think so.</p>

            . I live at Ball's-pond. I know the prisoner; she has come as a customer to my shop three times- the last time was about the 20th of May; I think she has made two purchases since the 9th of May, but I have not the memorandum with me; they came to about thirty shillings - these are part of the goods.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">the younger.</hi> I carry on business, in partnership with my father and brother, as builders, in High-street, Wandsworth. In July and August last, we were engaged merecting some warehouses for the London and South Western Railway Company, at Nine Elms—the prisoner was in our service as foreman of the works; it was his duty to take on what men he wanted to carry out the works, and to discharge them when their services were not required—he engaged a good many men for us—he paid them their wages—it was his duty as foreman to make out what we call pay sheets—he fixed the amount of the wages the men were to receive—it is our custom to pay from Saturday morning till Friday evening—if a man was engaged on Monday, he would be paid from Monday to Friday; that would be five days in that week, and the next day, Saturday, would go into the following week—we pay on Saturday, but the pay sheets are made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280115"></xptr>
               <p>up to the Friday—I generally send' the money to the different jobs to pay the men with—the money for the workmen at Nine Elms was sent to the foreman of the job, the prisoner—these produced are the four pay sheets for 30th July, 6th, 13th, and 20th Aug.—in the first sheet there is the name of Webster put down for six days, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on the third sheet, that of 13th Aug., Webster is put down at seven days three hours, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and on the 20th, six days nine and a half hours, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a back day—that means the last day of his services; he was to leave on the Saturday afternoon, 21st Aug.—we had only one person of the name of Webster in our service at that time—he has since been taken into our service; I think he returned some three or four weeks afterwards—he was not a perfect tradesman; I mean, not a first rate hand by any means—he is a carpenter—a first rate hand would be entitled to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day; I am now paying him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—if he had been a first rate workman, he would demand 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner's wages were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—these sums of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in these sheets are calculated at the rate of 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per day—if he had been a perfect workman, and entitled to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, these sums would be correct, if he had worked that time—if the prisoner had by mistake paid to any of the men more than he was entitled to pay them, and it was returned to him, it would be his duty to enter it on the pay sheets previous to returning them to our office on the Saturday afternoon, and to refund it with the pay sheets—it would be his duty, not merely to account for it, but actually to refund the cash—he did not, on 30th July, 13th Aug., or 20th Aug., return to me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or any money overpaid to Webster; there is no mark or alteration in the pay sheets to show that he has corrected it—my attention 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. not called by the prisoner to those sums as having been returned—these pay sheets are not in the prisoner's handwriting—there is no person in particular appointed to bring the pay sheets to the office; it depends upon whoever is coming there, probably a labourer leaving the job would be told to leave it at the office as he passed by going borne—these pay sheets came into my hands the first thing on Saturday morning, at 6 o'clock; that is the course of business—60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was advanced on this first pay sheet—that was on 30th July; the 12. 10a. forms an item in that account—the men were paid at the place where they worked, at Nine Elms—my brother was present on that occasion—it is the course of business to have the pay sheet at the time the men are paid, and their names are called out from it; on the other occasions, a person named Watkinson was present—on 13th Aug., 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given; the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. forms part of that total—on 20th Aug., 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid out; the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is included in that in two items of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave the money to Watkinson—I could not positively swear that I gave it into Watkinson's hand, for I am shut up in a private office the first thing in the morning—I have a clerk alone with me—I count out the money myself, and put it into bags myself, and give it to him to pass to the persons that take the money—at other times, I give instructions as to who shall take the money—I had not the slightest knowledge that Webster was engaged at a less sum than 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day; I did not know that he had only been five days engaged the first week, instead of six—the prisoner was not allowed to make any profit upon the employment of any of the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employment of Messrs. Nicholson, at Nine Elms, in July last. The prisoner engaged me—he said I was to have 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—we did not make any agreement—my wages were settled with him—I went first into the employment on a Monday—I do not recollect the day of the month, it was in the early part of July—I was there four weeks altogether—I was paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the first week, by Mr. Powell—I worked six days that week, and I was paid for five days, keeping a back day—they stopped a day—I was paid on the Saturday, but the Saturday went into the next week—after I had been paid, Powell said there was a mistake of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my reckoning, and I returned him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about an hour after he had paid me, the same night; he said, "You must meet me at such a place, and pay me this 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back again," which I did; he said he had to pay it back again to Mr. Nicholson—I was to meet him at the Three Goats' Heads, which I did, and paid him the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., outside the door—I was paid the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the office at Nine Elms—on the following Saturday he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was for seven days and a half—on the third Saturday he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was for seven days three hours—that was made up of overtime—before I was paid, Powell said, "There will be a <hi rend="italic">dambling</hi> mistake in the reckoning this week, and you will receive 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said the mistake was 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I suppose a <hi rend="italic">dambling</hi> mistake meant a shocking mistake—he paid me the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. about a quarter past 4 o'clock—he mentioned about the mistake both before and after he paid me—he did not mention it after he paid me, I did not see him any more that night—on the Monday following he called me off, and it was then he said it was a <hi rend="italic">dambling</hi> mistake—he said it before he paid me, and after also—I paid him back 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the Monday—Mr. Watkinson was present on the Saturday when he paid me the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was paid at the same time as the rest of the men—Mr. Watkinson was present on the Monday when I paid the prisoner back the 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was in the pay office—I am sure Mr. Watkinson was present—on the fourth Saturday I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was paid in the evening, by the prisoner—before I was paid, he said to me, "Your wages will be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; there is a mistake, and after you have received the money you will have to meet me at the Southampton Arms and return me back again 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Mr. Watkinson paid me the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the prisoner's</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the partners in the firm of Nicholson and Sons, builders, at Wandsworth. This pay sheet of 30th July, contains an entry of the various sums to be paid to the workmen; the gross amount is 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I find Webster down for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to be paid to him</p>

               <p>on 30th July—that forms part of the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I paid to the prisoner on the Saturday—he was to pay that away in wages to the different men—the men are called in rotation, and the sum opposite their names is paid to them by Powell; they were paid by Powell on this occasion—I doled the money out to Powell, and he paid the money to the men—I was present when they were paid—according to this entry, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was due to Webster—I gave Powell the sum of money that is entered here—I cannot say whether or not he handed over the whole of it to Webster.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman to Messrs. Nicholson. The aggregate amount paid to workmen on 13th Aug., appears by this sheet (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) to be 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid that to the prisoner in one sum; it was on a Saturday—I had the pay sheet with me, when I handed him over that sum—it was for him to pay the several men with it, which he did—this name of Webster appears here for him to be paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I saw the prisoner pay Webster that sum—I did not call over the names, the prisoner called in the men and paid them—on 20th Aug. I paid the men myself; the amount was 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Powell did not take part in it at that time, but he was present and the pay sheet lay on the desk by him—I think he called the names—I mentioned the sum to be paid—he was at my elbow—on the pay sheet of 20th Aug. here is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down to Webster's name, and an additional 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I paid to Webster—the prisoner has never returned me any money that I overpaid Webster.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Nicholson and Co., and worked in the same gang as Webster—I had been there six weeks at the time of this occurrence—the gang consisted of eight men, and the prisoner was foreman over it—I know that he was in the habit of supplying the men of the gang with money and beer when they needed it—I used to have some myself, and the other members of the gang at the same time—Webster had beer at the same time I had—we used all to have it at the same time, at 11 o'clock, or at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and in the evening sometimes, at 6 o'clock—it was supplied by Mr. Trimmings of the Three Goats' Head, in the Walworth-road, on the prisoner's recommendation, and we used to pay him at the end of the week on the settlement of our account, and he used to pay Trimmings—we used to pay Powell back, on the Saturday night or Monday morning—I have been present when Webster had beer, but I did not see that he paid at the time for it, nor did I pay for mine at the time—</p>

               <p>when Webster came to work there he had no tools of his own, and Mr. Powell supplied him with tools—I know that of my own knowledge, and that Webster had no tools of his own during the whole time he was employed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

When I was a boy I was given to understand that my father was married a second time—I know nothing of it myself—I knew a person of the name of Lever, she was my father's wife—the prisoner is the woman—I believe I was about ten years old when he married her, and about twelve months after that I was sent for by Mr. Smith—I lived in my father's house for a year—I believe that is the woman.</p>

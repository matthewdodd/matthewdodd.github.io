I said, I do. He then said, I am going to have some beer; I may as well have a pint of beer at the old house. I said, very well, I am going on an errand, and when I came back I found Mr. Hill in my house. He asked me for change of a one pound note. I gave him the change, deducting for the pint of porter.

In the month of April last, I saw the prisoner at our house; he came there with a person named Withey; he had some ale; he offered me a pound note. I went out to get change at Mr. Wright's, a baker's shop next door; he could not change it without taking ten shillings-worth of halfpence. I went back to the prisoner, and told him; he made no objection to the halfpence I received of Mr. Wright the full change, and left with him the note. I gave the prisoner the change. I tore the note by accident. A gentleman came from the Bank and said it was a bad note.</p>

            . I am one of the inspectors of bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that note, and tell me whether it is a genuine or a forged note - A. It is a forged note in all respects, paper, signature, and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these other three - A. These three are all forged. They appear to be impressions taken from the same plate, and they appear to me to be signed by the same hand-writing: the signatures are different names. They are so well done they would deceive any body.</p>
               <p>(The note read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been some time an inhabitant of Bristol, and I have been in the habit of trading from place to place frequently. I have taken country notes. I have been glad to take bank notes, because country notes would not go in London. I never had a bank note, but what I paid twenty shillings for it. I have received upwards of forty pounds since last February, from that time downwards. In the first place, I received of Mr. Davis half a year's annuities, ten one-pound notes. My finances were poor. I have had a sick wife and a large family. I never gave a false address to man or mortal. I took out a licence to sell any things where I could. On Monday, after my licence was dated, I went from Bristol, and was coming to London. My licence was dated the 29th of February. I carried a good deal of goods with me. I went with the coach to Chippenham. I went to the Antelope; I supped there and breakfasted there; my dinner came to six shillings. I gave a ten pound note. I received change, nine pound and fourteen shillings. There were three or four recruiting serjeants there. I sold dominos there; they gave me another pound note. I got a returned chaise, which took me to Marlborough. I slept at Mr. Cole's, the Coach and Horses. I sold dominos there. On the day following I sold one dozen pair of shoes for one pound two shillings and sixpence; then I sold two pieces of straw plat for one pound in Marlborough. From Marlborough, on the Wednesday night, I went to Hungerford; on the morning following I went to Newbury; and on the morning following I went with a returned chaise to Reading; and the next morning I was looking for a returned chaise to come towards London. There was a returned chaise at Maidenhead, and just at that moment I had to repack my goods; a man came and looked over my goods; he said he was a corn-cutter. He shewed me some boxes of salve, which sold at one shilling a box; he said he would sell me them at eight shillings a dozen. He lived at No. 1, City-road, the corner of Old-street. He paid me three one-pound bank notes for straw plat, and thirty shillings. Then after I came to London I went to Fry's banking-house, facing the Mansion-house, up a court; I there exchanged four country notes for bank notes, and some other notes I changed in Birchin-lane, to about four pound. I was here last October. I came to the Admiralty office to get a discharge for my son; I then went to that public-house, the Shades, with Mr. Withey, and when the girl told Mr. Withey the note I gave her was a bad one, Mr. Withey told them I should come again. I never passed a bad note knowingly. I never had one but what I paid twenty shillings for in trade.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter. This is my father's licence. I took the licence out myself. I paid four pound for it. It was after I took the licence out that we set off for London. He carried list shoes, straw platt, and boxes of dominos. My mother was ill; she was left in Bristol with my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what money your father took with him from Bristol A. Not exactly. He changed a ten pound note at Chippenham; the change was nine pound fourteen shillings; at Chippenham he sold some dominos; he received a one pound bank note; from there we went to Marlborough; we slept at Mr. Coles, the Coach and Horses. He received three one-pound bank notes at Marlborough of different people; he gave change for one of the notes. My father generally asked for bank notes. He left Marlborough to go to Hungerford. I got up the next morning at seven o'clock to go by the Marlborough coach to Newbury. I cannot say whether he took any money at Hungerford. He met me at Newbury at one o'clock. We left Newbury at seven o'clock the next morning. At Newbury he took three one-pound notes and thirty shillings in silver, of a man who said he was a corn-cutter; he bought plat to the amount of four pounds ten shillings. He said his salve was sold at a shilling a box; he would allow my father three pence a box for selling it. He gave his direction, No. 1, Old-street. the corner of the City-road. I saw this corn cutter pay my father three one-pound bank notes, and thirty shillings in silver My father never marked the notes he took. I cannot speak to them. My father never gave a false name or address.</p>

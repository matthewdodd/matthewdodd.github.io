                  </hi>. I live at No. 88, Holborn Hill On Saturday, 17th Oct., between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with a dark man; she asked for some ale, and paid a bad shilling—my daughter took it up, and said it was a bad one—I said, "It is, give me a knife;" and I took a knife, and cut it, and handed it back—the prisoner gave me a good sixpence, and I gave her change—she did not go away, she remained at the counter—in half an hour afterwards she asked for some rum—she paid for that with a good florin, and I gave her change—some time after that she called for half a pint of gin, and put down a bad florin—I told her it was bad—she said she did not think that—one of the customers then went to look for a constable, and I gave the bad florin to him—I marked it—this is it—there were two or three other persons drinking with her—the shilling which I cut has not been found.</p>

On Saturday night, 17th Oct., between 12 and 1 o'clock, the prisoner was brought in—I found this bad shilling, which she dropped from her clothes when she went to the cell—she said she had no money, but when I undid her clothes this fell from her.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coal-merchant: On the 15th of August, in the evening, I was coming from Newington-green, in company with two ladies; in getting over a bank into the field, where Miss. Jackson was robbed, I observed the prisoner coming down within one hundred yards of me; he came from a quickset hedge to the place where we were, in a beaten footpath; he came close behind us, got over the bank, and went to some paling, along which was a footpath, over which Miss Jackson had to go; the paling was made of ship-timber, and there was a part of the ribs; he hid himself behind one of them; he came out again, and passed her; he then turned round and passed her a second time, and then turned about and stopped her; I saw her deliver something, first with one hand, and then the other, at different times; he then set off that way, the way that she was going, but hearing people in the lane, he turned out and came towards me; I made a cry of stop thief, and saw him taken immediately; I never lost sight of him for a minute, or a sixtieth part of a minute; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I took him down to Miss Jackson, and asked her if that was the man, she said it was; he did not say a syllable; we took him to a public-house, on Newington-green, and searched him; we found upon him about five pennyworth of halfpence; Miss Jackson described that there were some new halfpence amongst them, and there were some new ones amongst those that he had, and a tin box, containing his discharge from the barracks at Chatham, on account of his bad sight.</p>

When I was brought back, Mrs. Jackson was asked if I was the person, and she said she could not tell; then they took me to Newington-green; the constable asked her, and she said she not say that I was the man, and then a gentleman came and said, he would swear he saw me take the purse out of the lady's hand.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Miss Jackson.) Did you ever say to any one, that you did not know whether he was the man or not? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

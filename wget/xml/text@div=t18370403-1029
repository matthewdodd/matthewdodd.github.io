On the 6th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Taylor came for half a pint of beer—my wife served her—she offered sixpence—it was put into my hand, and I perceived it was bad—she paid for it with a penny she had in her hand, and went out—I followed her into the Curtain-road—about fifty yards from my house I taw the male prisoner cross over and join her—she put her hand to his hand and seemed to give him something—I followed them to Shore<lb></lb>ditch—the man went to an eating-house, bought some pudding, came out, and gave her part—they eat it, and went on to Norton Falgate, and stopped at the door of a public house—he then put his hand to her hand, and seemed to give her something—she went into the house—he walked on—I went into the house and saw the female prisoner at the counter, and a six pence on it which the bar-maid was taking up—I told her to look at it, which she did—it was bad—I told them to secure Taylor—I went out, and saw Aaron standing by the new theatre—I seized him by the collar and said, "You scoundrel, I have got you"—he put his hand to something and threw a white parcel over the pales—he got his arm out of his coat, and he had no shirt on—he tried to get the other arm out, I let go his coat and seized him till assistance came.</p>

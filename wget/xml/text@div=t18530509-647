                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, at Deptford. On 5th March the prisoner called at my house, about 9 or 10 o'clock at night—he asked me to lend him some money, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on this order—he said he was entitled to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as the last pay of a share of Her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Phantom</hi>—the name of Broadley is there—I asked him whether that was his name, and whether it was the order he received from the agent of the ship—it is his own name, "Samuel Broadley"—he said that he had sold three-fourths of the prize money to a gentleman at Chatham, and this was the remaining part to get, and that he bad been to the agent to receive the money; and he gave me this order to call on Monday at 10 o'clock to receive it—he said the agent was Mr. James Buchanan—I believed what he said, and I lent him five shillings upon his stating he had lost two of his shirts, and should get into trouble if he did not replace them—I was induced to do it from his representation, that he would get into trouble for not having his shirts to produce—it was very foolish, 1 did it because I believed what he said—I was induced to give him money because I believed I should have it back on Monday—he said he should be with me at 7 o'clock to go to the Admiralty—after I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he asked me to let him have some beer, and I let him have five gallons, which he took away—I did so because I believed his statement, and that he would pay me on Monday, when the order was paid—at half past 9 o'clock I saw him—he said he had met a comrade from London, and would be with me at 10 o'clock on Tuesday to receive it—I never saw him again till the 21st—I made a complaint to the Commandant at Woolwich—the prisoner was there when I made the complaint—the Adjutant told him he was charged with receiving money under false pretences—he stated he had received the money, and was willing to be put on stoppages to pay it—he was given into custody; the Adjutant requested me to call the next day, and see the Commandant—he was given into custody on 22nd April—these are the two documents T got from him—I made every inquiry of Mr. Buchanan in connection with this order, and could find no such person—(<hi rend="italic">order read</hi>—"<hi rend="italic">Please allow the bearer to proceed to our office to receive the last pay of a share in shares of Her Majesty's ship</hi> Phantom.

                  </hi>. I am in the Accountant-General's department, in the Admiralty. This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a document given to every man in the service—it is signed by Captain Henry Eden, and he is the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Fisgard</hi> flag ship, Woolwich—on his bringing this to the Admiralty, the signature induced me to look at the <hi rend="italic">Fisgarais</hi> book, and 1 found the description corresponded with a man of the name of Houghton, not Broadley—I have the book here—we have no such ship as the name of <hi rend="italic">Phantom</hi>—we have a ship called <hi rend="italic">Phantome</hi>, the French name—it would not be spelt the same—there has been an erasure, and the name of Broadley substituted for Houghton, and the <hi rend="italic">Phantom</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Fisgard</hi>—the document for Henry Houghton would have been right if it had not been erased—there is no prize money due to the <hi rend="italic">Fisgard</hi>—she is a stationary ship at Woolwich—the book I produce is a book containing a description of Henry Houghton—the book of the <hi rend="italic">Fisgard</hi> corresponds in every particular with the certificate—the names of the ship and man have been erased, and those of Broadley and <hi rend="italic">Phantom</hi> substi-</p>

               <p>tuted—the signature of Eden corresponds with that in this book—I did not bring the book containing the names of the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Phantome</hi>, because it would not answer the time—he served in the <hi rend="italic">Phantome</hi> from Dec., 1844, till Feb., 1845—it was merely to show he had been in the ship <hi rend="italic">Phantome</hi>, but this is for a period between Aug., 1849, and 1850—the certificate is for that time—when he did serve it was from Dec, 1844, to 1845, and no prize money was due to that ship since 1842.</p>

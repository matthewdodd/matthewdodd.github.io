I am a gentleman's coachman, and live at 45, Shoe-lane—I occupy a front and back room on the second floor—on the afternoon of 9th of April, about half-past 4 o'clock, I heard strange footsteps—I jumped up and saw that the bedclothes were all stripped off the bed—I heard some one run down stairs, and I and my daughter ran down after them as fast as we could—I saw the prisoner going along a few yards from the house with some things on his shoulder—we pursued him; a struggle ensued, and we all three fell down in the mud together—it was raining very hard at the time—I took him back to the house, sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—I do not rent the whole house; Mr. Pontifex is the owner—he does</p>

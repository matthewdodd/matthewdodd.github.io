                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, at Plumstead—on 10th May, I turned a pony out to grass, on the common, at 8 o'clock—next morning, at 7 o'clock, I missed it—I saw nothing more of it till the 26th of May, when I saw it in a cart belonging to Mr. Read.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Salisbury-place, Wands Worth—on 12th May I saw a pony straying about; about 5 in the morning—I tied it up, and about 9 o'clock a man came, and afterwards brought the prisoner with him, who claimed the pony—I asked if he would sell it—he said he would, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as things were very queer with him, and he could not got enough to support it—I gave him 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—Mr. Sayers afterwards came and claimed it, and took it away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter—I was with Read when a man named Riley came, and afterwards brought the prisoner—the prisoner asked 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pony—he said things were very bad with him, and he had been getting drunk all the week—I said the pony looked very bad, and he ought to be ashamed of himself to keep it in that state—he said he had been thirty miles with it on the Sunday, to Kingston and back, and it had had nothing to eat—he stood out for some time for the money, but ultimately took 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

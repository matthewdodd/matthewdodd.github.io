                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 381.) On Wednesday morning, the 19th of July, in consequence of information, I went to the King's Arms in Bow-street, with Samuel Benton, to watch Borham who was the ostler. I hid myself close by the yard—they could not see me—I was looking through the win<lb></lb>dow of a house—I could see all over the King's Arms yard—about nine o'clock I saw Mr. Gray's cart come to the premises—White was with it—he fed his horses with some mixed victuals, which he took from the top of the cart—he then went into the house—Borham was in the yard, attending on the horses—he fed them with some new hay, which be took from the top of the cart—in about half an hour he fed them again, with some more new hay—he then went in—he and White came out together, and bad some conversa<lb></lb>tion, which I could not hear—White got on the top of the cart, and handed a full sack down to Borham—I gave Samuel Benton the signal, and he went to the spot in the private stable, where Borham went to—I saw the sack in the stable, and took it, and Samuel Benton took Borham—White was at the top of the cart—I told him to come down—he got down, and said he was going to feed his horses again—I told him I should take him on suspicion, as I had seen him feed his horses three times before—the sack contained about two bushels and a-half of mixed victuals.</p>

I was with Joseph Benton at the bottom part of the house—I received a signal from him about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock—I went into the stable-yard, and saw Borham in the private stable—he had a sack of chaff, which he was in the act of shooting into the corn-bin in the stable—I stopped him, and prevented his pouring it</p>

                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Mr. Henry Gray. He occupies Hunter's Hall Farm, at Dagenham, about nine miles from the King's Arms—White was in his service, and went with his team—he had an allowance of five bushels of corn for the week, three bushels of beans and oats for the three horses—I gave him out the allowance on Tuesday, generally—I gave it his on the Wednesday this time, because I had lost the key of the barn on the Tuesday—when he went he told me he had got enough to make up with the mixed victuals—the beans and oats were mixed—I did not see him before he started—I have got a sack here which I believe belongs to White—it is one he picked up, and he has used it for some time—I have examined its con<lb></lb>tents—they are what we call mixed victuals—as near as I can tell they are such as my master used—I believe them to be my master's—I have not com<lb></lb>pared it with any on the farm—it is about the same quality—White had no authority from me to take a sack full of this.</p>

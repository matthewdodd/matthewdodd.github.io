On the 10th of October, about two in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop represented herself to be a cook in a gentleman's family at No. 50, Wood-street. She purchased cheese and butter to the amount of fourteen shillings and sixpence, and requested change for a two pound note. I laid the change for a two-pound note on the counter. The prisoner took it up. She said, my man was to go with her to get the two-pound note at her master's house, as she described it, and to take the butter and cheese. My man and the prisoner set off from my house. I expected my man to get the two-pound note. I saw them go out of my shop together. My man returned without the two-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman brought back at the same time - A. No. I did not see the woman any more until I saw her at Hatton Garden office about six weeks after she got the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her to be the woman that played you this trick - A. Yes. I knew her again. I have never got my money. My servants name is

I was to carry the cheese and butter that she had bought, the prisoner said, to No. 50, in Wood-street, and I was to receive a two-pound note back.

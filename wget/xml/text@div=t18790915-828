                  </hi>. I am a house decorator at 16, Dudley Street—on Wednesday night, 20th August, shortly before 12 o'clock, I had just left the theatre door and was crossing into Porter Street, when the prisoner, who was behind me, called out "Make haste here, Bill"—I turned round and saw him standing with his back to the shutters of a shop, and as I walked on I received a blow on the back of my neck from behind on the right, and fell on my right elbow on the kerb—a man put his knees on my elbow and held me by the throat, and another man was leaning on my knees and held me down while the prisoner, leaning over, tried to get the chain from my waistcoat—I got my hand free and held the watch; the prisoner held the chain and pulled it, but could not get it—he then said "Boot the b—," and I was kicked, and let go the watch, and they took it away—I got up and ran as far as I could in great pain from my side, and saw the back of the prisoner turn down in the mews on the left—a gas lamp was projecting at the corner and I saw the light thrown distinctly on his back—I saw him next on the Friday night, standing at the door of a public-house—I immediately recognised him, fetched a constable, and gave him in charge—he said "You have made a mistake," and when he spoke I recognised his voice—I have not seen my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know it was the prisoner who called out; he was standing in the direction where the sound came from—I had not seen him before—I do not think it was a minute from the time they attacked me till they ran away—he spoke in rather a loud, excited tone when he answered the policeman—Porter Street is near Granville Street.</p>

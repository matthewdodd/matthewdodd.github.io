                  </hi>. I am a ballast getter. About two o'clock in the morning of Saturday, the 15th of June, I met the prisoner in the street—she asked how I did—I had known her for five years—she said she had only come out of Newgate the same day, and would I give her a bit of supper—I took her into a coffee-shop, and called for bread and butter, coffee, and eggs—I asked if she would have any more—she said no—I had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my left hand trowsers pocket when 1 met her—she sat on my left hand side—I put my hand into my pocket, and took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the rest of the money—she said, "Give it me, I will pay for it "—I handed her the shilling—she handed it to the landlord, who gave her 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I went about two yards from the door with her, and then I missed my money—she walked away as soon as I missed my money—I walked after her, but could not catch her—I had not been in any other person's company—I was sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 152.) I saw the prosecutor—in consequence of what he said I looked after the prisoner, and found her about four o'clock in the morning—I took her to the prosecutor—he charged her, and she was taken to the station—I told her when I first took her it was for rob<lb></lb>bing a man of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said no, she had not had such a chance that night, she only came out of Newgate the day before—I took her to the sta<lb></lb>tion, and asked what she had—she said all she had was in copper, about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she was searched by a female—she found nothing on her—this is the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she took off her pocket, and laid it by her side, and this was in it.</p>

             sworn - On Tuesday, the 27th of December, about twelve o'clock at night, there were a great quantity of staves, to the number of about fifty, stole out of a lighter alongside the ship; they were put into the ship's boat and taken away, boat and staves altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken to? - A. That we have not found out yet; they were lying in <placeName id="t17970111-35-crimeloc219">Ratcliffe-cross tier</placeName>

               <p>Q.What were these staves for? - A. Casks; I know that stave that was left in the boat was one that was taken from the lighter, by a mark J.R. and a cross at the end of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they belong to? - A. Isaac Soley and sons.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the staves secured on board the lighter? - A. They were in an open lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the staves before they were lost? - A. Not two hours; I came over them at ten o'clock at night on board.</p>
               <p>Q. They lay publicly in this barge for any body to help themselves as they went up and down? - A. Yes; but they might as well have taken our ship away as them.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. Before the mast: On Tuesday night, the 27th of December, I went to bed, and there was one of the Custom-house officers on board, and had been for some time; he called me up, and said, there was somebody upon deck; I came upon deck, but could not see any body upon deck, but I found a man in the lighter that was lying alongside the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him enough to know him again? - A. Yes; that was the man at the bar; he is a ballast-heaver.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before, so as to know his person? - A. Yes; he was taking the staves from the lighter, and putting them into the ship's boat; he cut the ship's painter, and got into the boat, and he offered to give me five shillings to say nothing, and he drove up the river, and a man in a lighterman's boat took him into row.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that? - A. Yes; and then they went up the river.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be doing all this? - A. When I came upon deck, he took the last stave out, and cut the painter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other staves in the boat? - A. Yes; the boat was almost full of them; there were about fifty or sixty, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light about the ship? - A. No; it was a moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding he had a hat on, are you perfectly sure he is the man? - A. Yes; I went down into the lighter, and saw his face; I was him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to stop him, or give any alarm? - A. No, I did not try to stop him.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you? - A. There was nobody up but myself; the officer was in bed, and the mate and master too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the reason why you did not attempt to stop him? - A. Yes; I called them as soon as I could, but the boat was gone too far to find him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The officer called to you first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the officer knew of this before you did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew if you had called out to the officer, and told him the man was on board, he would have come to your assistance? - A. He was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know your master would have given you a very good flogging, if you had not fixed upon somebody? - A. I called to the mate of the other ship, and he would not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the mate on board your own ship would not come, though he called to you first? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not attempt to stop him? - A. It was of no use to get myself killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know you come now to swear to him, to save yourself a good flogging for letting him go? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had seen this man before? - A. In Captain Harrison's vessel, heaving ballast.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a very dark night? - A. No, it was a light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give this account of it when you were first questioned about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the Magistrates? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I live at the prisoner's house when I am out of place; I came to his house about six o'clock a boxing night, the 26th of December, and Pindar and his wife and I all laid in the bed together that night; we went to the Black-house and had some beer, and he went home at nine o'clock and went to bed, and I left him in bed when I went away at nine o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What night in the week was it? - A. Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you slept in the same room, or in the same bed? - A. In the same bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I dare say he declared to his wife that he did not make free with you? - A. It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110053"></xptr>was not the first night by a great many; I have lived in the house above a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sleep there in any other way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you not to sleep in the house as you had done before? - A. Because the bed had been washed that I used to sleep in.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he an honest man? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I never saw any thing but honesty by him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you here upon this occasion? - A. His wife came after me the day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear nothing of this business till the day before yesterday? - A. No; I was in place when she came after me.</p>
               <p>Q. What place? - A. At the back of St. Paul's; where they have got three children; I believe it is Great Carter-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What number? - A. I cannot tell; it is the first house; one Murphy keeps the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear of his being taken before? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure he never went out of the house that night? - A. I am perfectly sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not sleep at all that night? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have gone out without your knowledge for two or three hours, and come back again? - A. He might, for ought I know; but I went to bed with him, and left him in bed in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live? - A. No. 8, Golding's-hill, Ratcliffe-highway.</p>

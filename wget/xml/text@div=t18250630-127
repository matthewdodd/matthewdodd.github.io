            . On the 18th of June I was on Islington-green, near Mrs. Macdonnell's house - I saw the prisoner and two other boys come across the green; they went close up to Mrs. Macdonnell's shop; the prisoner and one of the others came back about twenty yards from the shop; the other remained there. I saw the boy who stopped behind come from the shop in two or three minutes, and give the prisoner something; they all went towards the turnpike; they ran part of the way. I lost sight of them.</p>

            . I was sitting in my mother's parlour, and saw the prisoner in company with another boy, lurking about the shop window, before the robbery; and in a quarter of an hour my mother complained of being robbed; I went in pursuit to the Angel and down towards the bridge, in the City-road. and saw three boys running with great rapidity; I watched them some distance, and saw the prisoner, who was one of them, throw something white up in his hand, and catch it again, but I could not see what it was; he was not running then: I crossed the road, and heard the prisoner say something about cutting the glaze; I immediately seized him, and gave him in charge of Cope.</p>

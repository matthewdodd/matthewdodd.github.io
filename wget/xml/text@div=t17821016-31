             at this time was from home; when he returned he took this note, and on applying to Messrs. Welch and Co. he found they knew nothing of the drawer, and that this note was a manifest imposition: in consequence of this, he caused the necessary advertisement to be printed, and had it circulated the next day very early, and the prisoner was apprehended; for on the very evening that the prisoner obtained these goods he turned them into cash; he went to the house of Mr. Paris, a pawnbroker, and there he pawned this watch to this Mr. Paris, which he had allowed seven guineas for, for the sum of two guineas and a half: Paris, the pawnbroker, the next day seeing this advertisement, recollected the person of the prisoner, and the young man was apprehended. You see therefore, Gentlemen, this matter is very short so far; that he put off this note with intention to defraud there cannot be a doubt; for if he had known at that time, or had supposed that the note was really of the value it professed to be, he would certainly have got cash for it otherwise, than by applying in that channel to raise money so much under the value of the note. Gentlemen, it is your province to determine upon this case;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160057"></xptr> I shall call the witnesses who will prove to you, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the prisoner at the bar is a person of the name of Hyam Levy, and that he signed the name of Lewis on the back of this note. The prisoner is likewise charged with the forgery of the acceptance of this note, which is supposed to be accepted by Mr. Olding, one of the partners, but as the marks on the note are excepted J. O. and the first letter appears to be more like an than an a, I take it for granted, an objection will be made by Mr. Sylvester, of counsel for the prisoner, that this does not altogether appear to be the word accepted.</p>

               <p>After he was gone with the watch and the buckles my son came in, I desired him to go to Welch and Rogers's, to know if the note was a good one; I did not see the young man again till I saw him in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of knowing what his real name was? - He declared before the Justice that his name was Hyam Levy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. When this note was first tendered to you did you look at it? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you know such a house as Messrs. Welch and Rogers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then did not it strike you as very odd that a note should be drawn upon Mr. Velch with a V, and Mr. Roger? and another thing here is wrote accepted instead of accepted; the name nor the acceptance did not answer: the name, J. O. is like a T. instead of an J. did any of these things strike you? - No, they did not then.</p>
               <p>You thought it was a bill drawn on them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far off do they live from you? - The corner of Finch-lane, and I live at No. 14, Cornhill; I had nobody with me, I could not send any body.</p>
               <p>No, but you could have read; this young man bought some goods of you? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you desire him to write his name? - No, Sir; he wrote his name voluntarily of himself; I asked him his name; he said, shall I write it at the back? I said, if you please, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where he got this note? - No Sir.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Paris, pawnbroker, in the Strand, I know the prisoner; on the 19th of September, in the evening, he came to pledge a watch, I have the watch here, he pledged it for two guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>The watch produced and deposed to by Mr. Chater, senior.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel to Mr. Chater. This young man never described to you who Messrs. Velch and Roger were? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>He left it to you to make a conclusion who they were? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, in this case, the prisoner tendered a note, clearly in the name of Velch, Roger and Co. bankers, in London, not describing who these bankers were, or where they lived, or that they meant the house of Messrs. Welch, Rogers, and Olding; but tendering this bill to Mr. Chater, as a bill of Messrs. Velch, Roger, and Co. who this Mr. Velch and Roger were, he does not say; that is the imagination of the holders of the bill, and of the bankers: the bill has no one mark of the house about it; Mr. Olding, it is proved, by Mr. Brandford their clerk, writes accd. and not accepted, therefore, I submit to your Lordship, there is at present no evidence to say, that the prisoner, at the time that he offered the bill, meant this house of Welch, Rogers, and Co. it might mean any body else.

He went without the man, the bill-holder; the bankers knew him exceedingly well, they said will you indorse this bill as your property, he said, he would go and fetch the man; he took him with him to the bankers: the bill was payable, if I mistake not, to

               <p>Mr. Fielding. The bill on the face of it states Velch, Roger, and Co. Bankers.</p>
               <p>Court. The bill really seems as if calculated to deceive, it may be taken for Welch in the first instance, and there is a very material thing in the V, as if there was another stroke to make it a W. I did not know at first when I looked at it, whether it was Velch or Welch. Whether it is not sufficiently purporting on the face of it, to be a bill drawn on Welch, Rogers, and Co. and whether any man taking it in the course of trade, would not consider it as such a bill.</p>

            , and have been with him thirteen years; I have known this young man from his infancy, many years; his character has been such, that he has had of me, and Mr. Gompertz, several drafts and cash to the best of my knowledge, but many drafts in my own name, and also for Mr. Gompertz, I never heard any thing dishonest of him, but quite the contrary; his uncle who was very well known for his honesty and integrity, as a diamond broker; as well as Mr. Gompertz as a diamond merchant, have entrusted him with parcels of diamonds to a considerable value, and never made any scruple to trust him. Mr. Gompertz is an ailing man or he would have been here himself.</p>

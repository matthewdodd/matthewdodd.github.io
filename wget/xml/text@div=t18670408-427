                  </hi>. I live at 6, Heath Street, Lewisham, and am engaged in business in London—I am in the habit of receiving bills of exchange from China every mail—they are sent to my address at Lewisham—these bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are seconds of exchange, I had received the firsts from Hong Kong, they had all been cashed—from the ordinary practice I should expect these to come by the next mail—I also expected one first of exchange for 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are on the Hong Kong and Shanghae Banking Company, London—I received no letter by the mail which arrived on 11th February—it should have been delivered at Lewisham on Monday night, the 11th—I saw the prisoner on Thursday, the 14th; an appointment had been made with him the day before by my sister, who gave me four bills late on Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, and next morning the prisoner called—I asked him how he became possessed of the bills—he said that he had found them the day before in a railway carriage; that he went up by a train the day before from Lewisham, giving the time; that the train stopped at Spa Road Sta<lb></lb>tion, and a lady, who had been talking to a gentleman, who showed her the bills, got out there, and the train went on to London Bridge, where the gentleman got out, who, having taken the bills from his breast-pocket, intended to put them into his pocket behind, instead of which he left them on the seat; that he picked them up and ran after the gentlemau, but could not see him—I asked him what time the train left Lewisham—he said, "The mid-day train"—he mentioned the time, but I do not remember it—I said, "How is it that you did not go to the Lost Property Office"—he said, "Oh! yes, I did, but they would not receive them," and that he then looked at them, and thought he would run off to the Bank with them—I said, "When you went to the Bank, did you put the bill on the counter or put it into the clerk's bands?"—he said that he could not say—he was very flippant, and said that the clerk went to the back to see if it was advised, that it was not, and that the bills were given to him back—I said, "Are you sure a banker had these bills in his hands, and gave them to you back?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I believe you have been a banker's clerk"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What bank?"—he could not recollect, so I suggested the London and County—he said, "Yes, aud that was enough for me"—I asked him to walk to the station to describe the gentleman who left these bills behind him—he went with me—the sergeant who took the</p>

I am a widow, and am Mr. Garrett's sister—I live with him—on Wednesday afternoon, 13th February, about half-past two o'clock, the prisoner called on me and said that he had found these bills that morning in a railway carriage, a gentleman having dropped them from his pocket, who had been flourishing them about and showing them to a lady who got out at Spa Road Station; that the gentleman got out at London Bridge, and dropped the bills, and he picked them up and followed him, but lost him in the crowd; that a porter came forward to take them, but he thought he had better take them to the Shanghae Bank, in Broad Street—he could scarcely tell me the time of the train he went by, but he guessed about 11.30—I said that he must call again when my brother came home—he left the four bills with me and arranged to call in the even<lb></lb>ing, which he did, but my brother had not arrived, and he came in the morning.</p>

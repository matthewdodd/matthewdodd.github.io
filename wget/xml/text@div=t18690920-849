               <p>I was in plain clothes in the Minories—a van passed down then, there, from which the driver was thrown, and was lying on the ground—there was a crowd round—I saw Mr. Orchard go in amongst the crowd, and pick the man up—while he was doing that, the prisoner placed his handkerchief round his hand, and as the prosecutor rose up he made a rush at him and took something from his waistcoat pocket—I could not see what it is, be<lb></lb>cause the prisoner had his handkerchief in his hand—I saw the watch guard hanging down—the prisoner ran away, shoving the handkerchief in his pocket—I followed him into Rosemary Lane, where he ran into a clothes shop—a boy was at the door, and I went up stairs—the prisoner ran into the back room, and turned out the gas—I got a light, and saw him stand<lb></lb>ing up, attempting to shove something into a crevice in the ceiling—I told him I was a police constable, and should take him into custody for robbing a gentleman, in the Minories—I searched him in the shop, but found nothing on him—I searched the crevice in the ceiling, but found nothing there—in the evening the prosecutor brought the watch to the station—I saw the prosecutor go into the crowd—I noticed that he had a watch guard on—it was not hanging down then.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 1, Sharp's Buildings, Minories—about 6.30, in the afternoon, 16th August, I saw a man thrown from a van—I ran directly to pick him up, and whilst doing so, someone tapped me on the shoulder, and I missed my watch—my chain was hanging down—it was safe when I went into the crowd—I saw the prisoner running towards the Mint, and I ran after him, with the constable, till he turned into a clothier's shop, in Rosemary Lane—I saw a light in the back room when I went into the shop—it was put out directly—I stood at the door while the constable went up—when the gas was lighted the prisoner was standing on a box, reaching up to the ceiling—I re<lb></lb>mained in the shop about twenty minutes with the prisoner before he was taken to the station—I was standing at one end of the room—I after wards found my watch in my coat pocket—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was broken from the guard—the prisoner had no opportunity of putting it in my pocket—I was at the door to prevent him, coming out—I was in the room twenty minutes, while the search was going on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You never felt the watch put into your pocket at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was in the shop three times after the prisoner was taken to the station—it must have been put in the last time I was in the shop—I had felt in my pocket before then—it must have been put in after the prisoner was in custody—it could not have slipped there, and I did not put it there myself.</p>

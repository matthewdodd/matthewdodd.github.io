                  </hi>. I am a milk-man, of Walthamstow. I had a cow, called "Beauty," safe in my field on Thursday evening, 10th Aug.—I would not have taken under 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I had not sold it, nor suffered my son to sell it—I missed it a few minutes before six o'clock next morning—I afterwards saw it at Temple Mills, nearly two miles from my premises—Mr. Love's man had it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. On the evening of 10th Aug., I saw Canson—he asked me if the cow-boy was on the premises—I saw him again about a quarter past eight o'clock, with the other two prisoners, about 100 yards from Gaydon's place—Jonathan Gaydon said if I saw the old gentleman I was not to tell him I had seen him—the other two prisoners were near enough to hear that.</p>

On Thursday evening, 10th Aug., I saw Perkins and Canson about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, about a mile from the prosecutor's, driving the cow before them—I asked where they were going to take it—they said, "To Temple Mills, to go to Smithfield"—I asked where they got it—Perkiss said, "Bought it, and paid for it, of young Gaydon"—I said, "Which?"—Perkiss replied, "Of the father and the son both, on the Monday previous," but Mr. Gaydon had given them leave to let it remain there till Thursday—Perkiss said he gave 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and he had been at the Nag's Head with Gaydon and his son, and they had a pot of ale together—I saw Mr. Gaydon the next morning, and from what he said I took Perkiss into custody—the cow was found in possession of one of Mr. Love's men.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman N</hi> 36). On Friday morning, 11th Aug., I went with the prosecutor to try to find the cow—I saw Mr. Love's man with it—I left it at Temple Mills, in charge of the police—it was afterwards delivered to Mr. Gaydon—I took Perkiss into custody in Smithfield—he said he bought it of young Gaydon, on the Monday previous, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave a deposit of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that he came on the Thursday night and paid the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him, and he let him in at the small gate with a latch-key, and drove the cow out at the large gate; and allowed him to keep the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. extra as he bad got a good bargain.</p>

I took Gaydon on the evening of 11th Aug.—I cautioned him in the usual way—I told him I took him for being concerned in the robbery of his father's cow—he cried very much, and said he should not have done it if he had not been persuaded by some person to buy a gun, and had not the money to do it.</p>

On the 15th of April, the prisoner looked in at my window and then he went away again. I was sitting at supper, it was past eleven at night; there is no glass to that part of the shop, it is open. he returned again in two or three minutes, and put his hand under the kit and lifted it up. I observed he looked hard on the other side of the way, and then left the tub and went away again. I staid to watch him; he came again in three or four minutes and took the tub of salmon off. I ran after him directly; he turned up an alley. I ran after him and catched him with the tub of salmon in his hand, and the glass was upon it. When I caught him he said, what can you do with a drunken man? I gave the watchman charge of him; he did not appear to be drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Pembridge Villas, Notting Hill—about 1.30 on Christmas morning 1 was aroused by the police, and I let them in—we walked straight through the hall from the front door to the back entrance and I noticed spots of blood—I let another: policeman in at the back door, and we walked through the conservatory into the drawing-room—I went to the door but I did not enter the room with the police—I went in afterwards and saw the prisoner in the hands of the police—I saw him searched at the station and saw fourteen photographs and eight or ten Christmas cards found in his pocket—they are my property and were kept on the drawing-room table—I examined the premises and found the whole of the coal cellar window broken in; the frame work all broken and it was sufficiently large for a man to get through—from the coal-house the knife-house would have to be passed through—I saw a coat found in the knife-house which did not belong to me—I had never seen a coat there before—I did not examine the lower premises on Christmas Eve as I generally do.</p>

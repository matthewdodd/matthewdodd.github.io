               <p>Are you sure you was near enough to see whether he took any thing up, or only stooped? - What he picked up seemed to be at a distance from him and looked like paper.</p>
               <p>Did you see him before he stooped? - As I turned round I saw a man stoop down.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the Counter to see him? - No.</p>
               <p>To WILDBOAR. How soon after that was it that the man was taken? - I suppose it was not more than ten minutes that I heard of it; there was a mob; I went to see what it was,. and he was going towards the Counter.</p>
               <p>Did you know him to be the man you saw stoop down? - I judge it to be the man I saw stoop down by his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the Counter? - Not till I was sent for by the mother of the prisoner about two days ago.</p>
               <p>Was that the first application that was made to you on the part of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him to the Counter? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - No.</p>

               <p>How did his mother know you knew any thing of it? - I cannot say, that I did not enquire about; she came to me and said, a person told her I was there and saw him stoop.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - Upon my word I don't know.</p>
               <p>Did you mention this to any person? - I mentioned it to several people, that I saw a man taken up that used the Ship and Baker over the water.</p>
               <p>Did you think the man was falsely accused? - I did not know what to think; I should think, if he had done any thing he would not stay to stoop, but run away.</p>
               <p>How came you not to go to the Counter, and say you saw him stoop and pick up something, if you thought him innocent? - I did not want to trouble myself about it.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A dyer.</p>
               <p>Where do you work now? - No where now; I worked journeyman with one Mr. White in Ratcliff-highway last week.</p>
               <p>Had the man that stooped a hat or not? - That I don't know.</p>
               <p>To ANDREE. Look at the prisoner; is this the man that was carried to the Counter upon whom the things were found? - It is.</p>
               <p>Suppose you had not been able to take him at that time, and had not found the things upon him, should you know him to be the same man you had the struggle with in the house? - No; but he was never out of my sight till he was taken.</p>
               <p>JURY. You are sure the prisoner is the man you pursued from the house? - I am.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the employ of the Mint for twenty<lb></lb>seven years—on 23rd February, about half-past eight, I went to 97, Flower and Dean Street, Spitalfields, with ten or twelve other officers—we went to the second floor—the door was fastened, by a table being placed between it and the bed, on which the prisoners lay—by some difficulty we managed to remove the table, and got in—the prisoners were undressed in bed—I said, "My name is Brannan, I come with a search warrant, signed by Mr. Ellison, the Magistrate at Worship Street, as you are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession"—while forcing our way in Davis dropped this purse on the floor—it was picked up—Gladden said that it was that <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> that put us on them—I asked her who <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> was—she said, "<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> Phipps over the way, and you shall have him soon, so help me God"—I said, "His place is being searched now"—I saw Miller take two packets, containing two shillings each, from the bottom of an old chair, wrapped up in a piece of horsehair, with paper lapped between them—they were bad—she said, "I will acknowledge to the shillings, but so help me God the two shilling pieces must have been put there by that b——y <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>; you shall have him before long"—I made them get up and dress, and took them in custody—as we left we saw <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, and Gladden said, "Oh, you b——y <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, they shall have you before long"—some tissue paper was found on the table, which appeared to have had coin in it—that is the paper in which they wrap counterfeit coin invariably.</p>

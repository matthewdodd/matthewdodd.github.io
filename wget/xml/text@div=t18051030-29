               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had the stones, I told him they did not belong to me, it made no difference to me; they belonged to Delaney, I did not know, but they were ordered by my master, as I had done different jobs that day for different men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Batho. I believe the stones had been shot about half a mile from the place, near the back of the London-dock, I believe these are the same stones, they are of the same quality.</p>

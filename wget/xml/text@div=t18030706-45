               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I purchase those hose from your shop? - A. Yes, in the manner I have stated.</p>

               <p>Q. Did I promise to pay the porter? - A.You did.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JACKSON sworn. - I am porter to Mr. Lobb; I was ordered by Mr. Wilson to go with the prisoner, and bring back nine guineas for the goods; I followed the prisoner to the India House; up two pair of stairs, on the landing-place, he took the parcel out of my hand, and told me he was to give me nine guineas, and desired me to stop, and he would pay me; he went along the passage, and I followed him at a diftance, as I thought he was gone to some of the Offices; going further on in the passage I perceived a stair-case, and the prisoner nearly at the bottom, when I saw him put the parcel into his pocket; I run down stairs, but could see no more of him till I saw him at Bow-street about a fortnight after.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you hear any words between Wilson and me? - A.You asked for a bill of parcels, and said you would pay the person who took them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The indictment charges me with having stolen this property; it is evident I went and fairly purchased them, and they were delivered to me at the India-House.</p>

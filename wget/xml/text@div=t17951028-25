               <p>Q. Were you in the warehouse of Messrs. Brandon and Cortissy on the 19th of September? - Yes. The prisoner was <rs id="t17951028-25-deflabel141" type="occupation">employed by the customs to take the tares from the coffee</rs>

               </p>
               <p>Q. How is the coffee kept? - In casks and bags. They are generally open after they are tared. I was on the stairs. I see the prisoner take the coffee out of the cask, it was this small bag, and put it into his breeches. On doing this he went down stairs. I immediately followed him, and told Chamerson, the excise officer, if he offered to go out to stop him. I went up and told my master, and he called him to him, and master told Chamerson to touch him, and he said, he had got a little coffee in his breaches; he pulled it out himself, and delivered it to Mr. Chamerson.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there? - Two pounds and a quarter, Mr. Chamerson weighed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any such small bags as these in the warehouses in which coffee are kept? - There are not.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of coffee was it? - Raw coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be of the same kind as the coffee in the warehouse? - The very same kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. Did you see him put the coffee into the bag? - No, I did not, because the casks was not above half full. I see him take the bag out of the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a warehouseman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray has there not been some little kind of dispute between the custom house men and the warehouse men? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not so unreasonable as to complain that you would not move the casks? Was there any complaint to your matter that it was your business to move the casks out of the way, and you did not move them? - I do not remember there was any such complaint.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the allowance of beer taken away in consequence of their complaint? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was stopped? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this man's employment in the warehouse? - A coffee tarer, employed by the customs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the custom of office to search every man before be went out? - Yes, but in the part where he had concealed it, he might not have been searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they not been, in consequence of several depredations, more in their search? - They certainly have.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280042"></xptr>Q. Was he certain of being searched before he left work? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this such a quantity that you think be could escape being found out? - Yes, because I observed when he went down stairs there did not appear any alteration.</p>

This is the same kind as was in the warehouse.</p>

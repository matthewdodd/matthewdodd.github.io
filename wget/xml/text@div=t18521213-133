                  </hi>. I live at Galway-buildings, Bath, my husband is a mason there; the prisoner married my daughter Ann, in June, 1851; previous to Mon<lb></lb>day, 15th Nov., I received a letter from my sister, in consequence of which I came to town from Bath on Monday, 15th Nov.—I went to No. 76, Sun-street, Bishopsgate, where the prisoner and my daughter lived—I do not think it was 6 o'clock when I went there, I am not sure—my daughter was there, nobody else—Mrs. Roe, my sister, was with me—the prisoner came in about ten minutes after I went, to the best of my knowledge; he came in and said, "Well, mother;" I said, "Well, Henry, how are you?" he said he was very ill; I asked him what was the matter with him; he said, he had got a pain in the chest—I said. "I do not wonder at it, on account of your using poor Ann as you have"—I think the next words I said were, "Well, I am come to-night for Ann"—he said, "Wait a bit, and I will tell you"—I said, "I have waited long enough"—he said, "if you won't wait to hear what I have got to say, I will leave the room;" and he put on his hat—I said, "Ann, my dear, make haste and come with me, come this night with me, you knew that I was coming for you?"—I do not think the prisoner was more than ten minutes gone; he came back with sergeant Dixon, and a policeman named Brown—sergeant Dixon said to me, "You must go from here;"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "You are come to break the peace"—I said, "I am not;"—he said, "You are forcing a man's wife away, from what he says?"—she got up then, and said, "Oh, no, sir, it is not my mother who is forcing me, I wish to go myself"—sergeant Dixon said, "Do not you wish to live with your husband?" she said, "Not unless he will keep his hands off me; because it was decided between me and my husband,</p>

               <p>three weeks ago, for me to leave him, on account of his pledging all my clothes and selling all my goods"—the sergeant said, "These are family affairs, I do not know anything about them; you need not go to-night unless you like to;" and then he left—nothing else was said, to the best of my knowledge, before he left—after the sergeant left the prisoner took his wife by the hand, and said, "Come here Ann, my dear, are you willing to leave me?"—she said, "Yes, Henry, unless you keep your hands from me"—he said, "I never <hi rend="italic">hurted</hi> you, did I?"—I said, "How can you say that, when it took a woman or two to rescue your hands from her neck, and bruised it black?" she said, "Oh, Henry, I never told mother anything, it was not I that told her; "<hi rend="italic">no more she did not</hi>—he said, "I never bruised your neck black, did I Ann?"—"Henry," she said, "I never <hi rend="italic">runs</hi> from my word; yes, my neck was bruised black"—then he said, "Oh, Ann, the policeman told me you should not go home to-night without I liked; you shall not go home to-night"—she said, "Mother dear, I have neither money nor clothes to come home"—I said, "Never mind that my dear, for if you have health you can get more money, and I can pay your passage home; come with me to-night as I have got a return ticket to go back this night?"—he said no, she should not come to-night, "to-morrow," he said, "I will take her clothes out of pledge, and you shall have her by 10 o'clock"—there was a trunk in the room; she had put her things in it, and packed it up before he came in at first—all this time she was sitting on his lap—she said, "Henry dear, you have got no money?" "Oh," he said, "I can borrow some money on the bank book"—she said, "Mother, stop all night, and I will make you up a bed?"—the prisoner said, "No, there is no room for mother"—she said, "Yes, I could make you up a comfortable bed; do stop?"—he said, "No, the bed is not large enough, you could not be comfortable,"—then he said, "No, do not stop to-night, mother, come to<lb></lb>morrow morning, and have a cup of coffee with us?"—I said, "Henry, I do not consider my daughter's life safe in your hands this night, neither should I think myself safe to have a cup of coffee with you to-morrow morning"—he said, "Do you think that of me?" I said, "Yes, I do"—he said, "What do you say <hi rend="italic">of</hi> that, Ann?"—she made no answer to that—he said, "You shall be sure to have her to-morrow morning, at 10 o'clock"—I desired him again to let me have her that night, and to go borne, as my family would be uneasy about me, expecting to see me home the same evening; but he said, "No"—I think I wished him "Good night," and said, "Shall I have her to-morrow?" he said, "Yes"—he held her right hand in his left hand all the time—I said, "I do not know where I shall go to lodge;" he said, "Go over the way; somebody will tell you where you can go to lodge;" I said, "I am so strange here"—I came out, and met the same two policemen who were in with me—in about ten minutes afterwards I went back again, and called a great many times before either of them answered me, and my breath was so short, and I was very excited with them not answering me—I asked her to lend me some clothes, and I got a lodging for the night, and left about ten minutes to 7 o'clock—it was nearly half past 10 o'clock, or not quite so much, it might be a quarter past, when I returned in the morning; I am not sure—I went upstairs and called for about ten minutes, and there was no answer, but at last I heard him getting off some<lb></lb>thing, I do not know what, as he stepped down—the room door was fastened—he said, "That is Mrs. Rogers"—I said, "Henry, where is Ann?"—he said, "She is all right; we are happy now, <hi rend="italic">ain't us</hi>, my dear?"—I said, Ann, my dear, if you are there, why don't you answer me?"—he said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185212130065"></xptr>
               <p>She is here, and we are happy; "I said, "Well, open the door, then"—he laid, "There is no hurry"—I said, "Will you open the door, Henry; let me see her, that is all I want; if you don't open the door I shall go for a policeman"—I went downstairs and got a policeman, came back with him, and found the prisoner down in the passage—the policeman said, "Where is your wife, Horler?"—all <hi rend="italic">as</hi> he got out of him was, "She is right enough, and we are happy enough"—he appeared to be tipsy—the policeman said, "Well, tell me where she is; let us go upstairs and see where your wife is"—he said, "I need not go unless I like to; if you will come out with me, I will show you the spot where I left my wife this morning at 6 o'clock, kissed her, and parted with her in happiness"—I said, "If she is out of her own house she is in the river, or in some water, for you have certainly murdered my daughter;" I said, "Police, don't you let him go, for he is a murderer"—we all three went out then on pretence of his showing where she was; there was sergeant Dixon, and me, and the prisoner—the prisoner did not go anywhere, and I said, "Sergeant, don't you listen to him, because he is only leading us a <hi rend="italic">dance</hi>;" and at my request the sergeant took him into custody—the sergeant then went back to the house, but I did not—I saw my daughter's body on the next day, Wednesday; she had on the same boots and frock that she had on the Monday evening when I left her.</p>

               <p>wife's mother there was a fortune-teller, and that she earned a deal of money, as much as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a day; that she had several other daughters, all of whom were married, and had children; and his wife not having any children, on that account his mother-in-law was more anxious for his wife to keep the door of the fortune-telling room—he then asked me what he was to do—I asked him if his wife was inclined to leave him—he said they had so worked upon her that he believed she would leave him—I told him that if my wife was inclined to leave me I should allow her to go, but that he might please himself—he further stated that he had money in the bank, I believe he mentioned 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that they were also demanding the half of that, and asked me if they had a right to it—I replied that the property was his as well as his wife, and it was at his own option whether or not he gave it—he then left the station apparently satisfied—he returned again a little before six o'clock, and stated that he had been down to his place and they would not allow him to go in; that they had caught him by the throat and thrust him out—I told him that he had a right to go into his own place, and, if he chose, to order them out; and as I was instructing a constable to go down to the place to see what was the matter, the inspector and a sergeant came into the charge-room, and the inspector, understanding from the prisoner what the matter was, ordered the sergeant down to the house to see what was the matter—I saw him again three or four hours after, about 9, or between 9 and 10 o'clock; he then returned in company with a young man named Bucking<lb></lb>ham—I was at the station-house door as they came in—I asked them as they passed, what was the matter now—the prisoner remarked that this was a young man he had known for a long time, and that he bad every con<lb></lb>fidence to place in him, and be wished to hand over his bank-book and money to him, and to sign an agreement to that effect—I remarked to him that thought he was acting rather hasty and foolish, and suggested to him to wait till to-morrow; but he seemed inclined to have the agreement signed, and to have it done to-night—I then told him that I did not exactly see it to be a police matter, and suggested to him to see the bank authorities, which he could do in the morning—they then both left the station together—he was perfectly sober when I had these conversations with him, and his manner perfectly collected.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, living in Baker's-buildings—previous to the 15th Nov. I had purchased some furniture of the prisoner; I saw him on Monday evening, 15th Nov.—he came to me about 8 o'clock, as near as I can guess; between 7 and 8 o'clock—he said he thought he was going to sit down comfortably, but his mother-in-law, and his aunt, had come from the West-end, and they had upset him again, and they seized him by the throat and threatened to murder him, and turned him out of the room, and he had come to me to know what he should do—I said, "Go to the police station, and get assistance"—he said, "Will you go with me?" and I went with him to the station, and I was asked some questions by sergeant Dixon about the furniture, which I answered—I went back to the house with the prisoner and the policeman; I saw his wife there—that was about half past 8 o'clock, when I went with sergeant Dixon; the prisoner was then in the passage—I then went home, about a quarter of an hour after, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to me again; that would be between 8 and 9 o'clock, as near as I can recollect—he stated that his mother had threatened to transport him, and would I go and have the money turned over in my name at the bank, and when he wanted it he would send to me for it; I agreed to do it—I then left him, and went out, and he went too—he did not go with me, he went out at the same time as I did, or directly after; I went to the station with the bank book, and then went to the bank and had the money turned over to me; the prisoner said that he should go to America, and take his wife with him, and then he should be away from them all—he afterwards came to me again with two coats, a pair of boots, and two waistcoats, and I had got a boa there that he had left there some time before, and he gave me some pledge tickets—he said, as he was going to America he should not get them out, and I might have them if I liked—he said, if he called for them I was to let him have them, and if he did not I was to keep them—he did not say anything more that night—I did not see him again until next morning—he left my house at 7 minutes past 11 o'clock on the Monday night—he was then perfectly sober—I saw him on the Tuesday morning; he came to me about half past 8 o'clock, as near as I can guess; he was very much intoxi<lb></lb>cated, and remarked that I must excuse him because he was intoxicated—I told him to go home, and he went away—he had not said anything to me on the Sunday previous—at the time be sold the furniture to me, he stated that his wife wished to part with the furniture, and if I liked I should have the first offer; I said to him, "Does your wife wish to part with it?"—he said, "Yes;" I said, "I will come over and look at it;" I went over, and said to the wife, "Do you wish to sell your things?"—she said, "I do; if you do not have them a broker shall;" that was about the 3rd Nov., in the fore<lb></lb>part of the month, about a fortnight before this occurrence.</p>

               <p>that they had the power to do it—I said they could not do it, and he said, "Fortune-tellers can do anything;" he appeared really to believe that they had the power to transport him, and I could not persuade him otherwise; I tried but could not—I said, "They can't do such a thing as that, Henry;" he said, "They can; they have got a doctor, she stated to me that she had bribed a doctor in Bath to come up and swear that I was no man; and if that was not enough, she would get my own father;" and he said, "What can I do?"—I said, "They cannot do it;" he said, "The doctor I dare not refuse;" I said, "You can have a doctor on your behalf," and he sent my wife out of the room, and there exposed himself to me—I could not convince him that they had not the power to transport him; he still believed they could, and I could not persuade him otherwise—he said that they wished to get his money, and that was the reason why he wished to have it turned over to me, that they should not have it—it was turned over to me late on Monday evening, after the bank hours—he was so anxious to have it turned over that it was done after the bank hours, because he really believed that they could transport him—he said that his wife's mother had said to his wife, before him, "Give him a pill if you wish to get rid of him, as I did a party at Bath, and kept him lingering for four months, and no one will talk about it;" he said that his wife's mother said that in his presence—he said nothing further about what they threatened to do to him; I have told you all he said about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was not a delusion on his mind that her friends were interfering with her, but she said so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she mentioned it in his presence and mine too—she also spoke about going to America—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at 77, Wardour Street—on the after<lb></lb>noon of 22nd October I served the prisoner with twopennyworth of hot rum—he tendered a bad florin—I said "Are you aware what you have given me?"—he said "No, I have been into Carrera's, tobacconist, and they gave it to me in change"—that is about 100 yards off—I gave him in custody and gave the piece to the manager—these are them produced. Samuel Cullum. I am manager of the Duke of Wellington, 77, Wardour Street—on 22nd October I was in the bar, but did not see the florin until after it was broken—I said to the prisoner "Now look here, you may have got this by way of mistake; have you any money about you to pay for what you have called for?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you any more bad money now?"—he said "No"—I called a constable, who</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in James's-place, Ratcliffe. I keep a private house, with two rooms in it—on the morning of the 27th of September I went out at half-past four o'clock to the public-house—the per<lb></lb>sons were not up—I saw the prisoner Blewitt pass me with two charis—I had never seen him before—they were painted rush-bottom chairs—I told him they were mine—he made no answer—I called a policeman who was standing close by—I turned myself round, and saw Henwright on the pavement, with my wash-hand basin—I asked her how she got it—she said this man gave it to her—he made no answer—I had seen them ten minutes before in my own house.</p>

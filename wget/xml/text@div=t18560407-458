On Monday, 10th March, I fastened up the house—the bar of the back kitchen window was secure when I went to bed at 11 o'clock—I was awoke from half past 5 to a quarter to 6 o'clock next morning—I found the shutter of that window broken off the hinges—the bar was as I had left it on the previous night—the window was open—I missed 5 coats, 7 pairs of trowsers, upwards of 12 waistcoats, a necklace, a brooch, a silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and a pair of gloves—I had seen those things the last thing before I vent to bed, in the front shop—the dress coat was hanging on a chair in the back parlour—the property is worth upwards of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know either of the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at the Model Lodging House, in Queenn's road, Chelsea. On Monday, 10th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I saw Abbott in the Queen's-road—Edmondson came up soon after, and Ventham was on the other side of the road—Abbott had sent for me, and he asked me to buy a pawn ticket—I did buy it, and gave him sixpence for it—he then asked me where Mr. West lived—Edmondson came up soon after that, he asked me if there were any bells in the house, I told him I did not know—Edmondson came up at the time Abbott was asking me about the bells—he was near enough to hear what was said—Ventham was across the road, not near enough to hear what was passing—they said nothing more—oh! yes they said they would go there—they did not say when or what for—they said they would go to Mr. West's—I swear they did not say what for—they then left me, and went towards Chelsea College—on the Wednesday I heard that the robbery was committed, and I told the constable what they had said to me—on the Friday night I went to their lodging where they slept, in Orchard-street, Westminster—I went by myself—Abbott and Edmondson lodged there—I saw both of them in the morning and the same night—it was between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning that I saw them—they told me they had done the robbery—they told me they got in the back way; and Abbott showed me the pawn tickets—he told me they had pawned the things for 6£. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they wished they had not done it—they both spoke—they asked if I would buy the tickets, or if I could tell them who would buy them—I said it was not safe to have anything to do with them—I then left them, and went and met the constable, 339, and I told him that Edmondson had a knife, which he took from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Edmondson. Q.</hi> How many days afterwards were you yourself charged with the robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was never charged with it at all—I did not see you with any pawn tickets—Abbott had them—I sent the policeman in to you directly after I came out—I have been in prison, but not for felony—I have been in twice, once for leaving the workhouse with the clothes on, and once for a bottle of brandy—I was brought into it by another, I was charged with stealing it—I was found guilty, and had three months—I was taken up for robbing my lodging and got off—that was about seven or eight months ago—Mr. West once gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was for some work that was pawned by a party I was with, not by myself—that was last June—Mr. West dis<lb></lb>charged me because he was short of work—he had lost the use of his limbs and could not get about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 174). On Monday, 17th March, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 10<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Holywell-street, Westminster—I went to the up stairs back room; the door was fastened—I tried to open it, but could not—I waited there for some few minutes, and then the door was opened by Ventham—I went in and found the room fall of smoke—I said to Ventham, "What is the cause of all this smoke?"—he said, "I have just been smoking a pipe," drawing my attention to a pipe that was on the window ledge—I picked up the pipe, and found it was quite cold—I handed it to the landlady of the house, and likewise to the con<lb></lb>stable—the smoke proceeded from a chamber pot that was standing in the middle of the room—I did not examine it then—I told Ventham I should take him into custody on a charge of breaking into a house in Manor-street, Chelsea—he replied, "I know nothing at all about it; I have been at work at Kingston for the last three weeks, for a man in Earl's-court"—I then com<lb></lb>menced searching the room, and underneath the bedstead I found Abbott secreted up in the corner—I got him out, and told him he was charged with being concerned with Ventham in breaking and entering the house in Manor-street, Chelsea—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I asked him what he was doing underneath there—he said, "I got underneath then because I did not want the landlord or landlady of the house to see me, or to know I was here"—I then took them to the station—I locked the room door—as we went along, I told them that Edmondson was in custody—they said they knew nothing at all about him—after taking them to the station, I went back to the room, and from the chamber pot I took these pieces of a duplicate, there being a quantity of other pieces also in it, but they were all burnt up into small pieces—I found the remains—I ascertained that they were the remains of pawn tickets, by applying to a pawnbroker—these pieces are dry now, but the chamber pot was half full of urine at that time—on examining underneath the bed where Abbott's head was, as he lay there in a stooping position, I found the remnants of some paper appa<lb></lb>rently burnt, with a lucifer lying on the floor, and the floor was much burnt—I produce those remnants—no property was found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Abbott.</hi> I was smoking, I had my pipe in my pocket. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not see whether Abbott was smoking, he had no pipe when I took him into custody—there were three pipes lying on a shelf, and when he was by the door, he said, "Let me take a pipe," and he took one that was half full of tobacco that had been in for some little time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ventham. Q.</hi> When you came to my door, did you speak at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the landlady of the house came up with me—I could not see inside the room—I tried other pipes besides the one in the window—there were two others on the mantel piece—the witness, Wilkins, stated at first at the police court, that he knew nothing at all about you, he was afterwards recalled, and then he stated that he saw you on the opposite side of the way.</p>

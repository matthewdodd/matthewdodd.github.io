               <p>How do you know it was your horse? - I am very sure of it, it was a brown gelding, about fourteen hands and a half high, I suppose, I do not know exactly, I have the horse now.</p>
               <p>Is there any particular marks besides? - Rather a large head, a remarkable large headed horse of the draught kind, it was a chaise horse.</p>
               <p>Were there any particular marks? - I cannot say I know of any particular marks.</p>
               <p>Can you safely swear that the horse you saw the day after in the possession of the uncle, was the horse that was stolen out of your stable? - Certainly, my Lord, I have no doubt of it; I was alarmed in the morning between three and four on the third of June, that my house was broke open, I immediately sent a man to the stables; I borrowed a horse of a neighbour, I went to different turnpikes in search of it; I took the prisoner, I met him going to London in search of the horse, I met him under the wall of Kensington Gardens; the prisoner was my <rs id="t17840707-40-deflabel213" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Court. Was the confession taking in writing? - Yes, and signed by himself.</p>

               <p>Can you swear positively to the horse? - O Sir, there is no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Here is no confession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. You say this lad had lived with you nine months, had not he lived with you longer? - No, Sir, he came to me the 17th of June was a twelvemonth, and absconded.</p>
               <p>During the time he lived with you I believe he behaved very well, that you have acknowledged? - Where did I acknowledge that?</p>

               <p>The lad was giving a dram to a poor soldier, and his master threatened to lick him, and he ran away.</p>

               <p>Did not you ride part of the way to go for it? - We turned down Kensington, and I wished to have charged an officer with them there; he rode behind the uncle, the uncle said I will engage he shall go whereever you please, we never went out of the road, the uncle said, I believe I can find the horse for you; when we came into Piccadilly, the prisoner slipped down from behind his uncle, and ran down Piccadilly.</p>

               <p>I recollect the prisoner calling on me on the 2d of June, he came from Bayswater, he was going to Great Ealing, he was very bad indeed with the small pox about him; I persuaded him not to go, I asked him to have my horse, I keep a little old horse, and asked him to have it to ride, and not to be late on account of his being ill, he thought he was able to go the journey very well, the next morning I saw Mr. Curtis, he rode up to my house and called me out, he asked me how my nephew did, I said he was in a very weak bad way, and he was gone to Ealing, that he called upon me the night before, and was very bad; he went aw ay soon after; he called again, and said to me, Colley, if you behave like an honest man, you will go along with me directly; for what, says I, says he, your nephew has robbed me to night; I went with Mr. Curtis, and by Bayswater we saw my nephew; Mr. Curtis called to me, come along, Colley, I said I am coming as fast as I can; says he, my horse will be boiled down before I can get at him; I said I hoped it was not so bad as that, I hoped we should find the horse and the boy too; Mr. Curtis said, damn the boy, he did not mind so the horse was not boiled down; when he saw the prisoner he caught hold of him, the boy said stop master what is the matter, says he you have been and robbed me to night, the boy said he had not robbed him of any thing, he told him he had broke open his house and robbed him, I asked Mr. Curtis of what, and he said he could not tell what yet; the boy said let me speak to my uncle, I directly caught hold of him, says I, he shall not go away.</p>
               <p>Court. When the Prosecutor charged him with taking the horse did he deny any knowledge of the horse? - He did say he had taken nothing from him, he told me directly the horse was at Chelsea very safe, I told the prosecutor so immediately, and I said I hope you will forgive him, he said I do not know what he has taken from me, we turned down to go to Chelsea and went as far as Hangmore Inn, through Kensington, it is two miles out of the road, we turned back again in order to go to Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to go? - Then Mr. Curtis's mind altered, he would not go, then we came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Now you have heard what that witness has said, is that true? - No, not that I purposed to go to Chelsea, or promised to forgive the man.</p>

                  </hi> I am parish clerk of St. Paul, Deptford. I was present at a marriage on 6th Jan., 1842, between two persons, named Nadin and Pugh—I have no recollection of it, except by the book, where I find my signature—I have a copy of the book here, which I made myself, and examined it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">William Nadin and Elizabeth Pugh married 6th Jan.</hi>, 1842")—I gave a certificate to the bride at the time.</p>

I have known the prisoner four or five years—she lived in Boon-street, Lee, nearly opposite to me—William Nadin lived with her as her husband—I have seen them together numbers of times—on Monday night, 5th Feb., I was at the Greenwich station when the prisoner was brought there by Green, charged with this offence—her husband, Nadin, afterwards came in, and I asked her where the certificate of her marriage with that man was—she said it was in a little box in her box—I examined her box, and found this little box with two or three papers in it, and this copy of a certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I last saw Nadin on 12th Feb.</p>

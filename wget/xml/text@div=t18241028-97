            . I live at Chichester, and did so in 1815. Messrs. Marsh, Sibbald, and Co. were my bankers. I had 5450 l. 3 per cent. Consols at that time - they received my dividends for me. I bought 100 l. more not long ago; I have received the dividends on 5450 l. upto that time, and since that time upon 5550 l. from Messrs. Marsh and Co. I never authorized them or anybody to sell 5000 l. of that stock; I never executed this instrument - (examining it) - it is not my hand-writing. I was not in town in May, 1815, but at Chichester.</p>

            , re-examined. Mr. Marsh generally went to the Bank to receive the bulk of the dividends; it is usual before they are received for an alphabetical list to be made of the sums and the dividends to be received - I believe Mr. Fauntleroy generally made out that list.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this, is it a list of the dividends to be received in July, 1824, upon Consols - A. It is, and it is endorsed</p>
               <p>"Three per cent. Consols, July 1824, Marsh, Stracey, and Co." The endorsement, and the whole list appear to be in the hand-writing of Mr. Fauntleroy, except the figures in red ink, which are made by the clerks at the Bank - the columns of names and sums are in Mr. Fauntleroy's hand-writing. Miss Young's name is towards the end of it, and the sum of 550 l. is placed opposite to her name. When Mr. Marsh receives the dividend warrants, he brings them home, and gives them, I believe, to Mr. Fauntleroy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made out the account of sums received at the Bank - A. Mr. Fauntleroy made out part of it, and the rest is made out by the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the day-book for July, 1824 - A. I have; it contains an account of dividends received in July, 1824; the first twenty-four items are in Mr. Fauntleroy's handwriting, and the rest is entered by a clerk; the 23d entry which is in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing, is as follow: - (reads.)</p>
               <p>"F. Young 5550 l. Consols, 83 l. 5. s" which is the half-yearly dividend purporting to be received. I have the day-book for July 1815 - here is an entry of Miss Young's dividend on 5450 l. - 73 l. 11 s. 6 d. in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing, with several other entries. I believe the property-tax is deducted. Here is an entry of the dividends received in January, 1816: the three first items are in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing, and the rest are by the clerk. Miss Young's dividend is entered for 5450 l., but not in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing; here is an entry for the same amount of F. Young's stock in July 1816, in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing and in January, 1817; the same dividend is entered on 5450 l. - 81 l. 15 s. in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing. In January, 1818, the same amount is entered in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing, and in July, the same sums in his writing also. In January, 1819, the same sum and dividend are entered in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing also, and in July, 1819, and in his writing. In January, 1820, the same sum and dividend are entered in the same hand-writing; and in July, the same sum and hand-writing; in January, 1821, and July, here are the same sums in the same hand-writing. In January and July, 1822, the same sums are entered in the same hand-writing; and in January, 1823, there is the same sum entered, and in Mr. Fauntleroy's hand-writing. In July, 1823, the dividend is entered upon 5550 l. 83 l. 5 s. in Mr. Fauntleroy's hand-writing; and in January, 1824, the same, and in his writing also.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to the day-book of the 1st of June, 1815 - A. There is a sum of 2953 l. 2 s. 6 d. carried to the account of 
               <persName id="t18241028-97-person963">H. F. </persName>
            - (which I presume to be Mr. Fauntleroy) - it is in the hand-writing of Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. Now turn to the partners' private ledger, and look at the dates of June the 1st and 6th, there is an entry of the 6th of June, of one of the partners of 40 l. - A. Yes; it is Mr. Graham's writing - (reading) -</p>
               <p>"Ryan 40 l. June the 6th;" there appears to have been an erasure at the extremity of the page, but the full amount is carried out in the next item - here is an entry of the 1st of June on the same line, but after the 6th of June,</p>
               <p>"Cash 2953 l. 2 s. 6 d." - and in the extended line is 2993 l. 2 s. 6 d. - being the two sums added together, all the entry except</p>
               <p>"June the 6th, Ryan 40 l.," is in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. To whose credit does the whole of that line stand - Ryan's amount, and the whole of the identical sum - A. It stands to the account of

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. GURNEY. This sum is placed to Mr. Fauntleroy's private account - A. Yes; the sums placed to that private account are very large.</p>
               <p>Q. They amount in two pages to 50,000 l. - A. They may.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not these sums finally find their way into the funds of the banking house - A. I do not know; that rests with themselves. I cannot tell that these sums were ever drawn out by Mr. Fauntleroy for his private account, for Messrs. Martin and Co. were our bankers in the City - there were large transactions with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not every shilling of these monies applied to the funds of the banking-house - A. I do not know; the partners themselves can tell - but the clerks never had access to these books - it was customary to enter considerable sums to the initials of the partners.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not many of the sums through Martin's house placed to initials, or called Exchequer-bills account - A. No, we were ordered to make sums received to the initials of the partner's names in the day-book; that is all we know.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. As far as these books go, this sum is carried to the private account of the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a police-officer of Malborough-street. On the 10th of September I apprehended the prisoner at the banking-house in Berner-street - he locked a desk which was in the room where I apprehended him after he knew what I came for; he locked it with a key which was suspended to his watch - I took the key from his watch in Malborough-street; I believe this to be it - (looking at it;) I delivered it to Mr. Freshfield - and in consequence of a message from Mr. Freshfield, I attended him at the banking-house, and searched the desk with Mr. Freshfield; it was opened with this key - there was a private drawer in the desk in which were some keys and some papers - I marked the papers after I brought them away - the prisoner was examined on the day - I kept the keys until after the examination, and then went to the banking-house, and found Mr. Freshfield there - he had two tin boxes in his possession; the name of Fauntleroy was on one of them - I do not know whether it was on the other. I tried them with the keys which I had found in the desk, and opened them with those keys - I locked the boxes again, and delivered the keys to Mr. Freshfield, who took the boxes away in a coach.</p>
               <p>MR. FRESHFIELD re-examined. On the day the prisoner was apprehended I went to the banking-house of Messrs. Marsh and Co., and made a search - I received a key from Plank, which opened a private desk; and in that desk we found some other keys. I returned to the banking-house after the examination, and in a room at the back, of what I understood to be called the partner's room; I saw several tin boxes - one had the name of Fauntleroy on it, which I took possession of - there was another, either upon or under that box, without any name. I desired Plank to try the keys to it, that I might not remove a box belonging to any other person; he tried one key which opened it; and finding from the first paper that there was no doubt it must be Mr. Fauntleroy's, I locked it up and took possession of it with the keys - and in the course of that night I examined the whole of the box with the name on it; and about half of the other - that with the name contained deeds, probates of wills, letters of administration, and other official documents; the other was a great variety of memorandums, diaries, and stock receipts, among which was the sale note for the stock in question; also a paper which I now produce - I marked it.</p>
               <p>MR. TYSON re-examined, (looking at the paper.) The whole of this is in Mr. Fauntleroy's hand-writing. When there is a sale of stock as a regular transaction the sale note is put on a file, and copied into a book by one of the partners.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. - Overwhelmed as I am by the situation in which I am placed, and being uninformed in what manner I should answer the charges which have been alleged against me, I will endeavour to explain, as well as the poignancy of my feelings will enable me, the embarrassments of the Banking house, in which I have been for many years the active and only responsible partner, and which have alone led to the present investigation, and although I am aware I cannot expect to free myself from the obloquy brought upon me by my anxiety to preserve the credit and respectability of the firm, still I trust that an impartial narrative of the occurrences will obtain for me the commiseration of the well-disposed part of the community. Anticipating that the Court will extend its indulgence to me, I will respectfully submit such observations as I think will tend to remove from influenced minds those impressions, which with sorrow I say must have been made upon them by the cruel and illiberal manner in which the public prints have untruly detailed an history of my life and conduct; hoping, therefrom, I may deserve your compassion, although I may be unable to justify my proceedings, and secure my liberation, by a verdict of the Jury, yet they may be considered, in the mercy of the Court and a discerning public, as some extenuation of the crimes with which I stand arraigned. With this object it is necessary that I should first state, shortly, the circumstances under which I have been placed during my connexion with Marsh and Co. My father established the Banking-house in 1792, in conjunction with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280042"></xptr>Mr. Marsh, and other gentlemen. Some of the partners retired in 1794, about which time a loss of 20,000 l. was sustained. Here commenced the difficulties of the house. In 1796, Mr. Stracey and another gentleman came into the firm, with little or no augmentation of capital. In 1800 l became a clerk in the house, and continued so six years, and although during that time I received no salary, the firm were so well satisfied with my attention and zeal for the interest and welfare of the establishment, that I was handsomely rewarded by them. In 1807 my father died; I then succeeded him; at this time I was only twenty-two years of age, and the whole weight of an extensive but needy Banking establishment at once devolved upon me, and I found the concern deeply involved in advances to builders and others which had rendered a system of discounting necessary, and which we were obliged to continue in consequence of the scarcity of money at that time, and the necessity of making further advances to those persons to secure the sums in which they stood indebted. In this perplexed state the house continued until 1810, when its embarrassments were greatly increased, owing to the bankruptcies of Brickwood and others, which brought upon it a sudden demand for no less a sum than 170,000 l. the greater part being for the amount of bills which our house had accepted and discounted for these parties, since become bankrupts. About 1814, 1815, and 1816, from the speculations with builders and brickmakers, &amp; others, in which the house was engaged, it was called upon to provide funds to near 100,000 l., to avert the losses which would otherwise have visited it from these speculations. In 1819, the most responsible of our partners died, and we were called upon to pay over the amount of his capital, although the resources of the house were wholly inadequate to meet so large a payment. During these numerous and trying difficulties the house was nearly without resources, and the whole burthen of management falling upon me, I was driven to a state of distraction, in which I could meet with no relief from my partners, and, almost broken-hearted, I sought resources where I could, and so long as they were provided, and the credit of the house supported, no inquiries were made, either as to the manner in which they were procured, or as to the sources from whence they were derived. In the midst of these calamities, not unknown to Mr. Stracey, he quitted England, and continued in France, on his own private business, for two years, leaving me to struggle as well as I could with difficulties almost insurmountable. Having thus exposed all the necessities of the house, I declare that all the monies temporarily raised by me, were applied, not in one instance for my own separate purposes or expenses, but in every case they were immediately placed to the credit of the house in Berners-street, and applied to the payment of the pressing demands upon it. This fact does not rest on my assertion, as the transactions referred to are entered in the books now in the possession of the assignees, and to which I have had no access since my apprehension. These books, I understand, are now in Court, and will confirm the truth of my statement; and to whatever account all the sums may be entered, whether to that of Stock, of Exchequer Bills, or to my private account, the whole went to the general funds of the Banking-house. I alone have been doomed to suffer the stigma of all the transaction; but, tortured as I have been, it now becomes an imperative duty to explain to you, Gentlemen, and through you to the world at large, that the vile accusations heaped upon me, (known to be utterly false by all those who are best acquainted with my private life and habits,) have been so heaped upon me for the purpose of loading me with the whole of the obloquy of those transactions, from which, and from which alone my partners were preserved from bankruptcy. I have been accused of crimes I never even contemplated, and of acts of profligacy I never committed; and I appear at this Bar with every prejudice against me, and almost prejudged. To suit the purposes of the persons to whom I allude, I have been represented as a man of prodigal extravagance; prodigal indeed I must have been, had I expended those large sums which will hereafter be proved to have gone exclusively to support the credit of a tottering firm, the miseries of which were greatly accelerated by the drafts of two of its members to the amount of near 100,000 l. I maintained but two establishments, one at Brighton, where my mother and my sister resided in the season - the expenses of which to me, exclusive of wine, were within 400 l. per annum. One at Lambeth, where my two children lived, from its very nature, private and inexpensive, to which I resorted for retirement, after many a day passed in devising means to avert the embarrassments of the Banking-house. The dwelling-house in Berners-street belonged solely to my mother, with the exception of a library and a single bed-room. This was the extent of my expenditure, so far as domestic expenditure is concerned. I am next accused of being an habitual gambler, an accusation which, if true, might easily account for the diffusion of the property. I am indeed a member of two clubs, the Albion, and the Stratford, but never in my life did I play in either, at cards or dice, or any game of chance; this is well known to the gentlemen of these clubs - and my private friends with whom I more intimately associated, can equally assert my freedom from all habit or disposition to play. It has been as cruelly asserted that I fraudulently invested money in the funds to answer the payment of annuities, amounting to 2,200 l. settled upon females. I never did make any such investment; neither at home or abroad, in any funds whatever, have I any investment; nor is there one shilling secretly deposited by me in the hands of any human being. Equally ungenerous, and equally untrue it is, to charge me with having lent too loose and disorderly persons large sums which never have, and never will be repaid. I lent no sums, but to a very trifling amount, and those were advanced to valued friends. I can, therefore, at this solemn moment, declare most fervently, that I never had any advantage beyond that in which all my partners participated, in any of the transactions which are now questioned. They indeed have considered themselves as partners only in the profits, and I am to be burthened with the whole of the approbrium, that others may consider them as the victims of my extravagance. I make this statement, not with a view to criminate others, or to exculpate myself; but borne down as I am by calamity, I will not consent to be held out to the world as a cold blooded and abandoned profligate, ruining all around me for the selfish gratification of vice and sensuality, and involving even my confiding partners in the general destruction. Gentlemen, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280043"></xptr>have frailties and errors enough to account for. I have sufferings enough past, present, and in prospect, and if my life were all that was required of me, I might endure in silence, though I will not endure the odium on my memory, of having sinned to pamper delinquencies to which I never was addicted. Thus much has been extorted from me by the fabrications which have been cruelly spread amongst the public; that very public, from whom the arbiters of my fate were to be selected. Perhaps, however, I ought to thank the enemy who besieged the prison with his slanders - that he did so whilst my life was spared to refute them, and that he waited not until the grave to which he would hurry me had closed at once on my answer and my forgiveness. There is one subject more connected with these charges to which I am compelled to advert, and I do so with great reluctance. It is added to the other charges made against me, lest the world should think there was any vice in which I was not an adept. I have been accused of acting treacherously towards the female who now bears my name, having refused to make reparation until threatened by her brother, and of having deserted her at a moment when she had the greatest claim on my protection. Delicacy forbids me entering into an explanation on this subject further than to declare, that the conduct I adopted on that occasion was uninfluenced by the interference of any individual, and arose, as I then considered, and do still consider, from a laudable and honourable feeling on my part; and the lady's brother, so far from coming forward at the time alluded to, was on his passage to the West Indies. Could all the circumstances be exposed, I feel convinced that every liberal-minded man would applaud my determination, and I feel satisfaction in stating, that the lady in question has always been, and still is actuated by the best of feelings towards me. I have now only to apologize to the Court for having entered so much at length into the statement of my unfortunate case, and in conclusion I have to express my perfect confidence, that it will receive every favourable consideration at your hands; and I fully rely that you, Gentlemen of the Jury, will give an impartial and merciful decision.</p>

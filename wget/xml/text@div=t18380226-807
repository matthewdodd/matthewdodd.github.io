                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Edward Fellowes, and have been so fourteen years. It is my duty to attend at his place of busi<lb></lb>ness in Broad-street every day—I go at nine o'clock in the morning, and we close about six o'clock in the evening—the warehouse is in that story of the house where the kitchen usually is—the counting-house is on the ground floor, and the warehouse is underneath that—it was formerly a kitchen—you go down stairs to it—there is a door leading to it which opens immediately behind the street or passage door of the house—it is a strong door, secured by a strong lock—on going through that door, and going down stairs, you come to another door, secured by two strong locks,</p>

               <p>and lined with iron—it is the duty of the porter, at night, to fasten up that warehouse, and he gives the keys to me—I usually go down myself, and put the gas out, and see the warehouse secure—he fastens the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say whether on the 15th, the day of the robbery, you were in the warehouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw every thing perfectly safe about half-past five o'clock—we had some Italian tram silk, some called "or<lb></lb>ganzine," and some called "cad man"—I received the keys from the porter in the ordinary manner, at the close of the day, and put two of them into my desk, in the counting-house, and that of the top lock, belonging to the bottom door, I put into my pocket—the porter does not live in the house, nor do I—I went home, and, about eight o'clock the same evening I heard of the robbery, and went to the warehouse—when I arrived I first saw the housekeeper, who is a man—he is not one of Mr. Fellowes's servants—the house is not entirely occupied by Mr. Fellowes—the upper part is let off—the street door is the common entrance to Mr. Fellowes and the other parties—the street door is closed when we leave the premises—on seeing the housekeeper I went down to the warehouse—I found the top door open—I proceeded down to the bottom door—I found the top door had been opened by a skeleton key, and in the top lock of the bottom door I found a skeleton key—no violence had been used to the bottom door—in my judgment, both doors had been opened by skeleton keys—I examined the warehouse, and missed about 540lbs. weight of silk, worth from 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a quantity of each of the three sorts taken, about 3 cwt. of Italian tram, 140lbs. of organzine, and better than 1 cwt. of cadman—I am accustomed to silk—it was bound up in the usual manner, when in our warehouse, as it comes from the throwsters in England—we made the warehouse secure, and left for the night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk-manufacturer, and live at No. 6, Fort-street, Spitalfields. I have known the prisoner for six or seven years—I have known him as a kind of agent, to sell silk about at different parts, and for different people—he did not keep a warehouse, that I know of—I do not think he did—I do not know where he lived—I only knew him by going about the trade—on the 27th of January he came to me about twelve o'clock in the day—mine is a public warehouse—he showed me two samples of silk, and asked me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the tram, and 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the organzine—I asked him what weight there was—he said he could not get the tram then, but could get the organzine in the afternoon—he asked me to buy the organ<lb></lb>zine, and he thought there would be about 32lbs.—I said, "Bailey, is this all right?"—he said, "O yes, I shall not bring any thing but what is right"—he said it belonged to a man who was going to Macclesfield that evening, and wanted the money to go with—he said then that he could</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he presented the samples, did he say what quantity there was of each? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said there were thirty-two lbs. of the organzine and about fifty-two of the tram, but he could not have the tram before Monday—he said he could bring the organzine in the afternoon—I said I should not be in before half-past three o'clock, and he said he would be there at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you heard at that time of Mr. Fellowes's robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had a bill lying on ray desk about it—I said to him, "Bailey, this aynt Fellowes's silk, is it?"—he said, "No, by no means"—he was going out when he mentioned about the 32lbs., and he said, would it matter if there was double the quantity—I said no, I could find the money if it was all right—he then said, "I can cat the cord, and let it into your drawer"—I did not exactly know what that meant, but it gave me some suspicion, particularly as I thought the silk corresponded with that described in the bill on my desk—I had only seen the samples—nothing more passed between us, to my recollection—he said he would meet me at half-past three o'clock, with the silk—I left, and returned at half-past three o'clock, and learnt that he had been there, and left a bag of silk—I did not see the bag before he came in—my daughter, Eliza Farrington, and her husband, keep the house—the prisoner came to his time, at half-past three o'clock—in the meantime I had been to my neighbour Fowler, and showed him the samples, and then went to Mr. Fellowes, and made an arrangement about the officers coming to my house—when the prisoner came in at half-past three o'clock, I said, "Well Mr. Bailey"—he said, "I left the bag in the kitchen"—I said, "Well, fetch it out?"—he did so, and brought it, and put it on the counter, and then two officers came in, took it off the counter, and took the prisoner and the bag—I did not know where the prisoner lived—I heard him give an account of where he lived, but do not recollect the address he gave—I afterwards saw a small quantity of silk produced in a kind of pickle jar—it was Italian organzine—it is like the sample I have, and I think it is the same silk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know they were his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From Fowler or Gilbert, I think, not from himself—I believe Gilbert and Fowler went there with me—it is a very small house, one story high, and has only four rooms—I saw a woman there—we said we wanted to see Mr. Bailey, and asked her if she had any silk in the house—we told her we had come to search the place—she give us leave at once—Herdsfield and I searched together, and found some silk—while we were making the search, a knock came at the door—it was opened, and a man came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk dealer, in Aldermanbury. I recollect telling some silk to Mr. Fellowes—I sold about 1401bs. of organzine on the 12th of December, and another 140lbs. on the 10th of January, both from the same bale—I afterwards saw the silk in the black bag—it was the silk I had sold to Mr. Fellowes—I have no doubt of it whatever—I have some reasons for being positive—it was thrown at a mill I have at Derby—we have not thrown a bale of Italian for about three years like it, and have not since—it is thrown in a peculiar manner.</p>

The silk in the warehouse in Broad-street on the 15th of January all belonged to me—I have examined carefully the differ<lb></lb>ent parcels produced from Gilbert's, and found at the prisoner's house—I have compared them with my own silk, and can say most decidedly that it is my silk, and what I lost from my house—I knew nothing of Ridgway previous to this discovery—I have seen the silk found at Ridgway's—it is perfectly different altogether to this—it is tram—it is silk which I claim.</p>

The prisoner's father and mother lodged in my house about two years, and he lodged with them. On the 27th or 28th of January, I missed the plate, spoons and different articles.

            . Q. You are a marshalman. Yes. On the 28th, Mr. Jasper came to the Mansion House. Mr. Nalder being poorly, I went to Mr. Jasper's. He took me into his bed-room; he shewed me the cupboard from where he had lost the plate; he told me five spoons and three silver punch-ladles. He gave me this. I went to Mr. Baxter's, Snow-hill, and there I found five spoons and three punch-ladles, pledged.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Baxter, Snow-hill. I produce the things that the prisoner pledged. The prisoner pawned those five spoons on the 23d of January. I asked him who he brought them from. He said, a Mr. Jones, a housekeeper in Fleet-lane; he was not his father; he lived in the same house with him, and Mr. Jones gave him these things to pledge. On the 27th, he pawned a punch-ladle for eight shillings.</p>

On 30th April I was there—the prisoner Brown came in for a glass of porter—she put down a bad sixpence—I told her it was bad, and she said that I must take the porter back, as she had no more money—she said that she got it in change in Westminster-road—I broke it in two pieces, returned it to her, and she left—I followed her; she went into Westminster-road, under the railway arch—she stood there a short time, and Edwards joined her—they stood close to each other for some time—Edwards then left her—he returned in about ten minutes, and joined her again, and, after having stood some time, they both proceeded down West-minster-road, till they got within a short space of the Rodney—Brown went in there—I went into the other box, and heard Brown call for a glass of porter—I cautioned the person about her—I had before seen a constable, and told him.</p>

On 30th April Brown came in, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—she asked for a glass of porter, and gave me in payment a sixpence—the last witness came in, and made a motion to my young master, and I broke the sixpence with my teeth, and told Brown it was bad—she said she did not know it—I jumped over the counter, and detained her till a constable came, and gave the sixpence to him—he brought Edwards into the bar, and took both the prisoners to the station.</p>

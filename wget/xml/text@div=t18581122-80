                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Henry Collins, a pawnbroker, of High-street, Wandsworth. On 11th October last, the prisoner came to me and pledged a pair of trousers, which I asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—I gave her this du<lb></lb>plicate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she went away—I saw her again on Saturday, 30th October, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, as near as I can say—I am sure it was after 9 o'clock—she applied for an affidavit for those trousers—she said, "Mr. Webb, I want an affidavit for those trousers I pledged with you for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked her if she had lost the ticket—she said she had mislaid it—I filled up a form, and she put her mark to it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the form—she went away with it—I saw her again about three hours afterwards, after she had the declaration signed—she said, "I know who has the ticket now"—I said, "You have done wrong by taking the declaration, knowing who has this ticket"—I told her she was liable to be punished by law for so doing—she said nothing to me—she then went away, and I knew no more of her till she was given into custody—she put her mark to the declaration in my presence—I did not, on the Saturday morning, ask her in particular how she had lost it; only in the usual way, asked her if she had lost it, or if it was destroyed—that was in order to enable me to fill up the form.</p>

I am a marine store-dealer, at Wandsworth—I know the prisoner quite well—some time in October, she came to my shop—it was between a fortnight and three weeks before 3d November, I cannot say positively—she offered me two pairs of women's drawers, one shirt, and this duplicate for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>that I had lost by a great number of things that I had purchased of her, and that I would rather be without them—she pressed me to buy it, being in great want of money—at last I did buy it—I gave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for all the articles—I saw her frequently at my house after that—I saw her again with reference to this on the Saturday before the examination, between 8 and 9 in the morning—she came to my house, inquiring if I had taken those trousers out, with reference to this ticket for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told her that I had not—she asked me if I would sell it back again, and I said, "Yes, I will; for I have lost by all I had from you"—I said I would take 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—she said she would not have it then, but she would call in the evening to see the ticket—I showed her the duplicate at the time.</p>

We went into a room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130079"></xptr> we sat down together, she in one chair and I in another. As I sat in the chair I fell asleep. Nothing passed between us. When the waiter came in and waked me, and asked me if I had lost any thing, I had been there about half an hour; the prisoner was gone. I immediately found I had lost my watch and money. I have not got either watch or money again. The prisoner was taken up about three weeks after. I had looked at my watch just before I went in, so I am sure I had it. I had been drinking a little, but was not disguised so much as not to know what I did.</p>
               <p>Had you any talk with the prisoner about a present? - No, nothing at all.</p>

               <p>I was waiter at that time at the French Horn in Holbourn. I remember the prisoner coming in with Mr. Farris, it was very late in the evening, near the morning. They went into a room and ordered a negus. I saw seven or eight shillings; he gave me two shillings, and put the rest into his pocket and buttoned it up. I did not observe whether he had any watch; in about ten minutes after the prisoner went out; I went in to him and he was asleep. I then waked him and asked him if he had lost any thing, because his breeches were wide open, as well as his pockets; he searched his pockets, and said he had lost his watch and money. I took the prisoner up about six weeks after. I am sure she is the woman, I knew her before.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor was in liquor, and he took me into the French Horn. I was at the house every night, but they did not take me up for three weeks.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did you give her any money? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was you with any other woman that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you treat any other? - No.</p>

            , he keeps a tripe shop. On the 25th of May, about three or four in the afternoon, I was in Brownlow-street, Drury-lane, which is nearly as wide as this court - I saw a woman sitting at the corner of Brownlow-street and Drury-lane; she was sitting on a small stool, selling curds and whey; there is a post at the corner of the street; she was sitting more in <placeName id="t18330704-129-crimeloc663">Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Where you looking at the old lady? A. Yes, I could not be off of seeing them both - the post is not within the pavement; she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040098"></xptr>sitting on the pavement, but the curds and whey were off the pavement - the first thing the wheel came in contact with was the curds and whey - if she had stood up and stood still, I think she would have come to no harm; the paving is rather round there and sloped off towards the post - she leaned forward, which was no doubt the cause of the accident.</p>

I was coming from Covent-garden driving a horse and chaise - I was in Brownlow-street at ten minutes before three; I heard the scream of a female; I looked and saw the black bonnet of a woman - the cart was going on, but I turned my mare round and stopped it; the prisoner was given to the policeman.</p>

            . I am a surgeon - this woman was given into my charge on the 25th of May, about half-past three o'clock - I examined her side and found a fracture of two or three ribs; she was taken to the Middlesex-hospital, and died on the 8th of June, about eight in the morning - the remote cause of her death was the fracture of the ribs, but she had diseased bones, and the slightest thing would cause a fracture - the immediate cause of her death was a chronic cough, and the secretion of mucus in the lungs, but the fracture of the ribs increased the cough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not this have caused her death, independent of the fracture? A. Yes, certainly; but that no doubt, increased the cough.</p>
               <p>COURT to LUMLEY. Q. Had you any difficulty in stopping the cart? A. No; the prisoner was full of contrition, he never said a word.</p>

            . I saw the cart come out of Brownlow-street; I passed the prisoner's horse in my cab, and he made a halt just opposite this stall - the good woman trying to save her stall, put herself right in the way - if she had sat still, or stood up, it certainly would not have happened - the prisoner did not attempt to run away or escape.</p>

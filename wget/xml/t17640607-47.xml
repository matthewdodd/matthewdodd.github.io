            . I am a watchman. I was at the corner of Warwick-lane when the woman called out, Stop thief; and upon hearing it repeated, and saying he has robbed me of my bundle, I stepped from my stand, and saw the prisoner with a bundle, under his left arm: I came up to him and had a scuffle with him; the handkerchief had two corners untied, and the things flew out of it. He got away, and the bundle was thrown away, but I did not see him throw it away. I pursued, and called Stop thief, being not above a yard and a half behind him; and by Stationer's-hall, he was taken by a brother watchman; and being asked how he came by the bundle, he said, he had no bundle at all.</p>

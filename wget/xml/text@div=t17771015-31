               <p>On the 22d of September the prosecutor told me he had been robbed of his watch in the street by a man, whom he described to me; I went to the Golden Anchor, and saw the prisoner at breakfast there; I said to him, I have something to say to you; do you know any thing of a robbery last night? he said, yes, and if I would let him go for half an hour, he would bring the man that stole the watch; I told him I would not; I took him to the round-house, and the last witness searched him and found the watch upon him.</p>

               <p>I found the watch lying on the ground; the prosecutor was standing with a woman under a gateway; I asked him if he had lost any thing; he said, no; so I thought it was not his; I took it up and put it into my pocket; I went about, half drunk as I was, and said to one and another, that I had found a watch, and the neighbours buzzed it about that Waylan had found a watch; the thief-taker got hold of the word, and put it in the man's head to make a property of me; when they took me I knew they would take the watch from me, right or wrong, so I took it out of my fob, and put it under my arm.</p>

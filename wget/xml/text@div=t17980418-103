             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live at Bath: On the 19th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, I took a coach<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180099"></xptr>from Webber-row, St. George's-fields, to <placeName id="t17980418-103-crimeloc559">the Saracen's-head, Snow-hill</placeName>

The prisoner at the bar; I desired him to drive into the yard; he said, it was not allowed; I said, go in, and ask why it is not allowed; he went, and came back, and said, it was not allowed; I desired him to tell the book-keeper to send out a porter or two to take the trunks in; he went into the yard, and brought out two men with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the yard immediately join the street, or is there a passage? - A. There is a sort of lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see whether he went to the bookkeeper's office or not? - A. I could not; he was back in about a minute, with two men; I asked him if these two men were sent out by the bookkeeper or not; he answered they were; are they the porters of the yard, I asked; he said, yes; I handed the trunks out to the coachman to give to these men; after the trunks were delivered to the men; I was taking the number of the coach, 496, and also taking care of the children.</p>
               <p>Q. After they had taken the trunks, did you observe which way they went? - A. I did not; after I had paid the coachman, and taken the number of the coach, I went up the yard; I should tell your Lordship, that when I was going away, I observed a porter's knot in the coach, I did not observe it while I was in the coach; I went up to the coach-office and enquired for my trunks, they were not there; I then went after the coachman, and found him upon the stand at the Old-Bailey; I asked him who those two men where that he brought out-did you see the book-keeper; he said, yes, I went into the coach-office; did you go into the book-keeper's office; he answered, I went into the office and saw the book-keeper, who told him he might bring them himself and be d-d; that he then met the two men to whom he delivered the trunks; I said, how could you tell me that the book-keeper sent out the two porters of the yard; says he, I know nothing about it, you may do as you can; I told him, you must come back to the book-keeper's office, and let the book-keeper see you; the porter and myself went back, and the prisoner followed; but when he came back, he acknowledged that he had not been into the book-keeper's office; he was at that time confronted by the book-keeper; the bookkeeper declared he had not seen him; then he went away; as I knew the number of the coach, I thought he would be easily found; on the Monday morning the prisoner and I were both at the Hatton-Garden office together.</p>
               <p>Q.Was what he said taken in writing? - A. I cannot say, I think not; the prisoner said, there were no boxes put into the coach; and then he said, he saw them put in, but he never saw them taken out; I delivered them out of the coach into his hands, and I have never found them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You gave them into his hands as he gave them into the hands of the two persons that came with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no difficulty in finding him, you went to the nearest stand, not an hundred yards from the Old-Bailey? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the Saracen's-head pretty well, yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that there are two bookkeepers? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there are waggons go from the Saracen's-head as well as coaches? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Haviland coming there in January last? - A. I do, I went with him to find the hackney coachman; we found him in the ranks; that is him at the bar. Mr. Haviland asked him who he had delivered the trunks to, and he said, he had been to the coach-office, and got a porter to fetch them. Mr. Haviland told him there was no luggage brought into the house nor to the coach-office; he said, he had been to the coach-office, and the book-keeper had desired him to bring them up himself, and be d-d; he spoke to Mr. Haviland in a very insolent manner, and he might do what he could. Mr. Haviland took his number.</p>

               <p>Q. He might have drove down to Bridge-street in that time, or Holborn-hill? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge; the porter came down the yard, it was late at night and very dark, I did not go into the warehouse, but as soon as I got into the yard, I called out, porters, and two men came; I did not know but they were porters belonging to the yard. The gentleman and the four children, and the porters, all went up the yard together.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Haviland.) Q. Did you see what became of those two men after you had given them the trunks? - A. I did not, the trunks went some time before me, I stopped to pay the coachman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Shakespeare; I live at No. 3, Crown-court, Old Broad-street. I know No. 5, it is opposite me—I know Louisa Norton by sight, she lived at No. 5, and was housekeeper there—on the evening of Saturday, 26th Jan., I saw her in the passage, between 7 and 8 o'clock, and her two sons, Thomas and William, were stand<lb></lb>ing on the window sill at No. 5; they had got their hands up feeling the glass—the window pushes down—Louisa Norton stood behind them with a broom in her hand—I went in, and had occasion to come out again—I heard a whispering and talking—I was alone in the house, and I thought I would look out again, and then William and Thomas Norton, and Kelly, were trying to get the window down again—I went in and again came out hear<lb></lb>ing a noise, and Kelly was there assisting William Norton in at the window</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185603030038"></xptr>
               <p>—they saw me, and drew him back again—Louisa Norton was standing on the ground—she said, "That will do"—I was cleaning the lower part of the house—I looked again, and saw Kelly put William Norton quite in at the window, and Louisa Norton stood by the side—and she and Kelly went into the house, and shut the door—that was the last I saw of them that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk merchant, at No. 5, Crown-court, Old Broad-street, in the parish of St. Peter-le-Poor—I have two partners—Louisa Norton was cleaning our offices for about six months, she lived up stairs in the top of the house—on Saturday, 26th Jan., I left my office, between 5 and 6 o'clock—there is a passage to the house, leading into the court—the entrance door to my counting house is in the passage, and the window is in the court—by that window I can see into the street—when I left on that Saturday night, I had secured the door leading to the passage—when I left all was safe—I returned about 9 o'clock on Monday morning—it was customary when I went into my counting house to fasten the lock back with a nail—there was a pin, and a chain, which I was using to keep the lock back, but the pin was gone before the 26th, as far as my recollection goes—in consequence of having lost the pin, I used a nail, and on that Monday morning I looked for the nail, and did not find it in its place—I then looked over my stock and boxes and discovered that I had lost a good deal of silk—my attention was drawn to one particular box, by the side of which I was keeping the nail—from that one box I missed about 1 lb. of silk; but we have about eighty boxes—this silk produced is of the same description as that we missed on the 28th—we did not occupy the cellar—we had the key of it about six months, because it was then a ware-house for us, but we had nothing to do with it on the night of the 26th Jan.—this silk is our property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who lives in the cellar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I do not live in the house—it is not mine—I only have the counting house—it is a large room—I think the house has about two rooms on a floor—Louisa Norton had been employed about two years by my firm, but I declined her services—she lived at the top of the house—I saw that box safe on Satur<lb></lb>day night from which I missed the silk—I was in the habit of looking inte my boxes, because I saw the silk was going away—that box contained about five or six pounds of silk—I think the house is inhabited in the day time by the landlord—I do not know whether he is in any business—I saw a good many persons coming in, and sometimes working men, but I never inquired about his business.</p>

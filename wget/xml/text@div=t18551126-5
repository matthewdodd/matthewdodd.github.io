               <p>passing along by Buckingham cottages, and passed the prisoner Thomas—" directly I had passed him, two arms came across my neck, and M'Carthy came in front of me, took my watch from my pocket, and undid the chain from my button hole—the person's hands were strangling me, and I could make no resistance or noise—after my watch was taken they let me drop, and I saw four persons running, but could not call out for a few seconds—the prisoners are two of the men who ran, and who took my watch—Thomas is the man who nearly strangled me, he was walking at the corner of the pavement as I passed, and there was another one near him with a light coloured coat on—Thomas was the only man with a dark coat, except M'Carthy; I merely got a glance of him at that time—I did not see him till he turned to run—he was the nearest to me when they let me fall—I saw him immediately before and immediately after—on the following night I was taken to see four men in custody, and identified these two; the others I only saw running—I value my watch at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

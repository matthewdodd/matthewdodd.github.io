On the 28th of April, about half-past ten o'clock, I was going from Covent-garden to my home, and as I went along Little Pulteney-street, I met the prisoner with a bag of books - I suspected they did not belong to him; I felt the bottom of the bag, and found they were books - I asked him where he was going with them at that time of night; he said he was going to the Bull or the Bell, in Holborn - the waggon went off early in the morning, and that he had brought them from Regent-street; I went on to the corner of Dean-street, and there I saw a watchman - I said, "This young man says he has stationery in this bag, I want to convince myself that it is so;" he put down the bag, and I found ten of my books in it, which I had seen in my warehouse a day or two before; I went to my warehouse, and missed them- they are Journals of the Houses of Lords and Commons; the warehouse was locked up, and had been opened with some key - I have had lads to sleep there.</p>
               <p>ROBERT QUADLING. I am a watchman, and took the prisoner; these are the books.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BARNS. He said so at the time, and that the person had given him some bread and cheese.</p>

The prisoner came on the 4th of August to my shop, and asked for four penny sheets of writing-paper, he tendered a half-crown—I observed that it appeared very bad—I did not say any thing, but I went into the parlour, under pretence of fetching change, and sent for a policeman—I told the prisoner I thought it was a very bad one—he said he was sure it was not—I asked him where he came from—he said his mistress sent him—I asked who his mistress was, and where she lived—he told me in Whiskin-street—I told him I should not give up the half-crown, as it was bad, but to send his mistress to me, and if she was a respectable person I might give it up—he then said it was his own, and I had no right to keep it—I then went to the door, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

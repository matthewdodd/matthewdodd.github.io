These depositions (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) have my signature, and this is George Wilkin<lb></lb>son's signature—he was examined by me in the presence of the prisoner, George Willis, but not in Oliver's presence—what was taken down were the correct answers which George Wilkinson gave—it is all in my hand<lb></lb>writing—I gave Willis the opportunity of cross-examining Wilkinson—he put no questions to him, but denied every thing—Charles Willis and another person were present, not Oliver—George Willis was charged then as a principal in the robbery—Mr. Wilkinson is since dead (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The information of George Wilkinson taken upon oath, on the 19th February, 1836, before me, William Robinson, Esquire, in the presence and hearing of Charles Willis and George Willis, charged on suspicion of assault and highway robbery. The said George Wilkinson on his oath, says, I reside with my mother, at Tottenham-court Green, in the said County, widow—on Friday, the 22nd of February, I went to town, and returned about four o'clock in the afternoon, and brought with me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereign and half-sovereigns, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I gave the two notes to my mother and kept the gold myself, which I put into my left-hand trowsers pocket—my watch pocket—about eight o'clock that evening I went to the Swan Inn, opposite Tottenham High-cross, kept by one Jonathan Gurr—I sat in the bar, and had some gin and water—I left the Swan at about eleven o'clock at night to go home—my mother's house is on the West side of Tottenham Green, a short distance from the Swan—when I was within about twenty yards of the front court gate, I was suddenly seized from behind and pulled down on my back—some one put his hand over my mouth, and another pulled open my great-coat, my under coat and waistcoat—I felt a hand in my left-hand trowsers pocket, where the gold was—the party then left me on the ground and ran away—I got up and went in-doors—I discovered the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was gone, as well as my gold watch, chain, and seals—the persons who robbed me never spoke—it was momentarily done—the night was dark—I did not see the faces of the party, nor do I know how many there were; but I think I can safely say there were two at least—shortly after I went in doors, I, together with William Collier, my mother's footman, went to the spot where I had been pulled down, and picked up some keys and a</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of the Victoria Dock Company—I was on duty in plain clothes at West Ham, on 14th September, and saw the prisoner going towards the iron bridge—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, something a man had given him—I found he had got 74lbs. of lead wrapped up in a handkerchief—I took him into the Dock, and then he said he saw this lead in a hole, and he took a portion of it—we have missed 230 feet of lead from the roof of the building—I have com<lb></lb>pared this lead found on the prisoner with the place where it was taken off; it is part and portion of it; the nail-holes correspond exactly—the prisoner was in the employ of the Dock Company occasionally, as a labourer.</p>

I am in the employ of the company, as a carpenter—I am not aware that the prisoner was in their employ; he was not in my department—I compared this lead with the roof—under the roof was a gutter, and three planks had been taken up, and the lead taken since the last rain, which had been about a week before 14th September.</p>

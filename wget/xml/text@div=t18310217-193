            . I knew of the snap having been put on the door, and about half-past eight o'clock in the evening on the 11th of January, I heard the prisoner go across the warehouse, and down to the wine-cellar - I heard the snap go off, and I went down and took him; he denied then that he had taken any wine, but the next morning he said he had taken it, and drank it - Mr. Spencer has lost not less than six dozen of wine, besides brandy.</p>

His son is cohabiting with a lady in Burton-crescent, and he had been in the habit of sending wine there - I have been afraid to say any thing, because he acted as a sort of deputy master over me; they let me go home that night, and then took me the next morning - they got two men there to frighten me, and asked if I knew of any body else being guilty.</p>

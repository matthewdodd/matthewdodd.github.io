                  </hi>. I am a straw hat manufacturer—on 5th July, about twenty-five minutes to 11 at night, I was in Cannon-street—the prisoner brushed very hard against my left side, where I carry my watch, and my watch fell down, but not to the pavement, as it was attached to a gold guard which was round my neck—the prisoner ran away and I missed my watch; the guard was not broken, but the ring of the watch was gone—I have not seen it since—I followed the prisoner as closely as possible till we got to the King William Statue—I was only five or six yards from him at starting—he was stopped in Cannon-street, and I found him there with Apthorpe and Challoner—I did lose sight of him, but not above a minute—a gentleman gave me the watch, and I identified it as mine—he had picked it up on the ground—I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

I live at 2, Brick-hill-lane, Thomas-street—on the night of 5th July, at a quarter to 11 o'clock, I was in Cannon-street by the King William Statue, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running as fast as he could, and no one running before him—a young man tried to stop him, but he bobbed under his arm—I caught him, and the man under whose arm he dodged, came up—a gentleman came up and asked the prosecutor whether that was his watch—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if the prisoner was the man—he said, "Yes, I can swear to him by his whiskers—the gentleman gave him his watch, and went to the station in Bow-lane.</p>

The child left me the day the prince of Wales was married, which was the 8th of May, I never set my eyes on the child no more till the Wednesday before Easter, and when she went she had not a stitch on her but a flannel coat, and she sent for me at ten o'clock at night, and she was dressed in that manner that it astonissed me to see her.</p>

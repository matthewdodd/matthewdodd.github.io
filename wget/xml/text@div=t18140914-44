               <p>Q. Was there light enough that night to enable you to distinguish his face - A. Yes; there was a butcher's shop open with a light, and another public-house window was open; the light from them windows assisted me in seeing the man.

            . I am a victualler. In December, 1810, I kept the Newcastle Arms, Nightingale-lane. The prisoner used my house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the night that poor Davis met with his murder, had you seen Da Silva in your house alone, or in company - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Cardosa - A. On this night, Cardosa and two others ran out together; a girl came, and called Cardosa. I am confident that Cardosa and Da Silva went out with the two other men; I did not follow them. Cardosa was the first that returned; Da Silva returned in about half an hour; when Da Silva came in, he had a knife in his hand, a table-knife round pointed; he said, it was his landlady's knife. Staples, a young man, came in, and said to Da Silva, you have stabbed the man; Da Silva made no answer. I asked him if he could swear to stabbing the man; he hesitated, and said, he could not. I said it was of no use detaining Da Silva. I had heard there had a man been stabbed; I had not been out to see. Da Silva went out immediately,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140028"></xptr>leaving the knife with me. It was a common case knife; there was nothing remarkable on it. When I saw Cardosa next was at the Police office. Da Salva I have not seen until these three or four days.</p>
               <p>EMANUEL MERCURY. I am a Police officer. I apprehended Cardosa that night, at No. 2, Cable-street, Back-lane, at his lodging, between eight and nine o'clock, almost immediately after the transaction. After he was handcuffed, he produced a clasp knife, he said, he had been eating his victuals with it; the knife was rather rusty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that endeavour our to apprehended Da Silva - A. I did, that night, and other times; I could not find him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I lived with Mr. King in December, 1810. The deceased, Davis, was brought to me; he just breathed; there was some appearance of life. I afterwards examined the body to ascertain the cause of his death; I found a small wound upon the back, a good deal of blood upon the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the back - 
               <persName id="t18140914-44-person448">A. </persName>
            Between the shoulder-blade and back-bone; no other wound that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a deep wound - A. It appeared so; I opened the body, and found the wound had penetrated the lobe of the lungs three of four inches; the cavity of the chest was filled full of blood that issued from the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover enough to make you say what was the cause of his death - A. I attribute that he died from that wound. That wound night have been made with some sharp instrument; a common clasp knife would have made such a wound as that.</p>
               <p>(The conviction of Antonio Cardosa read in court.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the public-house when some women cried for assistance, saying, they had been illused; at the instant I came out of the house, I received a blow in my face. I did not return another. I received a second blow, and fell to the ground. I then got up, and run away to my lodgings, and remained there until I thought the disturbance was over; I took a bit of bread and meat in my hand, with a knife and went to get a put of beer. I heard a man had been murdered by a Portuguese; I had a knife in my hand which I brought from my lodging; I was fearful of taking this knife to the door, for fear I should be accused. I never concealed myself, or absconded from my lodging until I was shipped on board a ship bound to Guinea. I never had any thought that any one could blame me that I should be accused of such a tyrannical deed. I have been twice in this country since; I had my lodgings near Nightingale-lane On the day I was accused by the brother of the deceased, it is a false accusation; it originated by a lady of the Francis, my landlady; on the day I received my money on board the ship going to Guinea, I would not give her any money; she said, she would have me taken out of the ship, and said, I was the man that committed the murder. This worthy gentlemen, is all I have to say in respect to this cause. I call God to witness that I am innocent, nor had I any knife in my hand when I went out of the public-house, nor ever had I the thoughts of it. I swear solemny, like a Christian, that I did not know of the murder of Davis at the time this misfortune happened, until I came to the public-house again. I certify to the gentlemen, that I ab hor the using a knife, nor have I been accused of a smaller crime. A long time have I been in the English service, always behaved properly, have been esteemed by the officers and ship mates in every ship I have been in, and welcomed by all my friends. I have no more to say. It is a very improper thing, after being so many weeks in this country, that I should be accused of this offence.</p>

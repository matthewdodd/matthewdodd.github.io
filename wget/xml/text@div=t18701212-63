                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 210). On the evening of 1st December, I saw the prisoner on Tower Hill, kneeling on the chest of a man named Bullinger, who was on his back—I went up, and he rose and crossed the road to a cab, which she stopped, and was going to put Bullinger into it—she said "I will put him in"—I went to the cab, and she went away about ten yards—I followed her, brought her back, and asked what she bad in her hand—she said "Nothing"—I caught hold of her hand, forced it open, and found this watch in it—I asked her how she came by it—she said "It belongs to that man," and that she was taking care of it for him—I told her I should charge her with stealing it—she said nothing to that—I knew her by sight—Bullinger came to the cab, and I asked him if the watch was his, but he was too drunk to identify it—he seemed to recognize it next morning at the Thames Police Court.</p>

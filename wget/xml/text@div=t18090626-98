On the 3rd of June I heard the cry of stop thief; the prisoner would have run by me if I had not stopped him; Jones came up after the prisoner was down, and said the prisoner had stole that bacon from Mr. Beal; Jones said the prisoner threw the bacon down, and he picked it up.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

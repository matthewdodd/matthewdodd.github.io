My wife opened the door, they seeing the light of the candle, to the best of my knowledge it was the prisoner, catched the isinglass out of my hand, and they all made off directly. I called out, stop thief, and pursued directly. Several gentlemen ran out of the Ship tavern, they pursued, and the prisoner was soon taken. It was a moon-light night, I am certain to the prisoner.

            . I am a waiter at the Ship tavern Ratcliff-cross. Between the hours of 12 and 1 at night I heard the cry stop thief, I knew Mr. Harding's voice, I went out, he said he had been robbed of four pounds of isinglass, and told which way they were gone; I pursued and got up to the prisoner, and took him by the collar, I said, you are the thief, come along with me. Mr. Martin came to my assistance. He swore in a very bad manner when we got him into the tavern, and said, gentlemen I know you all, and if ever I live to get over this I'll do for you all.</p>

            . I was at the ship tavern with several gentlemen. I ran out upon hearing the cry stop thief, and when the waiter and I had taken the prisoner, I found this parcel of isinglass about ten yards from the place the prisoner stood. We brought him to the Ship tavern, there he looked at several gentlemen, and said, I have failed along with you, and you, and looking at me, said, I know all your haunts, and if I get clear of this I'll do for you.</p>

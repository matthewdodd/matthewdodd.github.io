                  </hi>. I am pot-man to Mr. Edward Wilkinson, at the King's Head public-house, Cumberland-street, Middlesex Hospital. On the 4th of April, about a quarter-past ten o'clock in the morning, I had been cleaning the pots, and left them on the pot-horse—in consequence of what I was told, I went into the skittle-ground, where the pot-horse was—I heard some pots rattle, and went to the door of the water-closet—I saw the prisoner standing inside, with one pot in his hand, two on the seat, and one pot was on a form in the skittle-ground, about two feet from where the prisoner was—I asked what he was going to do with the pots—he said he did not know—he handed me the one from his hand, and said there were two more on the seat—I said I saw there were—he said he knew no<lb></lb>thing of them—I said I was sure he must, and collared him—he then went on his knees, begged pardon, and said if he came before a Jury they would take my word before his.</p>

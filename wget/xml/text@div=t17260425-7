Between 10 and 11 in the Morning, I went out of my Shop into my Kitchen, to get a little Drink.

I was very much surpriz'd to think how it could be carried off undiscover'd at that time of Day, and in such an open publick Place. I made Enquirys, but could get no Intelligence, till the next Night about 12 o'Clock, and then a Man came to me from the Mint, and told me that the Thief was taken, and several of the Goods found upon him. I went thither, and saw the Prisoner, and he confest to me that he had had the Goods, but said that he found them in Moorfields.</p>

No, not I, what would you have with her. Why, says he, I gave her a great Parcel of Rings to pawn for me, and she is run away with them. - You must know that this Hannah was one of his Flows. - And besides I heard that he had been all Day at

             thus depos'd. The Prisoner was our Lodger, and pretended to be our Kinsman, for being lately come, over from Ireland, he told us that he had married my Husband's Brother's Daughter, and that he was a Hatter by Trade. - About Noon on the Day of the Robbery, he came in, and gave my Child, a Necklace, and told me that he was going again for Ireland. - From our House he went to Mother Dammeree's, who kept a Bawdy House at the Next Door, and there I suppose he spent the rest of the Day and Night, for next Day in the Evening Mr. Smith came, and told us of his having spent 8 l. there, and that he had got a great many Rings and Snuff-Boxes. Upon this I had a Suspicion of my new Kinsman, for on the Saturday before, he had not Money to pay for his Weeks Lodging. So we went up into his Room to search, and there was his Wastcoat and Breeches hid behind a Picture. We pull'd them out, and found the Pockets loaded with Rings, and Chains, and Snuff-Boxes, which were afterwards shewn to the Prosecutor, and he swore them to be his. - Whereupon we took the Prisoner.</p>

             thus depos'd. Between Ten and Eleven in the Morning, I was walking round Holywel-Mount (in the Field near Holywel-Lane, Shoreditch) and at some Distance, I saw a Man standing in an odd Posture, with his Back towards me, and his Head almost between his Legs. I could not imagine what he was about, and so I went towards him, upon which he laid himself all along upon something, as if he had been asleep; at that Time a Friend of mine coming by, we walk'd off a little Way, and stood upon the Watch. We saw the Man rise again, and perceived something like a Box under him; but seeing us, he lay down again. We went up to him, and asked him why he lay in that Manner: He said, he was not well. We proffered to give him a Dram, if he'd go with us; but he said, he could not drink any thing. I thought something more than ordinary was the Matter, and therefore was willing to find it out; but my Friend being in haste to go, I desired him only to watch two or three Minutes, while I called another Acquaintance of mine who was hard by. I went, and as I come back, I met the Prisoner empty-handed. When I came to my Friend, whom I had left waiting, he told me, that he was gone off with a Case in his Hand. Why, I met him just now says I, and he had nothing in his Hand. Then he has thrown it away, says he; and so we went to look, and found the Show-Glass turned upside down, but it was empty, and we could not afterwards get sight of the Prisoner.</p>

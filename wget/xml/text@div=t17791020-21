Then I was desired to go the taste the liquor at the Queen's-head; there I saw the prisoner with some drummers and fifes, and some soldiers of the First Regiment of Guards. I treated them with liquor to the amount of three shillings and threepence, being pleased with their musick. I went in at about one at noon. I might be there an hour. I had five guineas and an half in my left hand breeches pocket when I went in. I had been at the Bull's-head just before; there I was paid eighteen shillings. I could not give change. I pulled out the rest of my money out of my pocket. I saw then that I had four guineas and a half, and this guinea made five and a half. After I had been there some time the drums and fifes were ordered on duty; the prisoner and I were left alone; then I fell asleep.</p>

The next morning I went to the parade to look after the persons who had robbed me; there I saw a fife-boy, who had been playing with my handkerchief; I took him by the collar, and desired him to show me the rest of the men; in consequence of which the prisoner, and the rest of the men, were turned out; I took the prisoner off the parade, and before Sir

I understand that the prisoner sometimes has money sent him. I have known him have two or three guineas at a time; upon asking him that time how he came to have so much money in his pocket; he said he had had some money out of the country.</p>

               <p>JOHN M'ALLISTER. I lodge at Somer's-town. I came from Bromley, Kent; last Saturday night I was in Fleet-market; I had mistaken my way from London-bridge - I met a set of men and girls at the corner of Fleet-market, they said,</p>
               <p>"Old codger will give us some gin," I said,</p>

               <p>"I want nothing to do with you, I want to go to Somer's-town, let me get to the bottom of Holborn, and I can find the way;" Varlow said,</p>
               <p>"Old gentleman, you are out of your way, we are going to Battle-bridge, and will go with you; come up this lane and we will go together;" I said</p>
               <p>"I did not care, so that I went the right way;" Varlow said</p>
               <p>"Come in here, and we will soon go" - she took me up stairs into a room - I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want me to stop all night," -</p>
               <p>"to be sure," said she; I said I would not; I wanted to get out - my pocket was open - she came up close to me, and my money was gone in an instant; she made her escape - I missed my Scotch mull and tobacco-pouch; I made a disturbance at the door, and at that time she escaped - I came down stairs talking to the girls there, and was disgusted with their conversation; Day was in the passage - I said,</p>
               <p>"What a house you keep, I am robbed of all;" she said,</p>
               <p>"No, not all," and gave me my pouch and mull, which I put into my pocket, and went down stairs; I had not got far when the girls followed me and robbed me of my watch.</p>

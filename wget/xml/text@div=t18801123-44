                  </hi>. I am a printer, of 7, Axe Place, Hackney Road—on the 23rd October I was in the Pox and French Horn about 5.30—I came out a few minutes before six, when the prisoner caught hold of my arm and pulled me back, and another man came round in front and put his hands over my mouth and eyes, and another man put his Lands in my trousers pockets and took 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had—then the men who had my money ran away—I ran after him and I caught him, and the prisoner and the other man came over, and I was struggling with, the three—the prisoner kicked me on the leg three times, and I fell to the ground, clinging hold of his legs, which threw him down—I climbed up to his hands to prevent his hitting me, and when I had my hands to his chin I tried to catch hold of his coat—he bit my wrist, and I still have the scars—a policeman came up—I charged him with robbery, and then he struck me in the eye with his fist, which knocked me down—he was then takes—I was quite sober—I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I don't know the man, who robbed me; I was not in his company—when I caught him I asked for my money, but he would not give it me—he lisped rather—I had not been in the Metropolitan Tavern with him—I went into the Fox and French Horn with Oliver, a shopmate—I did not say to the man behind the counter, "Don't serve this man, he has got my money"—I do not know whether I bit your nose when on the ground—I was so exhausted and frightened—I earn 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—I did not assault anybody in the Metropolitan Tavern—I left off work at 2.30, and at three o'clock I went to John Street, where I stayed two hours—I then went up to the Fox and French Horn Tavern to have some beer—I swear I was not in company with the man who took my money—he had a kind of plaid suit on—the robbery took place outside the Fox and French Horn—I came out to go home; Mr. Oliver came out previously—I ran about 30 yards after the man with the money—I do not know where he went to—I had a shilling in my pocket when this was over.</p>

I was in Trenwell Street a few minutes past 6 on this evening, and saw a crowd outside the Fox and French Horn—I heard somebody call out, "They are robbing that man;" I ran up and saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling on the ground—the prosecutor was on the top of the prisoner—I pulled him off and asked him what was the matter—he said, "That man and two others have robbed me of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I will charge him with highway robbery"—in the meantime the prisoner got up—I had hold of the prosecutor's arm when the prisoner deliberately struck him in the face with his feet and knocked him down—I then told him he would have to come to the station with me—he said, "All right, I will go quiet"—I searched him at the station and found 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 167). I was walking with Barnes along Trenwell Street on the evening of the 23rd October; somebody passing along side, "You are wanted; somebody is being robbed;" I went to the spot and saw the prisoner and prosecutor on the ground, the prose<lb></lb>cutor being on the top of the prisoner—there was a mob there—Barnes caught hold of the prosecutor by the collar and lifted him up, and then caught hold of the prisoner on the left hand side of this collar, and I caught hold of him by the right; when we had got them up the prisoner hit the prosecutor in the eye—we took him to the station—the prosecutor had the marks of a bite on his wrist—it was bleeding.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You were bleeding on the upper lip; you said the prosecutor had done it—you did not say he had bitten you—I am not the first constable who took hold of you.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "The prosecutor was in company with me and man named Oliver, and Mrs. Murphy, and they went into the Metropolitan Tavern together, and there the prosecutor called for a quartern of Hollands gin, and the landlord asked why he wanted such strong liquor. The prosecutor said, 'I can show you how to make people drunk, and show you how I can rob them.' He called for more beer, and after coming from that side pro<lb></lb>ceeded to the Fox and French Horn public-house, and on the way the prosecutor turned to a man, and asked him to stand some beer. The man said, 'If you are broke I will pay for some.' The prosecutor said, 'I have no money. I am broke!' The man said, 'I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for all the money you have upon you.' The prosecutor said, 'You shall have it,' and he gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and searched him. The man took the prosecutor's money and ran into the Fox and French Horn. The prose<lb></lb>cutor followed him, and said to the man behind the count, 'Don't serve him, for he has got my money.' The man ran out and the prosecutor followed after him. I ran out after and saw the two fighting. That accounts for the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. found on the prosecutor."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence said that he was lame, and could not run or kick, that in the mob he got knocked down, and the prosecutor also, who bit his nose, and that when they got up he knocked the prosecutor down for it, and that the only truth in the case against him was giving the prosecutor the blow.</hi>

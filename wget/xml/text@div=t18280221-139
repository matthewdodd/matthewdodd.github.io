               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then you had hold of him? A. Yes, by the coat; I do not know whether he had hold of my arm - I was a little intoxicated, but not much; I had been drinking two or three pints of porter, and about a quartern of rum; the prisoner and I did not walk arm-in-arm - he walked with me five or six yards, and not further; he was going my way: he put his hand into my left waistcoat pocket - I lost 15s. I believe he is the man who took my watch; I told the Magistrate I had lost 15s. - it was all in shillings; I had wrapped it up in a piece of paper, and put it into my pocket in the public-house, a little after eleven o'clock. I said nothing about the 15s. till I got the watch-house; it was not more than two minutes from his putting his hand in my pocket till the second coming up and taking my watch; I said, "Let go of my pocket - let my money alone." I took hold of him directly he took the watch, but he had handed it to the other - the watchman came up in about half a minute - the other ran away, up George-yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did not you tell the watchman you had been robbed of 15s.? A. I was so agitated that I did not mention it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter before twelve o'clock I heard the cry of Stop thief! I went up, and saw the prisoner inclining rather to lead and protect the prosecutor, who had been drinking, but I considered him capable of knowing what he was about; he gave a clear account. I took them to the watch-house, and found 3s. on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say he was capable of giving a clear account? A. Yes - he was intoxicated, but did not require assistance to go along; he could stand and walk; they were standing still, with the prisoner's hand at the prosecutor's back. I was standing three or four yards from George-yard when I heard Watch! called - they were not in my sight; that is a very crowded part of Whitechapel: no man could have walked along Whitechapel, and not meet more than ten or eleven persons; I should think he would meet as many hundreds; he did not say a word about any money being taken from him until he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say there? A. He said the prisoner had robbed him of a watch and 15s. in silver; that he attacked his pockets, and he said, "Let my pockets alone;" the prisoner said, "Never mind, it will be all right;" the prosecutor had not hold of the prisoner, the prisoner had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not the prosecutor crying, and the night constable said, "You are foolish, you do'nt know what you are about; what are you crying for?" A. Yes, those words were uttered,</p>

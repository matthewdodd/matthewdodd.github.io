            . I received this bill (holding one in his hand) the 23d of January, 1768, of Mr. Ive; it is for 98 l. 6 s. I saw the prisoner about two or three days after in our counting-house. He said he was very sorry he could not oblige me with an hundred pounds, but he had sent me a very good bill on Mr. Aked (that is this bill in my hand ). I believe I had not discounted it.</p>
               <p>Q. What day in January was this that you had this conversation with him?</p>
               <p>Fryer. It might be about the 26th. I never saw Mr. Alexander to my knowledge before. He told me he should not want it for some time. He applied to me the 29th of January, 1768, for 20 l. I let him have it. He applied to me the 1st of February for 20 l. more. I told him then I thought he did it to serve himself and not me, for it was of no service to me to come to me for the money so soon after. I imagined he would lend me the bill till it became due. He told me he had some particular payments to make, and he had been disappointed, but he should not come any more for some time. He came again on the 8th of February, then I let him have 30 l. more; that was 70 l. in all. I believe then I told him pretty much the same as I did the second time. He told me he wanted the money, and he must have it. He applied the 26th of February for ten pounds, then I lent him ten pounds; this was money lent, because we had some other bills between us. When the bill became due, it was presented for payment, which was the 4th of March: it was noted, protested, and brought to me, and I paid the money. He gave me a note of hand to be accountable for this bill of 98 l. 6 s. I believe on the 12th of March I insisted upon him either to indorse the bill, or give me a memorandum to be accountable for the value of it. After that I never thought any thing about the writing. Then I thought there was a great deal of likeness between the writing of the memorandum, and the indorsement John Brown. I told him I thought John Brown and he learned at school by one master. He asked me why. I told him, because I thought there was a good deal of likeness in the writing. He said, One man may write like another. I told him I thought the indorsement, John Brown, was his hand-writing. He answered, It was immaterial to me, but I should have my money in two or three days. I had asked him several times about John Brown, but he never would give me an answer where he lived; but said I should have the money in a few days. He desired I would not trouble my head about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this bill presented to?</p>
               <p>Fryer. To Mr. Aked's house in Prince's-street. I discounted the bill with Fothering and Barber in Watling-street. I gave them the cash for it. After I received the bill I went to Mr.

             two or three times, and I received for answer from him, That he never wrote such a bill in his life. I shewed Richard Aked's letter to the prisoner, and I believe I shewed it to Mr. Ive.</p>
               <p>Q. What past between you and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fryer. He proposed he would take up the 98 l. 6 s. bill in a few days. I applied a great many times for the money. He told me I should have it in a few days; sometimes the next day; sometimes in two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner write?</p>
               <p>Fryer. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the words John Brown on the back of this bill, and tell me whose hand-writing you take it to be.</p>
               <p>Fryer. I told the prisoner I believed it to be his own, and I believe it now.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know such a man as John Brown?</p>
               <p>Fryer. No; I know no such man; nor could I ever learn from the prisoner where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you form your judgment, that this is the prisoner's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Fryer. By having seen him write this memorandum, and by receiving several letters from him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you ever saw him write any thing besides this memorandum?</p>
               <p>Fryer. No; I will not swear I have.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to prosecute him sooner?</p>
               <p>Fryer. It was through his promises that we should have the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to change your mind and prefer this bill?</p>
               <p>Fryer. Mr. Aked of Leeds insisted upon it that we should find out the forgery. The prisoner had promised, from time to time, we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280024"></xptr> should have the money, and we became bankrupts, which put it out of our power to prefer a bill against him or any one else. There were several people that gave me reason to believe it was a forgery. Tatlock and Parry did.</p>

               <p>I borrowed the bill in question to raise cash, and though I wanted it myself, I lent it to Mr. Fryer to raise money for him. John Brown had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280025"></xptr> put his name to several bills drawn upon his master payable to me, on purpose to raise cash as a friend of theirs. I nether forged it, neither do I know it to be a forgery, nor do I believe it to be one. As to Brown, he is now in France, and I cannot have his testimony. Supposing the name was not his hand-writing, it might be written by virtue of a power from him; but that is a matter of which I am very ignorant, and I believe it to be the hand-writing of that Brown, and therefore I humbly submit it there can be no charge against me.</p>

            . John Brown was my clerk for about six months, he was so in February 1768. He is now gone abroad. I have seen him write many times. (He takes the bill in his hand.) Here is the name John Brown to this bill. I am very certain this is his hand-writing. I will look no further, that is his hand-writing. He was my clerk in Prince's Street, near the Mansion house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the body of the bill in his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Aked. No: that is not. That I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave you?</p>
               <p>Aked. He left me I believe in June. He came to me about the 2d of January.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see this bill before it was put into your hands now?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. For acceptance. I would have paid it, but I never saw it after it became due.</p>

               <p>N. Aked. He lived at Leeds.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand-writing is the body of it?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. That is my brother's hand-writing. I have no doubt of it. If I had had any doubt, I would not have accepted it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first of your hearing there was to be this trial?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. The first time of my hearing of this trial being in agitation was yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how your brother came to draw this bill upon your clerk?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. My brother was then a little out of money, and this was drawn to keep the credit up.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been no application to you to pay this bill?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. I never heard of it: if they had come, I would have paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known any instances where Brown has lent his name to Alexander?</p>
               <p>N. Aked. That I can't remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the bill to you for acceptance?</p>

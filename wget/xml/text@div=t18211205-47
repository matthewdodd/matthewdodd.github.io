On the 8th of November I let the prisoner a lodging, he said he was a shopman out of employ; I let him the one pair of stairs back room at 2 s. 6 d. a week; these things were let with the lodging. On Tuesday, the 13th, he left. I found the door locked about three o'clock in the afternoon, and the key gone, he had given me no notice. When I got the door open I found the articles stated in the indictment gone. I saw him at Bow-street on the Saturday after, I found all the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was he the only one who took the lodging - A. Another young man named Evans, slept with him, who had been some time with me. I let the bed to two, both paid for the use it, he is now with me. I told Evans another young man was coming, and he consented to it. One Brown lodged there before the prisoner, he had left some weeks. Evans then occupied it by himself till the prisoner came. Evans only paid half, he did not see the prisoner till he came. I told them each that another man would sleep there. There was only one key between them, they used to lock the door and give me the key.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Sepulchre's. On Tuesday, the 13th of November, about eleven o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner in Smithfield, and a woman holding him by the coat, I took charge of him and found a screw-driver, seven keys, and four duplicates in his pockets. Child claimed one key, I found a candlestick in his hat, also a towel and a pillow-case, two pieces of soap, and a pair of scissars. I took him to Guildhall, and observed a lump on his back, one of the marshalmen pulled out a sheet from there, and in his trowsers I found another sheet, and a pillow-case. Child claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took him the very day he left, and kept him in custody - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I work at Blackwall-yard; I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this Blackwall-yard? - Down at Poplar, at Esq. Perry's.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner? - I know him very well. I was coming home from Blackwall-yard to the house where I lodge, and there I catched him with these things in the garden; it was about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner? - In Wright's garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Wright? - He is a labouring man, a watchman in the yard; and the prisoner had these things on him, these two axes, and this tea kettle.</p>
               <p>Q. One is an axe and the other is an hatchet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he these things? - In his hand taking them through the door, he was coming out into the street when I catched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept the things from that time to this? - Yes, I am sure these are the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you? - I asked him what business he had with them? he said he was fuddled or else he should not have come down there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear fuddled? - I really cannot say whether he was drunk or sober, I don't justly know what he was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear to you? - He walked very well to the watch-house; we took him to the watch-house directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Wright come to the watch-house that night? - No, not till the next morning; I went up with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time of the night was I taken? - Nine o'clock, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you find a bill against me last session at Hicks's Hall? I was turned out by proclamation.</p>
               <p>Court. What day did this happen? - The 16th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was not he prosecuted in December last? - I know nothing at all about that.</p>
               <p>Q. To Wright. You are likewise a watchman I understand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see this boy in your yard at all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140004"></xptr>Q.What time did you come home? - About six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any property? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the watch-house? - Gibson came down with an officer, and told me I must appear against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go on that information? - I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these things there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The axe and hatchet did they belong to you? - Yes, I bought the small one, and the large one was given me by the carpenter that works in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any name on it? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had it? - Nine months; I know it by the handle; I can swear to the hatchet, because I bought it and put the handle in myself; it was broke off, and I put it in again afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. The tea kettle what do you say to that? - The tea kettle was left in the room by a person who had rented the room, and went to sea, and his wife died, and I let the room again, and the tea kettle remained there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of these these people? - The man's name was 
               <persName id="t17950114-1-person47">

               <p>Q. When did you last see him? - He went out in the Henry Dundas, and coming home he was prest.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you see him last? - I fancy it is about twenty months, I don't know but it may be two years since; the tea kettle was left in the room when his wife died.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>

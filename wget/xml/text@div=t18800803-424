Newmarsh and Sewell, of Cirencester, a firm which we knew very well and who were clients of ours—he said, "My father died when I was quite young and left Mr. Newrmarsh my guardian, when I was old enough Mr. Newmarsh sent me to Eton and I was absent about a year"—he mentioned the house he stayed at which I forget, and that he afterwards went to a crammer for the purpose of passing a military examination to go into the service—upon the strength of these statements we undertook the business—he said he wanted money particularly on that very day, and on the 21st April I gave him this cheque for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">this was on the West London and Commercial Bank</hi>)—the next day I sent to procure a copy of hid father's will—my clerk spoke to me and on the 24th I told him I had procured a copy of the will and no mention was made of his name, but the property was left to Mr. Newmarsh—he said, "My father was a very old friend of Mr. Newmarsh, he had great confidence in him and he left the property to him in trust for me"—and in answer to Mr. Burr's question in my presence he affirmed that the trust was undeclared—he also said, "When I came of age Mr. Newmarsh placed me in possession of the property, and I have already drawn one half year's receipts, amounting to about 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in June next I shall receive another 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and that Mr. Goddard, of Peacock and Goddardrsolicitors, was one of his trustees—I believed his statements and gave him these two cheques on the 24th April for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came very often—on May the 4th, when he called I told him he must complete the mortgage, and Mr. Burr and the defendant drove to a solicitor in Clements Inn and came back with this mortgage (<hi rend="italic">this was the mortgage of a farm at Ydstradfai, and plot of land at Mynyndsylln, and a receipt for</hi> 412<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I gave him two cheques for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ind 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently gave him these cheques May 5th 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, 6th 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 8th 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, 12th 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 21st 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5, 26th 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 28th 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 29th 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and June 5th 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 9th of June I said, "Jones this is very serious, you most get me those title deeds, I cannot go on advancing money in this way unless I have some security"—he said, "They are deposited with Mr. New<lb></lb>marsh"—I said, "Very well you must go down there and get them, because I must have them"—he said, "Very well, I will go"—I said, "Go this evening"—he said, "I cannot because I have not got any money"—I said, "What have you done with all the money I have given you?—he said, "I had a lot of outstanding bills to pay, and I have spent the rest"—I said, "I will let you have another 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> down to Cirencester and you must give me your word of honour that you will go and bring me back the title deeds"—I then cashed the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)and gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I could not give him a cheque because my partner was not in and a cheque of the firm would require two signatures—I believed the statements in the mortgage of 4th May that Mr. Newmarsh had the deeds, and that the prisoner possessed the property and had the power to mortgage it—he never brought the deeds—I knew of no prior charge on the property—I do not recollect his stating the property was unencumbered—he never Mentioned Mr. Sneiling's name to me—I also gave the prisoner various</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Peacock and Goddard, solicitors, of South Square, Gray's Inn—I have known for some years Mr. Newmarsh, solicitor, of Cirencester—in June, 1877, he requested me to become a trustee of a voluntary settlement to be made in favour of defendant—I produce the deed which was subsequently drawn up—it relates to a farm, Ydstradfai, and to a smaller farm at Mynydsylln—I handed the defendant a copy of the deed last January—it also relates to some mountain land—the total acreage of the farm was 223 acres—that was let at 1 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and the smaller allotment produced 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the deed provides for a mortgage upon the land of 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 4 per cent—for 1877 and 1878 the net rental would be 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—afterwards there was a reduction of 10 per cent on account of agricultural depression—the trustees were to have a discretionary power to apply the income for the defendant to the age of 25 for his maintenance and with power to withhold it, with the usual cessor on alienation—it is an absolute cessor, it goes back to the trustees, after 25, provided the defendant did not become bankrupt or alienated, he is then absolutely entitled to the rents for his life, with remainder over to his issue and other parties afterwards—it is entailed—the ultimate remainder in fee is Mr. Thomas Hall, the son of the settlor—the defendant has been of age about a year—the deed states him to be 19 in 1877—before I gave the defendant a copy of the deed I had had numerous conversations with him as to his income—when I took instructions for the deed he was present, and the terms of the then proposed trust were explained to him by Mr. Newmarsh in my presence—I paid him the income at first with regularity, and then circumstances came to my knowledge which induced me to withhold a portion—on more than one occasion I complained to him of the way he was going on with regard to pecuniary matters, and I informed him of his position—I told him he was not absolutely entitled to the property—first of all I him a copy of the deed because I thought it was better he should</p>

               <p>Q. Could you, from the place where you were set to watch, see the prisoner and the place where the soap was put? - A. Yes; at three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come to his work, he went into the stable, he came out and went into the warehouse through the window; he stopped there about five or six minutes, and then he put a sack through the window, and carried it into the stable, he kept the sack in the stable about three quarters of an hour, he came out with the sack and a little bundle of hay, and his great coat, then he put it in the cart and drove out of the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of No. 3, Blackheath Road, Kent On Tuesday or Wednesday, 24th or 25th Feb., the prisoner came to my shop, about half past 10 o'clock at night, and asked for a mutton chop and two kidneys—he gave me half a crown—I gave him the change, and he left—I put the half crown into my pocket, where I had only some halfpence and a shitting and a sixpence, and in about four minutes afterwards discovered that it was bad—I wrapped it in a piece of paper and have kept it separate ever since—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I saw the prisoner at Greenwich police court, and am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You stated first that it was Tuesday, 3rd March, and you stated, on your return to the police court afterwards, that it was Monday, 2nd March. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was taken out of my business in a hurry, and did not remem<lb></lb>ber the day; after my neighbour had referred to his book, I went to the police court a second time to correct the error which I had made, and stated that it was Monday, 2nd March—I am sure now that it was not 2nd March, and that it was not on Feb. 25th or 26th, or on the 23rd, because we never slaughter anything on Monday—it was on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was called out singly, and by name, to be identified by this man. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> They told a man to unlock the door—I was a yard or two off the cell, and he was the first man that walked out, but I never heard him called by name; I said, "That is the man "—I looked in the cell after<lb></lb>wards to see if there were any men there, but not to see if I knew any of them, as I was quite certain about the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Railway Tavern, at Lewisham. On Whit Monday night, about 20 minutes to 12 o'clock, after the house was closed, somebody knocked at the door—I opened it, and the prisoner was there with a small bottle in his hand; he asked for a quartern of rum and a cork—the light was out outside, and the gas was lowered inside—I said, "You had better come in, and let me have a look at you"—(he wanted me to give it out to him)—my wife, who was in the bar, took the bottle and put the rum into it, and I saw him hand her a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece; she went into the bar parlour to get change for it, returned with it in her hand, and gave it to me, saying, "This is bad"—the prisoner said, "I have got some more money," and put his hand into his pocket and threw down a good half crown—my wife gave him the change—he wanted the crown back, but I would not give it to him—he said, "You shall either give it me back or lock me up"—I said that I could not be away from my house for a week or a fort<lb></lb>night, and if he had any doubt that I was doing wrong, he might take a summons out before a Magistrate—he went outside the door with me to look for a policeman—a policeman came, and we all went in again; the policeman advised me to lock him up, and I gave him into custody—I gave the crown which I received from my wife to the policeman at the station.</p>

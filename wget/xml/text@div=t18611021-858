(<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, G.</hi>) I am employed by the Mint authorities—on 5th October, I was in the City-road with Sergeant Elliott, and saw the prisoner and another female going towards the Eagle tavern in the direction of Finsbury-square—they looked about them, and looked back and I thought from their manner that they observed me—they separated at the corner of Providence-street, and the prisoner went straight ahead—we followed her—I was within five paces of her when she looked back again, and then I saw her stoop her head towards her hand which went to her mouth—I seized her by the right arm, and Elliott by the left—this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) was on her left arm—she appeared in the act of swallowing something—her right hand was closed—I said, "Mrs. Robertson, what</p>

This is the way in which bad coins are usually wrapped up—the shilling found in the bag is of 1856, and is counterfeit—here are eighteen other shillings all counterfeit, one of which is from the same mould as that found in the bag—the others are from three or four different moulds.</p>

I suppose the woman in front of me dropped them. A gentleman spoke to me, and I have put an advertisement in the paper to see if he will come forward; but I not heard from my friends whether he has done so.</p>

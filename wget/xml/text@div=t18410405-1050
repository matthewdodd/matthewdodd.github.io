On the morning of the 8th of March, about half-past seven o'clock, I met the prisoners in Chapel-street, Lisson Grove—Grogan had these two fowls, one under each arm, and Hil<lb></lb>lier had one fowl—I went up to them and asked where they bought them—Hillier said in the market, and they had given 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-piece for them—I understood him to mean that morning—while I was talking to them a man came up and offered 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the three—Hillier said they would not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bird-fancier, and live in Homer-street. On Mon<lb></lb>day morning, the 8th of March, the prisoners came to my shop with three fowls—Hillier asked if I would buy them—I asked if they were his own property—he said, Yes, he had bought them on the Saturday previous for 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—I asked what he wanted for them—he said 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—one was very bad with the croop and likely to die, and I said that was too much—he said, "How much will you give for them?"—I offered 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is not an under price considering the time I have to keep them, and one not being in health—the officer afterwards came in, and I delivered the fowls to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. James Barlow, a plumber, in the Harrow-road. I missed some fowls of his at eight o'clock on Monday morning, from the hen-house, which was broken open—it stands in a yard fenced in—I know these two fowls to be Mr. Barlow's—he has had them about two years—I saw footmarks in the back meadow leading to the hen-house.</p>

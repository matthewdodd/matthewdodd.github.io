               <p>Sherwin. I am sure this is my table-spoon; the prisoner lived in the same house with me; I made enquiry in the house, and she left the house that night; I saw nothing of her till the next day, when she was taken up.</p>
               <p>ANN SHERWIN sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; the prisoner lodged with a person of the name of Butterfield, the house is let out in tenements: On the 6th of September, I missed a table-spoon and a tea-spoon, I know the tablespoon to be mine, I told the prisoner I had missed it, and she said, she was very sorry, she hoped I should find it; she went away, and did not return that night; she was sometimes absent all night, but very seldom: she was taken up the next night, and on the Saturday following she owned she had taken the table-spoon, but knew of nothing else; the constable and I were with her at the time; I made her no promise of favor; she gave me the duplicate, and my husband went to the pawnbroker's, and saw the spoon.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GABELL sworn. - When the prisoner owned it, she said, Cadman was as bad as she; she told me where Cadman was, and I took her into custody; the prisoner said, she had spent the money at Edmonton-fair: On the 15th, I went to to search the lodging, and received the duplicate from Mrs. Butterfield.</p>
               <p>SARAH BUTTERFIELD sworn. - I interrogated the prisoner, and got the duplicate from her; she acknowledged it, but it was in consequence of a promise of forgiveness from the prosecutor, and I got the duplicate from her upon that promise.</p>

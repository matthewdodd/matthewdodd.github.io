               <p>John Wynn. As I was coming to town on the 23d of last month, between six and seven in the evening I was stopped in <placeName id="t17530111-13-crimeloc66">Hide-Park</placeName>

I was on horseback coming on a full walk, and one of the men stepped up from the rails and took hold on the horse's rein with his left hand, and put his right hand up to me, but what he had in it I can't say. Another man on the other side of the way came up and demanded my watch; then he came round on the other side and ordered me to dismount, so I did, and they searched my pockets and took seven-pence in money out of my right hand pocket; one of them got hold of the great coat which I had on my back and ordered me to pull it off; they bid me make haste, and said there was another customer coming, money they wanted, and money they would have ; then they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property is it?</p>
               <p>Wynn. It is the property of Mr. serjeant Draper, which he gives me as a part of my livery; I can't take upon me to swear the prisoners are the men that took it.</p>

            . On the 24th, I was in Compton-street with Cooper and Collins, and saw the two prisoners, and another in company - I heard one say to the other, "There is nothing in that pocket," they were then following a gentleman; I watched them up Great George-street, St. Giles's, into the second house, they came out in a minute and a half, and stood at the corner, the prosecutor came by; the one who has escaped, beckoned the other to come on, they all three followed him about three hundred yards - I saw the one who got away, take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to Moore, who went across the street with it; I went after him, and saw him put it in his pocket; I took it from him, and secured him - the prosecutor came up and claimed it. Taylor was in company with him.</p>

               <p>Court. Did they demand the money of you before you parted with it? - Yes; as soon as I gave them the money, they let go my collar and bid me go to the bottom of the court, which they said was my way out; now that was no way out, and they told me if I came up to the top of the court, they would cut my bloody head off, and another said he would murder me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250098"></xptr>Court. Was the prisoner one of those that made use of these expressions? - Yes; there was no way out at the bottom of the court, and I came out to the top again; I did not see them at all; I went down Holywell-lane; I live in New Nicol-street, Shadwell; going down Holywell-lane, the two fellows were under King John's Court, the other was opposite the way; they strove to catch me again, they did not catch me; after I had got past them, I knew one of them that went by the nick-name of Guinea-pig, that was the prisoner; I said Guinea-pig, you shall pay for this to-morrow; I have known the prisoner this two years, he lodged next door to me part of the time; they then threw brick-bats at me as hard as they could, and I called watch! but none came; then I went home, and I saw no more of them that night; but the next day, abut two o'clock, I apprehended the prisoner; I then sent a man to see for an officer, and he brought Mr. Wade; after he was at Mr. Wilmot's, he told me, if in case he was guilty of a fault the night before, he hoped I would forgive him; then he said, consider my wife and child.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you made use of any promises to induce the man? - I never said a word to the man.</p>
               <p>Did you threaten him? - No.</p>

               <p>When I was locked up at Mr. Wilmot's, the prosecutor sent two men to me, and they gave me three or four pints of purl, and asked me after if I would have any gin, I said I had enough; then says one of them, are not you a foolish fellow to go to rob a man that knows you, and he said to me tell the truth, I am a particular acquaintance of the prosecutor's, and I will persuade him to make it up.</p>
               <p>Court. The prosecutor says you said at Wilmot's, that if you was guilty of a fault the night before, you hoped he would forgive you, and consider your wife and child?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has made that out of his own head.</p>

               <p>I was at the Duke of Northumberland's arms, next door to Justice Wilmot's, on Saturday the 17th of January, about two in the afternoon; I went in and asked what was the matter, some of the people in the house said, a young man is going to be examined for robbing Mr. Clarridge; I went down to see him; I said to him, if I was a dying man, says I, young man, you have been guilty of a very bad action, are you the man that robbed Mr. Clarridge? he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you given him any liquor before this? - My Lord, as I am here alive, I never gave him a drop of liquor in the days of my life.</p>
               <p>Was he sober? - Yes; I said I am acquainted with Mr. Clarridge, he is a very civil man; says he, do you know him; I said, yes; he said, then for God's sake, and cried very much, speak to him to make the matter up; I told him, I would let Mr. Clarridge know what he said; says he, my mother is over the way, who will make up the eleven shillings; he said, I had the sixpence, but I never had the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Had you made him any promise before this, to shew him any favour that he should not be prosecuted? - None in the world.</p>
               <p>Had you told him it would be better for him? - No, I never gave him any liquor, nor saw any go to him; I told Mr. Clarridge, and he told Justice Wilmot that he had spoke to somebody concerning the matter, who was at the Court, or near it, and he said it was Mr.

               <p>Court. Do you positively take upon you, Sir, to say that this prisoner had not any liquor in your company? - Yes, I had given him none.</p>
               <p>How came you to accost him at the outset, with saying, you have done a very bad thing? - Because I knew the prosecutor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250099"></xptr>Court. He could not be guilty before any examination.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man came out three or four times to me, and you know you said I had better tell the truth, and you would make it up for me, without going to gaol at all; says you, you know very well you had sixpence, tell the truth, and another man that was along with you at the same time, kept bringing me out a pint of purl, and had brought me purl, and wanted to force me to drink.</p>
               <p>Court. Did such a conversation pass? - Not the least in the world, if I was a dying man.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems very unnatural that the prisoner, who knew nothing at all of you, should expose himself; what reason was there for your informing the prisoner that you was an acquaintance of Mr. Clarridge's? - I never said I would make it up for him, I said I would tell Mr. Clarridge.</p>

               <p>Jury to Mrs. Webley. Have you any knowledge of the prisoner being one of the persons that insulted you? - I do not know any one of them.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of the prisoner before this time? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there a person like him that was one of the three? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to me very extraordinary that they should make that second attack on him, after they had taken his property.</p>
               <p>Jury to Clarridge. What business are you? - I am a shoemaker, I had been into the Borough with some shoes.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night, or dark? - Rather light than dark.</p>
               <p>Was there any lamps any way near? - Not far off, I could see the men perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Jury. With which hand did he collar you? - I cannot be perfect.</p>
               <p>Why he has but one hand? - He was on the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am lame of one side.</p>
               <p>Jury. There was time enough to call the watchman.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarridge. It seems to me to be pretty extraordinary, that you should, under such circumstances, discover that you knew any one of them; why, you might have been murdered? - I was left for dead about two years ago; I did not think they meant to meddle with me.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Webley. Did Mr. Clarridge appear in liquor? - Quite sober.</p>
               <p>How near were the three men to you when they abused you? - They came quite close to us.</p>
               <p>If you had known the prisoner at the bar at any other time, you would have known him at that time? - I did not take any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250100"></xptr> notice, I did not think they would offer to stop the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Court. If the purpose of these three men was robbery, they would have had a much better booty, by attacking them both together.</p>
               <p>Jury. The three men had an opportunity of robbing you both if they chose it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nobody there to prevent it? - No.</p>

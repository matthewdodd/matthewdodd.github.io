On the morning of the 18th of June I saw a woman lower a bag out of Mr. Harrow's window down to Ross, who stood in the street and received it; it was about the size of a small pillow-case - she put it into her apron and crossed over; I went to meet her, and said, "What do you call this?" she said, what was that to me; I spoke to the watchman, he said he could not do any thing, as it was not his ward - soon after another watchman came up and went for the officer; I was not aware that I had a right to take the woman or I would have done it - I am quite sure Ross was the person; I saw her in custody in about an hour.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had information, and went to the prosecutor's house; I found Mr. Harrow - he was out of town; I saw Benge, and asked what she had let out of the window to a person in the street- she said flour which she let down to her daughter, who lived in Plumtree-court, Shoe-lane; I sent the watchman, who brought her to me - I then went to that place, where the two prisoners lived together; when we got there, Benge said, "Where did you put it?" Ross went to a drawer, and, took this out - on further search, I found this second quantity of flour.</p>

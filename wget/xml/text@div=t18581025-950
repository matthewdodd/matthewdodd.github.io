                  </hi>. I am a draper at Bungay in Suffolk. On 30th September I was in London—I was standing on Ludgate-hill, opposite the Old Bailer, watching the sheriffs'procession pass—immediately after I crossed over to the Old Bailey; I was met by three men—the prisoner was one of them—I immediately put my fingers into my waistcoat pocket, as I thought to take care of my watch, and it was gone—it was fastened to a piece of black braid round my neck—the braid was not broken, but the ring was wrenched off the stem of the watch—it was done without my feeling it—immediately I missed it I saw it in the prisoner's possession—he ran away, and I ran after him and saw him throw it away—it was afterwards shown to me by the officer—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worth about four guineas.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gloucester-street, Lambeth—I was coming up Ludgate-hill on 30th September, and saw the prosecutor and three men surrounding him—the prisoner was one of them—they began pushing him about—the prisoner was behind him—I saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, pull out the watch, and directly ran away with it—I ran after him till the policeman took him into custody.</p>

On Sunday morning about eight o'clock I fetched a pair of boots on trees, from No. 16, Hunter-street, and brought them home to be cleaned - I put them into the passage behind the door; I went up stairs for half a minute, and as I came down I saw a man's foot going out at the door, and when I got down the boots and trees were gone - no man lodged in the house; I told my mother a thief had taken them away - I ran out and saw them soon after in Harrison-street; they had been dropped - a gentleman picked them up, and gave them to me; I saw the prisoner at the watch-house next morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I apprehended the prisoner concealed in the privy of an empty house in Harrison-street, just before eight o'clock in the morning; I collared him - he said, "It was not me;" I had told him he had stolen the boots; I had heard an alarm, and seen him turn from the corner of Cromer-street, up Gray's Inn-lane, into Harrison-street, with one boot under his arm; I saw him throw it over into an area - the last witness saw the boots and trees, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you lose sight of him? A. Yes, when he turned round the empty house; I believe Mr. Wilson, of Cromer-street, is a friend of his, from what he says - he did not say he was going to breakfast with him; the privy is at the back of No. 43, Cromer-street - Wilson attended at Hatton-garden.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see his face? A. No; I had no idea of their being our boots at that time - I was examined before the Justice, but I was so flurried I do not know what I said; I had only laid in three weeks; the man appeared to me to have a dark coat on - I thought it was black.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier, and live at No. 43, Cromer-street. My privy is on the landing place going down stairs - it is a kind of water-closet, but at the back of my house are some carcases of houses with privies to them; my back door is often open; the prisoner is a tailor - he often came to breakfast with me; I expected him that day - I heard a knock at my door that morning, but I was not up; my boy went down, but who he let in I did not see.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could he get to your water-closet if he wanted? A. The door opens with a small latch-key - he could go there; there was no occasion for his going to the privy of an empty house.</p>

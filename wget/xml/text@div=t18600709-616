                  </hi>. I am foreman to James Vavasseur and others, of 47, Cannon-street, silk manufacturers—the prisoner was in our employ on 10th April, as a weaver of silk, and had been so employed some time before that—on 16th April I gave him out forty yards of warp silk, that is unwoven silk; it weighed about forty-eight ounces—he signed a receipt for it—it was to be woven into silk—he was to make it up into neckties, and deliver it to us within twenty-eight days—I gave him a ticket, as is usual with us, telling him how the work was to be done, and in what time; that is the common course, and the workman signs the receipt—he was to make it up at a place occupied by him, No. 2, Golden-lane, City—that was a room he hired of us for that purpose—the loom there belonged to him, but the machine belonged to us—in the course of the manufacture it is necessary to use something called "leads," commonly called "lingoes;" they are small leads for the purpose of holding the silk; they also belonged to the firm—it is my duty to inspect the work as it goes on; I went to him on 26th May for the purpose of inspecting his work as he was going on with it—he was at work—as near as I could say about fifteen yards of silk was then-actually made up—if he had used proper diligence he should have brought his work home before that; the twenty-eight days had then expired some considerable time—I had paid him visits several times before that—it is very common for the work people to keep the work longer than the specified time—on 5th May, as near as I can say, he brought back sixteen and three-quarter yards—we considered that he ought to have brought us home eighteen yards; only a small quantity would be allowed for in the weaving—if we give out forty yards we should be content with receiving thirty-seven yards or so—the quantity that he was deficient would not be allowed for in the weaving—I went again on the 28th May; he was not there—it being Whit<lb></lb>Monday I did not take particular notice of that; the door was locked at the time—I believed that the silk was safe—on the 29th, next day, I went again and examined the house; I found he was gone—when I went in I missed the silk and the leads; he gave no more silk to me than what I have mentioned, but he left a small quantity behind, about five or six ounces, for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186007090040"></xptr>
               <p>which I have given him credit; that is part of the unmade silk—the whole of the silk that was manufactured was removed, and also part that was unmanufactured, and a small quantity of unmanufactured silk remained, the value of which was about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was still a very large quantity deficient—ten guineas we estimate the value of that which was deficient—the lingoes were gone; more than 4,000—they were worth from 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made a communication to the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How many bobbins of silk might you have found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there were seven or eight with silk on them, but they were not all full—there might perhaps have been eight or ten bobbins with silk on—I will not swear that I found eighteen bobbins—there were two or three smaller bobbins—I believe the number of bobbins was quite correct—it very much depends on how much silk one bobbin will hold—they may hold more or less than an ounce, most likely less, on an average twenty-five bobbins take a pound of silk—the warp bobbins hold from the fifth to the sixth part of an ounce each bobbin—I will not swear to the number of empty and full bobbins, but the number given out to you corresponded with the number that we found, added to those which you had previously returned at the warehouse—we have at the warehouse the account of the silk that we discovered, and we have given you credit for it—we have not charged you with stealing the silk which you left behind you—I do not charge you with twenty yards of ready-made work—we consider that there was from sixteen to seventeen yards of work made up at the time it was removed—I will swear that I saw thirteen yards of work made on 26th May—that was on your beam—I am not acquainted with the precise value of that work after it is ready-made—I know the value of silk before it is woven—I have not got the particulars of the exact weight that was given out—the length was forty yards—I have not got the precise weight of the sixteen and three-quarter yards of silk that I received home—I said I believed there were four or five more bobbins—I do not swear it—I think there was an ounce of silk on the warp—when I went to your house on Monday I saw several of the tenants who reside there; I saw your next door neighhour—I did not see you—I think I came between five and six o'clock on Monday, the 28th May—to the best of my recollection the place was fastened up—I don't remember coming in and seeing you at work—I have a very great many things to think of; I have stated the evidence to the best of my recollection, and as far as remember the place was closed and I did not see you on that day—I enquired about you there, and I was told that you had had a quarrel with a man and had been kicked down stairs; a man named Wade told me that—I believe that was about five o'clock—I did not go to your place any more that evening—I went there again on Tuesday evening about six o'clock, the place was fastened up and I saw nothing until one of the work people broke away part of the fastening of the doors, and when I went into the place I found the work had been violently removed, and that the leads had been cut away from the machine—I would swear that 4,200 were cut away—they were all taken away—there were 5,200 leads—you could not work with one less than that number—they were all gone except a few that were found on the floor—I am not able to say what the market price of the leads is per thousand—your place was safe enough when I saw you there at work on Saturday the 26th May—that was the last time I saw you there at work—I found only a small quantity of silk waste—the forty yards of silk that I gave you was violet and the other colour was nankeen—there was forty yards of violet and twenty yards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186007090041"></xptr>
               <p>of nankeen—I gave you twenty-one days to do that in—I gave you a docu<lb></lb>ment and you signed it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police-sergeant</hi>, 518). I took the prisoner in custody at Hulseworth in Suffolk, on 14th June—I showed him the warrant and said I should take him for stealing silk from Mr. Vavasseur's—he was in custody when I got there—I received him from the superintendent of police—in the railway carriage he said, "I knew I was very foolish for doing this so I gave myself up; I have sold the property in question to a man whom they call 'Crutchy,' whom I met in the City-road"—I said, "Did you give it him"—he said, "No; I gave him leave to cut it from the loom"—I said, "As to the weights, do you know anything about them?"—he said, "No; I did not give him leave to cut the weights away."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I first went to work for Mr. Vavasseur I, was making a scarf belonging to him; he saw me at work and said, "When will you have finished this? "I told him the day and he said, "I can find you something better than that when it is done." When I had the scarfs done I went to him; he took me to a house and showed me a room in Golden-lane, which he said he would let to me for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; he afterwards took me to a much worse room and I had to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for that. First he offered me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard for work, and then he would not pay me more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I was dreadfully ill-used, and I was obliged to leave the place; I was ill-used by Mr. Vavasseur's tenants. I can get a man to swear that he saw a man break into my place.</p>

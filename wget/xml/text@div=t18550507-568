                  </hi>. I am a jobber, and live at Walthamstow. On the morning of 2nd May I went to the Cock, about 9 o'clock in the morning, to refresh myself with a pint of beer—there were the two prisoners and two more persons there—the prisoner Hughes flew at me, threw me down, and put his hand into my pocket, and drew out a purse, which contained 80.—I did not struggle with him at all—I was on my face—as soon as he had transacted it, he went out at the back door—I never saw my money again—I do not know what became of my purse—I did not see it afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walthamstow. I was in the taproom of the Cock on the morning of 2nd May—I cannot say what time it was—I went in for a pint of beer—I had not had my breakfast—as near as I can tell it was about half-past 10 o'clock—I had no watch—I know the time by going up to the water—I saw Gibson and the two prisoners there—I saw Hughes take the purse out of Gibson's pocket—Gibson was standing up before the fire, and Hughes was taking the purse out of his pocket—Hughes went out backwards, and came in again, and brought the purse in one hand and the money in the other—he put the purse into the fire, and gave the money to Monger, and then he went out—Gibson went after a policeman.</p>

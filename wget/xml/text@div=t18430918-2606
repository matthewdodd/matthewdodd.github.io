                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Cambridge-street, Hyde Park, and keep a boarding house—the prisoner was about two months in my service—on Sunday, the 13th of August, I received information, and next morning I told the prisoner I missed a petticoat—she said, "What sort of one?"—I said, "With tucks at the bottom"—she said she had got one with tucks which was given to her by Mrs. Richardson—she unlocked her box and handed it to me—I said it was mine—she said it was not—I knew it to be mine—I do not recollect where I lost it from—it was in a drawer or about my room—it was made in the East Indies by a black man—I brought it home myself, and know the work—I told her again the next day it was mine—she said Mrs. Richardson gave it to her; but when I gave her in charge, she said it was mine—the policeman found a gold pencil-case and two pocket handkerchiefs in her box—the white handkerchief is mine.</p>

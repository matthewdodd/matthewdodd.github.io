                  </hi>. I am clerk to a gentleman in Milk-street—on Tuesday, 13th September, I was at a beer-shop in Bath-street, City-road, kept by Mr. Smith, a friend of my father—I went there about 10 o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner there—I had seen him about twice before—while I was there he spoke to me; he asked me what time it was—I told him it was half-past 10 o'clock—he said he thought it was later than that—he then asked me if I did not live in York-street—I said "Yes,"—he said he lived in Charles-street—he played one game at bagatelle with me and two others who were there—after that he asked me if I was not going home before 12 o'clock—I said "Yes,"—I remember his leaving about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I did—I left about twenty minutes before 12 o'clock—I went straight home, and when I got within three or four yards of my home I felt something strike me on my head—it was a heavy blow, and nearly stunned me—I caught by the rails—I turned and saw the prisoner—I said, "What did you hit me in that manner for?"—he said, "I hope I have not hurt you?"—I said, "You have; you have cut my head open,"—I felt the blood running down—he put his hand round me, tore my coat open, and wrenched my watch from the chain—my watch was fastened, and he broke the rivet from the watch in taking it—this is my watch—after he had taken it he ran off up the street—I ran after him, and called out, "Stop thief"—I came up with him in President-mews—he said, "Do you want your watch?"—I said, "Yes; give me my watch,"—he said, "There it is," and he ran off up President-mews—the policeman brought him back soon after, and I gave him in charge.</p>

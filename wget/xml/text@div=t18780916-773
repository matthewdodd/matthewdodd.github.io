                  </hi>. I am 12 years old, and live at 38, Wells Street, Poplar—on 15th January about 4.15 I was in Wade Street, coming from school—there was a rank of boys walking two and two—the prisoner was part of the school, and was one or two ranks in front of me—I had my books in a strap in my hand—I stepped forward, hit the prisoner with the strap, and walked on, and he turned round and hit me in the back, just under my shoulder bone—I did not see what with—it hurt me, and I staggered and fell and fainted—I was taken to the hospital <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not see him strike me—I don't know whether he struck me deliberately, or whether he tumbled against me—he did not say anything—I had been playing with him on the way—we had been very good friends—we had never had any quarrel—he bears a very good character in the school, and has a good-conduct medal.</p>

                  </hi>. I was walking with the school, keeping the ranks—I saw Driscoll run up to the prisoner—there was some discussion between them—Driscoll hit the prisoner with a strap, and the prisoner turned round, and he appeared to me as though he fell against him, as if he could not help it—I saw his hand go behind his back—I saw some<lb></lb>thing in his hand, I can't say what it was—it glittered like steel and Driscoll fainted—I did not hear anything said about a knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I was walking with the other boys—I saw Driscoll hit the prisoner with a strap, and the prisoner immediately stabbed him with a knife in the back; he had been using the knife in school paring his nails—he had it in his hand at this time, it was done suddenly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Poplar Hospital—an 15th January Driscoll was brought there; he was suffering from an incised chest wound, penetrating to the pleural cavity; it was about an inch long, and about half-an-inch deep; it was rather of a dangerous character, and he has been suffering since from inflammation of the pleura—it would require some force to cause such a wound—the knife produced could have caused it, it is very blunt.</p>

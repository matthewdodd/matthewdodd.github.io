                  </hi>. I am an account book manufacturer, of Cheap<lb></lb>side, with my father. About 9th July, the prisoner, who I had seen two or three times previously, called—I had never had any transaction with him—hehanded me this card: "Edwin Boucher, Secretary to the General Picto<lb></lb>rial Exhibition Company," and, in pencil, "12, Beaufort Buildings"—he said, "I am surety to this Company, which is now in actual course of forma<lb></lb>tion, are you willing to supply such goods as may be required for the Com<lb></lb>pany?" I said, "Yes"—he named certain goods, which he requested might be sent that evening to No. 12, Beaufort Buildings—they came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I sent them—the prisoner subsequently called upon me at various times, and</p>

               <p>obtained other goods, which I sent to the place indicated—I parted with them believing that he was secretary to the company, that it was in actual course of formation, and that he was authorized to order goods on their behalf.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Maldon Buildings, and was one of the directors of the General Pictorial Exhibition Company, at the end of 1856 or the beginning of 1857—it remained in existence three or four months only—thelast regular meeting was on 8th April, but the meeting at which the disso<lb></lb>lution took place was held at Mr. Maddocks', in Serjeant's Inn—previous to that the prisoner was secretary of the company; he was one of the promoters of it—in May, 1857, his services were dispensed with, and he was dismissed—Mr. Maddocka proposed that the chairman and secretary should be dis<lb></lb>missed—Isupported the proposition, and as it was not opposed, I consider that he was dismissed—I did not, on behalf of the company, give him autho<lb></lb>rity to act for them after that date—he had no authority from me, or in behalf of the company, to order goods of Messrs. Rowsell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then there was no actual dismissal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no formal dismissal by resolution—Dr. Carr was one of our directors, I think he was represented at that meeting—I ceased to be a director after 8th May—Iconsider that the whole thing was dissolved—as far as I know, it ceased to exist after that meeting—I only know what was done up to that time.</p>

Bowsell, or anybody in particular, for books—before July, we authorized him to obtain stationery and books—I cannot say who was present, but four or five directors—Mr. Bernard was there, I believe, and Mr. Ferrand and Mr. Brooks—I did not see the prisoner for three or four weeks after the meeting at Maddock's—he did not say anything to me about being at Rowsell's—he told me, before May, that he had procured books—he did cot say a word to me about it after the meeting was over.</p>

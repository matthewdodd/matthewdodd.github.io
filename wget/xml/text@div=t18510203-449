                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mansueto Novati, of Saffron<lb></lb>hill. The prisoner was in our employ about two months—on 13th July, about half-past twelve o'clock at noon, my servant brought me in ten sovereigns, and put them on the bench in the shop by my side—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there—I told her to get me change for one of them, which she did—I then had to go to the street-door—the sovereigns were then on the kitchen-table—I had left the prisoner in the shop—while I was at the door, the baker brought the dinner, and the prisoner took it in and took it down in. the kitchen—he came up again, and walked through the shop, and up the street—I had before given him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to go on an errand for roe, and he said be would go in twenty minutes—when he went away he did not return—I missed the sovereigns in about an hour afterwards—I was at the door speaking to a gentleman about ten minutes—there was no one in my house but my three children and my servant and myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ash-street, Hoxton. I employed the prisoner to collect orders for me—I gave him thirty-seven ink-stands to use for patterns to take orders—he took them on the morning of the 10th of June, and was to return them at night, with any orders he might take, but I did not see him till Saturday morning, when I went to his lodgings and took a policeman with me—he had a letter written out, which his wife gave me—it stated he had made away with a few shillings, and he would make it up—he told me that he had sold the inkstands and wafer<lb></lb>seals, and other things, and appropriated the money to himself—I did not authorise him to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Did you not tell me, "Don't turn away money?" and on four or five occasions I have come home, and told you I could get no orders, but I could have sold the goods—and you said you would make up some goods for me to sell? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not authorise him to sell them, but he had sold several things on the preceding days—he had been only nine days with me—he had sold things, and I had taken the money, but I told him not to do it again—he could not consider that he was authorised to sell these—I allowed him goods at a certain price, and when he took them, I would charge him 20 per cent, under—if he had chosen to have taken more ink-stands, he might.</p>

I am an independent gentleman, living at Shepherd's Bush—No. 134, Bermondsey Street, belongs to me, and I let it to the prisoner Francis on lease last June, to carry on the business of a matting manufacturer—he occupied it till 20th November—no name was put up, and no business was carried on—I do not know Beavan—I got no rent, I saw no goods on the premises, and the place was not even furnished—I had to resort to extremities, and had to pay him out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of High Street, Borough—on, I think, 28th August Turner came there—I had not seen him before—he wanted some envelopes, with a die, and an address on them, which he wanted to look well for a respectable business—I showed him specimens and he selected one; the die was done, and five hundred envelopes—he also had five hundred envelopes plain, to go on with—"William Turner &amp; Co., 130, Bermondsey Street," was on them—he also looked at some ledgers, and ordered some of a peculiar sort, and had one to use till the other was ready—he also ordered some memoranda forms, headed "William Turner <hi rend="italic">&amp; Co.</hi>, drysalters, 130, Bermondsey Street. Ships'stores in bond or duty free"—he represented that he had another business, and as it was difficult to transact both, he thought of bringing the other business to Bermondsey Street, and he had "drysalters" struck out, and "wood, hoop, and timber merchants" put in instead; he also had the bottom line taken out, and it was stated at the time that the printing was to be paid for on delivery—he also ordered a quire of white blotting paper—he took away five hundred envelopes with him, and came afterwards and took further goods—I sent the goods home about 3rd September, but Mr. Turner was not at home—he</p>

I am now going to the bank, and as I come back I will call and give you a cheque"—he called two hours afterwards and said that he had been dis<lb></lb>appointed and had not sufficient there, but he had got a bill, and asked me if I would take it—I said "No, I don't take bills; it was to be a cash transaction"—he said "I don't ask you for any change; the acceptor, John Dixon, is a respectable acceptor, of 17, Granfield Street, Battersea, and I supplied him with goods a week or two ago"—I eventually took the bill, and afterwards supplied him with further goods to the amount of 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know Francis; he called on several occasions for goods for Turner, and he brought me a note purporting to be written by Turner—they once came together, and Francis said that he wanted two ledgers to be sent to Mr. Turner at Stroud; Tamer had said that he would send his man for the goods, and Francis afterwards came and I let him have goods to take away for Turner—I mentioned to Turner that Francis had had goods away for him, and he denied that he had sent him, and said that he got them on his own responsibility—Francis also introduced Mr. May (<hi rend="italic">See last case</hi>), who had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of goods, and brought a card with him, "which he showed to me in Francis' presence, who said that Mr. Turner had sent him round with Mr. May as a customer—I supplied him with a ledger, and then with another ledger—I have not been paid for any of those things—the total amount supplied to Turner and Francis was 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I presented Dixon's bill at the South-Western Bank, where it was made payable, but there was no account there and never had been, and it was dishonoured—I then went to Dixon's place, which was worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and a shoemaker was at work in the back parlour.</p>

Please deliver to bearer the remaining part of the timber, and be kind enough not to keep them wait<lb></lb>ing as yesterday. Bearer will sign receipt note for me.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MOODY</hi>. My foreman gave me a document pur<lb></lb>porting to be from Bucknell &amp; Moore—I did not afterwards sell the timber—if there is any left it is on my premises now, but I should think it is all worked up—I paid Mr. Turner for it—I had not previously consulted Buck<lb></lb>nell &amp; Moore, but they sent me a letter authorising me to pay Turner, and they were satisfied to get their money from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THIS JURY</hi>. It is the practice of the trade to buy goods in this way; for the last two months and for another month to come they bring up scores a week—I had seen Francis, but I had never seen Turner—this was for cash to take the goods at the door; we measure and find it correct, and then we pay.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Beavan's Defence.</hi> I took the place with the view of doing an upright' good business, which I should have been able to do if the police had no come down upon me, and I was obliged to give it up. I had no dishonour<lb></lb>able intention whatever. With regard to the bill, I gave it to Mr. Leightup in good faith. I had some timber coming from Horsham, and I sent it on to go on with. These things would have been paid for in a proper manner if I had not been suddenly stopped. I utterly protest against knowing anything at all of this firm. I called upon Mr. Moore several times, but could not see him; I only saw a boy, who said that he was in the country. I throw myself upon the merciful consideration of the Jury; and, whatever you say, I stand here as honourable a man as any of you.</p>

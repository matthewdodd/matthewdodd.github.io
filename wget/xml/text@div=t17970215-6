               <p>Q. How far is it from the Five Bells to where you live? - A. Not a mile; Mr. Firbin came out with me, and came across the street at Harmondsworth, and there he left me.</p>

About a quarter of a mile, or a little more, from where Firbin had left me; when I had got into the field, just before I got to what we call the cross-path, the church clock finished striking nine exactly as I got to the cross-path; I had not gone an hundred yards further before I was attacked; two persons appeared to be standing and waiting for me, they were standing quite still in the path that I was going;

             was one of those two persons? - A. Yes, he was; he took me by the breast, and repeated the words, your money, your money, two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150019"></xptr>times; I replied, my lad, perhaps you are in liquor, saying your money is a very serious thing, I will treat you with any thing you require to drink; after I had said that, I said to him, it is a very serious thing to say your money; he made me no answer; then I said, the other man, that was standing by him, whom I believe was Tomkins, knew him if I did not, and he would, perhaps, tell him of it another night when they sell out; immediately, upon which, Haynes struck me a very violent blow upon the side of my head, without speaking to me; the violence of the blow knocked me down, and knocked my hat off; as soon as I could recover my feet, I put my hand towards his breast, and said, my lad, the blow has hurt me very much; I desired him to say, upon his honour, he would not strike me any more, and I would believe him; the little money I had got was no object to me, and I would give it to him; I then gave him, out of my right-hand breeches-pocket, fourteen shillings and sixpence, which is the whole money I lost; he put his hand to the outside of my left-hand breeches-pocket, and I told him there was nothing there, I did not put money in that pocket, I had nothing but some small papers; Tomkins never spoke to me all the time that I know of, he stood three yards off, I believe, one part of the time; he then put his hand into my right-hand breeches-pocket, and searched to the bottom, and, I suppose, feeling for my mony felt my watch, for he got hold of the chain, and pulled it out; as he had hold of the chain, I caught hold of the watch; I said, my lad, don't take the watch, for it is an old silver watch, of no great value to you; he then said, he would have the watch; and, I think, he said by God; and in attempting to pull the watch out of my hand, he pulled the chain from the watch, and left the watch in my hand; I said, my lad, if you will have the watch take it, and then he took the watch from me; after that, I told him he would be sorry for taking the watch; I was afraid I had said too much; then he and Tomkins went away to a small distance from the path, upon the corn land, a few yards off, not ten; I then said, now, my lads, do find my hat for me, for it is the only hat I have got; they had knocked it off with the blow, and I saw no more of it till next day; I told them the blow has hurt me so much that I cannot see the hat, or you either; they made me no answer, nor did not come back to me, but went away across the common field, not in any road at all, across the corn land, to a place called Ash-lane, and I came along the foot-path home to my own house at Longford.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. What was your watch and chain? - A. A silver watch, by Rowe, and the chain steel.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak of Haynes positively? - A. Yes; I had known him from a child in petticoats; Tomkins I don't speak of positively, it was his size and appearance, but I did not remark his face; as he never spoke to me I did not pay any attention to his face; Tomkins has lived in that neighbourhood, I believe, all his life time; I suppose I have known him more than thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever the person was, did he stay with Haynes all the time he committed the robbery, and go off with him when it was completed? - A. Yes, the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this were these two men taken up? - A. The next afternoon; and they were examined before Mr. Bishop the next morning after, which was Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether what they said was taken down in writing? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You was in their company at the public house? - A. No; I never saw them till they stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this foot-way, where you were stopped, the way leading to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Also, the public foot-way from this village to the Bath road? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that you are very certain with respect to Haynes, that he was the person that stopped you, and demanded your money? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Haynes had been a long time living in that neighbourhood? - A. He was born in that neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore must have known you? - A. I believe they both agreed to rob me before I left the public house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I wish to know whether you don't think that Haynes knew you? - A. I know he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Then Haynes must have known you as a public man in that neighbourhoop? - A. I have told you so.</p>
               <p>Q. The other prisoner knew you? - A. Yes; I have paid him money many times for his work.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to say, notwithstanding this, that these men ventured to stop you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe these men afterwards, when they were taken the next day, were taken at the usual place where they had been at work? - A. No, they were not; Tomkins was taken at the same public-house where I was the night before, the Five Bells; my servant and the constable took him; I was there immediately after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the afternoon of the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore an entire day had elapsed? - A. Not entirely; and then my servant and the constable went and fetched the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150020"></xptr>Q. You mentioned before your neighbours, that you had been robbed? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have gone abroad in the neighbourhood from your report? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And notwithstanding this, the man was taken at the same public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been as positive to Haynes? - A. When Haynes was brought into the public-house, I looked in his face, and said, I did not want any further proof, and I told the constable and my servant, to take Haynes to Longford, that they might not be together; they were both then at the Five Bells; I ordered my servant to come back, after he had taken him to Longford, and see me safe home, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, when you made this observation, that you required no more of him than to look in his face, it was after he was brought in in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned to any body, previous to this time, that Haynes was the man that robbed you till you had seen him? - A. I had been to Mr. Bishop, and sworn that he was, and he granted a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, the information you gave to Bishop, was, that Haynes and another man had been at a public-house where you was, and therefore you believed he had robbed you? - A. I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You called upon the prisoner after he was in custody at the watch-house? - A. I never knew he was in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he kept in custody, before he was brought to the Magistrates? - A. He was taken to the White Horse at Longford.</p>
               <p>Q. You called upon him there, I believe? - A. Only once; I went down with my man to see that he was safe, he was then in the custody of the constable, that was the evening he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only purpose you went for, to see that he was safe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go for the purpose of any conversation with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this? - A. Immediately after the clock struck nine.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, at that time it was dark? - A. It was darkish.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, before the Magistrates, it was so dark, you could not see a yard before you? - A. I never said so at all.</p>
               <p>Q. May I ask, whether you had been dining in company? - A. I don't know that I had been dining at all that day, I went from my own house about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not dined that day? - A. I had, most likely, I had not been from home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you recollect whether you had dined that day, or not? - A. Most likely I had of course, at home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Then if I ask you, if you were at any parish feast that day, of course you will tell me you were not? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at this public-house? - A. Perhaps it might have been two hours, not three.</p>
               <p>Q. How might you have been employed during the time at that public-house? - A. Smoaking my pipe, and drinking some ale, and some rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Then three hours were employed in smoaking, and drinking ale, and rum and water? - A. Not three hours, it was more than two.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went from the house, you did not observe any body going before you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from the house, before you met with the persons that robbed you? - A. A little more than a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time, I believe, that you met them, they were coming towards you? - A. Did not I tell you they were standing still; I did not see them move at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I beg you will answer me decently, Sir, - you advanced towards them, they did not come towards you? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently, they were not going from the same house where you had been? - A. That was the first time I had seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean again to say, though you don't recollect having seen them before, that that man Haynes was one of the men that stopped you? - A. I say he did stop me, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them at the time, Haynes I know who you are, you had better not rob me? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You rather said somewhat at the time, tending to shew, that you did not know him? - A. I said, the man that stands by you, knows you, if I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were you the least disguised in liquor? - A. As sober as I am now, and as recollecting.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. Darkish; a few stars, but no moon, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you, of observing the person of Haynes? - A. While I was asking him several times, upon his honour not to strike me again, I had a very particular view of his eyes and nose; I saw them very distinctly, they were very remarkable.</p>
               <p>Q. Close to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of hat had he on? - A. I did not take particular notice of his hat; he had a handkerchief round the lower part of his face, which appeared to be a light coloured pocket handkerchief.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150021"></xptr>Q. Whether it was a cocked hat or not, you cannot tell? - A. No, my attention was called particularly to his eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it then from the observation of his eyes, that you speak? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from nothing else? - A. That in particular; he appeared to have a light coloured swan-skin waistcoat on, or a flannel waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe any other of his features? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And is it from that circumstance only, the observation of his eyes, that you speak now to his person? - A. Most particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. But knowing this man's life is at stake, you undertake to swear that that man was Haynes, with whom you have been so long acquainted? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that you knew him at the time of the robbery? - A. I did not say, that I exactly knew him, at the time of doing the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, at the time of the robbery, you did not know that he was Haynes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the observation you made upon his eyes, was not sufficient to bring to your recollection this old acquaintance? - A. I have known him from a child, and I saw the eyes sufficient to know that I had seen them before; but I did not recollect at that time, whose they were; his eye-brows are remarkably low, they are very particular.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not, from the observation of those eyes, at all then form your judgment who it was? - A. No; I could not recollect him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What has made you so positive since, that Haynes was the man? - A. I could recollect, before I was at Mr. Bishop's, in a great measure, whose face it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Your going to Mr. Bishop's, was the next day? - A. The next morning.</p>

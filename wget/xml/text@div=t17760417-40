I saw the prisoner near me all the way as I was going into the pit; I mistrusted him once he was so near me, that I thought he was attempting my watch, and I put my hand down two or three times.</p>

               <p>I am constable for Covent Garden theatre: upon Saturday the 13th of April several gentlemen said they had had their pockets picked at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177604170028"></xptr> the pit door; I went there and took the prisoner upon suspicion, at the pit door towards Bow-street.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Which door did you go in at? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>SMALLWOOD. The prisoner had a purse in his hand; he held it very fast and struggled a long time before I could get it from him: the purse was torn in two in the struggle; I have the part that had the money in it; there were twelve guineas and three half guineas; I secured the prisoner and took him to the office, then I went into the pit and asked if any body had been robbed; the prosecutor came out and said he had lost a purse, and described its contents.</p>
               <p>[Part of a purse produced in court.]</p>
               <p>FARNHAM. One of the half guineas is light; I know it by its being turned up at one edge, and a little defaced. This appears to be part of my purse.</p>

             cross examined.</p>
               <p>You had not put any particular mark of your own upon the half guinea. - No: I lost my money within a yard of the pit door; he must have taken my money while I was paying at the pit door, for I had my hand upon it before.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take your purse out of your pocket when you paid your money? - No: I had silver in my waistcoat pocket; my purse was in my right hand breeches pocket.</p>

             that the purse he lost was a whole purse.</p>
               <p>SMALLWOOD. I had a great struggle with him when I perceived it in his hand; I could not for some time get it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you pull it in two? - I believe I did; I held him by the collar; he had the purse in his right hand; I said you have got something there, I will have it; he would not give it me; with some other people that came to my assistance I got the purse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you lay hold of the purse he having hold of the other end? - Yes; and by degrees got his fingers open: I got hold of one end of the purse, he of the other, and we pulled till I got that part of it away. I did not look for the other part.</p>

I live at I, Sheppey Yard, Minories—on the night of 8th July I was talking to the landlord of the "Globe," and the prisoner walked through into the parlour—he afterwards struck a man and split his lip—Mr. May got him out quietly, but he returned and wanted to come in again—Mr. May would not let him—he struck Mr. May with a knife over the shoulder of a young man who was there—I saw the point of the knife projecting from the prisoner's hand as he came up—he threw the knife down and ran away—I ran after him—he had had a little drink, and fell on his hands and face and hurt himself—I held him down till a constable took him—I saw blood running from Mr. May's cheek.</p>

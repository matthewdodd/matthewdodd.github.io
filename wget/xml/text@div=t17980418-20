             sworn. - I am porter to Mr. Thomas Ellis: On the 19th of March, Mr. Ellis had a sale, <placeName id="t17980418-20-crimeloc92">No. 4, Berry-court, St. Mary Axe</placeName>

(Produces the curtain.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Whose curtains were they? - A.Arnold Harvey's.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner, you know, is a broker? - A. No, I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. He took his hat off, while he was in the house, did not he? - A. I do not know that he did, till I took it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Brokers play tricks with each other frequently, do they not? - A.Sometimes.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LOWE sworn. - On the 19th of March, the prisoner came into the drawing-room where I was, and asked for a catalogue, he then went out of the sale-room into the back room, from thence he went up stairs; James Legge was up stairs, there was nobody there, I believe, at that time but him and James Legge; he went out, and Legge followed him almost directly; he brought him back, and searched him, he pulled off his hat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180021"></xptr>and there was the curtain. I went and fetched a constable, and he was delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you never see the brokers play tricks with each other? - A. No; I do not know that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this can be called a curtain it must be sewed together? - A. It wants tacking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it is not a bad curtain? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ARNOLD HARVEY sworn. - This curtain is mine, I lost the fellow to it from the same house just before; it is a window curtain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Will you swear it is a window-curtain? - A. Yes, I will; beyond all doubt it is a window-curtain. I have been a broker these twenty years, I ought to know what belongs to a window-curtain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the fact.</p>

               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>JANE CROUCHER. Q. I believe you reside at Brompton. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 3d of December did you see the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, a little of this side of Hyde Park corner; I do not know where he came from; I was going into the city; he accosted me, he said he was surprised at the improvements in town, or the buildings, I cannot say which, but it was one of them; he said he had not been in town for seven years, that he had a son lived in Broad-street, No. 15, he kept a grocer's shop; as for his part he would not live in the city if any body would give him a house to live in. He walked on one side of me till we came opposite of a house (we were in Piccadilly); he asked me whose that was, I said I believed it belonged to the Ranger of the park; he then stooped down and took up a parcel; I immediately said I wish the right owner had it; he replied, so do I; he said, if I had not picked it up somebody else would. He was going to put it in his pocket; I said I should like to know what it contained, as I thought it might be the means of the right owner coming to the property; he said he would go to a private place and examine it; then he said we may as well go into the Green Park; we were standing on that side. He went in, and went to the third bench; he opened the parcel, he took off the brown paper, and there was a red morocco pocket book; he opened the pocket book, it contained a diamond cross. At this time there was a stranger going by; the prisoner accosted this stranger and desired him to read this paper -</p>
               <p>'a diamond cross, one hundred pounds ten shillings' - I then proposed to him to find out the right owner; this stranger said, madam, that would be very wrong, some person or other would own it that it did not belong to, it would be in the paper the next morning. Then the stranger proposed that he should leave some property in my hands, either thirty or forty pounds. I replied whatever you leave in my hands shall be safe. The prisoner at the same time said there was a man in Pall Mall that had fifty pounds of his money, and he would go and get the sum. He took me to a room in a public house, I think in <placeName id="t18080113-68-crimeloc412">Duke-street, St. James's</placeName>

The prisoner said your will be sure to deliver up the cross-tomorrow, when I come at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them your address. - A. Yes, and they gave me their address; the prisoner wrote his address, 15, Bird-street, and the stranger gave his address, 17, John-street, Westminster. They seemed so fair I had no idea what they were about. The stranger desired I would carry it home and lock it up before I went into the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the stranger since. - A. No. On the evening of the next day I went to Bow-street office and gave information; the magistrate was kind enough to speak to me although I went after the office hours were over. The officer said if the lady is not afraid of trusting herself with me, he would take me to a public house in Leicester Fields where I might see him. I saw him near the Ship in Leicester Fields; he was walking fast along the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the prisoner. - A. Yes, I have no doubt of his person; I thought he was an honest country farmer; the watch and the five pound note the officer has; it was produced at Bow street.</p>

            . Q. You belong to the office in Bow-street. - A. I do. In consequence of information I went with Mrs. Croucher to Leicester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before. - A. I never saw him before in my life. I was going through Leicester Fields, he was walking just before me; I saw the lady up with her arms, I catched hold of the prisoner at the bar; he looked round and said, I know what the lady wants is her gold watch again; I said to him I have got what I want at present, you shall go with me; he said, I dare say if the lady gets her gold watch again she will be satisfied; I replied, I do not know that she will, there is a five pound note besides; he said if I would let him go, I will take you to a man who has the duplicate of the watch, it is in pawn; he did not tell where. Going along the prison kept talking to the lady; I told the lady not to talk to him, but to go on before. I took him to the

I found the watch afterwards at Mr. Benton's, a pawnbroker in Holborn; Mr. Benton denied at first the watch being there. I went the third time before he gave up the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is it in Holborn. - A. It is the corner of a court that goes into Lincoln's Inn Fields; the watch was delivered up at Bow-street, and the five pound note I found upon Owen.</p>

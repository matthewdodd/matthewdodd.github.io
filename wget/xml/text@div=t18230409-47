The prisoner came to me one Thursday night, having left her place, and I let her lodge with me; she stopped nearly five weeks, and slept in the same bed, and occupied the same room as myself While she was with me, my son gave me 6 l. to take care of - the prisoner did not know it. There were three sovereigns, some crown pieces, and half a crown. I took out my drawer, and put the money behind it, and put the drawer in again - it was wrapped up in a silk handkerchief - the drawer would shut close with it there. I did not lock it, as I had no key. This was about three weeks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090026"></xptr>before she left. I went out every day to work - I left her in the room. I was sometimes absent all day. I did not look for the money until my son spoke to me about it. She had then been gone away to her place nine days - we missed the money, and had her taken the next day.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on the 8th of April, at No. 28, George-street, Manchester-square, where she was in service. She opened the door, and I said, I wanted to speak to her, about some money lost by the prosecutor, at No. 12, Circus-street. She said, she knew nothing at all about it - she had the newspaper in her hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I must go up to my mistress, for she is very ill a bed." I said,</p>
               <p>"Are there no other servants in the house." She said,</p>
               <p>"No." I allowed her to go up stairs; I stopped in the passage; she came down in two or three minutes, with a water bottle, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am going to get some water for my mistress." She went down, and stopped longer than I thought necessary; and when she came up, I asked her what had made her so long. See said, she had been filling the kettle. I then went down stairs with her in the front area, and found some wearing apparel, quite new, thrown there behind an empty beer cask. I said.</p>
               <p>"This is what made you stay so long down stairs." She said, she was very sorry for it; and, if I would accompany her to her friends, she would make the money good, - I had neither promised nor threatened her. The wearing apparel consisted of a bonnet, silk scarf, bombazeen and cotton gown, and some muslin. I asked her where the rest of the money was. She said, she had laid it out in those things; and she mentioned the prices of the different things, which came to above 5 l. Her box stood in the kitchen, with the key in it, but I found nothing there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix is a false woman; she first encouraged me to rob my father's house, and then to leave it; and, because I would not consent to what she wished, she has prosecuted me.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave her a good character.</p>

Lizzard and Co."—Mr. Lizzard banks with us in the name of "Edward Lizzard"—I knew that it was not his writing, directly I looked at it, and asked the prisoner where Mr. Lizzard lived, as I thought there might be another E. Lizzard in London—he said, "11, Moorgate-street," which is the address of our customer—I asked him if he had seen anybody endorse it—he said, "No, but it was done by one of the firm"—Mr. Liz<lb></lb>zard lives at Webster's, a confectioner's shop in Moorgate-street—I asked the prisoner whether it was a confectioner's shop, and he said that he did not know—there is this peculiarity in going up stairs to Mr. Lizzard's, that the confectionery smells remarkably strong, and anybody must be aware that it is a confectioner's shop—I showed the order to the chief clerk, went back to the prisoner, and asked him where he got it from—he said that he met a man that morning, either in a public-house or in the street, who had engaged him as clerk, and who sent him on in a cab to get it cashed, and he was to meet him in Threadneedle-street; I fancy he meant the Bishopgate-street end, which would be about two minutes' walk off—I took him in to the chief clerk—an officer was sent for at the same time, and Russell came.</p>

I am a detective-officer of the City—on 9th July, about 1 o'clock, I was called to the London and Westminster Bank, Loth<lb></lb>bury, and saw the prisoner—I showed him this draft, and asked if he presented it for payment; he said, "Yes"—I asked him his name; he said, "James McDonald," and that he lived at 28, Wootton-street, Lambeth, and was a jewel-case maker—I told him I was a police-officer, and asked him how he became possessed of the draft—he said that he met a man at the Cross Keys, Black friars-road, who asked him to go and get it cashed, and meet him in Threadneedle-street in half an hour, and promised him partial employment—I said, "It is about half an hour now, and you had better go and see if you can find the man—I told him to walk straight, and never mind me, and not take the slightest notice of me—he walked to the Bishopsgate-street end of Threadneedle-street, came back to me, and said, "I cannot see him; "he then turned back, and again said, "I cannot see him"—I said, "You should not speak to me, that is very wrong of you; go and see if you can see the man"—he went two or three yards, came back to me, and said, "It is no use; it is an hour ago now, and when I left him he was opposite," pointing to the end of Bishopsgate-street—just at that time Nicks, the porter of the bank, came over, and said, "It is no use going any further; he has <hi rend="italic">given the office</hi> to somebody; he has made a motion to somebody"—the prisoner said nothing to that—I told him I was not at all satisfied, he must come back to the bank with me—my attention was devoted to the prisoner's not getting away, and there were a good many people there, so that Nicks had a better opportunity of seeing the sign than I had—I took the prisoner to the bank, and then to the station—I went to 28, Wootton-street, and found that his father lived there, but that the prisoner had left home four or five years—I went to 11, Brad-street, Cornwall-road, and found there several letters addressed to the prisoner—the landlord is here.</p>

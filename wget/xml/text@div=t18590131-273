I am landlord of the Lord Nelson public-house—on the night of 13th January, I saw Barber and the prisoner at my house about twenty minutes past 6—there were five of them together, four dock officers and Barber, all in front of the bar—I left the bar in charge of my wife for about three quarters of an hour, and when I returned, I saw Barber take his waistcoat off and put it on the floor—the prisoner picked it up and held it for some time, and then Barber put it on again—after a few minutes he took it off again, walked into the taproom, and laid it down there—I desired the parties to bring it to me, which they did—soon afterwards, they all left the house—in consequence of something my brother" told me, I went off immediately to the constable Cliff—(my brother had taken Barber home), Cliff came, and I gave him information—I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Barber's in my possession—he did not appear to be in a, fit state to take care of it—he laid his purse down on the counter, and I thought it would be better for me to take it, as he lived only two doors off—I put the money out on the counter, so that the persons who were there should see what there was—I restored it to him as soon as he was in a fit state to take it.</p>

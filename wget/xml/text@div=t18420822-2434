I was drinking at the White Hart, on the evening of the 15th of August—I went there again the next morning—I drank part of a pint of beer—I could not be sure of the prisoners, but I believe I saw them at the White Hart that morning—I had my money when I went in the morning, and I afterwards missed it. <hi rend="italic">Wood.

I saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor come to the house about a quarter past five o'clock, on the morning of the 16th of August—the two prisoners had been there half-an hour before, and they were there when he care—he had another person with him—he called for a pint of ale, and paid for it—either he or his friend gave a glass of ale to the prisoners—the prosecutor then sat down, Brown sat next to him, and Wood next to Brown—I saw Brown put one of her hands into his right hand pocket, and she placed her other arm round his neck—she took something out of his pocket, but I could not see what—she then nudged Wood, who put her hand under her apron—Brown put her hand behind her, and passed something to her—the prisoners then went out—my master followed, and they were taken.</p>

               <p>FRANCES HOWELL. I am the wife of John Howell, who lives in Waterloo-town, Bethnal-green. On the 18th of July, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night, (my husband had lately returned from sea, and spent a good deal of money) I went to look for him, as he had been absent a night and a day - as I came up Brick-lane, to the corner of Phoenix-street, about a dozen men stood there; Davis, who was with me, happened to slip; I stooped down to pick her up, and a person came up and asked me to treat him with drink - the prisoner is very much like that person, and I believe him to be the man, but I have since seen a person very much like the prisoner; he followed me down Hare-street - we went into a public-house and had some drink together - as I crossed the fields a tall man stood with his back towards us, and his hands before his face; as I passed him the person who I believe to be the prisoner, shoved me round; I felt my pocket go from me as I fell - it was tied round me; they both ran away - I was too much alarmed to call out. The prisoner was taken in about a month; it was done in a darkish place, and I cannot be certain he is the man. I had seen a person like the prisoner many times before.</p>

On Saturday the 28th of February, the prisoner came into the shop for two pound weight of wax candles for lady Chambers; I replied we had not the pleasure of serving the lady a long time; he said no, he knew we had not. I asked him what size they were to be; he said sixes, and set them down. I then set them down, and by his ready reply I let him have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have let him have them if you had not thought he came from lady Chambers. - A. No, I thought I had done wrong; I followed him till he had gone past lady Chambers's house in Mortimer-street, then I took him by the collar and demanded the candles; he gave them me. I told him he must go back with me, he said he would not; we scuffled, and he got from me; he run back towards Cavendish-square, he fell over a child; we there scuffled, he got from me again; I at last took him back to the shop.</p>

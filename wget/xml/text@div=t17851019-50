               <p>Last Friday was a week I bought a buckle of the prisoner Conolly; I am a watch-maker and silversmith, I am sure it was the prisoner, I did not know her before.</p>
               <p>What buckle is it? - A silver buckle; on the Thursday night, I bought it on the 13th.</p>
               <p>Court to Haris. What time did you buy it? - About seven.</p>
               <p>Recollect the time as well as you can? - It was some where about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Stokes. I missed my buckle between seven and eight, I missed it instantly.</p>
               <p>What was you drinking? - Part of a pot of ale.</p>
               <p>Harris. The prisoner Conolly came to me to know if I could make a fellow to that buckle by Saturday night, I told her it was impossible; I live a quarter of a mile off; I told her it would come to thirteen shillings; the prisoners were both in company, I would not buy it the first time they came, and they came again, and a young man with them, and said, I had no occasion to fear, for he gave them the buckle.</p>
               <p>(The buckle produced, and the fellow of it by the prosecutrix)</p>
               <p>PRISONER CONOLLY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming out of the house, and I kicked the buckle and shoe before me, and this young woman followed me, and we went and sold it about half an hour after, I asked twice whose buckle it was, and nobody owned it, so then I went out of the house.</p>

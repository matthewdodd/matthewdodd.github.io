                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 102). On 22d Feb. I went into Mr. Redshaw's coach-house at Barnes, about ten o'clock at night—there was a horse and cart standing in the yard—I saw Cooke, who is his carter, come from the road—he took an empty nose-bag from the horse's note, took it into the stable, and filled it with corn, and put it up into Nicholl's cart—Nicholls came in while Cooke was getting down from the cart—a conversation took place between them, which I did not hear—after that, Nicholls took the horse by the head, turned him round, and they both went out of the yard together into the road—I went and stopped them—I asked Cooke if he had been deal<lb></lb>ing with Nicholls for corn—he said, no, he knew nothing of any corn—I be<lb></lb>lieve Nicholls deals in hay and corn—I got into the cart, and saw the beans in the bag which I had seen Cooke put into the cart—it was in the bottom of the cart, against the front, and covered over with hay—I asked Nicholls how the beans came there—he said they were beans he had brought in the morning—I had a light in my hand—I showed him the beans, and then took the prisoners into custody—I went back to Mr. Redshaw's stable—I saw part of a sack of beans there—in my judgment they corresponded with those in the nose-bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Mortlake. I have a stable at Barnes—I have not been in it for a month myself—I do not know whether the sack of beans belonged to me or not: I leave all that to Cooke, who is my carter—the stable that the policeman pointed out to me is mine—I saw a sack of beans, but not in that stable; they were in the adjoining</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184902260150"></xptr>
               <p>stable—it was the carter's fancy to have the beans there—whether he pays the rent for it, or I have to pay it, I do not know—I suppose the beans he would have there would be mine—I never gave him any authority to let any one have any beans—Nicholls hat supplied me with hay, the last eighteen months—he did not supply me with any corn—I met him at the White Hart between nine and ten o'clock in the morning on 22d Feb,—he said he had some hay coming if I required any that day—I said I would see the carter—I did not quite buy the hay, but it did come, and was put into my stable—if he considered that buying, I should consider it the same—I have not seen the hay at all—I said I would not buy it till I saw it, but he left it.</p>

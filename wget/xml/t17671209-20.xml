Between five and six o'clock I went down to Mr. Green's boat, to ask if it was stood; I found he had just lost a bottle of oil; I was at the finding it in the punt, where the prisoner Hoare was; when Mr. Green was for taking Hoare away, Edwards came and swore the boy should not be taken away, and offered to strike Mr. Green.</p>

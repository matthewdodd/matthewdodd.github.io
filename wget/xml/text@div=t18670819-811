                  </hi> I am a butcher, in Well Street, Hackney—between twelve and one o'clock on the morning of the 14th July I missed three sheep, worth seven guineas—I have seen their skins since.</p>

I saw the two prisoners about a quarter-past one on the 14th July in front of Hackney Terrace—they had a horse and cart, but were standing still—Johnson was in the crescent, and Watson stood by the side of the cart—I went towards them, and when very close to them Watson jumped on to the cart and drove off as fast as he could—Johnson went across the crescent and jumped over on the other side—I lost sight of them, and then went back and found some sheep—I</p>

From information I received on the 14th I went to some premises under one of the arches of the North London Railway—they are in the occupation of the two prisoners—they were not there tlie—I caused a watch to be placed on those premises, and about eleven o'clock the prisoners were taken into custody and brought to the station—I afterwards went back to the premises and found in the stable the carcases of three sheep—they were skinned and dressed, and ready to be taken away—the skins were found at Walthamstow the next morning—I also found on the premises a horse and light cart, and in a small room which had been used as a bedroom ten knives, two of which were covered with blood—the cart that brought the sheep away from the shed on the Saturday night was Mr. Tyler's.</p>

From instructions I received I went to the premises mentioned by the last witness—about a quarter-past eleven on the Saturday night I saw the prisoners in the yeti—they went into the stable, came out, and locked the door—I said to Watson, "Are you master here? "—he said, "Yes; don't make a noise out here"—I went into the yard and said, "Give me the key of the stable; I want to look in your stable"—Watson said, "I left it in the lock, outside the gate"—I said, "I shall break open the door if you don't give me the key"—I said to both of them, "Have you anything in there, before I go in? "—Watson said, "I shall decline to answer any questions at present—I then broke open the door and found three sheep hanging in the stable—I asked whether they could give any account of the sheep—Watson said, "I shall decline to answer any further questions at present"—I asked Johnson, and he said, "No"—I then told them they would to charged with stealing Mr. Tyler's sheep, and I should take them into custody, and they said, "Very well"—I afterwards went to Mr. Tyler, and toe identified the carcases in my presence, and in the presence of other butchers, from certain marks that were on the inside of the skin—I noticed the marks on the skins that Mr. Tyler refers to—we compared the insides of the skins with the carcases, and I can positively swear that they corresponded—I found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Johnson, and two keys; one of the keys opened the stable door.</p>

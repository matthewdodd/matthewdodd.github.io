               <p>Q. Did you miss any of your property from your house on the 30th of December last. - A. Yes, I lost a ten pound note, from my tea chest; I had seen it there the day before; I remember turning the key of the lock, but I did not try to see if it was locked; I left it in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other notes in the chest. - A. I had two tens, besides the one I speak of; a five and some other small notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you perceive that one of your notes were missing. - A. On Wednesday the 30th, about four or five o'clock; I found my tea chest open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count all the notes that were in the tea chest when you opened it between four and five o'clock on the Tuesday. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that one out of the number of the ten pound notes was missing. - A. I am sure that one of the ten pound notes were missing, and likewise a one, I believe but I will not swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a ten pounds bank of England note. - A. It was; the prisoner was my <rs id="t18080113-4-deflabel22" type="occupation">errand boy</rs>

               <p>Q. When did he leave you. - A. He left me about the time that I missed the note, within half an hour of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether before or after you do not recollect. - A I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand before that that he was to leave your service. - A. He did not tell me that he was going to quit my service, nor did I suspect him till the following morning; he went away about four o'clock instead of eight in the evening; his usual hour to come in the morning was eight, he did not come, and at ten o'clock the next morning I went to his father's house; I asked his father where his son was, he told me he went out as usual to go to my place; on the following day the father brought him to me; I found no notes in his possession; only eighteen pence was in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tea chest ever taken out of the house before you missed the note. - A. No, it remained in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is the boy. - A.(Prisoner.) I am fourteen.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street office; I and Warner took the prisoner in his master's shop, on the 1st of January; we found no notes upon him; he was searched by Warren, he found nothing but eighteen pence on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him. - A. Yes, in his master's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the master present. - A. I do not remember that he was.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any body present but you and Warren. - A.None else, as I know of. We accused him of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to tell if he did the act. - A. No, we just asked him if he knew any thing of the robbery; he said, that he had taken the ten pound note, that a helper belonging to Mr. Verney's yard gave him the keys to open the chest, and he gave him the ten pound note; at the second examination before the magistrate, he said he changed the ten pound note with Mr. Strachn, in Swallow-street; Mr. Strachn was sent for, he swore before Mr. Brodie that he never saw the boy; the next time he was examined, he said he had tore it to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send to the helper. - A. The helper was taken up and discharged on the second examination; there was nothing found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The man told me if I would tell him that he had the note, he would acquit me directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you so. - A. Warren.</p>
               <p>Q. to Kennedy. Did you hear that. - A. No, I did not.</p>

            . I took the boy backwards into the palour; the boy confessed to me that he had the ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. He says that you told him if he would produce the ten pound note you would acquit him. - A. No such a thing, I never promised nor threatened him; he said, that he had certainly robbed his master of a ten pound note and a one pound note; he shewed me the tea chest; he said out of that, I took out the ten pound note and the one pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He told me that if I would say I had the ten pound note he would acquit me; and being frightened, I said I had the note; I did not know who to bring in that had it of me. On the night I left my master they were all merry making; I left the shop before my usual time; I was afraid of coming to the shop in the morning; I went down to Mr. Porter. My father told me to go back to my master; I went back along with my father to my masters shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, the prisoner had an opportunity of taking the note, if he had been so disposed; and instead of staying at his master's shop till eight o'clock on that evening, his usual hour, he went away about four o'clock, and did not return till his father brought him back to his master's shop; that is the part of the evidence which presses mostly upon him; he has varied in the account he gave before the magistrate; you have heard his defence. If you are of opinion that he stole the note you will find him guilty; on the other other hand, the note not being found upon him, nor traced to the hands of any person; if you are not sufficiently satisfied that he stole the note you will then acquit him.</p>

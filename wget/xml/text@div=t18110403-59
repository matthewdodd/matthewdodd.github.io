            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I took the prisoner in custody on Saturday evening last, at the shop of Mr. Burnell in the Strand, near ten o'clock at night; she had no pockets, in her bosom I found two shillings, and sixpennyworth of halfpence; I then asked her if the direction she wrote on the back of the note was correct; she then said it was not, she lived at No. 12, Snow's-fields, in the Borough; I asked her how she came so far, or some such question: she said that she had been or was going to some friend in Northumberland-court, and that she thought it better to give that direction, which was so much nearer, than the one that she really lived at. I asked her if she was a married woman; she said she was not, but she lived with a person of the name of Smith, she went as his wife, but she was not married to him. On the Monday morning I went to this house in Snow's-fields, No. 12, on searching it there appeared to be in a room at the back of the shop, better than a quarter of a pound of tea, and about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030035"></xptr>pound of moist sugar. It is a kind of a chandler's shop, where they sell bread, butter, and cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other tea and sugar than that you have described - A. None, whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When you went to Snow's fields you there saw a parcel of tea, and a poor man there, and children - A. Yes, there were three children. I received the bill of Mr. Burnell, he indorsed it in my presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The tea and sugar for which the note was given was different tea and sugar to that - A. That I never saw.</p>

               <p>Q Look at that note, and see if that is the note she offered to you - A. It is. I asked her what her name was, she told me Brown; I then wrote Mrs. Brown on it. I am sure it the note that I received from her.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no knowledge of the hand-writing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Clark. The hand-writing on the front of the note Mrs. Brown was written by you Mrs. Clark - A. Yes, at the time I took it I thought it was bad, but I was not certain. I wrote that before I gave her the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write upon any other note the name of Brown - A. No, not exactly at that time. I did not put it out of my hand until I wrote the name of Brown upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Attend to my question - you have wrote the name of Brown upon other notes, have not you, it is a common name - A. I do not know that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with this note after you had written Brown upon it - A. I put it along with other notes I had in the house to send to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said at the time you took it you thought it was bad - A. I did.</p>

            . I live at No. 12, Meeting-house Walk, Snows Fields. The woman at the bar lived with me as my wife, she has four small children; I keep a chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect her being taken in custody on Saturday night on this charge of forgery - A. Yes. On the Saturday night I took the baby in a blanket to her in Bow-street, because a friend came forward. I gave her the note, I took it in the shop for a loaf of bread, a bit of cheese and bacon; I gave her the note and told her to buy meat, sugar, and tea, and what we wanted, and on Monday I came forward at Bow-street and said I gave her the note. I thought if there was any danger I would take it all upon myself. I gave the officer leave to search my premises. The sugar and tea was not brought home; on the Sunday morning I had none, I said to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18110403-59-person589">Gunn</persName>
             I'had no tea and sugar; he said he had some, I was welcome to it, he furnished me with some. I lived in Northumberland-court near seven years, she had a brother a coalmerchant that lived in Northumberland-street. Northumberland-street and Northumberland-court are connected together; the prisoner was well known there as the sister of Mr. Dell.</p>

               <p>Q. After she and you came to live together how long did you live in Northumberland-court with her - A. Near seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it that you lived in Northumberland-court - A. More than two years.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at Bow-street were you in custody - A. I was no otherways in custody; I went forward myself, I waited to see if they had got any thing against me. I was ready, and then I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Clark and Mrs. Warner - A. I saw that lady to-day in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. In the Lord Mayor's parlour - A. I do not know the name of the room. I saw them under the roof of this court; I went in along with the prisoner's sister, I asked them if they knew this woman; they said they did not know much of this woman; I said it was a hard matter to swear a thing unless they were sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken now did not you take the prisoner's sister into the Lord Mayor's parlour, where the bank witnesses were, in hopes that they would be able to say they were one like the other - A. I did not take the sister, she was against the door at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the object - A. It was not. Mr. Bellis was in there, and I went in to speak to him; Mr. Bellis called me of one side, he asked me to speak the truth if I knew any thing. I said I was an innocent man, I knew nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Mr. Bellis is the attorney of the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was in the Lord Mayor's parlour - did you see him there - A. He was in one of the rooms. He is the solicitor for the prisoner; he said, if I knew any thing against the prisoner to speak the truth, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. And all that did pass from you to these women was you asking them whether they knew the sister before or not - A. I said, do you know this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she pretty much about her age - A. No, she is older; I asked them if they knew this face.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was your reason for asking them if they knew this face, is it like the prisoner's - A. No, not exactly. I did not know there was any harm of it.</p>

            . Q. It has been said that you were in the parlour where we go to, you came to make some communication - A. Yes. After having heard the opinion of the learned gentleman, Mr. Alley, who has the charge of defending this case, I felt it my duty to acquaint Smith, he being the nearest person affected with the prisoner, I told him the learned gentleman advised her to plead guilty of the lesser offence, and in consideration of that the Bank would new her lenity, that application was refused, both by Smith and by the prisoner; the prisoner said, I cannot plead guilty to that which I know myself innocent of.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

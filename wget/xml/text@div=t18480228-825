                  </hi> I live at Fan's-place, Fulham. On 21st. Feb., about ten o'clock in the evening, I was crossing Hyde-park with James Young, and saw the prisoners with a gang under a tree, about twenty yards from the path—the prisoners came up to us—they attacked Young, wanted his money, knocked his hat off, and kicked it about—Miles said, "Money we want, and money we will have"—I said they would have none from me—Miles struck me on the nose, put his hand into my pocket, took my handkerchief, put it into his jacket pocket, and they ran away together—my nose bled—we ran after the prisoners, and never lost sight of them—a policeman took them—we gave them in charge—my handkerchief has not been found.</p>

                  </hi> I was with Pollard crossing the park—there was gang of about fifty boys under a tree—the prisoners came forward—a party struck me—he got away—my hat was knocked off—both the prisoner's kicked it—I did not see Pollard struck—turned round and saw the prisoners just going from him.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner call out to you? - No, Sir, he never saw me, I believe; I only observed he had a large nosegay in his hand; a person called to me, and I turned, and the horses were within four yards of me; I did not think they were so near; I did not see the accident; I was in a shop when it happened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you know the deceased gentlemen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was a very old man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Extremely deaf? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I have heard he was so deaf, that if a gun had been discharged at his ear, he would not have heard it? - I do not know that; I never spoke to him in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. You said, this was a pretty wide road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any foot path on either side, and on which side? - Yes, on the right hand, where I was.</p>
               <p>Was there any path on the other side of the road? - Yes, where the gentleman was.</p>
               <p>Did the accident happen after you went into this shop? - It happened while I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>How wide was the horse-road, at the place where you left the dray? - It was pretty wide; very wide; about two carriages might go.</p>
               <p>When you left the road, was there any people in the road? - I saw nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Were there any other horses in carriages? - No, I did not see one.</p>
               <p>The dray was going the same way you was going? - No, I met the dray.</p>
               <p>Did you look after it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see any people in the road, in the way you was going? - I met the gentleman about three minutes before I saw the dray.</p>
               <p>Was he in the horse road, or in the foot road? - He was in no path at all; he was just against the side of the horse road, on one side.</p>
               <p>Not in the patside? - When I met the dray there was a path on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Was the gentleman going the same way as the dray was? - Yes, he was.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labouring man; on Whit-Monday, the 24th of May, at Lampton, I was wheeling a barrow to London towards my own house, and I saw the deceased, about eighteen yards from the place where the accident happened, and about thirteen yards off, on the right hand, the dray came by me; the dray was on the trot.</p>
               <p>A slow or a fast trot? - I did not mind; the prisoner was either on the shaft or carriage, I cannot say which; his back was towards me, his face towards the horses; he was looking, I believe, towards the near side of the dray, and when I had gone about eighteen yards, to the best of my remembrance, I heard the prisoner cry whoy, sharply; I looked back, and saw the gentleman either under the carriage, or under the horses, at that distance I could not say which; I ran back, and saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150089"></xptr>endeavouring to pull back the horses; I picked up the gentleman from the wheel, and I believe the prisoner had pulled back his horses; when I came back the prisoner was by his horse; he came round as soon as he could; the gentleman was then speechless; I said, you have killed my master; I heard him make no answer; the drayman came round to my assistance, to the off side, where the gentlemen was; the gentleman was very much hurt; I believe the wheel went over his left leg, and I believe the driver, in pulling the dray back, put it over the same leg again, to the best of my knowledge; there was the appearance of blood; I assisted in taking the gentlemen home; he died the Wednesday night following; he lay in the off rut, nearer to the foot road on the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He lay in the rut of the off wheel of the dray? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never said that the prisoner answered that he did not see the gentleman till he was down; that he was extremely sorry for the accident, and that he had not intended it? - He did seem to be very sorry for the accident.</p>
               <p>But did not he say so instantly? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You was examined before the coroner? - Yes; on Saturday, the day he was buried.</p>
               <p>Of course at that time all the circumstances and conversations were fresh in your memory? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Fresher than they are now? - I do not know that I have studied more about.</p>
               <p>You said nothing before the coroner but what was true? - Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The driver was looking to the left side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The gentleman met with the accident by the driver's right side; the first you heard of the accident was by the prisoner calling whoy! sharply: you did not say any thing of driving this wheel over the leg a second time? - I was not asked.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to impute that he did it wilfully? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>This old gentleman had the misfortune of being extremely deaf? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you believed if a gun was let off close to him he would not have heard the report of it? - I did say so; and I think so now.</p>
               <p>Was any body in the road? - Not for some time.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you meet a young woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect whether the prisoner did not say whether he had seen the deceased before or not? - I heard him say he saw him some distance before.</p>
               <p>Do recollect; because I have the deposition you made before the coroner, and it is very material you should be consistent: did not you say before the coroner, that he said, he did not see the deceased till he was down? - I do not remember I said so.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that he expressed much sorrow for the accident? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How far was that from the place where the accident happened? - About thirty yards: I saw him on the dray towards the near shaft: I did not mind where the prisoner was when I saw the horse on his knees; there were two horses: it was a long trot: I did not see the gentleman before: I heard the prisoner cry out whoey, three or four times; then I ran up; the gentleman was down, and his head cut, and blood on his head; he was nearest towards the foot path, which was on the right hand side of the dray, which was the off side of the dray.</p>
               <p>How long might it be between the time of your seeing the dray, and hearing the cry of whoey? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I live at Hounslow: I was sent for on occasion of the accident of Mr. Rogers; I believe it was the 24th of May, between four and five in the afternoon; on examining him, I found the cuticle of the right hand tore away; and the bones lay bare; on examining the head, I found that the skin of the face, on the right side, was likewise torn off, and his scull laid bare on the head; upon examining the left cheek, I found both the bones were broke, and very large lacerated wounds on that leg, so that the points of the bones were discoverable; and on the right leg there was a very large contusion; from this accident, I apprehended him in great danger of a mortification; and he continued extremely ill till the Wednesday; and in the afternoon, or evening, he died; I knew him before, very well; he was an elderly gentleman, about seventy; he was in very good health before; I have no doubt in the world but that accident was the occasion of his death.</p>

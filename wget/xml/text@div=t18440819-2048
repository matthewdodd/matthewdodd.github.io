                  </hi>. On Sunday morning, the 18th of August, about one o'clock, 1 met the prisoner—I had been out in (he evening, and had left a friend of mine, who was a fellow-workman—the prisoner came to me, and asked me the way to London-bridge—I said she was going the wrong way—she then said which was the Monument—I said she was going the wrong way for that—she then said she wanted Fishergate-street—I said it must be Bishopsgate-street, and she was going the wrong way—she said she had not been long from the country—I asked what part she had been at—she said Leeds, Hull, Birmingham, and other parts—I got asking her questions, and walked about 300 yards with her—she then said she wanted the Curtain-road—I said it was on the other side of the way, down Bateman's-row, or any other turning—I went down Bateman's-row with her, and when I got half<lb></lb>way, or more, all at once she began shuffling to go away—I had no idea that I was robbed, or anything of the kind—a man came up, with a black coat on, and she said, "It is all right"—she was then about five yards from me, going away—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed all my money—I had had a George III. sovereign, three shillings, a sixpence, and eight halfpence, in my waistcoat pocket—I do not know how the prisoner's hand got into my pocket, but such was the case—I turned round, and attempted to run after her—the man with the black coat went to stop me—I shoved him away—I had a stick in my hand, and flourished it about—I turned the corner, and saw the prisoner running away—I seized her, and pulled her down—the man came up—I kept him off with my stick—I detained her—the officer came up, and the man in the black coat ran away.</p>

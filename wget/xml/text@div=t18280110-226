I went out at eleven o'clock at night of the 13th of December, on business, leaving my key with Mrs. Parker; I returned at twelve o'clock - the street door is kept on the latch - I found the hasp of my lock had been drawn out, but the landlord had put it on again; I went in, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. I knew the prisoner - she had visited me once in that room; I sometimes do needle-work, and when I cannot get it, I sometimes get my living in the street, I am sorry to say.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PARKER. I let this house out in separate lodgings, and live next door; Fitzgibbon left her key with my wife, about eleven o'clock, and in about an hour Driscoll came in, in his shirt, and gave an alarm; I took a candle, went up stairs at this house, to the back garret, and saw the prisoner on the landing-place, and all these articles strewed about - she had no business there - she had no property in her possession; she called to me directly I got up, and begged me to forgive her, and let her go; I said she had broken into the room and stolen the things, and I could not let her go - I found an iron pin, about six steps from the room-door - the staple appeared to have been drawn out by that pin; no other women lodge there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and keep the Half Moon public-house, in Smithfield. On the 7th of Nov. my family consisted of myself and my servant, Alice Boile—I had no other servant. About half-past eleven o'clock that night a man came in and requested a bed—I told him he could have one, and asked if he would like to walk into the parlour, or if he would like a candle, and go to his bed directly—he said he would like a candle, and go to bed directly—I then called Alice Boile out of the bar, and asked her to stop in the tap-room while I went and got a clean towel—I asked her for a candle, to go up stairs to get it for the bed-room—I left the man and Alice below—I came down immediately—I did not find them together then—the man had just stepped out—he came in again directly—Alice took the candle off the bar, and lighted him up stairs to bed, and I saw no more of him—he had his hat over his eyes, an I leant in a leaning position, looking at the clock, therefore I had not a full view of his face—I am not prepared to swear to the prisoner as being the man—I have a very great belief of it, from the leaning position of the head—I have a strong belief that he is the man, from the stooping position of his head and neck—he generally stands in that position—I have seen him at Guild<lb></lb>hall,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250090"></xptr>
               <p>and his manner of standing is like that of the person—I do not swear positively to him—the girl came down directly—the house was shot about five minutes before twelve by the clock, and about five minutes after twelve by the clock I went up stairs to my own room—at that time I had only two other inmates, who were cousins of mine, man and wife—they lodged on the second floor, the same floor as myself, in the opposite room—the man was to sleep in the third floor front room—I have a side door, as well as a front door, to my premises—that was bolted, and the front door waslocked, bolted, and barred—when I went up to bed I carried up 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in a yellow canvas bag, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a small tray—there were eight crown-pieces, twelve half-crowns, forty shillings, and twenty sixpences—I put the bag and tray on a chair by my bedside—it was there when I re<lb></lb>tired to bed—I did not lock or bolt my chamber door, it was only hasped—I was awoke about a quarter-past five in the morning by the ringing of the side door bell—being market morning, I thought they were ringing the bell for me to get up, but finding it continue ringing, I felt alarmed, threw a shawl over my shoulders, and went down stairs—I saw a police<lb></lb>man at the bottom of the house, and found that he had been ringing the bell—I found the side door open—I immediately ran up stairs into the lodgers' room, and found he was gone—my cousins were in bed—I then went down stairs again, and looked round the bar, but missed nothing from there—I felt ill, and sat down for a few minutes—I afterwards went up stairs for the money for the till, and found the bag containing the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was gone—the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the tray was not gone.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250091"></xptr>
               <p>asked me, about ten minutes to six o'clock, whether I had lost anything, and I said, "I am in very great hopes not;" but I had not then been from my bar—I did not say I had not—I did not tell him I had been awake longer than two hours—mine is a square room, with two windows in it—Alice Boile had been a month in my service—I do not think she saw me put any money in the tray, and take it up with me that night—I could almost swear she did not, for I had it in my apron—she went up with me, and into my room with me, but I generally carry the money rather secretly, under something—she might know it was my habit to carry up money every night, but I do not know—she is not always at the bar when I clear away—she always goes up with me of a night, but I do not put the money away in her presence—I take it up in her pre<lb></lb>sence—I sence—I very frequently lay it down, and throw my pocket handker<lb></lb>chief over it, till the servant is gone—I do not sleep with a light in my room—the man had gone up about ten minutes before eleven, and I went up about five minutes past twelve—he could know nothing about my money being in my bed-room, without he was <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> there—no one had any light in their room.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mrs. Lee's service on the 7th of Nov. last, About ten minutes past eleven o'clock that night she called me down to her—there was a man with her—the prisoner is the man—I feel sure of it—I was in his company about ten minutes before I went to bed—I then, by my mistress's desire, lighted him up to bed, and left him in his room—I went up with my mistress, and helped her to undress as usual—I did not see that she carried up any bag of money with her, or know of its being in the room—I did not know whether it was her habit to carry up money into her room—I did not know anything about it—I assisted to make the front and side doors fast—they were made fast—next day, by my mistress's desire, I went with Trew, the policeman, to No. 124, High-street, Wapping—I had observed the dress of the man over night—he had on a blue pilot coat, and a crape hat-band round his hat—he wore his hat over his eyes a good deal—I saw his features—I saw enough of him to be sure of him—when we got to the house at Wapping the front door was knocked at—no one came to that door, but a female servant came out at a side door, and after that the prisoner came out—he had no hat on—as I was going towards Wapping I had given Trew an account of the man who had slept at the house over night—when the prisoner came out I looked at him three times before I was sure of him—I then said, "That is the man that slept at our house last night"—I do not know whether the pri<lb></lb>soner could hear that—I said it to the policeman—the prisoner was close by—I then said to the prisoner, "You are the man that slept at my mis<lb></lb>tress's tress's house last night"—he said, "Me sleep at the Half Moon on Mon<lb></lb>day night?"—no one had mentioned the Half Moon till the prisoner mentioned it—this was on Friday, about half-past twelve o'clock—I am sure he said Monday night, and I said, "No, it was last night"—he did not say anything more—he then went into the house, and the policeman said to him, "Who said anything about the Half Moon?"—he said, "The servant did," meaning me—I had not said so—I had said, "My mistress's house"—he was then taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a City policeman, No. 26. At the time in question, I was No. 455. On Friday, the 8th of Nov., I went with Alice Boile to Wapping, to No. 102 I believe—Child, the beadle of Tower-hill, went with us—on arriving at the house, Child knocked at the door, and some time afterwards the prisoner came out—Child came out of the court, and the prisoner followed him—I saw the girl look at the pri<lb></lb>soner—I was on the opposite side of the street at that time—I crossed over immediately, and she said, "That is the man that slept at our house last night"—the prisoner was close by her at the time—I then said, "Will you walk inside, sir, if you please, I want to speak to you"—I was in private clothes—in going up stairs he turned round and said to Boile, "What do you say, I slept at the Half Moon, last night"—I then stated that there had been a robbery at the Half Moon in Smithfield, and he was suspected of committing the robbery—no one had mentioned the Half Moon before the prisoner said, "What, do you say I slept at the Half Moon last night?"—I said to the girl at the time, in the prisoner's hearing, "Have you mentioned the sign of the house?" or "the Half Moon?"—I will not be certain which I said—she said, "No"—I then said to Child, "Have you heard it mentioned, Child?"—he said, "No"—and I said, "Nor I"—when I told him the charge he asked me when it was—I said, "Last night"—he said he could prove, by two gen<lb></lb>tlemen, tlemen, that he was at home last night—I searched both him and his pre<lb></lb>mises—I</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to the prisoner's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We went down there through suspecting a girl that had lived with Mrs. Lee—the policeman and Boile suggested our going to the house, after we had found out where the girl lived, who used to live with Mrs. Lee—I do not know whether that girl was examined before the Magistrate—I was not there—I went to the prisoner's house at the desire of Trew and Alice Boile.</p>

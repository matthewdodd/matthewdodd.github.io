               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The two half-crowns and sovereign were in your right-hand pocket, and the three halfpence in the other? A. Yes; I was ten or eleven hundred yards from the public-house I had come out of; it was the Blue Coat Boy, in Dorset-street; there are warehouses where I was robbed; it was half-past twelve o'clock; I had just come out of the public-house, and was leaning my hand against a dray - I left work at eight o'clock, and went to have a pint of beer at the Seven Stars, in Brick-lane, with two of my shopmates and one of their brothers; we had two pots of beer there, and whether it was one or two quarterns of gin I cannot be certain - I changed a shilling there, and paid for one pot of beer; I put a few halfpence towards the gin - I spent 10 1/2d. altogether; my day's wages was 3s. 6d.; we then went to the Blue Coat Boy, had one pot of beer and one quartern of gin; we went there about half-past ten o'clock, and staid till twelve - we drank no more; I was quite sober; I saw the prisoner searched at the watch-house; I do not know that he stated the exact money he had in his pockets; no sovereign was found upon him; he did tell me to go home for a drunken fellow, and not to follow him, for he was not the man; I was calling Stop thief! because he was going away from me; I do not know any thing about him - I never was in a Court of Justice or before a Magistrate - I go to work at six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say there was a sovereign and two half-crowns in one pocket and three halfpence in the other, and the prisoner ran away, and said, "What do you follow me for? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 8th of August I was on duty in Brick-lane, between twelve and one o'clock; I heard a cry of Watch! and ran as fast as possible; when I got to Black Eagle-street, where the drays stand, I saw a bat lay; I passed that, and went on; the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner, he said, "I give you charge of him, he has robbed me of a sovereign;" he did not then mention any half-crown; but in going along he said he had lost two half-crowns and three half-pence -I took the prisoner back; the prosecutor took up his hat, and we went to the watch-house - I could perceive the prosecutor had been drinking; but he walked, and told his story very sensibly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would you say he told the truth if he said he was quite sober? A. He had been drinking, but he must have gone very rapidly to the place where he took the prisoner - he seemed capable of knowing what he was about; I think he had taken rather too much - he did not, at that time, say in which pocket he had his different monies; I saw the prisoner pull the money out of his own pocket - there were two half-crowns, and I think 7 1/2d.; but the watchman has nothing to do with that.</p>

            . I was the watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought there, and searched in my presence - there were two half-crowns and 7 1/2d. on him; the prosecutor charged him with having robbed him of a sovereign, two half-crowns, and 1 1/2d. - he appeared to tell his story sensibly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he been drinking? A. Yes, I thought so, and at first refused to take the charge,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100150"></xptr>but afterwards he told his story so correctly I did not think he had been drinking; the reason I thought he had been drinking at first was he seemed in a great flustration, and said he had been robbed a great many times over - I did not think he was drunk but that he had been drinking; at first he kept saying, "I have been robbed of a sovereign and 5s." for several minutes: and from his manner I did not think it was true - he did not at first say which pockets the coin had been in, but afterwards said the half-crown and sovereign were in one pocket and the 1 1/2d. in the other; I knew him by sight - the prisoner produced the money himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home from work at half-past eight o'clock - I said to my father, "Shall I go and enter myself into that benefit society to night?" he said,"You are getting a young family, I think it would be advisable;" I said my master would not give me any money - he said, "You shall not be lost for that;" and he went out, changed a sovereign, and lent me two halfcrowns and one shilling - I went to the Sugar Loaf to be entered, but the man, who was to propose me, was not there; I stopped, and had a pint of porter, a small glass of gin, and a short pipe of tobacco, which cost 4 1/2d. -I remained there to see if this man was there when the society broke up, but he did not come; that made me late - as I turned into Grey Eagle-street to go home this young man came and said, "I will have you about my sovereign;" I said, "Go about your business, you drunken fellow" - he laid hold of me, the watchman came up, and took me; the watchman said, "Come to the watch-hosue, you can see the man is drunk."</p>

               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

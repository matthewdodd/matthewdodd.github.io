                  </hi>. I am a teadealer carrying on business in Newgate Street—on the 30th October, about half-past one o'clock in the night, I was passing through Fox Court, Holborn, with a woman—that is the last court at the top of Holborn Hill, on the right-hand side going towards Holborn—I saw five men there, the prisoners are three of them—one of them ran up against me and knocked me against a house, and before I could recover myself one of them seized me by the neck from, behind, and I was drawn over his knees, so that I was reclining across him—Wilson is the man who first attacked me—while I was in that position another man took what money I had from my pockets, and. tore my trousers very much, and tore the cloth away—I was thrown to the ground and one or two of them then kicked me about the face and head—I believe Everett is one who did so, but I cannot speak positively—the others wereby—I only had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was taken away—while I was on the ground the woman called out "Police" and "Murder," which attracted their attention, and they left me and went to her—I immediately went into Holborn, met two constables, went back to Fox Court, and met the woman with my hat—Wilson then came up with a policeman, and I gave him and Everett in charge—I have not the slightest doubt that they are two of the men—I saw Thompson a week afterwards at Bow Street—I am as confident about him as I am about the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson. Q.</hi> Did not you say to the Magistrate that you believed me and this one were two of them, and at last, after a little hesitation, that you were positively sure we were the identical two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I swore confidently that you were two out of the five—I said I had not the slightest doubt about it, but I could not swear whether you pulled me from behind, and whether Everett robbed me—I was with the woman for an hour, but not at any public-house—nobody else was with her while I was with her—I say that you and Everett are two of the parties who robbed me, I could see your features as distinctly as I do now—I believe you had hold of me behind—there was a gas<lb></lb>lamp there—I did not state at the Court that I was not sure whether you were two of the parties, or that I had been with the woman since half-past five in the evening, or that I had been over the water with her—I had had six or seven glasses of beer during the evening, but when I went to the station and charged you I was perfectly sober—there was nobody with the woman—I do not know who she is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Everett. Q.</hi> On Tuesday, the 30th, before the Magistrate, did you not state that you were not sure we were the persons who assaulted and robbed you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Mr. Barker did not say, "You must not come to this place unless you are sure," nor did I then say, "Well, I am sure"—Wilson is the first of the men who pushed against me, and I can swear to you being there, and I believe it was you who kicked me when on the ground, but I cannot state that positively—I saw you standing within a foot of me when I was on the ground—I saw your face, there was a lamp immediately over us—the place was broad enough for us all to be together—I told the policeman I had been robbed and garotted in the court, but did not describe the persons who had done it, as we ran down without further argument, but I could have done so—he did not point out anybody to me, but a constable brought you up two minutes afterwards—when Wilson was taken I swore to him.</p>

On the morning of 30th October, between half-past one and two o'clock, Shaw came up to me in Holborn, his pockets were turned inside out, his trousers torn, he had a pinch in his throat, and two black eyes—I went into Holborn Buildings, at the end of which is a place called the Well, leading into Fox Court—I went to the end of Fox Court and saw Wilson in custody, he had the constable down against the wall, and they were struggling together—I assisted in taking Wilson.</p>

On 30th October, between half-past one and two in the morning, I heard a cry of "Police"—I went in the direction of the cry, and met Everett at the corner of Leather Lane, coming in a direction from Fox Court, bleeding very much—he said, "For God's sake go to Holborn Buildings; I have been stabbed there by my brother-in-law"—I said, "You had better wait and go back with me"—he said, "No, I refuse to do so," and within five minutes of that Walsh came up and pointed out Everett, saying, "hat is the man who assaulted me and assaulted the prosecutor"—he used the word prosecutor—where I met him was about 800 yards from Fox Court, he came down Holborn Buildings through Holborn.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">E</hi>). I know Wilson and Everett—I have seen them together two or three times, and Wilson and Thompson two or three times in the neighbourhood of Holborn, shortly before the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson. Q.</hi> How long before the robbery did you see us together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be a week or a fortnight—I met you at the corner of Dean Street one evening, and Thompson was with you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson's Defence</hi>. Fox Court is only a yard and a half wide, and he could not distinctly see who the man was who robbed him, and who was the man who chucked him. He has altered his statement since he was before the Magistrate. I am innocent of the robbery, though I may have struck a policeman. I do not believe there was a robbery; if there was it was the woman who did it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Everett's Defence</hi>. He cannot tell whether I assaulted or robbed him. Where is the evidence to prove I am guilty of either?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson's Defence</hi>. The prosecutor says that he cannot swear to me as assaulting or robbing him, only that I was one of the five persons present,</p>

               <p>which I deny. I deny all knowledge of the robbery, and deny being a companion of Wilson's. Previous to my being apprehended I was only five days out of the infirmary, and have things about me to prove it.</p>

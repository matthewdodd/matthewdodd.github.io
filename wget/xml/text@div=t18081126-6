               <p>Q. How long did he live with you - A. Nearly ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the course of his employ - A. Looking out goods and sending them out in the country to the various customers; that was part of his employ; he had also the paying of workmen that were employed out of doors, and the porters and other servants.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he to receive money - A. He was to receive money in the retail way in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that account - whose hand writing is that - A. The prisoner's; he kept a weekly account in a book.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount did he debit himself in the week preceding the 26th of December last - A. He debited himself with having received thirty six pound seventeen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount did he state to have paid - A. Thirty pound twelve shillings and two pence; leaving a balance of six pound five shillings and four pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the sums stated there do you see two items, money paid to Mr. Crawford - A. I do, to Mr. Crawford eleven shillings and six pence, and to Mr. Brookes two pound thirteen shillings; he accounted for these sums in his own hand writing; these are the hand writing of the prisoner, and they correspond with the book delivered in on Monday morning to one of the shopkeepers, as vouchers for the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the voucher for Mr. Crawford and Mr. Brookes - A. It is; both are in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. What week is this you are talking of - A. On Monday the 26th of September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Then he represented to you that he paid Mr. Crawford eleven shillings and sixpence - A. He did, and to Mr. Brookes two pound thirteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. And by means of this representation to you, you took from him a sum of only six pound and a fraction, whereas you ought to have the sum of seven pound and a fraction, you thereby obtained of him a less sum than you ought - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you always pay him money in advance - A. He always had money; we generally advanced on Monday or Tuesday fifteen or twenty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. He lived with you near ten years - A. Yes; he always behaved extremely well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a timber-merchant, at 17, Pownall-road, Dalston—I have known the prisoner years, and have occasionally employed him as engineer—in the summer of last year he was making an engine for me, and I advanced him money on account of that engine—on 18th July, he brought me this bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in precisely the same condition as it is now—he said that he had taken it of Mr. John Eades, a gentleman in Pump-court, Union-street, Borough, who he was doing work for and who paid him that in lieu of cash—I gave him a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bill became due on October 1, and my solicitor presented it—I got no money for it—in consequence of what I heard from Mr. Eades, I applied for a warrant on 1st October.

In July last I was a timber merchant, and lived in Pump-court, Union-street, Borough—I have known the prisoner four or five years—I never authorized him nor any other person to sign my name to a bill—this is not my acceptance—I never knew of another John Eades in Pump-court—I never accepted any bills in blank for the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know Gilbert when he carried on business in Boston-street, Hackney-road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I have heard he did so—he has carried on business ever since I have known him, near the Old Kent-road—I had one transaction with him amounting to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in, I think, 1859 or 1860—he entered into a contract with me to fit up a steam-engine at my saw-mills—that amounted to 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I agreed to supply him with money as the work proceeded—I gave him bills instead of money, as I could not get my work, and after he had received 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me, he became bankrupt—he never met any bills of mine when they became due—he accepted two bills, not for me, but for himself, and he got them discounted—I don't know what he did with the money.</p>

               <p>—I went down to see what was the matter—I was stabbed in the shoulder—I did not see by whom—my coat and waistcoat were take off—there was a pool of blood in the sleeve of my shirt—I afterwards went to the station and was examined by a doctor—the wound is not well yet but is still strapped up—I did not do anything to the prisoner; I had not seen him, and I did not see him strike me.</p>

I live at 22, Reculver Road, Rotherhithe—on the 5th October two females complained to me—I was with Caste—I saw two foreigners, the prisoner was one—I saw something shining in his hand while I was trying to get Caste away—I saw the prisoner strike Willing—he seemed to aim at his shoulder—I was not near enough to see whether he had a knife then—I am positive it was the prisoner who struck Willing—there was sufficient light for me to see that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 323). I was called by Caste, who recog<lb></lb>nised the prisoner—another man was with the prisoner, who has since been discharged—I said "I shall take you to the station for stabbing a young man in the Deptford Lower Road—I did not think he understood me—he came for some distance and made a reply in German—then he pointed to a ship and said "That ship belongs to the same country as I do, and I shan't go any farther"—I tried to persuade him to go—he commenced halloaing in his own language when 14 or 15 men came off the ship and rescued him—another man I took into custody for rescuing him from my custody was con<lb></lb>victed at the Greenwich Police-court—I afterwards obtained assistance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187912020030"></xptr>
               <p>and went to the ship, but could not find the prisoner that night although I searched the vessel—the next morning I went with Inspector Bannister and saw the prisoner at work on the same ship, the Flyshire, with a lot more men—I took him into custody again—Inspector Bannister told him the charge in German—I took him to Greenwich Police-court, where he was put in the waiting-room with 10 or 12 other men, and the witnesses were taken in one by one and they all identified the prisoner—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in one of his trowsers pockets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took another German seaman into custody—I found a similar knife on him—he was discharged—I gave him back his knife, Benjamin Browning. I am a surgeon at Rotherhithe—I was called on the night of the 5th October to see Willing—I examined him; I found him suffering from a severe wound at the top of the right shoulder im<lb></lb>mediately behind the collar bone, extending directly downwards—my left finger could reach the blade bone, which was cut through, and there was evidence of a wound on the lung—the wound was 4 inches deep, and an inch broad; it went directly behind the collar bone downwards—I was nearly an hour endeavouring to stop the bleeding, and I am within the mark when I say there was between one and two pints of blood—I had him removed to the hospital—the wound must have been done by some sharp instrument—this knife was handed to me in the police-court—it would inflict such a wound as this—usually the wound is smaller than the instrument which inflicts it, but I was struck at the time with the width of this wound, and I said before I saw this knife that it had been done with a broad knife—I examined the knife; it was covered with stains, some of which I retained for a chemical and microscopical examination—they are partly blood and partly rust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A similar knife would of course have inflicted such a wound—I had the knife eight or nine days—in my examination the first thing I did was to scrape off the stains, and touch it with a little ether to confirm what I supposed to be the case from the appearance of the knife, that there was grease on it—some portion of the stains dissolved in the ether, and another portion remained—I took a corresponding portion, and placed it on a hollow microscopic slide with a little distilled water—the stain was of a reddish colour, and the colour was not altered; had it been due to vegetable dyes there would have been an alteration, and if due to rust there would have been a little deepening of the colour—if it had cut raw meat there would have been evidence of blood on the knife—I tested the stains also with tests with a like result.</p>

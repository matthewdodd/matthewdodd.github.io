               <p>Q. You went down Type-street - A. Yes; during the time the conversation past. When the person that robbed me, left me, she ran up Red Lion-passage; I went up there, and told the people in the court that I was robbed, and I supposed the prisoner had run into one of the houses; they said, no. A young man came up, and said, you had better leave this place, they are bad characters here; you had better go to the watchhouse. I went to the watchhouse; I told the constable I thought she was a Welch girl; he told me to call upon him the next morning. During the time I was in the watchhouse, they took up Abrahams; she said, she knew a person of the name of Jones, that she lived in some court in Goswell-street; an officer went with me to her room. The officer found ten pounds in notes; I can swear to their being mine. I cannot swear that the prisoner robbed me; I believe she might be the woman.</p>

             came to me: he said, he had been robbed of fifteen pounds, and he had some information that the prisoner lodged in a court in Goswell-street. I found out the prisoner's room, and as soon as I went in, the prisoner went down upon her knees. The prosecutor said, if she would give him the notes, he would forgive her. She told me if I would go down stairs, she would give him the property. I went down stairs half way; there is a vacancy under the door; I could see the prisoner take something out of the bed. I went in the room, and told the prosecutor he must give me the notes; he gave me five one-pound notes, and a five-pound bank note. These are them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure they are my notes; she gave them me, I took the five-pound note of Esdaile and Co. bankers.</p>

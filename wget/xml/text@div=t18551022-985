                  </hi>. I am a labourer of Richmond. The prisoner is my brother—on 3rd Oct., about ten minutes after 11 o'clock at night, I went to my mother's house and found my other brother staggering in the alley—I saw some blood in the alley—I went in doors, saw the prisoner, struck him, and dragged him out of the house—that was in consequence of what my other brother told me—I found a white handled knife open in the yard, and gave it to a policeman—1 afterwards saw that my brother was hurt in the side and in the hip.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brother of the prisoner. On 2nd Oct., I went to St. John's-grove, and saw my brother William very much in liquor—he asked me what I wanted down there—I told him I came down to see mother, and said, "You had better come too; you are in liquor, and perhaps you will be locked up"—he said that he should not, and said some<lb></lb>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220147"></xptr>
               <p>rather disrespectful about his home—I said, "Yon have no occasion to gay that"—he said, "I will go home, and see about it"—I said, "Do;" and we went together towards his home—just before we got there he said, "I will see about it"—I said, "You shall not kick up any bother while I am here"—he said, "You will take it up, will you?"—I said, "I do not want any piece of work"—he turned round and hit me, and I pushed him down, but I know nothing of his stabbing me—I only felt weak, and found that I had received a wound—it was in the dark, and I cannot say whether anybody else struck me besides him—about three minutes after he hit me I found that I was bleeding—he struck me with his fist on the head; nowhere else—I saw no knife.</p>

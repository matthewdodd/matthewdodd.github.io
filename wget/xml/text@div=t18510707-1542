                  </hi>. I live in Holborn. On 24th June, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was on London-bridge, looking over the parapet, at the fire which had taken place at Alderman Humphreys' wharf the day before—the prisoner was next to me—I felt him draw my watch from my waistcoat pocket—it had been safe a minute before—I looked down at the prisoner, and saw a small curb-chain hanging down between his fingers—the chain was attached to my watch—I made a snatch at his hand—he dropped it, and when I got hold of it the watch was gone—I accused him of having my watch—he said nothing, and I gave him in charge—there were two women near him, and several persons about—the two women hurried away—I have not seen my watch since—I did not see it in his hand, only the chain.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, on the 5th of this month, as I was crying the hour of two, as I was going to ring Mr. Selwin's bell, which I usually do to call the men up, I saw the prisoner Jefferies with a bag in his right hand, and the door which is a lowish door in his left hand; seeing them up I did not ring the bell, he pulled the door rather too with his left hand, the other witness was a little before me, and I told him I saw a man that used to go by the nick name of Bricklane Jack; he and the serjeant went and looked round the market, and under a basket in the passage in the market, we found this bag of flour, which I believe to be the same.</p>
               <p>Did you see that bag of flour left there by any of the prisoners? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it here? - Yes, it has been in my possession ever since, it is now in the same state it was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is the same bag the prisoner Jefferies had in his hand? - To the best of my knowledge, I cannot positively swear down right that it is.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is there any mark on the bag? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>There is no mark on the flour? - No.</p>
               <p>Quick. Before the Magistrate he said, it was a bag he had made and bought the cloth; after that, he said, he had it made out of a towel or two, and he never had any but once before, and he sold that to a pyeman for for one shilling and sixpence.</p>

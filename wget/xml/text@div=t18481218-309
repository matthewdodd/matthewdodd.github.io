                  </hi>. I live at 27, Praed-street, Paddington. This money was taken from the Fountain Abbey public-house—I do not live there—Mr. George <hi rend="italic">something</hi> Howard is the landlord—I am secretary of a society held there, called the "Friendly Potters"—the rules are not enrolled—the money belonging to the society is kept in a box, which is in the landlord's care—the prisoners were stewards of the society—each of them had a key of the money-box, and I also had a key—there are three locks to the box—the landlord had no key—I left my key with the barmaid—I went into the room where the box was on the 4th Dec.—I found the box on the table—one key was in the lock, and another key was on the top of the box—one of those keys was mine, and the other was Butterfield's—it required the three keys to be used to get the box open—when I had been in the room about ten minutes, a boy came, and produced a small parcel, sealed up, containing Clark's key, and some papers belonging to the club-business, a member of the club came in, and 1 opened the box in his presence—I found in it 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the last time I had seen it was a month before—there were then ten sovereigns in it—I know what money had been duly expended in the meantime—the prisoners were given in charge by a member of ours for taking this money—they did not deny taking it, but they both said they had a right to it—they have been for some years members of the society—their business was to collect and pay the sick-money—the receipts which were brought to me spoke of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. having been paid away—the prisoners claimed to keep the other 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because they thought there was some dispute in the club, and they did not like different matters, and they would help themselves—fresh stewards have been appointed.</p>

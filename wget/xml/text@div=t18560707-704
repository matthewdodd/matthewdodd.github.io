                  </hi>. I live at No. 18, Thornhill-square, Caledonian-road, Islington. It is my dwelling house—on the night of 6th July, I saw my house all closed up, and I went to bed at a quarter past 12 o'clock—I was the last person up—I was alarmed between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I looked out of the window, and saw two men creeping under the wall down the garden—I went down and unbolted the front door and called, "Police"—I went to the garden and saw two men jump over the wall of the adjoining garden, to get away into the Richmond-road—I found my back door wide open—it had been fastened by bolts, the night before—the front kitchen window was a little way open—it leads into the area—that window had been shut down the night before, but I did not examine the fastening—no person could get into that area from the street, there is an iron railing over it—I missed four spoons, a flageolet, and an umbrella; and on the grass plat in front I found a shoe which had not been there the night before—shortly afterwards, the two prisoners were brought back by the policeman—I can<lb></lb>not possibly tell how they could hate got into the house—the back door had been unbolted from the inside—it had been bolted the night before—if any person had been concealed in the house the night before, they might have opened the door—that is the only way it could have been done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nurse maid in the service of the last witness. I sleep in the second floor back room—on that night I heard a calling out that there was somebody in the house—I got up, went out of the house, and ran round to Richmond-road—I there saw Sharp jump off the stable, coming in a direction from the back garden; and I saw a man come out of the side gate belonging to Mr. Watney, the publican's stable—any one could get there from our garden by climbing the wall—the man I saw was the height of Woodley.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell the Magistrate that Woodley was the other man—you said in your deposition, "I saw Sharp come out, and directly afterwards the other prisoner came from the gate." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I said, "I saw a man," I did not say it was the other prisoner—he was the same height—he ran to the Caledonian-road—the same way that Sharp did.</p>

On 14th February, between four and five in the morning, I was on duty, and was attracted by a noise in No. 193, Drury-lane—other constables came to me, and I waited outside while they went in—it was unoccupied—you can get to 193 from 191 from the leads.</p>

Emmerson called my attention to 193, Drury-lane, and after waiting there some time I and the sergeant went through the next house, and on going to the back of 192, I saw marks on the leads, and the skylight was broken—I then went to the back of 191, and saw marks on the wall as if somebody had been getting over—that is a public-house—Rook followed after me, and I saw a door broken open at the back of No. 191, by which a person could get into the public-house—I went through the door which was broken open, and saw Rigby coming up from the cellar—I turned on my light, and saw Wilson lying behind the water<lb></lb>butt—neither of them gave any explanation of why they were there—I found a small screw on Rigby, and he said, "Yes, I took that out of the gas-fittings"—I found the gas branches at No. 193 taken down and standing on the floor, and the glasses standing on a bench.</p>

On 18th February, about six in the morning, I went with Fenn to 192 and 193, Drury-lane—I went to the skittle-ground of 191—Rigby was coming up the stairs, and Wilson was lying behind a water-butt—I took him in custody, searched him, and in his left-hand pocket I found this skeleton key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him what key it was—he said, "This is a key which fits the door of 193"—I went back and tried it, and it unlocked it.</p>

I am a contractor of Lime-street, City—I was employed by Mr. Gauntlett to inspect some works at No. 193—he was repairing the house for a butcher's shop—I was there between five and six on the 17th, when the men were on the point of leaving off work—the gas-fittings were fixed in their places, and all the pipes attached—there were two globes on the branch that was facing the shop-front, and two were in the cupboard—I saw the men leave, and saw the shop locked up—I was one of the last that left—I went next morning between nine and ten o'clock, and found all the gas-fittings taken down, and the gas pipes torn down as well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drayman. On the 20th of October I was in Chiswell-street, with my dray, going towards Barbican—I saw Peter Smith driving a donkey, with two hampers, his son being on the donkey—the father was behind the donkey, driving it with a whip with a lash to it—I saw him whip the donkey once or twice to make it go on—he went between my dray and the path, and overtook a potato-cart—he went on the off side of it—the prisoner's cart came out of Bunhill-row, going to<lb></lb>wards Finsbury-square—it was a rubbish-cart, drawn by two horses, one before the other—the prisoner was in the cart—he had not any reins in his hand—whether he had any on the horses I cannot tell—he was on his proper side—the off-shaft of his cart his the panniers attached to the ass, as he turned the corner—it immediately threw the ass on one side, and threw the child under the off-wheel of the potato-cart—the ass struggled not rolled about a bit—the street was not crowded—our dray was a con<lb></lb>siderable distance off—there were only those two things—I saw the off-wheel of the potato-cart pass over the child's head—it was thrown exactly under the wheel—the wheel went immediately over him—it was not the fault of the potato-cart—I should not consider the prisoner could see the boy coming, for he was not aware the donkey was going to push by the loaded cart—if the man had stopped the ass, it would not have happened, and if the prisoner had been on the ground with his horses, he could have seen the boy, and prevented the accident—I went up to the boy—he was dead immediately.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable, G</hi> 34.) I was in Chiswell-street, and heard the father of the deceased cry out, "You have killed my child, stop, you villain, you have killed my child!"—the prisoner had then stopped his cart—I ran in between the two carts—the potato-cart was going on—the prisoner was down on the ground then—I ran to pick the child up—there was three of us stooping together—the father, the prisoner, and myself—the father got hold of the child—I then went and stopped the po<lb></lb>tato-cart—it had got about a yard off—the prisoner's cart was light—not loaded—I saw nothing of the accident.</p>

               <p>years old the 30th of this month—I was walking my donkey very sharply along, at about five miles an hour—I had a whip—my donkey was passing a potato-cart, facing Bunhill-row, and passing it—another cart came out of Bunhill-row—I did not push my donkey on at all—it had got as far as the shafts of the potato-cart, right facing the Bunhill-row turning—my donkey was then going to pass the potato-cart—I saw a horse coming out of Bun<lb></lb>hill-row as I was behind my donkey—it met against the donkey's head, and turned her sharp round—the shaft of the potato cart caught her—no one spoke to the donkey—he backed the donkey clean round, and my boy fell under the wheel of the potato-cart—the leading horse came against my donkey's head—I did not see how the cart was driven—whether the man was in it or on the ground—there was no fault in the potato-cart—the boy was thrown completely under the wheel—I ran to pick up my boy, and the wheel caught my foot first before it went over my child—it went over his head, and immediately killed him—I picked him up myself, and went on the pavement with him as well as I could crawl—I hallooed out, "Go and stop that cart"—he had got a long way before any one stopped him—the prisoner never called to his horses, at all, to stop them, that I could hear—if he had only spoken to his horses, I think my boy would have been saved—I should think if he had been on the ground he could have pre<lb></lb>vented it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drayman. I was with Vaughan, driving the dray—I saw the donkey pass me, following the potato-cart; and as it was pass<lb></lb>ing it, the prisoner's cart came out of Bunhill-row, came in contact with the hampers, threw the donkey on one side, and threw the little child under the wheel, which went over it immediately—the prisoner was going very slow—not at the rate of two miles an hour, I should say—he was standing in his cart—I think he was putting something to rights in the cart, but what it was I do not know—I do not know that he was so en<lb></lb>gaged at the time the accident happened, but he was, the minute before—if he had been on the ground, attending to his horses, most likely he could have prevented the accident.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was driving the cart, and got up to shift the board—instead of stopping the horses while I did it, I let them go on to save time—I was going as gently as I could—there is no blame whatever to me, I assure you—I was going about two miles an hour, and not more.</p>

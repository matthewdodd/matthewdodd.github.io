I told him I was not inclined that way.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go in - A. I went in, but by the appearance of the two men I was alarmed - I had been drinking; he then asked me to send for half a pint of gin - I refused, and said I should go. I got up to go, he came across the room, and gave me a shove into the cellar, the cellar-door was open, but I had not observed it; it was six or seven feet deep, and goes down a ladder - a light appeared at the top. I immediately looked up, and saw the prisoner coming down, I begged of him, for God's sake, to let me out of the place; the light was then taken away, and he came down, put his hands down me, and took 12 s. or 15 s. out of my left-hand pocket. I do not exactly know what I had, but I know there was 12 s., and it was chiefly in half-crowns - he took it as soon as he could come down. I crawled up the ladder, and got out of the house as fast as I could, leaving him in the cellar - the other man sat there, but took no part in it. I do not know who brought the light to the cellar-door. I did not know him before, but am quite positive to him - I was quite sensible. As soon as I got out I went into Gray's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280017"></xptr>Inn-lane, told the watchman, and went back - the prisoner and the other man were still there. I pointed him out as the man who robbed me, and the watchman took him. I did not hear him say anything to it. It was not more than ten minutes after that I took the watchman there. In taking him to the watch-house he made his escape.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not sick with liquor - A. No, I have told the truth.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The last witness applied to me about twelve o'clock on the night of the robbery; I went with him to a common bawdy house - I knew it to be so. I found the woman who keeps it, a man that cohabits with her, and the prisoner, there. The prosecutor said the prisoner was the man - he said he knew nothing about it. As I took him out, he said he could go without holding - I said I must hold him. On going up Holborn he kept shuffling, and when he got to Hand-court I had a desperate struggle with him - he got from me, ran across Holborn, through Turnstile, into Whetston's-park, and there I took him again. Six half-crowns were found on him.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I searched the prisoner, and found six half-crowns, 2 s. and two 6 d. on him. The prosecutor was frightened, but very collected. I went and examined the cellar, I never was in such a place in my life - any man might be murdered there, and nobody know it - it is very dark, and full seven feet deep; there is a ladder in it, with some of the steps broken. A sort of cupboard leads to it.</p>

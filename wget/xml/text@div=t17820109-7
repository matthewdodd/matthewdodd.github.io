            , we were stopped about half-way, between seven and eight in the evening, in the road by two men, they opened the door of the carriage of the post-chaise, and demanded my purse; I gave my purse, and at the same time I was a good deal frightened, and I gave my watch, it was metal.</p>
               <p>What was in your purse? - A crown piece; the purse was silk.</p>
               <p>What reason have you for charging the prisoner? - I had not the least memory of either of the men; not the least recollection; they went away directly after.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lewis. I was going from town to my house, at Little Chelsea, on the 21st of November last, with this lady, at nearly eight o'clock in the evening, and about the mid-way, between Little Chelsea and <placeName id="t17820109-7-crimeloc39">Hyde-Park-Corner</placeName>

Mr. Filewood, and the lady, Mrs. Lewis; the man came to my side, and demanded our money, Mrs. Lewis instantly gave her purse; he demanded mine, I was not quite so ready, he desired I would make haste; it was loose silver; I did not see Mrs. Filewood's purse and watch given; I thought I had some recollection of the man, after the watch was stopped; I thought I had some knowledge of his face; I saw him afterwards when the watch was stopped; the prisoner was taken up; I went to the office to see him; I then thought it was the man that came on my side; there were two men; I saw but one.</p>
               <p>Did you know both the doors of the chaise were open? - I did not; I cannot swear positively to him.</p>

               <p>Were not the stables his, as he is a hackney coachman? - They belong to Palmer; I pursued both.</p>
               <p>How did price escape? - It was dark, the stables run under ground; Price and the prisoner both run together.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him standing still before he run? - I saw him opposite the shop.</p>
               <p>Was that before Price spoke to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Price speak to him? - They both run one hundred yards, and then joined.</p>
               <p>Then they both ran before Price spoke him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Price had not spoke to him before they set out running? - No; I have known this man sometime, I never heard any harm before of him; I went round my counter, and saw the prisoner on the other side of the way; the counter runs up to the window.</p>

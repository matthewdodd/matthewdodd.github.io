                  </hi>. I am the wife of Owen Henry Passau, and live in Gloucester-grove, Old Brompton. On the 14th of June the prisoner came to our house, and took some furnished apartments—he gave his name as Talbot, and said he belonged to Lord Shrewsbury's family—he afterwards gave him<lb></lb>self the title of Honourable—there was a female with him—they occupied my apartments ten weeks—during that time I missed some brooches, rings,</p>

I called in a policeman, and in<lb></lb>formed him of the robbery—after he had been in a very few minutes, the prisoner and the female left my house—they had given me no notice of their intention to quit that day—they were to leave the following week—they did not pay their rent—I had seen these articles safe on my premises, while they were lodging there.</p>

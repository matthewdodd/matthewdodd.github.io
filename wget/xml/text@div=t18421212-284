                  </hi>. I am a grocer and live in Broad-street, Golden-square. On the 12th of July I paid the prisoner 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of Mr. Little, and took his receipt—it was two accounts, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he gave me two receipts, both on account of Saunders and Little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you a personal recollection of having paid him the sums? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perfectly, I saw him sign the receipts; one was for patent starch, supposed to be Indian corn.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 12th of July I was in partnership with Mr. Saunders; the prisoner was in our service., On the 18th of July he ac<lb></lb>counted to me for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Law—he said nothing about the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he never accounted to me for it—it is still unpaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This is the sum you made a mistake about at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the entry in the book is my own—the prisoner was paid by a com<lb></lb>mission—my clerk receives money for me, and it was his duty to enter sums he received from the commission agents—the prisoner did not have a com<lb></lb>mission on what he sold, but on what was paid for—the commission account had been overdrawn—I have lent him money, more than the amount of the commission.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did any other person receive money in your absence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—only Mr. Little—if I was absent the money would not be received—Mr. Saunders had the power of receiving money when he was there.</p>

               <p>by a man named Postan—I did not know the prisoner had received it—I asked Mr. Law to whom he had paid it, he said to Taylor—I questioned Taylor about it, and he said he had not received it, but it was received by the old man (Postan)—I then considered the prisoner innocent.</p>

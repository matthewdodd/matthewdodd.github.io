                  </hi>. I went into the Alfred's Head coffee-shop, at the corner of the London-road, on the 9th of Feb.—I was in the house till daybreak—the prisoner came, and would not let me alone—she wanted me to go home with her—I at last went with her to No. 13, Princes-street—I</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house in Princes-street. At half-past nine o'clock in the morning the prisoner and another female came with the prosecutor—the prisoner came down afterwards, and I heard her say, "Let him stop"—I said, "You are not going like that, to leave him here"—she rushed out past me, and the prosecutor sang out, "I have lost my watch"—I said, "One girl is gone, but I will stop the other"—he got a policeman—he would not give the other girl in charge—he said he had searched her, and was sure she had not got it.</p>

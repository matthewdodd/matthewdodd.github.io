               <p>Beaton. We had a verbal agreement with him above a year before this bears date.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any account settled between you?</p>
               <p>Beaton. No there is not, it is open still.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you this acquitance for?</p>
               <p>Beaton. He gave me this along with other accounts from his own book; but there is no account settled now, nothing allow'd on either side.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any accounts delivered in by him, in which he has charged this acquittance?</p>
               <p>Beaton. No otherwise than that he has delivered this and other receipts which are forged; and I will not allow them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a book of debtor and creditor?</p>
               <p>Beaton. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at this time to pay a proportion of the rent to Mrs. Forteau ?</p>
               <p>Beaton. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account did he give you these receipts?</p>
               <p>Beaton. He gave me them as money paid, of which I was to be half, had he paid the money, and they been good receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver you any account of debtor and creditor?</p>
               <p>Beaton. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a letter from Mr. Harrison, an attorney, in behalf of the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Beaton. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of it?</p>
               <p>Beaton. It was for me to settle the prisoner's and my accounts; I waited on the attorney, and told him how it was.</p>
               <p>Court. The right way would have been to have brought in a bill in chancery, to have settled accounts; and if he had produc'd these bills there. (if forg'd) the court would have ordered a prosecution.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was released on his own recognisance to appear to other two bills of indictment, for forging 2 other acquittances, &amp;c. after the accounts came to be settled in the court of chancery.</p>

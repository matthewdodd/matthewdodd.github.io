I was in the workhouse a fortnight ill, and when I came back they were gone. The prisoner was still there. My husband died three or four months ago. She owned she pawned them, and promised to redeem them when she had money. When I went to the workhouse I told my little boy to take the things to the workhouse with me, but she said she would take care of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you leave me your children to support, and I told you I would pawn these things to pay the rent - A. No. She is landlady of the house. I lived there 5 or 6 weeks; her husband was a friend of mine, and he would take no rent. She paid nothing for my children; the neighbours brought them victuals. I never paid her rent; when she asked for a shilling, I gave it her.</p>

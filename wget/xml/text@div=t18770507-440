I have offices at 173, Ball's Pond Road, Islington, and live at the Elms, Wood Green—on 23rd November the prisoner called on me—I think he had called once before—he said he wanted to get an action settled that was against him in the Mayor's Court, and asked if I could lend him the money to settle it—he said he wanted 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him what security he was prepared to offer—he said that he had got a house of furniture, a piano, a horse and" cart and harness, that it was a valuable little pony—I asked him particularly if the piano was his, or whether it was on hire, he said No, it was his own property—he produced a list of his furniture, I have not got it, I left it with the clerk to the Magistrate—I said "If I make this advance I shall require a bill of sale"—he said "Oh, will<lb></lb>ingly, but don't register it under any circumstances, it would be my ruin"—I said "If you are honest, which I have every reason to believe from what I can see of you, I will not register the bill of sale, but you must make me a</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The declaration being read, stated that the goods mentioned in the bill of sale were his absolute property, and that his liabilities: did not exceed</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) There is no schedule referred to in the bill of sale, it is general—having made the declaration and signed the bill of sale, I advanced him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part by cheque and part money—I parted with my money on the faith that <hi rend="italic">the</hi> goods he had assigned were his property, and that he was not in a state of insolvency, otherwise I should not have lent him the money—he was a perfect stranger to me—afterwards, in consequence of something that I heard, I wrote to him to know why he had not paid the money ac<lb></lb>cording to promise, and he wrote back a letter—I then went to Cambridge and took an officer with me from there to Horseheath, to take possession under the bill of sale—that was about the end of February.</p>

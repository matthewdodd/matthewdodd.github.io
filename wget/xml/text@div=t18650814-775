                  </hi>. I live at 32, Bath-street, Clerkenwell, and am a painter and grainer—on Wednesday, 5th July, about half-past 10 in the evening, I was with the deceased, coming from Islington, along Goswell-road, towards the General Post-office—there were ten of us, we had been to a temperance meeting—we had to cross Spencer-street from the right to the left-hand pavement, close to a public-house, which I do not know the name of—there was a light there, but no other gas-light except from a beer-shop round the corner—the deceased attempted to cross first, and I was about two feet behind him—when he got about two feet from the other side of the pave<lb></lb>ment he made a half turn, seeing, I suppose, a cab, which was about thirty feet from us—I turned to look what was the matter, the cab shot past, and the deceased had got his hands on the flank or neck of the horse—I made a</p>

               <p>snatch to pull him away, but he made a kind of half turn to the right—the horse's leg threw him, and the off wheel of the cab went over him—the cab came from Charles-street, crossing the Goswell-road, and at the rate of about ten or twelve miles an hour, as near as I am a judge of a horses' speed, and I have frequently ridden about with my brother in his chaise—it was more of a gallop than a trot—the horse and cab ran away when they had gone over the deceased—I did not see the cab stopped, I was too much engaged—I heard no one call out—I took my friend to a doctor—I saw no vehicle standing still.</p>

I am a warehouseman, of 3, Douglas-place, Clerkenwell—on the night of 5th July, I was standing at the right-hand corner of Spencer-street and Goswell-road, going towards the Post-office—I was with the party and was going to accompany them home—I crossed the road just behind the last witness—I saw a cab coming up Charles-street, driven some—what rapidly, and saw the deceased come in contact with the horse, he held up his hand to save himself from losing his balance, and the cab——wheel caught him on the left ancle and threw him down—the cab was going at the rate of ten or twelve miles an hour as far as I am able to judge—I should think it was a very fast trot, the horse appeared a very fast one, and very restive—I am not accustomed to horses, but I have been behind them frequently—I did not see the cab after the deceased was knocked down.</p>

I am a licensed victualler, of Pitfield-street, Hoxton—on the night of this accident I was riding in the prisoner's cab with a friend, Mr. Tannare—when we reached the corner of Charles-street some lady seemed to be crossing the road—I called out, the cabman slackened his pace, and the lady passed on—he proceeded to cross the road—some people seemed to be coming out of the public-house at the corner of Spencer-street from the last door—there was a cart or a van standing at the corner of the public-house in Spencer-street—I saw the deceased and one or two others come from the pavement as if they were talking—I found they came from the public-house—the rest of them stopped, but the deceased, I fancy, did not see the cab coming, or did not hear that I or my friend both called out—he seemed to be coming heedlessly, and the shaft struck him—he dropped down, and the wheel passed over his foot—I could not hear whether the cabman called out—it was a Hansom's cab——the deceased came into the road with his friends from somewhere near where the cart or van was standing—I should say that as we crossed Charles-street the cab was driving at about five miles an hour, certainly not exceeding six; but it is difficult to say the pace of a. horse when you are riding—he was not driving furiously—I do not think the driver could have prevented the accident—I think if the unfortunate man had not happened to have been talking to his friends he would have stopped, and the accident would have been avoided—imme<lb></lb>diately after the accident I put my hand through the little hole at the top of the cab and it immediately pulled up on the off side of the road—the policeman came up just as the cab had stopped, and I and my friend were getting out.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far had you been driving in this cab? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From Hoxton, three quarters of a mile to a mile—he was not driving at more than six miles an hour when the accident happened—I should say that he came at a greater pace than that from Hoxton to the Goswell-road—I had been in the cab about ten minutes—I should say that he was not driving faster than cabs usually go—from memory and from having seen the place since, I should say that he pulled up about the distance of four private houses from the public-house—I had a full opportunity of seeing before me—he pulled up without being called upon to do so; the policeman was not near enough to cause him to do so by holding up his hands—the policeman took hold of the reins, but it was just as the horse had</p>

               <p>stopped—he had pulled up on the off-side, not before I saw the policeman, but before the policeman had hold of the horse's head and we were in the act of getting out of the cab——if he were to say that he actually held up his hands and seized the reins before the horse stopped that would be a deliberate untruth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am out of business—I was with Mr. Blythe on the night of 5th July, driving along Charles-street—just as we were entering Spencer-street near the public-house, there were two ladies and three gentlemen in company—they appeared to be coming out of the public-house and had got some two feet from the kerb when the cabman called out and I called out as well—four of them stopped, but this unfortunate man rushed against the horse's head, struck the collar, and fell down—he appeared as if he was stooping in running—in my judgment, the cabman could not have avoided the accident—he was not driving so fast as a cab drove me down here to-day, between five and six miles an hour—previous to our coming out of Charles-street into Goswell-road, the cabman pulled up his horse to allow a lady to pass by—that was not quite at the corner, some few houses from the corner—that was some few minutes before the accident—after the accident the cab was turned round by the policeman—I was sitting on the side where the accident occurred—the cab was stopped by Mr. Blythe, and pulled up on the off-side, not quite twice the length of this Court from the scene of the accident—I noticed No. 27 I think—I saw the policeman run up on the near-side; he crossed the road and came up to the cab just as I was alighting—it was then at a standstill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then the place where the defendant pulled up his cab, was quite within sight of the people where the accident occurred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close to the spot—those who were present and saw the accident, could not fail to see the cabman pull up—he pulled up because Mr. Blythe shot his hand through the hole at the top, and not at the instance of anybody getting into the middle of the road and holding up his hands—there was no one in front of the horses' head—I had my hand on the dash-board to alight, before the policeman came up, and Mr. Blythe was out of the cab on the near-side—the off-side was close to the kerb——the cabman stopped his cab at the off-side before the policeman touched his reins, or made any signal—the policeman did take hold of the reins after the stoppage—I heard the cab<lb></lb>man call out; I do not know whether my friend must have heard it, because his attention was called to putting his hand through, and the cabman's shouting was not so loud as ours; I heard him call out before in Charles-street—he was going at the ordinary pace of cabs—I have been accustomed to drive for the last six years, and know what pace a horse goes at—it was impossible for that horse to go more than eight miles an hour, if he was pushed it would not exceed six miles—I was perfectly sober, and so was the cabman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 195, Goswell-road—I was at the corner of Spencer-street, crossing the road to fetch my supper beer—the first thing I heard was the cabman calling out most lustily; just as he was coming out of Charles-street, a passenger appeared to be going across; he stopped for her, but she went back to the kerb, and then he loosened the horse's reins, and started on again till he got to Spencer-street—I noticed that he did not use the whip, for it was in the socket—when he got six or seven yards up, there was a party of people on the pavement, and the deceased crossed and stooped his head as if to go under the horse's head, but he was knocked down—it was in my judgment quite impossible to avoid the accident, for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140060"></xptr>
               <p>there was a light van standing at the corner of Spencer-street, and the people that crossed came from behind it—they must have seen it, because it obstructed their crossing—I am not a good judge of horses' speed, but I should say it was the ordinary speed, five or six miles on hour—I saw the policeman take hold of the horse's head after it had stopped.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far did he get before he did stop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five or six houses up Spencer-street, nearly twice the length of this Court—it was not forty yards—I should say he pulled up about twelve yards from where the accident took place—100 yards would be absurd, that would be halfway up the street—the deceased's friends must have seen the driver pull up, unless their attention was called to the deceased, and they did not hear—the policeman crossed the road to him after he pulled up—I did not hear the policeman examined—he may have held up his hands, but he did not stop the horse, and I did not see him hold up his hands—he could not have caught hold of the horse's head by the reins, and stopped him without my seeing it; if he says that he did, it is an utter untruth.</p>

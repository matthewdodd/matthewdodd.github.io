               <p>Q. What time of the evening? - Between the hours of five and six o'clock; I went up the inn, the Spread Eagle yard, and left a young man, the ostler, with the coach to mind it while I went up the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the coach? - In Gracechurch-street, close to the Spread Eagle gateway, I went up in the yard, and returned back again to my coach, in the mean time, I was putting the reins right in my hand, I had got on the box, while I was putting my reins to rights my coat was drawn from out of the boot, I laid it at the top.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it there? - When I went from the coach into the yard, up to the office. When I was going to draw my horses off the pavement, a man hallooed out, you are robbed, stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it before that? - No, I immediately jumped off my box on the right hand side, on the pavement, and went round to the hind part of my coach and saw the prisoner at the bar with the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he the coat? - He had the coat rather hanging on his arm, and holding it in his hand and on his arm, it being a large coat, I could not leave my coach, and the people running I lost sight of him; my ostler he jumped off the other side, and ran after him, and the man that hallooed out stop thief pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after this yourself? - He was about twenty yards from the coach when I saw him with the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you get sight of him again? - He was brought back to me in the space of five minutes, or less.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that was brought back was the man that had the coat on his arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body bring the coat back? - The man that saw him take the coat.</p>

               <p>I am carman to Mr. Barnet the cheese-monger in Gracechurch-street; was going to put up my horse, and going home between the hours of five and six o'clock, and I saw this man the prisoner, he made two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080067"></xptr>or three attempts to take something out of this coachman's boot, the third time he pulled it off the coach and ran away with it, the coachman and the horse-keeper sat on the coach at the time, they were both on the box at the time, immediately as soon as I saw him take it, I directly cried out stop thief! the coachman and the horse keeper jumped off the coach and ran after him, the prisoner ran about twenty yards from the coach and threw down the coat and I went and picked it up.</p>

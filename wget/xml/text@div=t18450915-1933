                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I heard Benson make a state<lb></lb>ment before the Magistrate—this is the Magistrate's signature to it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Statement made by the prisoner Benson. 'I have been in the S division getting on for five years; I have lived in the station-house for the last six months; I came off duty last Friday, and I wanted a sove<lb></lb>reign, your worship, and I wrote to this young man to see if he would lend me one; I do not know whether it was Monday or Tuesday I wrote; he I said if I called on Friday I could have it; I came on Friday; I went to Watchorn's, opposite Mr. Noble's, and had a glass of ale, and I gave a sovereign to the barman; he gave me change, all in silver, excepting one halfpenny; I put the money into my pocket, and went over to Mr. Noble's</p>

               <p>to see this young man, to see if he could let me have the sovereign; I called for a glass of ale, and paid for it; I was there a considerable time, reading the newspaper, and saw the parcel on the counter that Drury had placed there for me to take, and I had another glass of ale; the butcher, the witness Lamacraft, came in, and picked up the parcel, and gave it to one of the young men, and said, "Here is a parcel of something here;" I was reading the newspaper at the time, and was not aware at the time that he had left the money there for me; Drury told me directly the money was picked up that he had placed it there for me; he told me how foolish it was of me, that he had left the pound there for me; then, fearing that he should be the loser, and make me pay the money again, I went outside, and met this man, Stockman, and asked him to go in and ask for the money I had placed there; I considered it was mine when Drury told me he had placed it there for me; I was to have returned the money to him to-day; Stockman came outside again, and said Mr. Noble would not give it unless I went in myself for it; I told, him that as I had acted to foolish about it, in not owning it at the time, I was ashamed to go in; I then went to a stationer's shop to write that letter, and gave it to this man to go in, thinking I could get the money in that way; we went to get a couple of cups of coffee; I thought it best to send a receipt, thinking that he, Mr. Noble, would send the money to me, and I wrote the second letter; Stockman took them to Mr. Noble, he came outside, and told me that he (Mr. Noble) was a most gentlemanly man, and if I would go inside he would give me the money; I went inside, and asked Mr. Noble if he would give me the money; he said he would if I would call the next day; then I told him he might keep it for a month if he liked, that no other person would claim it but me; Mr. Noble wished me to call on Monday, (this day,) and I did call; it was a mistake of mine when I said I got the money from one of Mr. Noble's men; I wish to say that I did not wish. Mr. Noble to know that a policeman would borrow money from his bar<lb></lb>man, and that was why I signed the letters. G.O. Benson. Taken before me, <hi rend="smallCaps">T. HENRY</hi>."</p>

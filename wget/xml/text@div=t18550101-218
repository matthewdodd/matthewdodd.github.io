He resided at No. 73, Warren-street, Fitzroy-square—he was a soda water manufacturer—he was at home on the evening of 8th Dec. last—Mr. Moore, myself, and his grandson, who is eight years of age, resided in the house—there was nobody else in the house besides Mr. Moore, his grandson, and myself, about half past 8 o'clock, on the evening of 8th Dec.—about that time I heard a knock at the front door, and a ring at the bell—I opened the door, and it was the prisoner, in company with a female—I had seen the prisoner before, when he came to repair the engine—I could not distinguish the features of the female—the prisoner asked if Mr. Moore was at home—I told him that he was—he was in the back parlour—I showed the prisoner into that room—he and the female both walked in—I do not know whether the door of the room was closed after they went in—I went up stairs directly after they went in—about ten minutes afterwards my attention was attracted by a noise in that room—upon that I came down stairs, and saw the prisoner, and the young woman next, and Mr. Moore next, all coming out of the parlour into the passage—I was then two or three stairs up from the passage, coming down the stairs—they had not all three come out into the passage when I first saw them; they were coming out of the room—Mr. Moore was not doing anything at that time—I ran to the front door with the intention of opening it—I was in the act of getting it open, when I saw a pistol in the prisoner's hand, and he put it to Mr. Moore's head—it was nearly up to Mr. Moore's head when I saw it—the prisoner was nearly close to Mr. Moore at the time—I saw the pistol fired off while it was in the prisoner's hand—I then ran out—I did not see what happened after that—I ran out into Warren-street—the prisoner ran out too after the shot was fired—there is a small iron gate beyond the house door in Warren<lb></lb>street—when I got to the house door there were some persons standing round that gate—the prisoner did not go through the gate; he ran back into the house, and bolted the door—I was left outside on the steps—I heard him bolt the door—among the persons who were outside the door at the time I was bolted out, there was one named Charles Collard—I spoke to him, and told him that I thought Mr. Moore was shot—I asked him to run round to the New-road, as I thought the man would get out the back way—he ran directly—he was a greengrocer, and lived next door; he kept a small greengrocer's shop—there is a back gate to Mr. Moore's premises, which leads out into the New-road—about an hour after I had been bolted out, I was let into the house—I do not know who it was that unbolted the door; I think it was a policeman who let me in, but I am not sure—when the door was opened I saw my master lying dead in the passage.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long did that struggling and scuffling go on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I ran down directly; I do not know how long it had been going on—I was up stairs at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Moore pushing the prisoner in the passage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had his hand up; whether he was pushing him or holding him back I cannot say—while he was doing that the prisoner was getting his pistol, I suppose—I was getting the door open then—I could not see what he was doing then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that was the time when the pistol went off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Moore had his hand up; that was the time I spoke of when I said his hand was up—I saw Mr. Moore's hand touch the prisoner, upon his shoulder.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went out at the door, about how many persons did you see; you said you saw Collard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; about three, I said—I went out directly the pistol was fired—the persons I saw outside were not inside the railings; they were in the street, close to the gate—they were standing; Collard was, I know—I do not know whether the others were passing at the time—at the time I spoke to Collard, he did not tell me what he had come there for—neither Collard nor anybody in his presence said they had come there in consequence of hearing the noise and scuffling in the house—I did not ask any of them what they had come for—they did not say any<lb></lb>thing about having come to the door in consequence of hearing the scuffling</p>

I am murdered!" and fell on the causeway—(I did not see any pistol till afterwards)—I endeavoured to hold the prisoner, hut he turned round and dealt me a blow under the ear with a pistol, and got away from me—I wrenched from his hand this piece of cane (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and that is the way he extricated himself from me—it has a piece of string attached to it—I could not see whether it was round his wrist—when he got from my grasp, he went down the New-road towards Fitzroy-street; that is away from Tottenham Court-road.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of 8th Dec. I picked up a pistol, two inches from the gutter, on the kerb in Bath-place, New-road, about the width of the pavement from the back of Mr. Moore's premises; about two yards from the wall of the premises, which premises front to Warren-street—the body of a wounded man was lying there, in the gutter, at the time—I gave that pistol to inspector Checkley at the station house that same night.</p>

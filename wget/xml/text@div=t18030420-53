             sworn. - I live at Downend, in Gloucestershire; by desire of Mr. Emmet, I went on the 5th of March to look after his mare; I went round the country till I came to Henley-on-Thames, on the 7th, where there was a fair, I looked all over the fair stables, and every place where I thought horses were to be seen; I dined at a house called the Broad Gate; I could not find the mare; I went away about five or six o'clock on the 7th; I then went to many other places in my way to London; I was going over Blackfriars-bridge to look for the mare, the 16th of March, when I saw the prisoner riding the black mare with a halter, talking with a man who was walking by his side; I did not know the prisoner, but I knew the mare; I did not tell him so, but said are you going to sell this mare? he said yes sir, I am. What do you want for it? he said twenty guineas; I said it is too much; he said it is worth something; I said it is, which way are you going? he said this way; I said I will go back with you, for I have no objection to buy the mare of you; we came by Fleet-market, and he said we'll have something to drink; he wanted to stop; I said, if you come on further, there is a better place; we rode along together, and he wanted to stop on Snowhill; I said you had better go a little further;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200057"></xptr>we rode together, and at the corner of Smithfield, he said, if you mean to buy the mare, buy her, for I will not go any further with you; I said, will you not give me leave to ride the mare; yes, says he, I will; I got off my horse, and got on his mare; I said, I would just ride round here, and be back in a few minutes, and I left my horse in his care; he said, he would call for six penny worth of gin and water; I rode across Smithfield, and round to the Ram Inn door; the gate happened to be shut; the ostler came with me to the public-house where I left the prisoner; I found a little boy holding my horse, but the prisoner was gone; I searched for him, but could not find him: I put the mare up at the Ram; about four o'clock next day, the 17th, Smith came to me, and in consequence of what passed, I went with him to the Red Lion, in Clothfair, Smithfield; Smith brought the prisoner from another house, through a passage, into the Red Lion; I said, how came you to run away, and trust me with the mare in that kind of way; says he, I was a little in liquor; says I, it did not appear so to me, I am glad to see you, I was afraid I should never see you again; says he, what's the matter? said I, you know what the matter is, it is a stolen mare; says he, I bought it at Henley fair; I said, I will not believe you, if you had been there, I must have seen you, where did you buy it there; he said, he bought it at Broad-gates; I said, if you had been there, I must have seen you, for I was looking for you, (the fair lasts only one day;) Smith was an officer, and I charged him with the prisoner, and I took the mare home to Down-end; I knew the mare well, having seen her every day; the next day I went before the Magistrate, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you always been equally accurate in your story? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Before the Magistrate you never said a word about any conversation having passed between you and the prisoner about his having bought the horse at Broad-gates? - A. He told me so when we took him.</p>

               <p>Q.What time of day was it? - A. Near seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no difficulty in riding away from you, he being on the black mare? - A. He might; but I should have tried my horse.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you leave to ride the mare? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Then the mare might have been fairly bought? - A. The prisoner said he had bought her on Monday evening at the fair, which was fair-day: I was there all day, and staid till it was night, about six o'clock; there were but few people there.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said you did not believe the prisoner was the man who stole the mare? - A. I cannot say who stole her.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know you have said so? - A. I cannot say who stole her.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know you have said so? - A. I cannot say I have not said so.</p>

             sworn. - I was at the Red Lion on the 17th of March; I heard some conversation respecting a mare a man had rode away with, between the prisoner, Gerrard, a little man, and Smith; I did not attend to it, but heard Gerrard say a countryman had rode away a mare that was on the partnership account between the prisoner and the little man; Gerrard told Smith if he would go and demand it, and get it, he should be well paid for it; Smith, Gerrard, and the little man, went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200058"></xptr>together, and the prisoner staid in the parlour; I asked the prisoner where Smith was gone; he said, he was gone to Smithfield; before I saw any of them again it might be three-quarters of an hour, when I saw a person come in who seemed in great confusion, who I did not know; the prisoner immediately jumped up, and went out of the parlour; Knapp, and five others, all came in; I went out into the yard in search of the prisoner, and into the tap-room and kitchen, but could not find him; I went into another public-house, about twenty yards off, and there I found him; I said, you have been stealing some horses; he made no answer; I asked him what he meant by sending Smith to get him into an awkward situation, and why he did not go himself; he denied it; I told him he must go with me to the other house; he went very quiet, and was taken to the Compter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Dunne of the Tower of London—I was in the bar parlour on January 19th, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the prisoner and three others drinking in the bar parlour—I went in and out all day, but I left at 4, and did not return till about 10 minutes to 5—they were there when I left—when I came back the prisoner and William May, one of the others, were not there—I had a gold watch hanging in the room, with an Albert chain attached to it—it was on a nail at the back of the prisoner, over a kind of bench—this was in the bar parlour, not a public place—I saw it at 4 o'clock, the last time I was there, and I said to Mr. Dunne, "It is 4 o'clock by the watch"—the prisoner was there—I returned there before 5, and found Mr. Dunne, his daughter, and William O'Brien sitting at tea—the prisoner was gone—as I sat down William May came in and I looked round to see the time by the watch, and found it missing—I gave information of my loss to Mr. Dunne and to the police, as soon as possible—I next saw the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the Tower canteen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the bar parlour is a private room—the sergeants of the staff go in there—Mr. Dunne ranks with them—the prisoner came in with May—they had been there before—the time when I missed my watch was the first time that I had been in since 4 o'clock—I had been to clean myself—Mr. Dunne the proprietor, was in charge of the bar parlour then—when I told the prisoner about missing the watch he seemed indignant—I may have known him a month by coming there—I can't say the exact time—I know how many people went into the bar parlour between 4 and 5—I was not there—I only know what I have been told by Mr. Dunne.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an army sergeant and live in the Tower—I was in the bar parlour of the canteen on Thursday, January 19th, at 4 o'clock—the prisoner, Mr. Dunne, William O'Brien, and the waiter, were there—the waiter left at 4 o'clock—the watch hung there at 4 o'clock—I should think it was about 20 minutes after 4 when I left to go to tea—I did not notice whether the watch was hanging there then—the prosecutor was at tea when I came back—that was perhaps a few minutes before 5—when I first left, the prisoner, Mr. Dunne, and Sergeant O'Brien were there—when I came back I found there, I think, Mr. Dunne and his daughter, the prosecutor, and O'Brien—the prisoner was gone—I did not see the watch when I returned—I did not take any notice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a free vintner, and keep the canteen in the Tower of London—I was in my parlour on the afternoon of 19th January, between 4 and 5 o'clock—I might have been there a few minuses before, but I know I was there at 4 o'clock precisely—Sergeants May and O'Brien, the prisoner, and myself, were then in the room, and the waiter coming in and out—just previous to 4 o'clock I ordered him to go and get himself dressed; he went and looked at his watch, and said it was 4 o'clock—I saw the watch—he then left immediately afterwards—the prisoner did not say anything to him as he left—I stopped there till 5 o'clock—two or three minutes before the prisoner went away I was called to the shop to serve some one, and whilst serving, he went away—I should say that was about half-past 4 o'clock—I saw him go out while I was sewing—I then returned to the room—no person was there then—I had only left the prisoner there when I went out to serve—the other two had gone—Sergeant May went first—he said he should not be more than twenty minutes away, and the prisoner said, "If you are only going to be away that time I shall wait, because I want to speak to you"—he did not stop till May came back; he only stopped till I was serving the customer, and while serving he went out—it is a double door, with a top and bottom half—he did not open the top door; I saw him go out under it—May had left there perhaps about ten or fifteen minutes—I did not miss the watch until the barman missed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known the prisoner long? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not very long—he came in occasionally with Sergeant May—I have no further acquaintance with him than that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Jury. Q.</hi> When did you last see the watch hanging there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At 4 o'clock I saw the barman looking at it—I never saw it after that—from the position the others were sitting in they could not get to the watch without my seeing them—the barman always hung the watch there to see the time—a stranger would have to go through three doors to get into the bar parlour—there is the entrance door, and a door to the shop where we sell the beer, and another into the bar parlour—the bar parlour is generally kept for what we call the staff of the regiment—civilians, when they come in, generally come in with those of the staff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GENT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After coming back from the shop, did you remain in the room till the prosecutor came back again into the bar parlour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After the prisoner went away, I went back again to the parlour, and no person came into the room till Sergeant O'Brien came back—I remained in the room from that time till the prosecutor came—my daughter also came into the room, and the servant brought in the tea-things—no strangers entered the room till Sergeant May came back and asked if the prisoner was there.</p>

               <p>open—it was shut when he went out on this occasion—the door is on the left hand side of the bar as you come into the shop, and then you have to turn to the left to get inside the bar—the door into the bar parlour is a double door—the top part is sometimes kept locked—there is another entrance down stairs from the other side of the place—the servant brought in the tea-things there—Sergeants May and O'Brien went out at the bar parlour door—I don't know whether they opened the upper door—you cannot fasten the top part from the outside—they might have gone out under the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner go out slily? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not think so—both doors were shut—I did not shut them—we always keep them shut—the sergeants could have shut them from the outside—I saw the prisoner go out—he did not go out as they generally go out—he went under the lower half—I just happened to see him when he went out at the bottom of the door—I did not speak to him as he was going out—I did not suspect anything—I have never seen any one else go out at the door in the same way—the officers are going in and out there all day—the door is opening and shutting all day—we always keep it shut—if the top part is open, the bottom part is generally shut—there is a bolt to the door.</p>

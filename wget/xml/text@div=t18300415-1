On the 2nd of March I had occasion to leave the chambers for a short time - I shut the inner door, and left the outer door open; I was not absent more than a quarter of an hour - I do not think it was more than ten minutes; I left nobody in the chambers - on my return I found a latch-key in the key-hole of the inner door; one key opens both doors - it is a Bramah's lock; the door was shut - I shortly after saw the prisoner about half way up on the second pair of stairs, with a bag and umbrella; our chambers are on the first floor: the bag and umbrella were Mr. Moody's - I asked the prisoner what he wanted there - he said he wanted Mr. Farrant; there is a Mr. Farrant living on that staircase - I asked what he did with Mr. Moody's bag; he said it was not Mr. Moody's - I said it was of no use to deny it, for the name was on it, on a brass plate, which was the case; I laid hold of his collar, and he dropped the bag and umbrella on the stairs - a scuffle ensued; he succeeded in getting out of my hands, and ran down stairs; I immediately followed him, and did not lose sight of him - he was secured, and brought back to the chambers - the bag and umbrella were found on the stairs, where he dropped them, and on his person was found some keys; and a pair of sugar-tongs belonging to Mr. Moody; most of the keys were for Bramah's locks, and of different sizes, the same kind as that in the door - the bag was opened, and contained a cloth cloak, worth eight guineas, and a great coat of master's, a black coat and a pair of boots of mine - I had seen the bag, umbrella, and sugar-tongs in the chambers ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, just before I left the chambers; Mr. Moody sleeps there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you left a notice on the door that you should return immediately? A. No - it was so short a time I did not think it necessary - nobody ran down stairs as I came in; the prisoner's way out if he had been in our chambers would be down stairs, but I suppose he heard me coming up; he was half way up the second floor stairs - Mr. Farrant lives on the third floor; I never saw the prisoner before - I had not double locked the door, but left it on the latch; the key in the lock was one of Bramah's - a common key would not open it I should think; I have one key, Mr. Moody and the laundress another - persons are constantly going up and down stairs; Mr. Moody has no other Christian name - it was not his key.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Could you get the key out of the lock again? A. We were obliged to get a blacksmith to get it out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As you went up stairs, would your footsteps be likely to be heard by a person close to the door? A. Yes, for I ran along the passage; if I had met him on the stairs I must have seen him with the bag. I have lived with Mr. Moody nearly four years - he has lived there all the time; I never saw the prisoner there before - if he had been employed there I should have known him.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was given into my charge - I have the property; here is the umbrella - there is a name outside the bag, on a brass plate, visible to any body; I found on the prisoner's person these sugar-tongs, and in different pockets these eleven keys, which I tried to several chamber doors - the cloak has the prosecutor's name inside; I found the cloak and great coat in the bag - the black coat and boots were not in it when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not a small brass plate? A. Yes; the prosecutor's servant claimed the things, and the prosecutor himself afterwards.</p>

            . I am certain this cloak and great coat are master's; I brush his clothes - his name is on the cloak, which is worth eight guineas, and the great coat 1l.; the black coat is mine, and worth 2s., and the boots 10s. - I am certain of these sugar-tongs; they were safe when I left the chambers; they are not silver - I have no mark on them; they were there when I left, and gone when I returned.</p>

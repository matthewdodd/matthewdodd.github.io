On Wednesday the 11th of February, at eight o'clock at night, I shut up my shop, and left the door latched, but not locked - I tried it myself, and am positive it was fast-it is a glazed door; I went into the back-parlour, and sat opposite the window which looks into the shop, I could see into it-in about half an hour I heard somebody in the shop, I got off my seat, and saw the prisoner through the window, standing on a chair in the shop, the boots hung over the chair, as soon as he heard me he jumped off the chair and ran out. There was a light in the shop. I immediately pursued and secured him. I missed a boot from over the chair, and found it just outside the door, in the way he ran; I am certain it was safe when I fastened the door-nobody had been in the shop before, I must have heard them if they had. Scoball gave me the boot-it is worth 1l. I never lost sight of the prisoner, and am certain he is the man.</p>

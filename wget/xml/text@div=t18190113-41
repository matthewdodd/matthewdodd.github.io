            . I am an inspector of bank notes to the Bank, and have been so above twenty years; experience enables me to distinguish good notes from bad. The Bank use a particular sort of paper. I have been in the daily habit of seeing the paper, and have seen an immense quantity of it - it is my business - I am acquainted with the character and texture of it, likewise the engraving, and the signatures of the different signing clerks - there is a watermark made in the fabric of the paper - (looks at the note uttered to Hopkinson) - it is not a genuine bank note - it is not bank paper, but an imitation of it; there is an imitation of the water-mark, which is put on after the paper is made. It is thinner than bank paper, and has a different appearance altogether; it is not the impression of the bank plate - the date line is engraved, but in a genuine note it is printed. It is signed J. Lambert, but is not his signature; I know it well, and am in the daily habit of seeing it. The other four notes are the same in every respect, and impressed from the same plate, the same date, and two of them are the same signatures. They are all different numbers, but the numbers consist of the same figures, 12,750, but are transposed - the numbers are printed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the bank ever use two notes of the same number and date - A. I believe it has happened - I have known three or four instances of it, it is not the practice, and is very unusual, and must arise from inattention to the machinery.</p>

The note uttered to Hopkinson is not my signature - here are two others bearing my signature, but I am certain they are not signed by me - no other person of my name is authorized to sign 5 l. notes.</p>
               <p>(The note was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Anderson's, and did not know the note was forged. I gave a false address, as I was out of a situation, and had been refused change, as I could not give a satisfactory address.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were not the parcels he had to take out in the warehouse? A. Yes, he had to take out five or six; these diapers were within three or four yards of them - he told me it was a mistake; he had been entrusted with considerable sums of money - I never had any quarrel with him; I have heard him complain that I imposed more work on him than I did on the other men, but I did not do so - he had got about one hundred yards from the door when I took him; I did not say before the Magistrates that it was twenty yards - I think not.</p>

            . Q.Were the parcels he was to take out directed? A. Yes, they were written on when the young men sold them in the shop; it was the prisoner's duty to put the parcels into the bag - I enter them in the book, and he calls them over.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Does he enter his parcels in a porter's book? A. No, they sometimes make a memorandum on a slip of paper; I had missed this parcel before I went after the prisoner - he did not call this over; I am not aware of any parcel being left behind which he should have taken out.</p>

                  </hi> I am a constable to the St. Katherine Dock Company—I know the prisoner. On the 13th of Aug. he came out of the Docks—I searched him, and found seven hanks of silk underneath a false crown of his hat—I produce the false crown, it is tin—the silk was curled round, and the false crown put close over it, so that you could not see the silk—the had a very shallow appearance—the silk weighs 8oz.—the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

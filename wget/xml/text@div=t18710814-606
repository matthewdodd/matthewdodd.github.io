I was apprehended, and the chief thing that took me out was to see my brother-in-law, who works in Gracechurch Street. I waited some time in Gracechurch Street for him, where I saw two police<lb></lb>men, and made myself known to them; one was Breeze, of the sixth division, and the other was named Dicks, who had been discharged from the first division, a few days before. Not seeing my brother-in-law, I took a walk over London Bridge, and in crossing the road from Deane's, I saw the telegraph boy running, and Sergeant Brett, whom I knew perfectly well, close behind him. Thinking he was running after the boy, I stopped him; the boy immediately said "Here it is, they would not give it to me at first," and he placed a bag in my hand. Sergeant Brett immediately arrested me, and said he should charge me with sending the boy with a forged cheque. I said "What nonsense, I am a police officer my<lb></lb>self." He told me his name, and what he was, and said I had better come to Bow Lane with him, where I was charged."</p>

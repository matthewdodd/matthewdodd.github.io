               <p>The prisoner came into the shop to buy a yard of linen, on Monday the 6th of February, and some lace lay on the counter, and at the same time I looked out the ribbon, I perceived her draw towards the lace box, I paid attention to her; in a little time I saw her draw a piece of lace out of the box, and convey it under her cloak, I then immediately charged her with it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220079"></xptr> and after that charge, I heard the lace drop down on the ground, it was rolled on a card, there were about a yard and an half, I went on the other side of the counter, and picked it up immediately, she asked me how I could think of taxing her with any such thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You are shopman to Mr. Earle? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>What sort of a shop is yours? - I do not not know, it is like most other haberdashers shops.</p>
               <p>You take that to be the answer I was seeking for? - I cannot say what you was seeking for.</p>
               <p>What sort of a shop is yours? - I cannot describe the particulars of the shop, it is a common size shop.</p>
               <p>How many men may be employed in it? - That is rather uncertain, according to the time of the year.</p>
               <p>Lightish, I suppose, like other shops? - There is plenty of light in it; I am sure there was never a piece of lace on the counter when the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Are you sure there was not one on the floor? - I did not go on the other side to see.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure of what you told me at first, that you saw the prisoner take it out of the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You sent for a constable? - Yes, I do not recollect what he said, I told him we had detected a woman taking a piece of lace.</p>
               <p>Did not the constable tell you, that from your story, you could not hurt a hair of her head? - He possibly might.</p>
               <p>Did he or not? - I will not swear he did not, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect giving this answer to it, that whether you could or not, you would bring her here, because you had lost so many things in the course of the year? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was not in the shop when this happened, I came down, and the woman was in the shop, and a part of the lace lay in the box, and Pinchard told me, that the woman came in for a yard of ribbon, and that he saw her take out the lace, and put under her cloak, and the constable informed me, that I could do nothing with it, that I had better let her go about her business, I said, I should not lot her go upon such terms.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - I gave an answer to this import, that as she had been detected of stealing it from me, I certainly would have her to Guildhall, and pursue her as far as the law would allow.</p>

               <p>I was constable.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take upon you to advise any body not to prosecute? - Mr. Earle told me he did not find the lace upon her; I said, then I doubted it would come to nothing.</p>
               <p>So you do not like to take charge of a person, and do your duty, unless you approve of the evidence? - I asked Mr. Earle, if he saw her take the property, he said, his young man did.</p>
               <p>Court. Learn your duty another time; your business is to execute the law, and to take charges.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff Sanderson. What ward are you constable for? - Bread-street ward.</p>
               <p>Do you serve in your own right, or as a substitute? - Substitute.</p>

               <p>I went to buy a yard of ribbon, and that gentleman said, I had taken something, and I said, I have nothing belonging to you, here is sixpence to pay for the ribbon; I told him I had two children at home, I might knock the card down, he accused me with taking two cards of lace; I said, if there is any dropped look for it.</p>
               <p>Court to Pinchard. Did you accuse her of taking two? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

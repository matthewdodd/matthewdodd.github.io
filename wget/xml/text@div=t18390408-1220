The prisoner lodged there—I quit<lb></lb>ted, on Tuesday, the 2nd of April, leaving my travelling-bag, containing my apparel and property, behind, in charge of Mrs. Harris, in the room where the prisoner lodged—I called on the Thursday, and found it in the next room—I examined it, and missed from it a white leather bag containing</p>

               <p>eleven sovereigns and one guinea, of the reign of William the Third—there was an incision on one of the sovereigns of George the Third, which I had often observed—the bag had been in a secret pocket of my waistcoat—I saw it the evening I left the lodging, between nine and ten o'clock—there was also a gilt brooch in the bag—I did not miss any thing else at that time—the bag was fastened with one string which I drew to—I found that partly open—I got a warrant the same day, to search Mrs. Harris's house, and Brand and Farrell, the officers, went with me—we found the prisoner in bed—Brand took his trowsers from the bed-side, and found ten sovereigns and five shillings in a purse—the prisoner put on those trowsers afterwards—one of the sovereigns I can identify, as one of the eleven I lost—while searching the room, the prisoner repeatedly expressed a strong desire to go down to the cellar to stool—Farrell told him directly Brand was at liberty he should go down with him, and after Brand had done searching, he told Farrell he could take the prisoner down to the cellar—accordingly Farrell attended him with a light, and I also followed down after, down to the floor over the cellar—the prisoner stopped at the water-closet, and made use of it—it is merely a place used to wash in—he afterwards returned to the room where Brand was waiting—I then asked Farrell, in the pri<lb></lb>soner's presence, would he attend me down to the cellar—he said, "Yes, that is the very place I want to <hi rend="italic">go.</hi> to"—we went down, and on searching the cellar, found, behind an old hamper, my white leather bag, containing my brooch—it was the bag which had contained my money and the brooch.</p>

                  </hi>. I accompanied Aldis and Brand to search the house.

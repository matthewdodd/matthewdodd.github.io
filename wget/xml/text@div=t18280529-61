On the 11th of May, in consequence of suspicion, the boxes of all the porters and servants were searched, and in the prisoner's box these articles were found; I believe the box was locked, and he kept the key - he opened it; I did not see whether he unlocked it or not; he said he bought them at a shop on Ludgate-hill, and mentioned the name, but I forget it; I said I was certain they were ours - he still persisted that he bought them, but at length he said he had taken them out of the shop at the time he was watching the premises; there was no threat or promise held out to him; I was there the whole time - he slept in the day, and watched at night; he had sixteen guineas a year, and board and lodging.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You are certain there was no promise or threat made? A. Yes - he has been four months in the service, and they had a three years' character with him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the commencement of it Mr. Evans was not there - Mr. Cross came to the room, and desired to search my box; I did not hesitate, and he turned everything out - Mr. Cross then called me aside and said if I would tell him the extent of the robbery, he would not expose me in public, nor proceed farther; I was afterwards taken by the officer - when I was in the watch-house, Mr. Evans came and asked if I could account for 2l. 15s. 6d. found on my person, and said he would not prosecute me - but I could not.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. I went to the watch-house concerning some money which he could not account for - when he came into our service he had about 4l. in his possession, and plenty of clothes - he had a larger wardrobe than myself; he came as porter first, and then was made private watchman, thinking him the most honest man we had.</p>

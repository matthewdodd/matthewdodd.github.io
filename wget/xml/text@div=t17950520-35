               <p>I had the care of the house the second of January.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know any thing of the prisoner at the bar? - She lodged with me seven weeks before I went. I was a lodger myself with Mr. Jarvis, No. 11, Charlotte-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the pay you for your lodging? - Yes, I had been in the house ten days before I saw that room unlocked in the two pair of stairs, the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked when you went into the house? - I believe not; but I did not go to see till I had been in the house several days.</p>
               <p>Before that day, you had not observed whether it was locked or unlocked? - Yes, before the tenth day I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the tenth day, did you observe it had been locked - Yes. It was then unlocked by a person, a friend of Mrs. Stents, who brought the key and unlocked the door; several ladies and gentlemen came to look at the house; it was to let. On the tenth day I went to the person that put me in the house, and told him I could not open the door. That person called on me the same day and came and opened the door; she came from him to me, and we opened the door with another key, then when we opened the door, we see the large trunk standing in the room, and a bundle laying in the chair, pinned up in a check apron; the person opened the bundle to shew me what was in it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stent. Her name was Helen, my mistress's sister's maid</p>
               <p>Q.What was in it? - Two silk gowns, two shifts lay at the top; I cannot pretend to say what more.</p>
               <p>Q.Were these the things that were stole? - They were part of them. The same week, on Thursday or Friday, I see the same two shifts.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you lock the door of the room after you had been in it? - No, I left it open; but I put the bundle in the wardrobe, which was not locked, in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you see the same shifts, where? - On the kitchen dresser, marked S. S. in red letters; the prisoner was out at that time, she came home in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that in the morning? - The same part of the day. In the afternoon she asked me if I had seen a couple of shifts lay there? I said, God bless me, yes; and I told her that I thought they were some of the same that were in the bundle up stairs, that I had put them in the ban box that stood just by. She stood a while, and said, they were marked with S I told her, yes, which made me think that they were some of the same that were in the bundle up stairs. She said no more to me nor I to her that time; she took them out of the band box, and went out of the house immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You see her take them out of the band box? - I did. She came home at night. The Sunday after she went into Wales; after she was gone I missed the bundle; she came on Sunday and was to call back to bid me good by; in the afternoon; when she came, I taxed her with taking the shifts; she said she knew nothing of the bundle, she never see them, and she said, as to the shifts they were her own, she had a dozen of the same, and that the woman, Mrs. Pottle, knew where she had left her box; I told her I would swear to the shifts, that they were the very same that I had seen in the bundle, and that they were marked with red letters; she said, her's were marked with blue, that she had brought them with an intent to mend them. She went away to go into Wales; the night before that the taylor brought her home a new riding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200113"></xptr>habit, and the bill with it, and it was five guineas, but she paid the man four guineas and a half for it; she said, that was what she had agreed to give his master for it. On Sunday she set off, and I did not see her any more till we took her up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You had the curiosity to examine into this bundle on the 10th of January? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did you first become acquainted with the prisoner at the bar? -About a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation of life were you in? - I was a lodger; I took in needle work. I believed I lodged in South Moulton-mews.</p>
               <p>Q. You know where the prisoner lived at that time; she lived at my Lord Kenggall's? - Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you received largesses of her as she could afford? - She had nothing to give; what I had from her came from her sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never had any thing from the prisoner herself? - I cannot recollect that really; I may have received small things that I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in such assluent circumstances that you cannot recollect a kindness that you received from a person almost a stranger to you? - I cannot say that I have received any thing of any kindness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, on your oath, that you cannot recollect? - I may have received something, but very small; I cannot say that I have received any.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed then as a single woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what apartment did the prisoner come to live in with you? - She asked me to let her come and live with me. I had a room to myself, rather small.</p>
               <p>Q. A room, I believe, that you paid three shillings a week for, in fact. Was the room furnished or unfurnished? - Unfurnished.</p>
               <p>Q. How many beds in the room? -One.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you support yourself? -At needle work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that was the only way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the prisoner first came and asked to lodge with you? - Yes, I am certain of it. I did say that I had engaged to pay three shillings a week, and that a young woman had promised to come with me into the room, and she did not come; then she asked me if I thought the bed was large enough for her to come?</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, that in consequence you was unable to pay the rent with ease? - I don't know but what I might, most likely I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you, on your oath, did not you ask her to come and live with you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.You have a child, I believe, and that child, at this period, was in the small pox, and you desired the prisoner would come with you into that house, and take care of that child? - I asked her if she would go with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us, that these two shiftslay on the kitchen dresser, and when the prisoner returned, she asked for these shifts? - She did. I told her, I thought they belonged to the bundle up stairs. She said, if I wished to have any further proof of her word, she would let me look into her boxes.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray, do you know whether Mr. Hawkins had any intention of returning to that house, or not? - It was to be let when I first went into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell, whether it was in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200114"></xptr>contemplation of Mr. Hawkins's mind to return to that house? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he ever return to it? -He did, after I came out.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SUGG sworn.</p>
               <p>I live opposite to the house where the robbery was committed, Mr. Hawkins's. I was then porter to Green and Constable. I saw the prisoner come out with the things, (I cannot say the day of the month) with two bundles, one under each arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day of the week it was? - I do not. I see her go round the corner with them; I see no more of her that day; and I see her another day carry a bundle up the street, the other way, up towards Vigo-lane.</p>

On the 28th of January last, I had a search warrant, to search two boxes, in No. 11, Charles-street, Grosvenor-square, in the apartment of Mrs. Pottle. When I went there, there was only one box. I asked where the prisoner at the bar was? Mrs. Pottle told me she was gone to Wales, but she could not tell me in what place. I searched that one box, and found nothing in it, but only rubbish. I never heard more of the prisoner till the 28th of last month. When I heard she was servant to a lady in Gower-street; I took her from there to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the lady's name? - Stimson. I searched her boxes there; I found nothing but only her own property; the prosecutrix was along with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have not any thing more to say, than that as soon as they accused me of the robbery, I came back to town; I told my prosecutrix before I went into the country, that if she was willing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200115"></xptr>search my box and disputed my word she might; she said she had no such opinion of me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Kelly. When had you notice of the robbery? - On the 24th of January, from the footman that came to town.</p>
               <p>Sugg. I forgot to mention that one of the bundles that I see her take out of the house was in a check apron, and the other in a pillow case, as it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you know it was in a pillow case? - I was right opposite to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This was publickly in noon day? - It was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

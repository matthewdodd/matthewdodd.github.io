About five o'clock, the prisoner came in, and asked for black ribbon - I shewed her some, and while she was looking at them, I heard something drop from her, which she stooped to pick up, and while stooping she dropped something else, and as she arose, she put a piece of ribbon on the counter, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150036"></xptr>soon after. I saw her put another piece on the counter. I suspected her, pushed her cloak back, and found another piece of ribbon between her arms and side. I told a young man who took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. She dropped something which she picked up, and before she could put the third piece on the counter you found the ribbon - A. No; she had plenty of time to put a dozen pieces down. The ribbon drawer laid before her, it was full, and they laid in regular order - they could not have got out by accident. I did not see her pick up her purse.</p>

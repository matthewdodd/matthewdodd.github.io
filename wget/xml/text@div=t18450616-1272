On the night of the 6th of June, about twelve o'clock, I came out of a public-house at the corner of Petticoat-lane, and saw Phillips—she asked me if I would stand a drop of anything—I said it was rather too late—she said, "Never mind, come over the way"—I said, "If you particularly want it, I have no objection"—I went over to another public-house with her—there was another female with her—I asked them to have what they wanted—they called for what they wanted, and I called for what I wanted—I took my purse out, took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out, and paid for it—I put my keys into my left trowsers pocket, and the change into my right—there were two sovereigns, seven half-crowns, and other money in my purse—I drank my ginger-beer, and we came away from the house—Phillips came away with</p>

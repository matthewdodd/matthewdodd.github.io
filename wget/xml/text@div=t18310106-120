The prisoner was in the habit of bringing beer and fetching pots from our kitchen, and did so up to the Monday before the 6th of January - I missed two silver spoons from the housekeeper's cupboard, about a fortnight before that - they belonged to my master, and were worth 12s. - the prisoner had been in the kitchen in the course of the afternoon when they were missed; I had seen them safe on the 18th of December, and missed them on the 19th - he had been in the kitchen on each of these days - here are two pieces of silver, which I believe are part of the spoons; they were the same as the housekeeper's; we had six of them, and there are only four now - I have brought one of them; these pieces seem to correspond with it - they all six corresponded with each other, and the four which remain are of the same pattern with these pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take them? A. No -I missed them on a Sunday from the kitchen; I never set them in the passage; I set them in the housekeeper's room till I washed them.</p>

            . I am a working-jeweller, and live in Davies-street, Berkley-square. On the 20th of December the prisoner came to our shop, and offered two spoons for sale, one broken in two pieces, and the other doubled up - I asked how he had got them; he said they were his own, and his mother had left them to him - he said he had broken them up for his own pleasure, and that he lived at the Bricklayer's Arms, Grosvenor-mews- I went there instantly; I was stating the circumstance to his mistress, and he came in and repeated the same story, that his mother had left them to him, and that he had two dozen more in his box; I felt satisfied, and said that when he came round I would give him the money for them - he came, and I said they came to 6s. 1d.; they were not so valuable as if they had not been broken - he refused to take the money, but took a pin which I had for 8s. 6d.; these two pieces are part of the one which was broken - the other I worked up; this is the spoon the witness has brought, and I have no doubt those I bought formed a part of the same set - there were the initials H. M. W. on them, and it was that excited my suspicion.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are there any marks on these pieces? A. No - I used up the pieces which had the marks, and had they applied a day later I should have used these.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said the pin I had was 8s. 6d., and it was but 7s.6d.? A. Yes, it was 8s. 6d., and you gave me 2s. 6d. - I gave you 1d. and said I would allow you 6s. 1d., which was more than I should if you had taken the money; I swear the pin was marked 8s. 6d. - I produced the ticket of it before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner at his master's house, in Grosvenor-mews, on the 3rd of January; I received these pieces of spoon from Mr. Medcraft - I was before the Magistrate, and what passed was taken down in writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of taking ale and beer to that gentleman's house, and one evening I saw something opposite the door, shining - it proved to be a gold brooch; I took it home - I said I supposed it belonged to some of the servants; I took it to the house, and one of the servants said it was his - he gave me 5s., and said he would give me a good Christmas-box; I went there on boxing-day, and before I had said a word he said, "I suppose you are come for your Christmas-box?" I said, "No, I don't think it right to ask for one;" he then said he would not give me one - I thought it odd; I went one morning, and saw a great number of spoons, six or seven dozens, and the footman's clothes there; I took the two worst spoons I could find, broke them up, and sold them to this gentleman - he allowed me 5s. 1d., but instead of taking the money I gave him 2s. 6d, which made 7s. 7d., for the brooch, and was the full value of it.</p>

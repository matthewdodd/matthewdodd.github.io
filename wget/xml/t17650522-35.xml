            . Between three and four o'clock on a Saturday, the man and his wife at the bar, and I, were going by this house in Suffolk-street; we saw a maid washing an entry; I saw a gold lac'd hat behind the door; I told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Kelley. About four or five months; we went out together with intent to rob. He bid me go in and take it; I said, I have no apron, and you have; you may go in and put it under your apron, and bring it; he went in and brought it out. Then we went into an empty house, and took the lace off, and went to Monmouth-street and sold a petticoat; then he gave me a shilling and the hat for my share; I got it dressed. (Producing a plain hat.) This is it; I told the constable where to find it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Isaac Kersey, of Leyton, in Essex, and am a dress-maker. I had some black satin sent to me to make up into a dress, the latter end of September—there ought to have been fifteen yards of it—it came at five o'clock one evening, and I measured it at nine the following morning—it then measured barely thirteen yards and a half—I mentioned it to the lady who had sent it—I afterwards went to Turner and Budd's, and had some conversation there—the prisoner was living servant with me—some days afterwards, after finding some lawn, I requested to look in her box—that was on the last day of Sept.—she emptied her box before me—I found in it some black satin, mousseline-de-laine, and cashmere—I put the satin into a drawer—the lady called in the afternoon, and I compared it with the dress—it corresponded in colour and quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the prisoner been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six months—she was not a work-woman—she had no right to meddle with these articles—I received this satin at five one evening—I cannot say what evening—I do not enter my dresses till I send them home—I might have two or three pieces of black satin sent in Sept., to make dresses—this piece came the latter end of Sept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure it was not the first week in Sept.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not sure of that—my husband brought it into the house—he is not here—I first saw it next morning about nine, in the work-room, brought to me by one of the apprentices—I saw my husband bring in the parcel at five, the preceding evening—it was to make up for Miss Wragg, of Walthamstow—she is not here—I expected fifteen yards—she said she should send the same quantity as she did before—after having measured it the next morn<lb></lb>ing, and found only thirteen yards and a half, I communicated it to the lady at eleven the same day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now just reflect a moment before you answer; will you swear you communicated anything about it to Miss Wragg for a fortnight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, within a week after I found it out—I believe I did the following morning—I cannot say the day I went to Turner and Budd's—I did not go to them the same day that I made the communication to Miss Wragg—I was ill, and did not go—I made the communication to Miss Wragg in her own house, when I went to fit the dress on—I cannot say how far Turner and Budd's is from Miss Wragg's—I did not pass it in going home—I cannot say when I went to Turner and Budd's—I am sure it was not so long as three weeks after—I first entertained suspicion of the prisoner about the last day of Sept.—I cannot say whether that was after I had been to Turner</p>

               <p>and Budd's—I did not make the dress with the thirteen yards and a half—I tried the body of it on before any other part was made, and then I told her there was not enough to make it up, and only thirteen yards and a half had been sent—I bought some more at Turner and Budd's, sufficient to make it up—I am quite sure the prisoner was present when I searched her box—there was no person present when her first box was searched—the satin and cashmere and mousselin-de-laine were found in that—she was pre<lb></lb>sent when her second box was opened—I am sure about that—my forewoman and the policeman were present—that was on the following day, and there were other articles found by the policeman—I have dismissed several of my servants before on suspicion of charges of this kind—I do not exactly know how many—it was about trivial things—this black satin was left in the show-room, which the prisoner is obliged to go through—the work-room is oc<lb></lb>cupied by persons who call—I do not know which of the young people left it there—my husband had brought it in, and it was delivered into the hand of the forewoman—she is not here—I did not see what she did with it, hut it was brought out of the show-room into the work-room the following morning by one of the apprentices—it ought to have been put in the show-room—at the time it was brought to me the string was off it, but when I saw the parcel in my husband's hand the string was on it—somebody must have taken it off—I do not know who did—my forewoman has been in my employ about four years—she was not in my employ all the time the other young persons were dismissed for little thefts—she left me fora short time, but there was no fault against her—I gave her warning to leave because I wished to have a milliner instead of a dress-maker for a short time—I have two other persons in my employ—neither of them are here—they, in common with the prisoner, have access to the show-room—the prisoner's boxes were in her bedroom—I believe no one else ever goes into it—I mentioned to my apprentices and forewoman that this satin was missed—the reason I had the prisoner's boxes searched was my finding a piece of lawn in her bedroom, amongst the dirty things—I usually sort out the things there if I am not busy, if I am the prisoner does it herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you saw this parcel in your husband's hand the night before tied, and the next morning it was brought to you untied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I found the deficiency the next morning, and took the body to fit on the same day—not the whole dress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Turner and Budd, linen-drapers, at Walthamstow—I sold some black satin to Miss Wragg—I afterwards saw two yards and two nails of black satin—I compared that with the black satin in our stock which I had sold part of to Miss Wragg—I found it corresponded with it exactly—I sold it on the 16th of Aug., and I made the comparison on the 2nd of Oct.—I sold fifteen yards and two or three nails to Miss Wragg.</p>

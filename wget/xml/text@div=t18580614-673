                  </hi>. I am watchman at the zinc works at the Surrey Docks. About 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, 9th May, I heard a noise in the store room, it was like the shutting of a window—the window slides on one side—I ran up, looked out of the window, and saw some one pass through the wicket gate which leads to the duck—the prisoner Beech would naturally remain on the premises, he was the watchman on duty that night—he should have had the key of that gate—we have no second key—his watch box is about twenty yards from the wicket gate on the further side to where I was—I went up into the store room, and found two layers of spelter had been removed—I had been in that place about 11 o'clock, after all the men had</p>

               <p>left—after missing the spelter I went to the wicket gate, and I found it shut—I stopped there some time; I heard the noise of spelter breaking, it came from the direction of the watch box—I went round and went to the other side of the wicket gate—I opened the large gates and went round—I heard nothing there—I did not go within twenty or thirty yards of the watch box—I did not see any one about then—I went back inside the wicket gate, I remained there some time, and I saw Beech and Winchester coming down from the Baltic yard, that was where some broken metal was afterwards found—they both came down and went together into Beech's watch box—Winchester had no right to be about the premises at that time—I went and gave information to Mr. Fletcher, and then went on with my work inside—in about twenty minutes afterwards Mr. Fletcher and I went to the watch box; Mr. Fletcher went in, I went just to the door, I did not go right in—after Mr. Fletcher went away, I went through the large gates, and back to the wicket gate—I then saw Beech by the watch box door, and Winchester coming from a barge into the Rice Mill yard—I heard two splashes in the water, but I saw nothing go in—the sound appeared to come from near where Winchester was—I saw nobody else near that place—the prisoners afterwards went down to the gate and were detained.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the oxyde and zinc manufac<lb></lb>tory. There is a passage which is common to my employer and the Rice Mills—there is a large pair of gates, which ought to be closed from Saturday evening till Monday morning—Beech was the watchman there—there is only one key of the gates—they are within the Surrey Docks—if you want to get access to the front or back entrance, you must go through the gates—both the prisoners are in the employ of the Rice Mills—I believe Beech has been so for about twelve months—on 9th May, I was called up about 3 o'clock in the morning—I dressed myself, and came down—I went into the works with the last witness—I went into the store room we keep the spelter in; I missed seventeen or eighteen plates of metal off the piles—I went down to the front entrance, and made inquiries—I went back to the works, and went with the last witness to the watch box; I saw Beech standing in front of it, leaning over the half gate—I said to Beech, "Have you any objection to my search<lb></lb>ing the watch box; I have lost something, and I wish to find it;" he mut<lb></lb>tered out what I conceived to be an oath—he came out, and I went in—I found Winchester lying on his back on the bench, pretending to be asleep; the bench is about 3ft. 6 in. or 4ft. long—he lay with his knees up—I shook him two or three times, in order to wake him; he pretended to be asleep, and half drunk—he rolled off the bench, and went outside—I searched, and, at the head of the bench, I found a bag containing a number of new brass bearings—the weight of the bag was about 25lbs. or 26lbs.—the bearings had never been used; they were cast from a pattern, and are such as are used in the Rice Mills works—the two prisoners still remained outside—they saw what I was doing—I opened the bag, and I said to Galland, "You are wit<lb></lb>ness</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185806140082"></xptr>
               <p>to what is here"—there were three different sorts of bearings; two of them were runners, with holes in them, and there were circular bearings, and the others were bearings of the ordinary description—I closed the bag and put it back, and under the bench I found another bag, with two new bearings in it, weighing 5lbs. or 6lbs.—when I took the bag, Beech said, "You will not take that away, they are not your property"—I replied, "I am aware of that, they are not mine, nor are they yours, you have no right to have them in your possession, they are the Rice Mills' property"—I then left the place, and requested Galland to watch—I went to Mr. Pepper who lives next to me—I roused him up, stated what I had found, and requested him to come with me—we went to Mr. Steaton and to the watch box, and saw Winchester, who appeared to be fast asleep on the bench—Mr. Pepper roused him up, and asked him what he had there; he stated he had come to pump Henry Yates' barge out—I picked out the bag of bearings, and missed two different ones; one of the runners with the hole in it, and one of the circular bearers—I challenged the prisoners with having taken a portion of these bearers away while I was gone for Mr. Pepper; they denied it—Mr. Pepper asked Beech how he came in possession of these bearers; he said about half past 1 o'clock, he heard a noise and went and opened the wicket gate and found the bearers just inside—I replied, "How was it you did not find them last night, when you came on duty, in broad daylight?" He made no reply to that—Mr. Pepper took the bag and bearers, and conveyed them to the station—I heard Beech given in charge, he said, "For God's sake Mr. Pepper what shall I do; for my poor wife's sake I beg that you will look it over"—Mr. Pepper said he could do nothing of the kind, he must do his duty—he made use of the same expression to me, and I made a similar reply—I went to Winchester's house and the policeman found a quantity of metal; I should say 7 lbs. behind an old bedstead in the yard—I was present when Beech's house was searched, and a piece of leather was found with a brand on it—from information, I went to Baltic wharf, and found a labourer who had found, secreted under the timber, fifteen pieces of metal—I was not present when they were found, but they were not removed, and I went and saw them there—they were brought away by my direction, they weighed 3qrs. 24lbs.—on 11th May, there was found at the back of the watch box in the soil three brass bearings, and a hammer was found in the stoke hole of the Rice Mill—on the 20th there were nine pieces of spelter found, and four brass bearings, and amongst them was the circular brass bearing that was in the bag when it was first seen by me on the morning of the 9th.</p>

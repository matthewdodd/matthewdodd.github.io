                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Fetter-lane. On the 15th of January I had a bag of Ceylon coffee, an original package—I missed it—it was placed four yards from the door, in the shop—it is my dwelling-house—we had roasted some coffee out of it the night before—I know the bag from the mark on it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking that evening? - A. I had been at my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking at all? - A. No; the last that I drank was tea that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking liquor to any excess in the course of the day? - A. No, I had not, I was perfectly sober; I was going down George-court, into off-alley; I put my hand in my pocket and felt my half-guinea then; I had a half-crown besides in my waistcoat pocket; I went into the parlour with her, and I felt the half-guinea after I was in the parlour; after that I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket; the half-guinea was in my left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you changed it from one pocket to the other after you first felt it? - A. No; upon feeling her hand in my pocket, I asked her what she was at, and missed my half-guinea, I was lying with her upon the sofa; I got up immediately, and charged her with having taken a half guinea out of my pocket, and she said it was a damned lie, the immediately clung round me, and rung the bell.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you be sure that this half-guinea had not dropped out of your pocket on the sofa? - A. I do not think it did; we looked round upon the sofa, but did not see it there; Mrs. Davis, who keeps the house, then came in; soon afterwards, Mr. Davis came in; I told her that this person had robbed me of half-a-guinea, and she said the had a better opinion of her than that.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know their names were Davis? - A. I was informed so by the neighbours, then Mr. Davis came in, and he asked if I had called for any wine, Mrs. Davis answered no; Mr. Davis said, if he has not called for any wine, I shall charge him for the room, a pint of wine will be only eighteen-pence, I shall charge him eighteen-pence an hour for the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there at that time? - A. I might have been in about a quarter of an hour; he asked me whether I would pay eighteen-pence an hour for the room, and I told him I would not; then he desired the prisoner to tear all my clothes off my back, if she did not, he would her's.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was by all this time? - A. Yes; then Mrs. Davis came and took hold of me by the collar, Mr. Davis immediately struck me with such violence, with a bludgeon, that it quite stunned me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you lay hold of them when you took up this woman? - A. His house is indicted, and he got out upon bail, and his wife; I got round them, my shirt was tore, and the skirt of my coat was tore off, and the prisoner called out, damn him, kill him, a rascal.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that came from the prisoner? - A. Yes; I was quite in danger of my life, and I cried out, murder, several times; I got to the door some how, I cannot tell how; some persons knocked at the door several times, upon hearing me cry murder; here is a witness here that saw Mr. Davis with the bludgeon held up to me at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the half-guinea had not fallen out of your pocket? - A. I am very sure.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you searched the sofa, upon which you were lying, to see that it had not fallen out? - A. As soon as Mrs. Davis came in, I looked upon the sofa, but did not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not searched? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130130"></xptr>Q. How soon after was the prisoner apprehended? - A. On Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this that you were at the house? - A. On Sunday; I had taken out a warrant at Bow-street, against Mr. Davis, for insulting me on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to take out a warrant against the prisoner on Monday? - A. I did not know her name, and when I went to her on Tuesday, the prisoner had got a warrant against me for insulting her; I applied to St. Martin's watch-house the same night, and they could not give me any reply.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you apply to the watch-house about? - A. For the insult of Mr. Davis, and they referred me to Bow-street next day, and I took a warrant out against Davis; he appeared at the office on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take out a warrant against Mrs. Davis too? - A. Yes; I did on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge the prisoner the first time you went to Bow-street, or tell the story of any woman that robbed you in the house? - A. Yes; I did, on the Monday, but I did not know her name.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to say, that it could go in no other way than by her taking the half guinea out of your pocket? - A. No other way.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You have said the prisoner has robbed you of half-a-guinea; you had it in your pocket, and, after sitting upon the sofa, you missed it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You missed the half-guinea while you were lying upon the sofa? - A. I missed it immediately after I felt her hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. It was after Mrs. Davis came in that you examined the sofa? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What light had you, and who assisted you, in that examination? - A. As soon as Mrs. Davis came in, I related to her that the prisoner had robbed me; she said she had a better opinion of her; and we searched the sofa, me, Mrs. Davis, and the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who held the candle? - A. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any hands upon the sofa besides your's? - A. Yes; Mrs. Davis's hands were round the sofa.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not Mrs. Davis have found this half-guinea upon the sofa, if it had been dropped? - A. No; I did not see any thing taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. You are confident in the opinion, that the prisoner took it out of your pocket; but supposing you are mistaken, and the half-guinea had dropped out of your pocket upon the sofa, might not Mrs. Davis, drawing her hands over the sofa, have taken up that half-guinea? - A. I do not think it dropped out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. But supposing it had so dropped out of your pocket, whether Mrs. Davis might not have taken it up in her hand? - A. I did not see her take any thing up.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. If you were so certain she had taken it out, how came you to search the sofa at all? - A. Mrs. Davis desired me to search it.</p>
               <p>Q. Not that you searched the sofa upon any doubt of your own, whether it was there or not, but that Mrs. Davis desired you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. When did you see the half-guinea last with your eyes? - A. I saw it about a quarter of an hour before I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Because I might fancy I had half-a-guinea in my pocket when it was only a farthing? - A. I had pulled it out at the house of call; I was at the Angel in St. Martin's-lane, with some silver; I put the half-guinea in my breeches pocket, and the silver in my waistcoat; pocket; half-a-crown and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay any silver when you took out the half-guinea? - A. No; I took it out to see if my money was there; I paid for a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You took out this silver and the half-guinea together, at the Angel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember telling my Lord, ten minutes ago, that you had drank nothing but your tea? - A. I had my tea about seven o'clock, and I had my porter about half past eight, with a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular reason to count your money, and separate it in this way, in different pockets? - A. Because I should not lose the half-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mean to lose the half-crown, did you? - A. I did not mean to pull out the silver and gold together.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us a long story about Mr. Davis and you, and a quarrel, in which he treated you ill; Mr. Davis did not come into the room till it was all over, and after you had searched the sofa? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your quarrel with Mr. Davis did not apply to the half-guinea at all? - A. No; that was because I would not pay for the room; the half-guinea was named to Mr. Davis as soon as he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned it to him, you mean to swear? - A. I heard Mrs. Davis mention it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say one word about it? - A. He said it was a damned lie; he had done no such thing as lost the half-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of being with this girl upon the sofa; at the time you were upon the sopha, did you give her any thing at all? - A. No; nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pay for the room, nor any thing else in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on Sunday night; and the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130131"></xptr>morning you want to punish Mr. and Mrs. Davis; how came you not to go to punish this young woman? - A. I did not know her name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take out a warrant against her till she had taken out one against you? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by the prisoner having a warrant against you? - A. Mr. Davis persuaded her to get a warrant against me for my insulting of her.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you present when any thing of that kind passed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know any thing about it. The fact was, the prisoner had taken out a warrant against you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you brought to appear there? - A. I was there the next morning against Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you brought before the Magistrate by any warrant? - A. When I was there, the warrant was served upon me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is that warrant? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What was it for? - A. For insulting her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing done upon that warrant against you; were you bound over? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I am a glass-grinder; I live at No. 3, Off-alley: On Sunday evening the 27th of December, I was going past No. 15, in the same alley that I live in, nearly opposite; I heard a dreadful cry of murder, several times; I was persuaded by a woman in the court, to go and knock at the door, for she thought murder would be done; I went and knocked at the door, the door was soon after opened, I cannot say who it was that opened it; I knocked a rat-tat at the door; I saw Wilson engaged with two or three women; Davis, the man of the house had a large bludgeon in his hand, as if he was going to strike the man; soon after the door was opened, Wilson ran out of the house, at least he was pushed out by the woman; when I had got him out into the court, I took him into a neighbour's house, to see what injury he had received; I saw that he had received a blow upon his forehead, and likewise that his shirt and cloths in general were very much torn; I told him his best way would be to go to the watch-house, and state his case there, he being a stranger to me, he went up to the watch-house, I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him engaged with two or three women? - A. I am positive there were two; they were handling him very roughly; pulling him about with their hands; and striking him; Mrs. Davis was one, I don't know the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, from the time you got admission, see any woman whom you recollect, except Mrs. Davis? - A. Not that I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What did the man complain of? - A. I did not hear him mention that he had lost any money, till he came before the Magistrate, on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him between the Sunday and the Tuesday? - A. No; I saw him on the Tuesday, before I went to the Magistrate, between eight and nine o'clock, I think it was; I did not hear him mention it before he got to the office.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. And he was in your house some time, was not he? - A. He was in a neighbour's house, some time.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOOTLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a taylor; I live at No. 2, opposite to Mr. Davis's, in Off-alley, within one house: On Sunday evening, the 27th of December, a little before nine, I was sitting by my own fire-side; I heard an alarm in the neighbourhood; I directly got up in half a minute, and went to the door; we know pretty well where to look for it; and I saw the prosecutor cross the alley, into a neighbour's house, Mrs. Smith's, a single woman, opposite Mr. Davis's; I directly went into the same house, to this man, and he was in a situation, that, to speak reasonably, he could not speak; he seemed so far out of breath and confused, with the ill-treatment he had met with; I asked him, what was the matter; he said, he was robbed of half-a-guinea; I saw his watch-chain hanging down low; I said, it was a wonder he had not lost that; he made answer, that he should have lost it, but for a hole that the chain went through; I went out in about a minute after, and saw the skirt of the man's coat chucked out, by a woman; but whether it was Mrs. Davis or not, I cannot say; we persuaded him to go to the watch-house, and they would not have any thing to do with it: On Monday he got a warrant against Mrs. Davis; but it was not executed till Tuesday morning; Davis was brought up before the Magistrate; I was there; this is a terrible bad house; I went round among my neighbours, to ask them to go home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you heard the prisoner say any thing? - A. I will tell you; I went to see for the prosecutor; I had never seen him before the Sunday night, in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? - A. Mr. Davis persuaded her to take out a warrant against that man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present? - A. No; we went before Mr. Justice Bond; and the case was laid down upon the warrant she had taken out for the man; and then it was brought forward, as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, he said, he was robbed of half-a-guinea? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was any body with you, when he said that? - A. I was at No. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130132"></xptr>Court. Q. You will swear that you heard it? - A. I will; if I was going to die this moment; the girl is very much to be pitied; but her landlord is a most infamous man, and her landlady a most infamous woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am quite innocent of the charge; he neither mentioned the losing of any money to me, or my landlady.</p>

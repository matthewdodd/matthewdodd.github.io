                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160013"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did you take possession of the hay? A. Yes, and showed it to Mr. Moate - he did not say he could not swear to it; Crockett, a person in his service, appeared as a witness, who has been since discharged - he was not in custody: he was not bound over at all - I have since ascertained that at this very time, that man had the keys of the place where the hay was kept; I have heard from the neighbours that Hooper is a respectable person, and that he keeps a horse and cart, but I do not know that he worked at the factory - Hooper told me that it was for a horse that had worked on the factory, and he showed me the horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know when Crockett was discharged? A. I believe the day this affair occured.</p>

Haydon was in my employ, for about ten years; he had been discharged once for a few months - I know nothing of Hooper; no horse belonging to the factory was kept in Hooper's-court, and no horse that I fed there - Hooper was not employed in any way in my service; Haydon was out early, as he was going to Bromley, and it was necessary to set out soon - he ought not to have taken more than one sixth part of a truss of hay; I saw the hay at the office, and I believe from the quality that it was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON, Q.Will you swear it was your hay? A. I can only speak to the resemblance of it - to the best of my knowledge I believe it was mine; Haydon was my <rs id="t18290716-22-deflabel128" type="occupation">carter</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Did not Crockett and Haydon sleep next to each other? A.Crockett lived near the premises, but not Haydon - Crockett must have gone to the place; I have my hay from my brother's farm, and his servants bring it to me - the key of the hay was in Crockett's care; there were none of the doors broken.</p>

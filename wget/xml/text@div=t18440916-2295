About two o'clock on the afternoon of the 17th of Aug., I saw the two prisoners, with another person, at the foot of London-bridge—I watched their movements, and saw them follow Mr. Hammond—I saw the back of Brown's arm, as though his hand was going into Mr. Hammond's pocket, but they pressed against two females at the time, so that I did not see the handkerchief pass, but directly afterwards the prisoners turned round, and ran away—I went and spoke to Mr. Hammond, and pointed out the pri<lb></lb>soners—I followed the officer, and he took them—I did not see the hand<lb></lb>kerchief picked up, but I saw it after it was picked up—I did not see the handkerchief on the spot where the prisoners were taken into custody.</p>

On the 16th of July I was in Oxford-street, three men accosted me, the prisoner spoke first; he said, he had just come out of Gloucestershire, and had received 12,000l. He said he was going to stop in town a few days, and wished to lodge his money in some safe hands. I recommended him to Messrs. Mastermans and Co. the bankers - I did not know any of them before. They said they were all strangers to each other, and did not know the way to Lombard-street. I said I was going through the city, and would shew it to them. I went about half a mile with them. The prisoner said, "Let us go into a public-house, and see if we have got the money, or we shall look foolish when we get to the banker's." I at first refused to go in, they said they should not be long. I went into the Spread-eagle, in Broad St. Giles's. The prisoner ordered a pint of beer, I paid for it. He went into the back-room, I followed him, the other two followed me. They stopped at the end of the table - I was on the other side. I thought they were going to count the money. They began quarrelling among themselves. They proposed to put down 5l. each - I did not put down my 5l. The prisoner said, "Come, put down 5l." - I asked him why? and said I had not got 5l. I began to think I was in bad company, and said I had only got 3l. - they told me to put that down - I put it down on the table. The prisoner gave me a piece of chalk, and said, "Now chalk;" I said I would not, as I knew nothing about chalking. He said, "Chalk any thing." I chalked the figure 3 on the table. He turned round and spoke to the others, and then turned back and picked up my three 1l. notes - They were very close together; he gave them to the other man, who said he came from Gloucester. One of them picked up the other notes (as I supposed them to be), and went out - I followed them. A man asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him the prisoner had taken 3l. from me - He ran after him and stopped him. I am sure the prisoner is the man who took the notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I have been thirtyone years in my place. I was not to have any thing for my trouble. They said nothing about hiding the figure under the hat. I put the money down through fear - I did not lay a wager.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH, I am a beadle of St. Giles's. On the 16th of July, I was just by the Spread-eagle, and saw them go in - I waited on the outside. In about a quarter of an hour a little man, in black, came out in a very great haste; after him came the prisoner, and next to him the prosecutor, who seemed agitated. I asked him if he had lost any thing? he said he had been robbed of 3l. I asked him which man it was? He said it was the prisoner; I laid hold of him-the other made his escape. The prisoner said "Nonsense! don't take me-I'll take care the man's money shall be made good, and you shall have a handsome present for yourself." I took him into custody, and found a pocket-book on him, with 1l. 10s. in it. He called me aside, and said, "For God's sake don't take me before a magistrate. I'll give you 20l., and the man's money shall be made good to him. I will produce a friend in ten minutes who will settle it." I found four flash notes in the prisoner's box, a bill for 395l., and some imitations of 2l. notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prosecutor said he had been robbed of the money.</p>

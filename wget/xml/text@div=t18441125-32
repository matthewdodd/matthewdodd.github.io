                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in West-street, Devonshire-street, Bethnal-green. On Saturday night, the 17th of Nov., I was in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, between two and three o'clock, and met the pri<lb></lb>soner, and went home with her—I remained with her till nine o'clock on the Sunday morning—I then went away, with the intention of leaving her—we fell in with a few friends, and stopped out till three o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, and between three and four I returned home with her again—about six o'clock I gave her 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to make me some tea—I then had two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and two half-crowns, in my left hand waistcoat pocket, in a little bag—I know I had it then—she had handled the money two or three times in her room—I had been drinking a little beer in the day, but nothing to hurt—I was not the worse for liquor—I laid down on the bed, and happened to drop off to sleep—she was in the room at the time—I awoke up at eight o'clock—she was then gone, and my money also—it was taken out of my pocket—the door was locked, and I was locked in—I was determined to wait for her, knowing she must come back, as it was her own room—I waited quietly, and she came back at three o'clock in the morning, very tipsy—I asked her for the money she had taken out of my pocket—she abused me—I said if she gave me the money back, I did not mind if she had spent half-a-sovereign, I did not want to have any bother with her—she brought two more females back with her—there were other persons in the house at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When he sat in the tap-room asleep his shopmate was with him; I told him to awake him up, and come home with me; he said he had money, held up his bag two or three times, and said there was more than silver or copper there; what it was I do not know, but I persuaded him to come home with me, as there was a very low set in the tap-room, and we were both very tipsy; we were together all day.</p>

About three o'clock, on the Monday morning, I was called to the prisoner's room, and the prosecutor gave her into my custody, charging her with stealing two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and two half-crowns—she said what money she had got was her own money—I searched her at the station, and found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on her, all in silver and copper—there were six half-crowns and one five<lb></lb>shilling piece.</p>

On the morning of the 1st April' I was in the East India Dock Road, about 1.15—the prisoner and another man passed me, and I saw something sticking out of his coat—I followed him and asked what he had underneath his coat—he said "Nothing," and at the same time put his leg between mine, and we both fell, and as we did so this cash-box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dropped out—as we were on the ground I made a grasp at the bos, and the prisoner's companion made a rush for it too—I rolled over on to the box and kept it—his companion knocked my hat off, and my lantern was knocked away too—at the station I opened the box in the presence of the inspector—in it was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. ll 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some of the silver was wrapped up in tea paper; on the tea paper was the name Welsh &amp; Co.—I was at once sent to their premises, and called out the manager—I found an entry had been effected by thieves through the upstairs window at the back—I examined the shop, and found that the till had been <hi rend="italic">got</hi> out by the woodwork being cut away—the look was still "shot"—a large bacon knife, which was found in another place, had evidently been used to cut away the woodwork—I found the barred door at the back unlocked, and the back door unbolted—the manager and I then returned to the police-station—he identified the stolen property—the prisoner was charged at the station with the burglary.</p>

I was at the station when the constable Melluish brought in the prisoner—he handed me this cash<lb></lb>box—I asked the prisoner to account for it, and he said a man had been to his sister's house and taken tea with him, and he had gone down Canning Town and waited an hour and a half, I think, and brought this cash-box to him—I forced open the cash-box, and found a tea paper inside stating the name of Welsh &amp; Co., 89, North Woolwich Road, Canning Town—I sent the officer to this place, and he discovered what has been related to you.</p>

On the 25th of December, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in the stable, waiting for a coach; my watch was in my fob. I knew the prisoner before; she came in the stable to me; I do not know how she came in; I was between asleep and awake, and saw her running away. I missed my watch, and saw it in her hand. I did not feel her take it, or know that she was there, till I saw her running away. I pursued, but could not overtake her. I did not call Stop thief! I knew where to find her, and went after her, but she was not there. She was taken on the Sunday evening; she said she had not seen my watch. I have been at her lodgings three or four times, and she came twice to me at the stable. I have often seen her at the public-house.</p>

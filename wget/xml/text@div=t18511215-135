                  </hi>. I am a builder, living at 24, Devonshire-street, New, ington-causeway. On Monday, 3rd Nov., about 12 o'clock at night, I was walking in the Borough-road, towards the Borough—when I got to South-wark-bridge-road I crossed to the right hand; as I crossed I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming along the road towards the Borough; it was going very fast indeed, the horse was at the full gallop; there was a man on the box driving; he was whipping the horse as fast as he could, and the horse was galloping as fast as it could—I believe the driver was the prisoner, because I saw him afterwards in custody at the station—I saw a chaise coming in the opposite direction; it was on its proper side of the way—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was on the right<lb></lb>hand side going down, that was its wrong side; the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> ran foul of the chaise, the left hand wheel of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> caught the left wheel of the chaise, threw it down, and broke the shaft—I ran and caught hold of the horse's head—there were two gentlemen in the chaise—when I ran and caught bold of the horse's head, they had been thrown out, and were down underneath the horse and the chaise too; it was an open gig—I think the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was about a yard from the kern when the accident happened—it went between the chaise and the kern, and the left wheel of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> caught the right wheel of the gig—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was stopped, and Mr. Stagg gave the prisoner in charge—I think he and the two gentlemen had all bad something to drink, but they were not tipsy—the gig was going at a moderate pace; I should think about five or six miles an hour, the horse was only trotting—I told the prisoner when he was stopped that he ought to be ashamed of himself, for driving at such a rate as that—he said it was not his fault; it was the other parties that drove into him—it is all a straight road, and very wide—there was no other car<lb></lb>riage</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman, in the Borough-road. About 12 o'clock on the night in question, I was standing at the north-west corner of the Southwark-bridge-road, and saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> going towards the Borough; it appeared to be going at a rate between nine and ten miles an hour, the horse wan galloping—I did not observe whether the cafe man was striking it or not—he was on his wrong side of the way—I cannot swear it was the prisoner—I heard a crash, and went to see what it was, and about 80 or 100 yards from where I was standing, I observed a gig lying in the middle of the road with the shafts broken—the horse was being held by the last witness, and near the kerb, on the wrong side, was the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the horse down—I went with the parties to the station—Mr. Stagg and the deceased were the parties who I understood were in the gig, and were thrown out—they stated, in the cabman's presence, that they were pitched out—he replied that they were on the wrong side of each other, and that in endeavouring to pass they were undecided, and so the collision occurred—the two parties in the gig appeared to me to be the worse for liquor, the cabman appeared as sober as he is now—he observed at the time, that he believed had the parties been sober they would have kept their course and allowed him to go past on the wrong side—I believe he said that he bad pulled on the wrong side, under a lamp—he was on his wrong side—I heard the deceased say at the station, that it was a lucky thing he had not broke his neck—that was in the prisoner's presence—he said something about his having been struck in the side, and he did not know but his ribs were broken—he did not complain of pain at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a yeast and spirit-merchant; the deceased was my clerk—his name was Thomas Johnson—he was with me in my chaise—I was driving—I bad had about two glasses of gin during the evening—I was as sober as I am now, and quite as capable of taking care of myself and my horse—Johnson was quite sober—we got into the Borough-road—we were on the proper side close to the kerb—I observed a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming in the opposite direction at a pace of ten or eleven miles an hour—I saw it before it came up—the near shaft struck my horse on the near side, right below the arm; it has been laid up ever since—I was not nearer the kerb than he was, because he came inside me—I was put on the off-side by his coming—he was on the wrong side of the way—the collision broke both my shafts off and knocked my chaise down—Mr. Johnson and I were thrown out—he fell between the cab and the chaise—he told me he was very sore in his inside, but when I took him home he thought he was better—I do not think that he was drunk—he had had the same as I had, and I know I was not drunk—I should think there was ten clear yards of road on the other side of me, besides what I occupied—there was nothing as far as I could see to prevent the cab going in the proper direction—my horse was going at about five, or six miles an hour—that was the <hi rend="italic">tiptop</hi> speed of it at that time—Mr. Johnson was 53 years old.</p>

               <p>he could not be found—the deceased was living with me at that time, not in the same house—I sent for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and took the deceased home—I stripped him, and examined him—he told me his injuries, and he went to the hospital next morning—as I took him home, he stopped at the Flying Horse, and asked for a drop of brandy, which I gave him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house-surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The deceased was brought there on the morning of 4th Nov.—he complained of a pain in his right side, in the situation of the liver and kidneys—he was suffering from haemorrhage of the urinary organs—he died on 16th Nov.—I afterwards examined his body—there was extensive lacera<lb></lb>tion of the right kidney; the liver was diseased, and there were three ribs broken—I cannot say whether the diseased liver was the effect of the injury, or any other can—he had jaundice, and it might have come on from internal causes—the cause of death was the laceration of the kidney—the three broken ribs might have had something to do with it—it must have been the result of outward violence—there was no appearance of outward violence—laceration of the kidney is easily produced; it might have been produced by being thrown out of a gig—that is a probable cause, especially if it was with such violence as to break three ribs at the same time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I took a fare to the Surrey Theatre, and was coming up the Borough-road on the near side; there was a wagon before me; I passed it, and, before I had time to get to the other side, there was a chaise, coming down; I pulled to the off, to avoid them, and called to them, but they paid no attention to the hallooing I made, and came right on my horse's shoulder; they knocked my horse down, and cut a wound in his shoulder, an inch and a half wide, and three inches deep; their wheel cut my wheel, which knocked them back in their chaise, and their horse fell, and knocked the shafts off; my shafts never touched their horse; it was their wheel which did it; I had stopped at the time they came on me; they did not know where they were going to; they were first on one side, and then on the other; a young man who lodged with the deceased, and paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night for his lodging, somewhere in St. George's-in-the-East, can prove that he had been an out-patient of St. George's Hospital some months; and the veterinary surgeon who came up and dressed their horse, and the sergeant who was at the station, can speak as to their state.</p>

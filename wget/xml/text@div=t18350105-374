                  </hi>. I live in Marylebone, and have a partner. The prisoner was in our service; on the 19th of December one of our men said he should like his hat to be taken off—he refused, but the man took it off, and found in it this two yards and three-eighths of kerseymere—I asked how he came by it—he said it was not mine—I repeated the question, and he said it was mine, and that he had cut it off a piece—I compared it, and it matched exactly—there was some cloth found in his box, which I cannot swear to; but I had lost some.</p>

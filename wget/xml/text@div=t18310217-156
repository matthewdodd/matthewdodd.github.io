            . I produce these gloves and handkerchief, and the key of the box, which were found in the prisoner's trunks.</p>
               <p>MR. HOPKINS. These gloves and handkerchief were taken from the prisoner's trunk, up stairs, in the dressing-room; the prisoner said they were mine, but I have no mark on them - these half-crowns have my mark on them, and the half-sovereign had a little mark at the end of the A, which I saw - I did not put any mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner say, "This handkerchief is mine?" A. No. he said, "It is yours, Sir;" I had not left any sovereign in the desk - the cashier, generally, takes out all the money at eight o'clock; he did so that night, but I was not there - I put the money into the desk, between eleven and twelve; the prisoner might have access to the desk, but he had no business there - he did not say, in my presence, that he had put a sovereign in, and taken the change out - I had a very good character with him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it possible for him to have put a sovereign into the desk? A. I counted all that the desk contained when I marked the money; the sum total was about 2l. 15s., and from that 17s. was abstracted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

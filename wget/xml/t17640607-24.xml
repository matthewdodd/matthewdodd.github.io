I felt, and found I had lost my handkerchief. He said, he saw three men take it out, and were gone that way, (pointing towards Newgate-street); there were several people gathered together: a person said, I saw a man run up the court just within Newgate-street, where is no thoroughfare. We went, and there found the prisoner: he told me he was an apprentice to a tea-board cutter in Water-lane. I charged him with stealing my handkerchief: he denied it: I never saw my handkerchief since.</p>

             the younger. I am in the 15th year of my age; going thro' Newgate with my papa, the prisoner followed us: he was about a yard from us when I first saw him; there were two fellows with him; he hustled me away from the side of my papa: one of them got up to my papa, and snatched the handkerchief out of his pocket: it was a red and white linen one. The prisoner was by his side, and he gave the handkerchief to him, and the prisoner gave it to the other person; and they went away towards St. Paul's back again.</p>

               <p>I was going down Newgate-street; there were two or three young men came along, and just as we came, he lost his handkerchief, but I know nothing at all of it.</p>

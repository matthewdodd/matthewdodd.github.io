               <p>I am an officer of the Customs; I saw the prisoner on the 2d of August</p>
               <p>What had he with him? - I was coming from the Victualling-office, and I saw the prisoner and another coming over the hill; and I suspected him; having I verily believe this bag at his back; I crossed first one way and then the other, that he might not observe me; when he came near to me I caught hold of him by the collar, and seized the bag, says I, you have got some tobacco; I saw the seal upon it, it was just such another seal as this; I told him he had stolen it; says he, that man gave it me; I wish you would run after him, no, says I friend, that will not do, I shall take care of you; I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did shew you another man? - Yes, the prisoner began to struggle; and another man came and assisted me, and took him and the tobacco to the Custom-house, and delivered it to Mr. Hart, and weighed it.</p>
               <p>Draper. This is the bag that I saw that had the seal on it; I saw the prisoner sitting on the cask.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Kite answerable to any body for it? - Yes, he must have been answerable for it to me; the people I seized it for would have laid it before the board, and I must have been discharged if I could not have given an account of it.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you seize this for? - Being run, and having no certificate.</p>
               <p>What was the weight of it? - Twenty pounds; by the late act of parliament it is liable to seizure if above six pounds.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>A man overtook me on Tower-hill, and asked me to carry it; I fancy he saw this gentleman and knew him; he was to give me sixpence to carry it into Well-close-square, and this man met me, and took it from me; I told him it was not mine, and there was the man that it belonged to.</p>
               <p>How came you to take it from him to carry? - He was to give me sixpence to carry it into Ratcliffe-highway; but now I find it was a fixed thing, as he saw the man, and knew him; he owned at the Justice's that he knew the man.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewis. Did you know the man? - Yes, I knew him to be about the quays as well as this man.</p>

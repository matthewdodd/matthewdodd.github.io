                  </hi>. I live in Goswell-road. I am not the housekeeper—I rent the shop, parlour, and a sleeping-room, of Mary Smith—we have a separate entrance—it is all one house—there are two passages—there is an entrance to the shop, and the private door enters into both parts of the house—Smith lives in the house as well as me—the entrance into the shop is separate, and the shop communicates with the private passage, leading to my bed-room—it is a bookseller and stationer's shop—the parlour and shop are on the ground-floor—I can lock them up separate from the rest of the house—on the 15th of April I came home about eight o'clock in the evening—a mob was collected round my door, and the prisoner in custody, with George Walter, against whom the bill was not found—I missed two books from my shop, which I had seen lying at the bottom of the window—it is a close window, which does not open—I had seen them safe at six o'clock, and went out at seven—I left Jane Sidey, and a boy we call George, within—he is not here—the window and door were quite safe when I left—on returning I found the uppermost part of a pane of glass gone—it had been cracked before, but was quite whole—a person could easily put his arm in, and reach the books.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Spokes. He went out at seven o'clock, leaving me and George there—about eight o'clock I heard a cry of "Stop thief—I went to the door, and saw the two books on the ground, by the step of the door, near the broken pane of glass—a gentleman took them up, and gave them to me—I put them back in the window, and afterwards gave them to the policeman—just before I heard the cry of "Stop thief," a man had come into the shop for some tobacco—he had gone away before I heard the cry, and left the door open—I did not hear the glass break—I and the boy were reading a book.</p>

I was passing Mr. Spoke's shop, about eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner, with two other persons—they passed me a short distance from the house—I saw the prisoner put his hand up to the side of one of the panes of glass, as if to cut the putty away—I mentioned it to three persons, and watched them—they all three stood together at the window, the prisoner being in the centre—I passed by, and saw the glass lying on the books, and saw the prisoner's arm inside—I went and seized him, called "Stop thief," and the other two were both taken—one knocked a person's hat off and escaped, the other was taken—I did not see the books outside the window, I only saw his arm inside—about five minutes elapsed between my seeing him scrape the putty and seizing him—his hand went into the window twice.</p>

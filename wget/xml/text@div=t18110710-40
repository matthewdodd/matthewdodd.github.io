            . I am a pawnbroker, I live in Gulstone-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100025"></xptr>Whitechapel. On the 4th of May, the prisoner pawned a tablecloth with me for five shillings, in the name of Elizabeth Weller. She said she was a lodger at the King's Arms, Leadenhall-street, that the tablecloth was her own. On the Monday following, a man came with the ticket of the tablecloth to my shop, which I had given to her the Saturday before; he said he had purchased it of a woman, in Shoreditch, for a shilling; I told the man my suspicion, he did not take the tablecloth out in June the 5th, following, the prisoner came to pledge a sheet; I examined the sheet, and found it corresponded with the mark of the cloth; I sent for an officer and she was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witness to her character.</p>

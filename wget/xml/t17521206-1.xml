            . My husband's name is Thomas. The prisoner's husband took a lodging of me; I can't find him : They were at my house from April till about two months ago ; it was a one-pair of stairs room ; he was to give me 2 s. per week; it was furnish'd. The prisoner and her husband went to gather elder berries, and said they'd pay me on their return; the room was left lock'd up; I broke open the room-door, with a warrant, about a month after they were gone Every thing was gone except the chairs, table and bedstead ; I lost a brass sender, a copper stew-pan, one pair of sheets, a bolster, two pillows, two blankets, and four curtains; I went with a search warrant and search'd Mr. Pearcy's house, a pawnbroker, there I found the stew pan and brass sender, part of my curtains, one blanket, one quilt, two linen sheets. These goods produc'd in court and depos'd to.</p>

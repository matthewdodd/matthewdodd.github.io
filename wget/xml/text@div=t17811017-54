He went out of town, and desired me, in his absence, to have an eye to the conduct of his servants. Arnold was to have access to his house. I had some reasons to suspect he had made an ill use of Mr. Walker's library. On some things being missed, the prisoner Wright, who I understood had acted in the capacity of Arnold's man, coming to me, I charged him with taking things from Mr. Walker's. He then said, It is too true: we have taken a great many things out of the house. He specified what things, and I wrote them down in the list. He told me where they were pawned: that there was a violin pawned at Mr. Dobree's, in Oxford-road, upon which they had borrowed 15 s. a very large telescope, which he said was pawned in Princes-street, for half-a-guinea; that two very large books were carried to a pawnbroker's at Exeter 'Change, where they had 4 s. for them. That is all, I believe, he mentioned at that time. I asked the manner in which they managed to get the things out of the house. He told me that it was done in an evening; that he waited below in the passage, with the street-door a little open, and Arnold brought the things to him, and then came after him, and they went together to pawn them. I asked where Arnold was. He said I should find him at a milk-cellar, in a passage in the Hay-market. I went, and found him in bed. I took him before a justice, and he owned taking these things.</p>
               <p>(The several pawnbrokers produced the various articles mentioned in the indictment, and they were deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Aldus. I am a pawnbroker; on the 9th of February, about eight in the morning, the prisoner at the bar, brought the things mentioned in the indictment, to me, to pawn; the prisoner told me he brought them for one Mr. O'Brian, No. 52, High-street, Marybone, he had a livery hat on then, with a cockade, the shift and stockings are marked O, I thought he brought them right, I asked if his was up, he said as he was out last night, he did not suppose he was, that he desired him to pawn them for six guineas, I said, I dare say his master would not be angry, I would not give him the money, but would step home with him and see his master, to see that he was right, as there were a great many good things; he said he was very willing to go, I went with him to No. 52 first direction; when I came opposite he told me, my master lodges at that house, the windows are not open, they were done up; I told him I would go and look, I desired him to go with me to the house, to know if he lodged there, he said he would not go near the house, I said I would not leave him, but would come back with him when his master was up, that I should not part with him or the things till I see the right of it; going back, he pulls out this case of instruments, told me he was on board in a battle, and these instruments were given to him by a Dutch lieutenant, he said he would sell them for half a guinea, he pulled out the knives belonging to the case of instruments, I observed they were stampt Gray; Gray lives in Bond-street; I told him it was very odd he should have them from a Dutch lieutenant, when Gray lived in Bond-street, he said so it was; when we were coming home, I took the knives from him, and told him the things were not his, he called at Admiral Barrington's, and the boy seemed to know him, he asked for the butler, he was not up; I took him to Bow-street, and then I went back to No. 52, and they said, there was no such person lived there; I asked there if they knew the prisoner's name, they said no; I asked if they knew captain Onslow, they said no, there are two parcels of stockings wrote Onslow at length upon them, I went to admiral Barrington's, and they told me where captain Onslow lived, I went there and informed him I had got some of his property and the prisoner.</p>

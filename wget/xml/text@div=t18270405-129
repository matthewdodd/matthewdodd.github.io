On the 24th of March I had some clover-hay mixed with oats, which had grown among the clover, which is a thing we do not often see; I do not think there is such a mixture round the country for ten miles - I cannot say how many trusses I had of it, but I missed one truss on Sunday morning, the 25th of March, about seven o'clock - I had seen it safe at eight the night before - it was laying together in the further loft; I saw the clover littered about the loft window, and missed a truss; I then traced to see where it was gone - I went to the bottom of the yard, and saw clover and oats by the fence, as if it had been put over there; I then traced it over three fences, into the yard of the Black Horse public-house; I got an officer, Wilson, and he went with me; I showed him the spots where it was, and we got to the fence leading to the Black Horse yard; the officer got over there, but I did not; he afterwards came out, and in about two hours I went with him to the prisoners' stable - I know them both very well; we found some clover, which the officer pulled out of a rack - it was the same clover which had been lost. Mr. Eames changes six coaches there every day. I did not see any other clover there; I saw the prisoners there, and told them to bring it up into the loft to match with ours - the of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050066"></xptr>ficer brought it, and they followed him; I told them it was ours; James said they had it of an ostler at the King's Head public-house, in Kingsland-road, but the direction in which I traced the hay was not that in which they would have gone from Kingsland-road to the prisoners' stables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it the mildness of winter which caused the oats to spring up with the clover? A. Yes. The prisoners occupy about fourteen acres of ground, and are market-gardeners; they were bailed - they had leave to go home to get bail, and returned; I could not tell how many trusses were in the loft, but could miss one by the manner they laid; I never knew the prisoners in trouble.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did they go before the Justice? A. On the next day.</p>

            . I am a constable of Enfield. Ansell called me - I traced the hay to the door of the prisoners' stable at the Black Horse public-house - clover and oats were spilt where they had rested - I afterwards saw the clover and oats in the rack in their stable - there might be about a truss there - it was a long rack and quite full - I saw the prisoners in about an hour, and told them Ansell suspected his clover was in their stable - James replied, "Don't take any of that out of the rack;" I saw some clover under some hay in the rack - I asked him where they got it - he said they bought it of the ostler of the King's Head public-house, Kingsland-road - they went with me to Mr. Eames' stable, and compared it - I have no doubt it was the same - the proportion of clover and oats were as near alike as they possibly could be - we let them be at large till Monday morning, when we took them to the Justice - when I first went to the stable the clover was in the rack, and the hay at the bottom of the stable, but when we returned the hay was over the clover.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took them on Sunday? A. Yes, about eleven o'clock - Henry told the Magistrate he had nothing to do with the horses, as he was engaged in the garden.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I went with Wilson to the stable, and took this clover-hay out of the rack, which I produce. James said he got it from the ostler, at the King's Head - Henry said nothing - I found them next morning opposite their stable-door, and they went with me to the Justice - I compared the clover; it appears very much alike, but I am not a judge of it.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any oats among it? A. I did not notice that; I was not before the Justice; my man was there - two or three hundred carts call there every day.</p>

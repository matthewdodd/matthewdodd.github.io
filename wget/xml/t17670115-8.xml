               <p>Allen.

            . I am niece to Mr. Allen, I live at his house; I saw the prisoner twice that morning, before he had the money; he came first about seven o'clock, and asked if Mr. Allen was up; he waited, I believe, above an hour; I talked to him a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>J. Allen. He had such a coat on as he has now, and a little round hat, and boots on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same person?</p>
               <p>J. Allen. I have no doubt about his being the man. He went out, and came in again, and said he should be glad to see Mr. Allen; this was in about half an hour after he went out, or a little better; I heard him ask my uncle to lend him two guineas upon the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the note?</p>
               <p>J. Allen. I saw a piece of paper in his hand, and saw him give it to my uncle, and saw my uncle give him the two guineas; I also saw him take the pen, but cannot say I saw him write.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay with your uncle?</p>
               <p>J. Allen. I believe he staid with my uncle pretty near an hour; I saw him that day three times in all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the conversation your uncle and you had with him?</p>
               <p>J. Allen. I remember he said he was a butcher, and he was come to administer to a will, but could not do it till his sister from Reading came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cheapside. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, on the 14th of Nov., I was going along Goswell-road—I had a pocket handkerchief—a communication was made to me, and 1 found my handkerchief was gone—this is it—my pocket was outside my coat, and 1 think it likely I might have left the end of my handkerchief outside, which might have been a temptation—I cannot swear it did not drop—I turned round—there was a scuffle, and I saw the handkerchief fall from some one.</p>

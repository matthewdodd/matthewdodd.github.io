                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 112). On 2nd November I was on duty in Red Cross Street, and from something that was told me I went into Golden Lane, where there was a crowd of four or five hundred persons blocking up the street—I spoke to a man not in custody, who struck at me with an iron bar, but did not reach me—I drew my truncheon, and he ran up Golden Lane—I turned round to see for Wiseman, and was im<lb></lb>mediately struck on the head by Sheen, with an iron bar like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he drew from under his coat—it knocked me down—I tried to get up, and received another blow on the head, I do not know who from—I felt the blood trickling down my back, and became insensible—I found myself in a cab—I saw Walsh four or five yards from Sheen before I was struck—I was in the hospital from the 2nd to the 13th, and in the Police Infirmary up to Saturday evening—I have not returned regularly to duty yet.</p>

Q.</hi> Was it a quiet crowd? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There had been a fight, and it was all in an uproar—I saw a tall man with a brown coat—I said to the man, "Move on," and I may have put my hand on him, or touched his arm—I did not push him—he took out an iron bar, and tried to hit me—that man got away—I did not go after him, or try to take him, because there were more men armed behind me—from thirty to forty men were armed with iron bars and sticks—I saw the prisoners at the Justice Room, Guildhall, and several men were placed by the side of them for me to pick them out—I had seen them go through with the warder before that, but did not take notice of them.</p>

I was with Anscombe in Golden Lane, amd saw the prisoners there—Sheen had this bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand, and a number of men had bars and sticks—I saw Sheen strike Anscombe on the head with this bar, and Walsh struck him on the head with a stick—I cannot say whether he fell, because Sheen turned round at me with this iron bar and said, "You b——, I will give you the same."—Anscombe, having a truncheon in his hand, warded off the blow—I followed Sheen some distance, but could not take him, and returned—I knew him before.</p>

On 2nd November I was at my door, 20, Crown Court, which is about twenty doors from Golden Lane—I saw Sheen near our door by the archway, with either a stick or a piece of iron in his hand—he halloaed out, "Here is a policeman coming; here is a copper; down with the b——swine!"—I went down the court, and a tall man, named Gallagher, made a hit at the policeman with an iron bar—he took out his truncheon to defend himself, and was going to run after the tall man, but he got a blow—I cannot say who gave it to him, but I should know him if I saw him.</p>

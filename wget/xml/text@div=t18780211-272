                  </hi>. I am district manager of the Chelsea division of the London General Omnibus Company—on 23rd May, 1877, the prisoner came to the committee and asked for employment and produced these two written characters from Mr. Phinley and Mr. Coombe. (<hi rend="italic">The character from Mr. Phinley, dated</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">was read</hi>. ) The prisoner was taken on by the Company as a conductor and the date entered on the licence—he did not say anything to me about his having been previously employed by the Company—I cannot swear that I asked him—it is our usual custom to ask, and I think it probable we did—I subsequently had a communication from Mr. Church concerning the prisoner—we should not have employed him if his character had been dated 1875.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer of Richmond Road—the prisoner was in my service up to April, 1875—on his leaving I gave him a testi<lb></lb>monial exactly similar to the one produced—I never gave him any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The character produced is a general representation of the man at the time he left me—he was one of the best servants I had—I should not hesitate to take him into my employ again if I wanted a man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the London General Omnibus Company, and I know the prisoner by his being employed under me at Paddington on 21st May, 1875—on 2nd July, 1876, he was discharged for inaccuracy in his accounts, but whether by me or the superintendent I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. No proceedings were taken against him—if conductors' receipts fall off we sometimes discharge them without going into the question of the cause—it may be that the receipts fall off through circum<lb></lb>stances over which they have no control—the Magistrate was not anxious to dismiss the charge in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I never heard anything of that before—I knew of his having been previously employed at Hammersmith. <hi rend="smallCaps">

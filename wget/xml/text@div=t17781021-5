            . Last Saturday was four weeks my husband went out at about six in the morning; I heard a noise; I thought it was somebody come to me to buy something; I was not well; I did not attend to it; I did not get up at that time. About seven in the morning I heard the same noise repeated, turning round in my bed (the curtains being drawn I suppose the prisoner did not think there was any body in the bed,) I drew back the curtains and saw the prisoner sitting with a gown, a pair of stays and petticoat of mine in her lap; I left them in a chair by the window; there were 4 s. in money likewise laid in the chair at the time; I had asked my husband for some money before he went out, and he had laid four shillings down in the chair; I jumped out of bed and seised the prisoner; I did not immediately think of my money, but laid hold of the gown, the handkerchief, and the stays, which she dropped and extricated herself from me; she ran down stairs, but was pursued and taken; when she was brought back again I had by that time recollected my money; I charged her with taking that; she denied that she knew any thing of it; at last Timnall said he saw her drop two shillings on the stairs; then she desired to be searched; she afterwards produced the other two shillings.</p>

               <p>I lodge at Mrs. Scott's. I heard a screaming early in the morning; I ran down stairs; I saw the prisoner at the door without any cap on; I laid hold of her; she denied having done any thing amiss and insisted upon being searched; there was an accomplice that stood below in the street that I apprehend she was going to give the money to; I saw her take two shillings of the money and put it on the corner of the stairs, which I secured for Mrs. Scott; the other two shillings she delivered to the constable; upon being told it would be better for her to declare what was become of them, she pulled off her shoe and stocking and delivered the other two shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 24th of January, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner standing by the side of a cart, look-ing at some other persons putting lead into it, at the end of Marsh-lane, Battersea, about thirty yards from the prosecutor's house—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the police—the lead has never been found—Beale and Deane the other two, were taken immediately—I found the lead stripped from the roof and hips of the house—it had rained in the morning, but ceased in the afternoon—the parts were dry—if it had been long done they would have been wet.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father-in-law, at Battersea. A little after nine o'clock, on the 14th of January, I saw some persons carrying laud away from Mr. Richards's house, and putting it into a donkey-cart the prisoner stood outside, by the donkey-cart, in the lane, not on the pre<lb></lb>mises—when they had put the lead in, he and another went away with the cart towards Battersea-bridge—the prisoner followed it, and the other man. drove—the prisoner asked me if I had any bones or iron to sell, and I said I had not enough yet, I was going to sell a good lot—I looked into the cart, and saw a shovel and basket—he stood talking to me white the other man drove the cart on—Beale then came up, and they went away together—I knew the prisoner before, and had sold him bones.</p>

On the 24th of January, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, a cart went over the bridge towards Chelsea—the prisoner and another person were with it—the prisoner paid the toll—it was rather a large-sized, white-coloured donkey—-about a quarter of an hour after that, Bush came to make in<lb></lb>quiry of me.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of April, in Crab-tree-walk, and said he was wanted—he said he understood so, but said, "Why don't you take Weller?"—I said, "Who do you mean?"—he said "Plumridge," and described to me where I could find him, and I apprehended him—going along he told me about their ab<lb></lb>sconding from the parish, hearing they were wanted, and said he went to world at Bermondsey, with Plumridge, and spent 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he had bor<lb></lb>rowed, and then wished to sell a dog which the prisoner had; but not get<lb></lb>ting enough for it, they applied to sell Plumridge's donkey, which I saw—it was light, and very large.</p>

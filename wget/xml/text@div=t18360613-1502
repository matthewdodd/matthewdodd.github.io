                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-constable. On the night of the 10th of June, I was on duty on the river—I was going by Jones's wharf, at Lambeth, about ten minutes after one o'clock—there were several</p>

               <p>coal-barges lying there—I observed some person in a boat push off from the barge—I hailed him—he made no answer, and I rowed towards him—I found it was the prisoner—I knew him before—he is a fisherman—I asked what he had got there—he begged to be forgiven—I found 3cwt. 3 qrs. of coals in his boat—I asked him how he came to rob Mr. Jones, his neighbour, for he was a very good man—he said he was—he then asked me to speak to Mr. Jones to be as lenient to him as possible—I went in an hour to look at the barge where he had been, and found a very large hole where the coals had been taken out—there were no barges at the wharf but Mr. Jones's.</p>

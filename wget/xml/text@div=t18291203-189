On the 10th of November the prisoner was in my house, in company with two others they all went away together, and I missed the tea-kettle from the tap-room; the prisoner was taken up the same evening.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITTER. I am servant to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner and two others come to our house - I saw the kettle while they were there; I missed it when they were gone, and there was a quart-pot over the fire, with hot water in it - the prisoner and his companions had a basket; I do not know which carried it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ESTILL. I am assistant to Mr. Price, a pawn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030070"></xptr>broker. The prisoner brought this kettle, and asked 4s. for it; my master said I might lend 2s. on it, which I did.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are many thousands like it- I am innocent of it; the pawnbroker cannot know me, as I never was in his house in my life - I had two shipmates with me, and if any one had taken the kettle it must have been seen.</p>

                  </hi>. My uncle keeps the Angel and Crown, Tabernacle-square, Shoreditch—I serve there as barmaid—I remember serving the prisoner there on 23d October last, about a quarter before 12, with three half-penny-worth of gin—he paid me with a counterfeit shilling—I found out that after he had gone—I gave him a sixpence, four penny pieces, and a half-penny change—he drank the gin and went quickly out—I bent the shilling, and afterwards gave it to the policeman—a few minutes afterwards the prisoner came in again for another three half-pennyworth of gin—the bar<lb></lb>man served him—he tendered a shilling in payment—I told the barman he had just given me a bad shilling, and showed it to him—the prisoner then said rather than have any row or bother, he would give a good one for it.</p>

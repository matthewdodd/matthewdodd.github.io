                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of 8, New Turnstile—on 29th August, at 8 a.m., I sold the prisoner some eggs—he offered me a florin—I asked him if it was a good one—he said "It ought to be"—it felt rather greasy, and I bent it nearly square—I asked him where he got it; he made no reply—I went towards him, and he ran away—I gave it to a man in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and the prisoner snatched it away—a crowd ran after him—I called out, and he was stopped—I did not see the coin again.</p>

On 29th August, about 11.30 a.m., the prisoner was pointed out to me in Lincoln's Inn Fields—he went close to another man, who said "Give it to me, Harry"—I saw their hands go together, but cannot say what passed—the other man ran away, and I took the prisoner—Powell said that he had tried to pass a bad florin—the prisoner said "It ought to be a good one."</p>

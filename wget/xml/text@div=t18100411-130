            . On the 24th of March, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the end of Portabella-passage, there were two children together; she stooped down and pointed her hand over the way, and took the bundle from the child, and sent the child over the way; she rolled the gown up and walked down the passage; in about five minutes the children came back; the big child cried very much, and told me, the woman had taken her bundle. In about an hour afterwards the mother of this child came, and asked me, if I should know the woman again if I saw her; I said, yes. The child came and said, the woman is taken. I went and saw her, and knew her directly. This is the child that she took the bundle from.</p>

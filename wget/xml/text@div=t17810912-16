               <p>Before the time they took the watch, did they make use of any kind of force? - No; only stood talking to me, before they took the watch.</p>
               <p>Were they talking to you before they robbed you? - They did not say any thing particular to me, but they stood playing with me, touching the watch.</p>

I searched him, and found nothing but a knife upon him.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. Did you know the man before? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - About ten at night.</p>
               <p>How can you be positive to the person of the prisoner from only seeing him at that time of night, not knowing him before? - Because I took him immediately, and never let him go.</p>

In about a quarter of an hour my daughter called me again(this was before six o'clock); I got up and opened the the window, the watchman was calling half-past five o'clock - I called him; I looked into the street, and saw a man standing about eight yards from my house-it was not quite day-light. I called out, "Who is there?" the watchman was still advancing towards the house; the man came forward, and stood under the window out of which I was looking, and looked me full in the face; I called the watchman again, the man then walked down the street, and I saw no more of him; I should not know him again. I returned to bed, and got up in about twenty minutes, being alarmed by my servant, this was after six o'clock; I went into the parlour, and found the furniture in great disorder. I missed a table-clock, a pair of pistols, two flutes, an old time-piece, and three umbrellas; the door between the parlour and the shop was forced open. I conceived that they must have got in at the parlour window, as it was open. I also found the cellar window forced open; the cellar doors lead into the street - they are folding-doors which fasten by bolts, that go into the flap, the place was large enough to admit a person through, there were no marks of violence on them, so that it must have been opened from the inside. There was no other place open but the parlour window and the cellar doors. The cellar is part of the house. I have seen some of the things since.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the last witness; I heard a noise between half-past four and five o'clock, and called to my father, what he has said is correct. When I went down stairs in the morning, the parlour shutter and window were open; my observation was the same as my father's; the cellar windows were shut about half-past ten o'clock the night before; I held the light for the servant to fasten them; they shut with two folding-doors and fastens with a bolt; they were quite safe. My father missed the articles before me.</p>
               <p>HANNAH SHEPHARD. I am servant to Mr. Blenkinsop; I rose first in the morning; the cellar windows were quite safe the night before; when I came down stairs they were shut close, but the bolts were broken. I saw them before my master, they were broken open after I had seen them the night before, so that a person must have been into the house. I missed the clock and the umbrellas; there was a time-piece besides the clock, which was also gone. I did not miss the other articles. I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>MR. BLENKINSOP Re-examined. I only missed the articles which I have enumerated, at the time-they were in the house the over-night. I afterwards missed the other articles out of the shop. I cannot say what they were; the spoons were missing that morning, they are worth 5s.; the pistols are worth 10s.; the flutes 5s., and the three umbrellas 20s.;</p>

            . I am the beadle of St. George's Parish. On the 30th of November I met the prisoner in Old Gravel-lane, knowing them before, I looked after them. They were carrying something in their hands; they looked round at me, and I at them. The prisoner Clarke altered the position of his bundle, and put it in front, which made me suspect him. I went to them, and asked Clarke what he had got; he said, it was his own property. I felt it, and found it to be pistols; they were tied up in a handkerchief. I asked him where he was going with them; he said he was going on board the Eliza, which lay on the other side of the river. I told him I must take him where he must give a better account of them. I took them to Shadwell-Office; while they were there I searched them. Baines wished me to let him go, as he said he was no acquaintance of the other prisoner. I found a German-flute, a watch and appendages, and a steel purse, and some orders for the free and easy clubs on Baines. I then searched Clarke; I found on him a tobacco-box, a bad three shilling token, and the pistols. I found out who the property belonged to, and they were committed. I afterwards searched Baines's house, and found a bunch of keys in his room; one of them fitted Mr. Blenkinsop's portable desk, another his till, and another fitted a door in his shop (I took the lock off the desk, and produce it).</p>

               <p>Baines' Defence. I was going along Ratcliff-highway, and met the prisoner, who asked me to go to Execution-dock, Jackson came to stop him, and he took me too. I bought the flute about seven months ago.</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. Jackson asked me where I got the pistols from, and I told him that I bought them for 10s.</p>

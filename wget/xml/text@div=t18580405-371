                  </hi>. I am a general dealer. On 12th March I had been out with a friend; I was coming home, about a quarter past 1 o'clock in the morning, along Bishopsgate Street—I saw the prisoner and a man with her, standing in the middle of the street, near to Camomile Street—she made a run from the man, and put her arms round my neck, put her hand into my pocket, and took 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out—there was a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and about eight shillings; I had had it safe just before—she let me go, and ran away; I missed the money, and followed her—she passed by the man, I saw her give something to him, and he ran off directly—I overtook the prisoner, and canght her by the arm; I held her till a policeman came, and gave her into custody—she denied the charge, and said I had been insulting her—I had done nothing, but was quietly walking home.</p>

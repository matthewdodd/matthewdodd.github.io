            . Robinson's father cleans my shoes; the boy came for the shoes, and one of the buckles being left in the strap, he took it away. I went and acquainted his father with it, and he searched for his son, but no son could be found. I said to some of the porters, if you see Robinson's boy bring him to me, and in about a quarter of an hour he was brought to 5 s. I threatened to sent him to Bridewell, and he fell down his knees, asked pardon, and said he had sold it to a man in the New Market. Penn sells old buckles, &amp;c. I said to Penn, friend, did you buy a buckle of a boy to day? he said, yes, and clapped his finger upon one which was not worth a half-penny: I pulled out the fellow buckle to that which was lost, and said this is the fellow of what you bought of the boy, and he owned he had sold it for 3 s. and he gave the boy but a penny for it: I believe the child did not know it to be silver.</p>
               <p>Job Lilly. Penn brought this buckle to me to sell: it weighs twelve penny wt. it is not standard marked silver. I knew Penn, for he had lived with a silver buckle maker: he said it might be as good silver though it was not standard marked, as if it had, and so it may, but it is not very probable.</p>

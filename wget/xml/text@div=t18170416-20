On the 2d of April, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I and my son went to the Synagogue; we locked the doors and fastened the windows, and left no person in the house. I tried the windows, and found both the street and yard-doors fast - I took the keys with me. We returned at half past eight o'clock, and found the street - door broken open-the asp and lock were also broken, and a box, containing the articles stated in the indictment, gone; they were worth more than 40l. - it was safe when I went out. I have seen part of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160009"></xptr>property in the possession of Dalton. It was twilight when I went out.</p>

            . I am an officer. From information that I received, I went to the house of the prisoner, Bridle, in Blacksmiths's-arms-alley, at the back of Church-lane. I found both the prisoners there, in bed together, about eight o'clock in the morning. I found a watch hanging over the mantle-piece in the bed-room - I asked Bridle where he got it; he said, he gave a Jew 12s. for it. I found a box, containing 11 watches and two watch-cases under the bed - I asked him where he got them; he said, a Jew had left them there the overnight, for him to take care of till he called again - I secured him. Coster claimed the property immediately that he saw it. Coster's house is in the parish of Christ Church, Spitalfields.</p>

From the description he gave me of the persons who sold them, I took the prisoner, Davies, into custody. I asked her if she had sold any old silver to any person; she denied it several times. I told her I found she had sold some to Killingworth; she then said, Bob had given it to her for pinmoney. I asked her when - She said, either Thursday or Saturday. Coster claimed them.</p>

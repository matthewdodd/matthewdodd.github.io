I lived with him in June last; and on the 18th of that month, I attended him at the dinner table, and collected the plate after dinner, and put it in a basket; and the groom took it from the room. I saw the basket containing the plate in the scullery, and afterwards I removed it to my pantry, at about half past six in the afternoon; I then went to my dinner; and staid about an hour: and on my going back to get them, they were gone. The basket was brought back on the Tuesday following.</p>

I did not then see what it contained; but they put it under a bed; and soon afterwards a prisoner of the name of

The wardsman took the bundle, and put it in his bed, and they then sat down together, and had some beer; and in some time afterwards, the wardsman went to search for the bundle, and found it gone.</p>

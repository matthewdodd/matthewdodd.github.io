            . I am servant to Mr. Thomas: the prisoner came into my master's shop on Monday the 3d of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; he asked for some handkerchiefs: as I was on the compter with my back to him reaching some down, I heard him slide some Irish linen off the compter; I looked round and he had not got it quite off: he looked at the handkerchiefs and asked for some with a purple border: while I was reaching them, I heard him slide it quite off and saw him hide it under his coat. I got down and asked for the linen cloth; he gave it me directly and went down on his knees, took hold of my hand and kissed it, and begged me to let him go: I would not, but said I would get somebody to assist me as soon as I could: he then seized me by my collar, and pulled me to the door; he let himself out and pushed me from the door and got from me: I pursued him with the cry of stop thief; in consequence of which he was taken and brought back.</p>

               <p>I had the cloth in my hand looking at it; I did not conceal it; he bid me put it down and I did.</p>

               <p>Second Count. For that they on the same day, a round blank of base metal of a fit size and figure, to be coined into counterfeit milled money, resembling the current coin of this realm, called a sixpence, salfely deceitfully, feloniously, and traiterously did colour with materials, producing the form and figure of a sixpence, against the form of the statute, &amp;c.(The case was opened by Mr. Cullen).</p>

               <p>SAMUEL HARPER sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am an officer belonging to the Public-office in Worship-street: On the 4th of March last, I went to Blue-anchor-yard, Rosemary-lane, we had had an information of coining going on, we went to search the house, and a little girl ran out into another house, where these two people were found, two doors from the other house; I followed her, she knocked at the door, and somebody opened that door; when I went into the house, the prisoner Read was sitting close by a table, and Rymes by the fire-side; Read was rubbing something close by that table where this board was,(producing a long deal board,) as soon as I went in, he got up from his seat, and went near to the middle of the room, there was a bed in the room, with both his hands behind him; I then called Ray in, and asked the prisoner Read, what he had in his hands; I took his hands from behind him, and the ends of his fingers and thumbs were white with the scowering-paper, I should suppose, or whatever he had been at, and the other part was very black; Ray searched the room, and I searched the prisoner; I saw Ray find some sixpences upon the table, close to where this man was sitting down; several pieces of sandy paper, and some cork, and a file, with the file dust in the teeth of the file; I saw all these things found, and I took care of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare that file dust upon the file, with the counterfeit money? - A. Yes; and it exactly corresponded, and so it was upon the board; I did not find any thing else; I searched Read, and Rymes was all this time sitting at the fire; I knew him before, and I said, you shall go to the Magistrate too, says he, Mr. Harper, you won't take me, I am doing nothing; it matters none, says

            what you are doing, you are both in one room, he cannot work without your seeing him; and I hand-cussed both together; Ray found the other things in the mean time; there is a Mr. Sheen now in Court, that has many houses upon the spot, that I called in to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson: Read's counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was opened immediately upon being knocked at? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find the room door open or shut? - A. It was opened to the girl; the street door opens into the room, there is no other door, I slipped in behind the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. In all your experience, who have taken as many coiners, as most men, did you ever see a person at work with the door in that situation.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask such a question, it is stuff.</p>
               <p>Witness. The street door opened directly into the room, and one window was stopped up, and the other had a cloth before it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Read. There was no such thing.</p>

               <p>I belong to the same office; I went with the last witness and found the two prisoners and searched the house; upon a table there laid these sixpences (producing them,) that had been just fresh field, and this file by the side of them; and in the drawer, I found some brimstone, and some cream of rather, some scowering-paper and some cork; over the fire-place, I found in different papers, parcels of sixpences,(producing them,) these two papers I found likewise,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060023"></xptr>upon the mantle-piece; I then got up upon the dresser, and in a bason I found these, (a great number of sixpences,) and I also found the blacking faucer, (producing it,) and a leathern apron stained with aqua-sortis, (producing it,) two pieces of scowering paper that lay upon the ground, that had been worked with; the prisoner(Read) said, that apron belonged to him; I found also, a pair of pliers, and some composition file dust.</p>
               <p>(To Harper). Look at those things. - A. This blacking is what they do them with, when they are almost finished, to make them sit for circulation.</p>

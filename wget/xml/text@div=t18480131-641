I was living at 3, Cupid's-court, St. Luke's—I had lived there, with the prisoner, two years and a half—my lawful wife is living at Birmingham—we had two children, Amina, aged between seven and eight years, and Robert Henry, between five and six—they lived with me and the prisoner—on 31st Dec., between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I came home form work—the prisoner was at home—I told her to make haste and get the tea, for I intended going to the theatre—she wished to go with me, but I did not wish to take her—I said I was going with Mr. Hewlett, who is a friend of mine—I had my tea, and put the children to bed before I went out—I then went to the Duke of Bedford public-house, on the opposite side of Golden-lane—the prisoner fol<lb></lb>lowed me, and said she would go wherever I went—I saw Hewlett, and asked him to go with me—he refused, and I asked him if he would take a walk—we left the public-house, and went up Golden-lane, into Old-street, and through several streets, the prisoner still following us—I told her several times to go home, and not to follow me, nor to abuse me—she said she would do so, she would follow me wherever I went, step by step—in going up Golden-lane, I turned round to her, and said to Hewlett, "This is a curious thing," or "an unlawful weapon,' (or something of that sort,) "for her to be following me with"—I believe it was a piece of lead, tied in a handkerchief, so as to swing about—she said I should find a very devil in her that night—we went into public-house at the corner of Old-street—she joined us, and drank with us—we had half-a-quartern, or a quartern of gin between the three of us—when we came out, I told her to go home, as I and Hewlett wanted to go to the theatre by ourselves—she still said she would go wherever I went, and would not go home—we then all three turned back, into the Duke of Bedford—as we went, I heard my name mentioned by some one that passed me—I did not know who it was then—I afterwards knew that it was Jane Jones—I had known her four or five days previous to 31st Dec.—I did not know her before that day—I had just spoken, but I had never known her—I never saw her before—when we went into the Duke of Bedford, Mr. Adams, the landlord, was there—Hewlett and I sat on a bench in front of the bar—while sitting with him, the prisoner was talking to Mr. Adams—her back was towards me, and I slipped out alone, without her per<lb></lb>ceiving me—I spent that night with Jane Jones, and went home between tea and eleven o'clock next morning—both my children were then dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at the Duke of Bedford, Golden-lane, and am a wood-turner—I am married—I have known the prisoner and Blake about six months—I have been in London about eight months. On 31st Dec. I was at the Duke of Bedford—Blake came to me about five or six o'clock, called me out, and asked me if I would go to the theatre—I said I would not, I was too ill—the prisoner was outside and could hear—Blake asked me about my wife going—I said she could not leave her family—he proposed to go for a walk—we walked towards Old-street—the prisoner walked on with us—he said to me that she had something in her hand; that she had a very unlawful weapon in her possession—I noticed it—I cannot say what it was—it was a hard substance in her handkerchief—she was swinging it in her hand—Blake said to me that it was lead; upon which she said, "You shall find a complete devil in me"—I cannot recollect any other conversation—I did not like the conversation, and said I should return to the Duke of Bedford—he said, "I shall return in a few minutes"—we all three of us went to a public-house at the corner of Goswell-street, close by Old-street, and had a half a quartern or a quartern of gin—they appened to be very comfortable there—when we came out Blake put his head on the stump opposite the door, and said something to her in a joke, as I thought—I did not hear what it was—I walked towards Old-street, thinking they would come after me—I missed them, turned round, and they were against the post—I was not near enough to hear distinctly what he said—the prisoner then walked with us through Fann-street to the Duke of Bedford—she did not leave us one moment, to my recollection—we all went in—he asked me what I would take to drink—I said I was not par<lb></lb>ticular to anything—we took half a quartern of gin, with some cold water—I cannot remember whether we drank it, or whether the prisoner drank out of it—it was not all drank—I think it was rather after seven o'clock—Mr. Adams was there—the prisoner went towards the bar to speak to him, and as she came towards the bar Blake slipped out, and I saw no more of him that night—she noticed his absence in an instant, and went after him without speaking—she returned in about a quarter of an hour alone—I was behind the bar—she said nothing—I said, "Mr. Blake, you are satisfied I am not gone with Mr. Blake"—she said, "A good job you are not, for he shall repent of it before the morning; and I will die like a <hi rend="italic">tramp</hi> at Newgate"—she left the house—I went to her lodgings about half-past eight or nine o'clock—they live on the ground-floor—the door opens into the room—there is a very small passage—I knocked at the door—she answered, and said, "Is that you, <hi rend="italic">Stephe</hi>?"—that was the name by which she usually called me—I said, "It is, Mr. Blake; I can't open the door"—she said, "I will meet you at the window"—by the time I got to the window she was there—she opened the sash and shutters—I said, "What is the matter, Mr. Blake? do not put yourself in a passion; if you do, it will</p>

               <p>end serous with you some day"—I reasoned with her—she said she had something black on her mind, and she would put a stop to it before the morning—I told her the nature of putting herself in a passion, and things of that description—I did not like to stay any longer—I shook hands with her, and returned to the Duke of Bedford—I do not remember seeing the girl Amina that evening, but I believe I did.</p>

I occupy the first and second floor, and Blake the parlour down stairs—I went to the play that night with my wife, and returned a few minutes before twelve—as I was coming home the prisoner passed me at the corner of the court, and went into a shop at the corner—as I went into my house, I observed the parlour shutters were turned back against the wall, and the window sash open—I know the two children—I saw them on the bed together, one towards the head, and one towards the foot, sitting up, and apparently playing and talking—about half an hour af<lb></lb>terwards I went to bed, and heard no more till I awoke at very near four I believe, by the police getting in at the window—I went down stairs, and found two policemen and Moore in the room, and the children both dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to Blake's room, in Cupid's-court, on the morning of 1st Jan.—I saw the bodies of the two children in the lower room—the officer was standing there, and pointed them out to me—one was a little girl—I found marks of external violence about her body—there were marks on the nose and cheeks, and a slight scratch on the top of the throat—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was suffocation, by forcible closing of the nose and mouth by the hands of some other person—the lungs were gorged, and the vessels of the brain turgid with dark-coloured blood—that was the case with both of them—they were precisely the same—I should think it would not require much—strength to suffocate a child of that size—a few minutes would destroy life—I should imagine it quite impossible for the child to have cried out—the mode of death would entirely prevent it—if any noise was made, it must have been made before it began.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I presume you imagine it must have been done by placing the bedclothes over child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; that would have been something—my impression is, that it was done while they were asleep, but in the mode I have now stated.</p>

On the 7th of October, I received my pension, consisting of four sovereigns, and 6 s. 6 d. in silver. I know the female prisoner, and am slightly acquainted with the man. I met them just as I came out of the College-gate, and took them to a house, and treated them, and then took them to my own room in Marlborough-place, Chelsea, where I gave them a dinner. I went to Portman-square, and on returning called on them in <placeName id="t18221023-62-crimeloc340">Ann-street, Westminster</placeName>

I then had a sovereign and 16 s. 6 d., in silver - I gave the man 1 s. for beer, and while he was gone for it I fell sick, and laid down by the side of their bed. I awoke in a quarter of an hour, and they were fighting - I put my hand in my left hand pocket, and found I had only 8 1/2 d. left. I said they had behaved very ill to me in robbing me, and they had better give up my money. The man searched his wife, and found 2 s. 6 d. on her, and offered it to me to go away. I took the woman to the watch-house; he followed me there. I gave him in charge. He denied having any money - 17 s. was found on him. I lost a sovereign and 12 s. 6 d.</p>

            . Q. When you got home your wife asked you for your money, and you gave her three sovereigns and 16 s. - A. Yes - she returned it to me again. I went home with a boy to King-street, Portman-square, and then returned to the prisoners'; but went to no public-houses after I left Chelsea. I was rather ill in my stomach. I had only drank two pots of beer, and very little gin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. James Bassett, a pawnbroker, in Great Queen-street. On the 24th of July, the prisoner Eliza brought me six des<lb></lb>sert-forks, and asked me to lend her as much as I could on them—having suspicion that they were not her husband's property, I gave them to my em<lb></lb>ployer—I weighed them—these now produced correspond with them in weight, and pattern, and every thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you let a lodging at any time to the prisoner? - I did, some time in May, or June, I cannot be particular to the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you let her? - A chamber, a one pair of stairs room, to her and her husband, she took the room first, I believe he was at sea; but when he came home, he and she lived there, and they paid the rent; they staid there until the 21st of October last; he went to sea before that time; she staid until that day in possession of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss? - A bolster and the other things mentioned in the indictment? - One large blanket, two sheets, one marked with my name on it, and the other not marked; the things are in court; I found her coming down from the room with the bolster in her apron, and I went in the room, and found the duplicates of the other things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Mordaunt knows that my husband had a fit of illness, and Mrs. Hardy had the same privilege of borrowing the bellows and the flat iron, and the tea kettle, as me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These articles I have not found, I do not charge her with these that I have not found.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My husband being ill, and through his illness I was obliged to pledge this property, when he was well he went to sea in order to reimburse the property, I don't know that it was any harm, so as it was reimbursed in the place again. Mr. Mordaunt keeps a house of ill same, and bawdy houses. Nothing but necessity urged me to pledge them, with just intention of putting the property in the place again; I submit to the candour of you, and the jury. There were people here for my character yesterday, and they have not come this morning; my husband returned last Monday and paid exactly one guinea and three-pence we owed for rent.</p>

               <p>Jury. Is the rent all paid now? - Only what was due at the time she left the place.</p>

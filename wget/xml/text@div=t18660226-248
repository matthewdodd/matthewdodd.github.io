                  </hi>. I am clerk to Dean and Co., tea-dealers, of 71, Ludgate-hill—the prisoner was their town-traveller—he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week salary, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week commission—his duties were to take out and deliver goods, to receive the money, and pay it to me the next morning—he has received the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for nearly three years—he has never paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Caratti, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Pyle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been in the prosecutors' service longer than the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there was a prior arrangement for a short time temporarily—in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the prisoner is debited with the bad debts—sometimes debtors apparently bad, pay in a small sum—it is in this way a debtor and creditor account—the prisoner was never asked to pay any of the bad debts, nor did he do so, that I am aware of—the amount of bad debts is 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in three years—of course we do not begin charging him with bad debts the first week—the first bad debt was in March, 1864—the agreement for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission was made more than two years ago—we have never settled the commission account with the prisoner, but he has been allowed to draw for the whole of the money—we paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week on account of commission, and kept back money for the purpose of security, which ought to have been paid to him—he was responsible for the bad debts by being allowed 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—if a house owed us 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would be responsible for it, if it incurred during his time, unless we chose to halve it with him—the commission account commenced in April, 1864—there has been no balance of it, but we could see that there was no money standing to his credit—we looked at the account whenever we wanted it—we paid the expenses of the cart—they did not amount to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—we supplied him with food for the horse; he would only have to put the nose-bag on—his expenses would be about sixpence a day for holding the</p>

               <p>horse, and giving him water—a boy was not supplied to the cart before the death of Mr. Murray—the prisoner did not complain of property being lost out of the carts, but he would be responsible for it—the customers were all ours and not his; but, by giving him a commission, we made him responsible for them—there is a certain rate on each article—his commission on tea was 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the first twelve months he went out—it was not the same the next year, because he was much more careless, and the trade slackened wonder<lb></lb>fully—we allowed him to draw 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—there is no commission on sugar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that for 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year he was to be responsible for all the bad debts of the firm's customers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, through whom he derived the commission—His returns were about 4,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and his commission was about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that is 1½ to 1¾ per cent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he had a burglary and lost 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he told me so—he also told me since his apprehension that he was robbed while riding on an omnibus—I believe that the prisoner, long before these proceedings were taken, instead of concealing the facts, told the prosecutors, and offered to give his brother's bill for the amount, but it was refused—Mr. Dean refused to compound a felony, but the prisoner only mentioned it—his brother had gone to America—the prisoner was discharged, and the prosecutor did not think of giving him in custody then, because his partner was dying, and did die before he could consult with him—during that time, I believe the prisoner was at home with his wife and family—he called three or four times during ten days.</p>

PATER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has this debtor and creditor account of bad debts been balanced for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but the prisoner has been overpaid about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was the firm and not the prisoner who lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were these customers whom he did not introduce? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, customers of twenty or twenty-five years—the firm has never failed to pay the half of all bad debts—I see that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for bad debts is in the books before his time—that is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Castle public-house in Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields—on Thursday, 10th April, the prisoner was engaged as under-cook—on the Saturday, about 11.30, I was making up my cash in the parlour, which is separated from the kitchen by a glass partition—the prisoner came to the parlour; there was cash and notes to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I had taken it from the cash-box—on Sunday morning I was aroused by the cook, Ann Watson, about 6.30; in consequence of what she said I followed her downstairs; I heard her say to the prisoner, who was on the stairs, "Why don't you go downstairs, woman?"—she said, "I dare not, there is a. man in the kitchen with a big knife in his hand, and the bar door is open"—Watson came back to me and said, "It is quite true, sir," there is a big fire in the kitchen"—I went down into the kitchen and saw a big fire there in the fireplace; a. lot of clothing was on fire, four of my coats, three hats, the potman's clothing and all the house linen, the servants' aprons, and a number of things—the whole of the large fireplace, oven, and boiler, was red-hot, as red as a furnace; a quantity of cigars and tobacco were half burnt, and the prisoner was at the fire poking all the things on, with her face almost as red as the fire, and black soot on her face—I saw no man there—I went into the bar and found all the spirit taps turned on and the spirits running—I returned to the kitchen and said to the prisoner,</p>

               <p>"Where is this man?"—she said, "He has gone up the steps in the yard"—I looked at the door immediately, and saw that it was fast, as I had left it; nobody had passed through it—I said, "Which way did he go?"—she said, "Through the window"—I said, "Which window?"—she said, "The window in the tap-room"—I looked in the tap-room and saw no person there—I went to the door leading into the yard and found it secured, just as I had left it on Saturday night—she said, "The man fell down when he was getting out of the window"—I looked in the yard, there had been a little rain, and some one had been sick there on the Saturday night, and it was impossible for any one to have fallen there without making a mark, and there was none, and the dust on the window-sill was not disturbed—there were no footmarks on the steps—the only exit from the yard is along the wall and into another yard, surrounded by high walls and houses, no one could get out that way—as soon as I had collected myself I went to see what damage was done, and I found all the ports and sherries that were in the decanters had been emptied into a tub that we wash our glasses in, and the decanters were all set on the counter, and a lot of spirit bottles had been emptied and the spirits were running down into the cellar, and this glass stopper belonging to one of the decanters I found in the fire—on examining the bar I found the drawers had all been opened, a bag that contained a gent's books had been opened, and all the biscuit boxes—the drawer that usually contained money was open; but nothing had been left in it—the drawers in the other bar had all the papers turned out and left on the floor—there were ten persons sleeping in the house at this time.</p>

I am cook to Mr. Merton—on Sunday morning, 13th April, about 6.30, the prisoner came to my room and said, "There is a large fire in the kitchen"—I went and called my master, and I met the prisoner on the stairs; I said, "What are you standing there for?"—she said, "There is a man in the kitchen with a white-handled knife"—she went down before me—I examined the door and window of the kitchen, they were fast.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 421). About a quarter past 7 on the morning of 13th April I was called to Mr. Merton's—I saw the prisoner there poking the fire—I asked her who lit the fire—she said she did not know who did it; when she came downstairs there was a man sitting on a chair with a knife in his hand smoking a cigar—I asked her where the man went to—she said he went through the taproom window into the yard—I asked where he went to then—she said up the steps and along the wall into another yard—she said he fell down in the yard—in company with the prosecutor I went up the steps and along the wall and found no trace whatever—I examined the door leading from the kitchen into the yard and found it all fast—I examined the window sill and found no trace there or on the steps.</p>

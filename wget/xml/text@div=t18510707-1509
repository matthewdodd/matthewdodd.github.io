On Sunday night, about 2 o'clock, I was in the street, near New Bond—street, and the prisoner came and spoke to me, but I did not understand her—she went with me to a public—house, where I gave her two glasses of port wine—when we came out of there, I understood her that she wished me to go home with her—I would not—she pretended to be very kind and <hi rend="italic">loveable</hi>, and came <hi rend="italic">round</hi> me, and she was tickling me about the waistcoat—I had some sovereigns in my right waist<lb></lb>coat pocket, and my watch in my left, with an India—rubber guard round my neck—I had my watch safe when I was in the public—house—I found my guard cut, missed my watch, caught hold of the prisoner's wrist, and said,</p>

               <p>"Give me my watch; give me what you have got"—she was astonished at the moment, and said nothing, but afterwards she said she had not the watch—I was going to catch hold of her right hand as well, heard something fell, and saw my watch on the pavement—I picked it up, the policeman came, and I gave it to him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—there was no one else near.</p>

On 7th July, about half-past 2 o'clock in the morning, I heard some one calling out in Union-street, Bond-street—I went and found the prisoner and prosecutor—I understood the prosecutor that he meant to give her in charge—I turned ray light on, saw the watch lying on the kerbstone, and the prisoner in the road by the kerbstone with the watch near her feet—the prosecutor was on the pavement—he picked up the watch, and said it was his—she said she did not do it, she did not take it—she afterwards said to me.

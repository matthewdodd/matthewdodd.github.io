               <p>Mr Bradley. On Wednesday Night last, about 7 o'clock, a Neighbour came to my House, and told me that there were Thieves in an empty House; I went to see who was there, and I had no sooner got into the House, but Mr Bromley , who was with me, cry'd out, there he is! I saw the Prisoner run a-cross the Yard, and we took him. When we had seized him, we went up Stairs to see what had been done; and found that Lead had been cut out of the Gutter, but how much I can't tell. The House, from whence this Lead was taken, belongs to Mr Maylin, as one of the Assignees of

            . I was drinking at Bradley's , when I heard that there was a Thief in this House. Bromley, Bradley, and I, went to the House, and as soon as we were got in, the Prisoner try'd to escape over the Pales. I heard a Noise of something running, and threw a Bit of Wood at him in the dark; but that not hitting him, I ran up to him, and took him, just as he was getting over the Pales to go away. After he was sent to New Prison, we searched the House, and found Part of the Leaden Gutter cut away; and the next Morning going into the Yard, I saw that the Main Pipe was taken from the Front of the House, in the Yard.</p>

             . On Wednesday Night, coming out of the Publick House, I was told, that some Men were taking my Master's Deals. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150025"></xptr> down the Alley, the Back-way, but Bradley and Draper went the Fore-way. I saw the Prisoner go out of this House with something, and when he saw us, he attempted to escape over the Pales in the Yard. The next Morning we found a Piece of Leaden Pipe, about 5 Foot long, which was taken from the Front of the House.</p>

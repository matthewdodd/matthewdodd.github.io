                  </hi>. I am a constable employed by the Great Northern Railway Company—on the morning of 22d March, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was in Lower Thames-street, near Billingsgate, and saw the prisoner in one of the London. Chatham, and Dover Railway Company's vans, delivering boxes and baskets of fish which were in the van—I saw him take out several plaice from the boxes, and some soles from pads, and secrete them under the straw in his van—I was in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner take a very large plaice from one of the baskets and hand it to Wells, who hid it under</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186604090014"></xptr>
               <p>his jacket and went away with it—a lad named M'Carthy was in the van as guard, and I saw him put some of the soles into a sack which was in the corner of the van—the prisoner then proceeded to deliver the baskets and boxes of fish, and the boy drove the van away with the sack in it, but the police prevented him stopping still, and ultimately the prisoner came up to the van near king William-street, got in, took the reins from M'Carthy, and drove along Thames-street towards Blackfriars—I did not stop the van, but I got up into it, and the prisoner said, "What do you want?"—I said "I am going towards the bridge, give us a ride"—just at that time Jones got up into the van, and I said to Martin, "We are constables"—he said, "I thought you were"—I said, "How many fish have you been stealing this morning?"—he said, "There they are," pointing to where they were under the straw, "there are five or six"—I looked, and said, "There are more than five or six, you are both in custody, charged with stealing these fish, the property of your employers"—I took the prisoner and the boy—I found eight plaice under the straw, and six large soles in the sack—I said, "Is this all you have?"—he said "Yes," but when the inspector ordered me to search him at the station, he took out a handkerchief, and said, "You have not got all; here is a pair here which I did steal, and I intended to take them home to my wife"—I said, "Who is that man that you gave that large plaice to that you took out of the pad?"—he said, "Well, I did take that I know, I do not know him"—from information I received I afterwards went to Wells's address, saw him, and received a plaice, which he admitted to be the same—M'Carthy was afterwards discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see where I delivered the remainder of the fish <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you backed your van against one of the other vans of the Com<lb></lb>pany, and put the last of your load in, but you had stolen the fish prior to that—I did not see Batt put some of this fish into your van, but you said that he did—when Wells put the fish under his jacket, you said, "You have no occasion to hide it, the b—s cannot swear to it"—when I asked you who you gave the fish to, you did not say that his name was Wells—you did not say he was a fellow servant of yours, but I have ascertained that since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live at Waterloo-buildings, Southwark—I was the prisoner's van-guard on 22d March, and went with him in a van, loaded with fish, from Blackfriars Station to Billingsgate—the fish were in boxes and baskets, with a string over them, and they were directed to people in Billingsgate—the prisoner took several of the plaice out of the pads, and some soles out of the boxes—he put the plaice in the middle of the van, and told me when I got up on the hill, to put the soles into the provender sack—I did so, if I had not I should have been <hi rend="italic">jawed</hi> at—the prisoner was the driver—I saw him put a pair of soles in a handker<lb></lb>chief—he put them in his pocket, and said that he was going to take them home to his wife—they came out of one of the boxes—I saw Wells there—the prisoner gave him a big plaice out of a pad—he put it inside his coat, and the prisoner said, "You need not be ashamed of it," and then Wells carried it in his hand—I was taken in custody, and examined as a witness at the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When did you first know that there were fish in the sack? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You said to me, "When you get up on the hill, put the soles in the provender sack"—you were not in Batt's van when the policeman turned the horse round, and I took the reins—I do not recollect seeing the porters come up into the van, and take fish out of the boxes—you asked me if I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, L. C. and D. R</hi>.) I went to the police-station, and said to the prisoner, "I am very sorry to see you here, Martin; it is a bad job"—he said, "Yes, it is, but I have told them all I could—I did steal one pair of soles, which I meant to take home to my wife"—I know Wells—he was formerly a carman in the Company's service, but left before this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When I have delivered any goods, and found anything short or wrong, did I not always report it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I never heard any com<lb></lb>plaint against you till this, but I directed the officers to search, in consequence of numerous robberies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was rather late in getting to market with the fish, and the porters and salesmen were all round the van in a great hurry after their different masters' fish—I did not load the van, and some of the boxes wanted out first, were at the bottom—I had to take them out one at a time, and some of the loose soles fell out, but I cannot account for, how all of them came at the bottom of the van. I went round with my delivery sheet, and told one or two of them I wanted a little bit of fish, which they have often given me before; one of the men got up in the van with two fish for himself, and I gave him this one in the van for his breakfast. When I asked the boy if he would have a fish for his breakfast, I had not unpacked the van. When I had got rid of most of the fish, I had seven boxes and several pads left, which I put on the other van and rode off. Batt said, "Do you want two or three plaice?" I said, "No, thank you, there are three or four loose in my van now;" but he threw three or four into my van, either because he had heard me ask for fish, or to send the officers after me. I was ashamed to see so many fish in the van, and when the boy was away, I picked them up, and put them into the sack; the boy is made to tell an untruth about them. I took one pair of soles, which I thought I had liberty to do. I should have given the loose fish in the van, which Batt threw in, to the officials at home. If the officer knew the fish were there, he must have seen Batt throw them there. What the officer says as to my telling Wells not to hide the fish, is a palpable falsehood; I told him to take it from under his coat, that he was not to be ashamed of them, as I was not; be was carrying it as if it was stolen. I have never sold a penny-worth of the Company's property in my life. I should have gone home, if the officer would have allowed me. There are half-a-dozen salesman who would give me a dozen fish, if I asked them, therefore I had no occasion to steal any. I have served the Company a long while and faithfully.</p>

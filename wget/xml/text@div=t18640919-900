                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 499). About half-past 7 on the evening of 21st August, I was on duty in the Commercial Docks—there was a fight at the corner of Grove-street, and there were between 200 and 300 people collected—I saw the prisoner there—he was stripped all but his trousers and fighting with another man—I begged of him to desist and go home quietly, and he directly showed fight to me—I told him it was no use to go on in that manner, he had better go home quietly—he refused to do so, and I took him into custody—as I took him he gave me a violent kick in the groin—he had his boots on—he then got hold of me, and threw me about—he tried to bite me, and tore at my face for about ten minutes till I got assist<lb></lb>ance—he kicked me, and bit me several times, and bit at me in the thigh—I was standing up at the time he kicked me in the groin—with the assistance of two constables he was taken to the station—I was not able to go—I was taken across the Victualling-yard and taken home in a cab—I have not done duty since—I have been under the care of a doctor, and am suffering now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and was called to see the last witness—he was in a very exhausted condition, and complained of considerable pain in the perin✗um, commonly called the fork of the body—I found tender<lb></lb>ness and swelling there, and applied leeches—he is not fit for duty at present—I think he will be fit for duty again—he may possibly suffer a little in<lb></lb>convenience, but it is porbable he will not.</p>

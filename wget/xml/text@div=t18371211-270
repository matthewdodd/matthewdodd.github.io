                  </hi>. I am a hosier, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I saw the prisoner in my shop on the 5th of December, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the evening—she asked me to show her a pair of black worsted stockings—I requested her to wait a minute or two, as I was serving a customer—she said she would; but in the meantime she took a pair of trowsers off the counter, and threw them down at her feet—I took no notice of it, and in about two minutes she stooped down, picked them up, and ran out of the shop with them under her apron—I followed, and took her in Tottenham-street—I did not see her drop them, as it was dark, but I saw them is the road, in the direction she ran, about two yards from her—when I stopped her I told her she had stolen a pair of trowsers out of my shop she said she had not, she had bought them, and paid for them—when I got her back to the shop she said she would pay me for them, but I gave her in charge.</p>

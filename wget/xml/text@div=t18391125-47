                  </hi>. I am in the service of Slater and Coates, woollen-warehousemen, Wood-street, Cheapside—the prisoner was their porter. On the 6th of November I went into the ware house, and saw him behind a pile of waistcoating—he was shuffling about, and moving a piece of goods, and putting it straight at the top—I saw him then throw something under the counter—directly he saw. me he said there were three packs we ex<lb></lb>pected from Manchester that morning, and I had better go and fetch the book to <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> the weights—I said, "No, they must bring it in themselves"—I staid in the warehouse, and after some time I saw him take the duster, and rub down the counter—he then took some paper, and what he had got under the counter, huddled it together, and walked to the top of the cellar stairs—I asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let me see"—he fell down on his knees, and said, "For God's sake don't any a word about it, and then he showed me two pieces of waistcoating which he had got—I told him I would not stand by, and see my master robbed—he said he would make amends for it at the end of the week—I said that would not do—he immediately put on his hat, and went outside the door with the waistcoating—soon after Mr. Coates came in—these are the two pieces of waistcoating he showed me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary in Ratliff-highway. The prisoner was in my employment from June, 1836—he occasionally received money on my account—in 1838, I asked him occa<lb></lb>sionally if certain persons had paid, and he said No, but they would pay at Christmas—on the 15th of November, 1838, I made some discovery, and went over, with him, a list of patients who owed me money—I asked him whether he had received Mr. Drake's account—he said No he had not—I asked him the same about Mr. Francis—he said No, he had not—he was in my service at that time, but left that afternoon—he never acknowledged having received these two sums—on the contrary, he said he had not received them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner on the 31st of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, at Stepney—I said, "Mr. Whicher, you must consider your<lb></lb>self my prisoner on account of your master, Mr. Rutherford; you have been receiving money on—his account, and I must take you to the office"—he said, "I know I have received money on his account, but I did not intend to defraud him"—in going along I said, "What money do you sup<lb></lb>pose you have received on Mr. Rutherford's account?"—he said, "Not more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," but he had got a list of the whole, and he in<lb></lb>tended to pay him—be said at first he should not go with me unless I showed him some authority—I told him I was an officer, that I apprehended him for embezzling Mr. Rutherford's money, and showed him my staff—he said, "I don't care for that authority, I shall not go with you"—he resisted a bit, but I mastered him, and got him down to the office.</p>

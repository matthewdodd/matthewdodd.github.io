               <p>Wm. Whitehead. About 12 o'Clock last Night, I met that little one (Slater) at Temple-Bar; she asked me to give her a Glass of Wine; I told her, my Pocket would not afford it; then says she, you may give me some Beer. So we went to the <placeName id="t17370114-32-crimeloc168">Coach and Horses at Temple-bar</placeName>

The other Prisoner, and another Woman that is run away, wanted me to go into a Back Room, and I went with them, and there we had another Full Pot; then the biggest of the Prisoners (Dryberry) stood before me, and the others on each Side of me, and pick'd my Pocket, of a Three Pound Twelve Piece, a Moidore and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173701140019"></xptr> a Shilling. I had all the Money in my Hand about two Minutes before - I had it when I sat down, and when I got up it was gone. The Buttons were in the Pocket with my Money, but they were gone too. One of them was found upon Slater, and I saw them in her Hands.</p>
               <p>Dryberry. Was I near you when you miss'd your Money?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. Yes; you stood before me, and pull'd up your Coats: 'Twas you that desired me to go into the Back Room.</p>
               <p>Dryberry. I was drinking a pint of Beer, and the Man and this Slater came in together, and we drank together; but when I would go home, he started up and said, he had lost his Money; I said, I had not wrong'd him, but he call'd the Watch, tho' I saw none of his Money, nor do I know the Man.</p>
               <p>Slater. He asked me to drink a pint of Beer, and then charg'd us with robbing him. Both <rs id="t17370114-32-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

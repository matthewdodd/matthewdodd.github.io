                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, United-buildings, Lisson-street, Marylebone. On 8th Nov. I went to Mr. Empson's public house, in Man<lb></lb>ning-street, and received 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, which I put into my pocket at the bar—my wife was with me, and two of my mates and their wives—I observed nobody else—I did not see the prisoner—the public house has a swing door, partly open and partly shut, so that people could look in and see what was going on, without coming in—I received the money up stairs, but I had half a pint of gin at the bar, and changed a half sovereign in payment—a person outside the door could see that—I then left, and went about 200 yards, into Bell-street—(I went into no other public house)—my wife was two or three yards behind me, and when I got opposite to Porter's <hi rend="italic">jerry</hi> shop, I was in the act of stepping off the pavement to cross the road to go home—I was immediately knocked down insensible on my face on the pavement, and was carried home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and was laid up for seven weeks—the blow was on my left temple, the skin was broken about three-quarters of an inch—I bled very much; here is blood on my jacket now—the prisoner was not taken for some time afterwards—my wife said, "That is the man," and he said that he was very sorry.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness, and was with him in the public house in Manning-street—he went up stairs to get his money, I remained down stairs—he came down and got something to drink at the bar, and took out half a sovereign—at that time the prisoner was sitting on a side form—I am sure of that, and that man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to a person</hi>) was with him—my husband put the change into his pocket, I believe, and we all went towards home—I was walking behind my husband in Bell-street, as I was carrying some loaves home—the prisoner was behind me, and this man with him, and as my husband got to the corner of Bell-street, the prisoner lifted up his hand and struck him; he fell down, and the other man said, "It is no <hi rend="italic">go</hi>, now, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>"—they ran away, while I called "Murder! police!"—assistance was procured, and my husband was</p>

               <p>taken home in a cab, and lay insensible for three weeks—I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand when he struck him—it was at the moment he was struck that I called, "Murder! police!" and they both turned round and looked at him as he lay on the ground, and one cried to the other, "It is no go, <hi rend="italic">Tom.</hi>"</p>

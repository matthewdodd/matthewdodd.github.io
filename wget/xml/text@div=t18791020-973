                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. These are known as Hanoverian medals, but they are new, and better made than any I have ever seen, and a better colour; and here is a half one, which is the same size as a half-sovereign, but not bo thick—they are milled, but the knerling is smaller than a sovereign—the legend is "Victoria Regina," and there is no coin like that—this is supposed to be the head of the Duke of Brunswick—they are used as whist-markers—they do deceive people, but I should not take them—they might be taken by gaslight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pay clerk to Mr. Shaw, builder, 79, Page Street—on 11th September Warden brought me this pay ticket, which is in Mr. Hurrell the foreman's writing—I noticed it had been altered, and handed it back to him, and told him I could not pay it, and that he would have to go to the foreman to have the alteration verified—he went, and returned with a letter, in consequence of which I gave him is custody the next morning—I did not see the foreman.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Shaw—Warden had been work<lb></lb>ing under me on 11th September as a scaffolder for five hours, and five hours the day before, and I gave him this pay-ticket between 1 and 2 for ten hours' pay at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—the figures have been altered without my sanc<lb></lb>tion from 10 to 12—he came back between 3 and 4 and showed me the ticket, and told me he could not get the money—I said "I should be sur<lb></lb>prised if you could," and I wrote a letter to the pay clerk—I had made out the ticket and gave it to Warden personally.</p>

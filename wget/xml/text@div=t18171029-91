                  <interp inst="t18171029-91-crimeloc489" type="placeName" value="the Strand"></interp>

As I was going by Northumberland House they trod on my heels again. I stopped at a shop window to see if they would pass; they did so, and ran down Villiers-street - I immediately missed my handkerchief. I ran after them, and found the prisoner up a court. I followed him through several turnings, but lost him. When I came to the Adelphi, I saw him at the top of a court; he saw me, and immediately set off running again. I stopped him at the corner of Adam-street, and am positive he is the same boy - He was in the act of throwing my handkerchief away. The other boy was stopped, but not having any thing about him, he was discharged.</p>

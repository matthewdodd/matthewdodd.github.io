            . I live in Wich-street; I lost this quilt in April last was twelve month, and never heard of it till some of the prisoner's own lodgers told me that it was upon the bed he lay on. I got a warrant, and went and found it there. How he came by it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>R. Coates. He lives in Drury-lane, the corner of Russel-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was found upon his own bed?</p>
               <p>R. Coates. His house-keeper, and a lodger, told me so. It was produced in court and deposed to. There were some velvet round the sides of it, seven yards, which are now cut off, I might have had eight guineas for it before it was stolen. It used to lie on a bed in my house, but it was taken away one night when I was asleep. Before the justice the prisoner said, he bought it of a pawnbroker at the bottom of Holborn; the justice gave him two hours to go to see for the pawn-broker, in which time he brought in two men for his bail, but the justice would, not take their bail, but the next day he was bailed out. The quilt is a curiosity, and was made in a nunnery.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you frequently declare you had reason to suspect some other people of taking it?</p>
               <p>R. Coates. I could not tell who to suspect, I did not suspect any particular person, I have seen the prisoner in my room several times come to a lodger of mine.</p>

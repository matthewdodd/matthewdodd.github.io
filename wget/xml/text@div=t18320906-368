            . I am foreman to Mr. Galloway at times. On the 31st of July, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prosecutor, having missed his things, told me to search for the prisoner, and about half-past four o'clock, I saw him in the room, and asked what he had done with Bill's things - he cried, and said he had taken and pawned them at the corner of Worship-street; I went there next day, but the pawnbroker had left; the prisoner gave me the duplicate, which I gave the Policeman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You asked where he pawned them? A. Yes; he said the house was shut up, but the goods were to be delivered in Newgate-street; but there was a board on the house referring to Mr. Joyce of the New-road; I have known the prisoner fourteen years; I never said the prosecutor had agreed to take 6s. a week not to prosecute.</p>

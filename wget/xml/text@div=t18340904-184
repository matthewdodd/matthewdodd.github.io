               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is your father's name? A. Joseph - my uncle's name is Michael - I have no uncle named Charles, nor any relation of that name - I have seen the prisoner once or twice before - he had no dealings with my father, to my knowledge, previous to that day - I am a Jew - he represented that he was going to be possessed of 2,000l., which his wife's aunt had left him, and he gave my father a paper that day to that effect - we have the paper - it was all fictitious lies.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did any Bill of Exchange pass on that occasion? A. Yes; Wilkins gave a Bill of Exchange for 50l. - 25l. was given to him, for the Bill of Exchange and there was an old debt of 25l. - he came to my father and said he was happy he was able to pay him his old debt, and brought him a bill purporting to be drawn on Alexander, his wife's aunt's executor, and gave him a paper to that effect - my father inquired about it, and understanding there was a Mr. Alexander, a respectable man, and the bill purporting to be drawn on him, he said as the dividends were not payable till July, he had allowed him to draw the bill of 50l., which he brought to my father to discount, and take 25l., his old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040104"></xptr>debt, out - my father never had any dealings with him till that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How then did he owe him 25l.? A. It was a bill on Mr. Tibbins for 15l., and the costs amounted to 25l. - he was party to that bill - Mr. Tibbins was a bankrupt, and he endorsed the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the bill given to receive 25l., to pay 15l. which was the debt, and the rest for the watch? A. No; it was 25l. for the old debt - my father did not give any receipt on account of the old debt - directly my father ascertained it was all a trick, he went before a Justice - that was about three weeks afterwards, as far as I can recollect - I believe the interview at the Bank Coffee-house was on the 27th of June, and the latter end of July or the beginning of August applied to before the magistrate - he had given full value for the bill in money and the old debt - I saw the prisoner about a week afterwards, and said, "Where is my watch?" and he pulled it out of his pocket - my father went several times to the house, and he could not be found, and he sent him a letter - my father appeared at Lambeth-street, and made a charge against the prisoner - I do not exactly know on what day - I went to the Mansion-house after that about this charge - I wanted to prefer the charge at Lambeth-street, but they said I must go the Mansion-house - my father's charge was not dismissed - I believe it was a charge of obtaining money, under false pretences - it was not a felony, but a fraud - the prisoner was ordered to be taken to the Mansion-house, the money being obtained in the City - I went before the Lord Mayor respecting the watch after I had been to Lambeth-street, but I do not recollect the date - Mr. Norton was the attorney at Lambeth-street - my father went to Lambeth-street of his own accord - I was only at one examination at Lambeth-street - on my oath I was only there once - I went to the Mansion-house after that - I then went to Guildhall, as the Lord Mayor did not sit that day - I appeared at the Mansion-house about the beginning of August - I know it was in August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to Guildhall on the 20th of August, and to the Mansion-house on the 26th of August? A. I do not know the dates - I think it was about five weeks before I went to either place - I will not swear it was less than seven - I will swear it was less than eight weeks from the day the watch was obtained, till I went before the Lord Mayor at the Mansion-house - when he showed me the watch, he said he had not seen Mr. Alexander - I did not demand it of him - I did not tell Mr. Norton about it - I have never seen the prisoner between June and August - I did not go to look for him - my father did - and my father had such confidence in him, seeing him dressed all in black, and he gave him a paper, which my father has got.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You expected he would return the watch in two or three days? A. I did; I never gave him authority to keep it - the Bill of Exchange forms the subject of another charge against him.</p>

             - and after the business had been transacted about a bill, he said Mr. Alexander was a very good friend, and he should like to make him a present of a watch - my son happened to take his watch out, and he said, "I should like one something like that," and said he should like something similar to present to Mr. Alexander - my son seemed to look at me, to know if he should allow him to show it, as he said he should like to show it to Mr. Alexander, and if he liked it, he should like to give him one similar to it - he took the watch away - he was to return it in a few days, I am certain - my son has never got it, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I do not know whether you and I are old acquaintances? A. I have had the pleasure of seeing you before - the watch was merely seen by the prisoner by accident - my son might have taken it out, and Wilkins see it and say, "I should like to make a similar present to Alexander" - he said he should like a watch like my son's, which he had seen before - my son might have taken it out, whether by accident I do not know - he never saw my son before.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been a bankrupt, Mr. Millingen? A. I have been a bankrupt, and am proud to boast I have paid 20s. in the pound - I was a bankrupt twenty-two years ago - I was one but a year ago, and lost 22,000l. - I have been a bankrupt four times, but always paid 20s. in the pound - I have never compounded with my creditors or taken the benefit of the Act - I never superseded either of the commissions - I have been plundered of too much money - there was 3,000l. to pay 1,000l. - I have been convicted of a conspiracy - I beg to state it was through the attorney who is now conducting the defence, Saul Yates, of Bury-street - it was in consequence of his swearing he saw placards in the hands of myself, and the other party, when we had ten respectable witnesses - we have a rule nisi granted for a new trial, on the perjury of Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the rest of your misfortunes, how often have you been burnt out and recovered the money from the offices? A. I never recovered money but once - when my wife was nearly burnt to death, I received 70l., and my costs were 200l. - I have had fires in my factory when I was not insured for a farthing, and lost 1,000l. - I think fires have occurred accidentally at my manufactory three times, but I was not insured for 1s. - I never swore that I once received 70l., and at another time 100l. - I think about eighteen years ago there was a sum of 110l., and 70l. when my wife was nearly burnt to death - it was not 200l. that I said I recovered - to my knowledge I never said so - I cannot tell what I said three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you recovered 90l. once, and 200l. at another time? A. I cannot say that I did - I will not say I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you ever indict a gentleman named Jessop, or something, for perjury? A. Yes; there have been indictments and cross indictments and informations, and 1,000l. has been spent in law expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. When you prosecuted that person, did not the Jury stop the case in the middle, and declare themselves satisfied? A. I suppose they were satisfied - there have been complete cross indictments - it was on the 27th of June that my son and I were at the Bank Coffee-house - my son, I believe, saw the prisoner a week afterwards - I was not present - I made application to him by letter, I think, on the 1st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040105"></xptr>August - I expected the watch was the same as my bill, that all he had told me about his wife's aunt and the property was as true as could be - the bill was due on the 31st of July - I then found it was worth nothing - I applied to the magistrate about eight or ten days after, at Lambeth-street - I think, the prisoner was held to bail - fully committed - he was not held to bail at Lambeth-street - he was fully committed, that I swear - I went to Guildhall, I believe, two or three days after, for we found out the occurrence took place in the City, and could not be entertained - the Lambeth-street magistrate did not tell me that he had no jurisdiction - if your client has told you so, it is false; if my son said so, it must not be with any intention, but a mistake - I mentioned, on my examination before the magistrate, at Lambeth-street, that he obtained a gold watch to show Mr. Alexander, and at Guildhall, before Alderman Copeland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get to the Mansion-house before the 26th of August? A. I really cannot tell - I went myself and took the prisoner about the bill on Wednesday morning, for we could not find him at home - I took him first on the Bill of Exchange - the Bill of Exchange was given for part money he owed me two years ago, and 25l. cash - I discounted a bill of 15l. brought to me by Mr. Tibbins - it was never paid, and both parties were sued on it - the prisoner called, and said he was a poor man, and it was useless my going against him - I let it go against Tibbins - my expenses were 10l.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The affair of the bill is the subject of a future indictment? A. Yes: I have indicted him for fraud respecting that transaction - that bill has nothing to do with the watch - my son has never been burnt out at any time, nor a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or your son in your presence, on your oath, give him any authority whatever to dispose of or pawn the watch? A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He pawned it in his right name and place of abode? A. Yes: I found him at that place - I did not know him before - I was not applied to to look after him till the Saturday - I was present at the examination at Lambeth-street - the watch was mentioned there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the examination at Lambeth-street taken down in writing? A. No: he was remanded to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What charge was he examined on? A. First on a charge of forgery, it was then considered to be fraud - Mr. Norton, the solicitor, discovered on Tuesday that the offence was committed in the City - he was not committed from our office - he was remanded to the Mansion-house - I took him there on the Thursday, I think to Guildhall; and to the Mansion-house, on the 26th - he was not committed for the bill - the bill was mentioned - Mr. Norton attended as attorney for the prosecution, at both examinations.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has the prisoner an attorney? A. Yes - the Bill of Exchange and the watch are two different transactions, and form two separate indictments.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MILLINGEN re-examined. This is my watch - I never gave him any authority to sell or dispose of it in any way - he promised to return it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the watch finished when it went out of your hands? A. I am not in the trade - it is one I wear myself - I had worn it six months.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did it go like another watch? A. Yes - I wound it up regularly.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, in his defence, made a long address, which was partly inaudible: the substance was - that the charge was supported by gross perjury - that, in 1831, Millingen, sen., held a bill for 15l., accepted by the prisoner, and drawn by one Tibbins, which bill was given in consequence of some proceedings in the Insolvent Debtors' Court; the bill was dishonoured, Tibbins took the benefit of the Insolvent Act, but gave Millingen another bill for the one in question, and Millingen informed the prisoner he was exonerated from all liability on the bill - that he met Millingen the Bank Coffee-house, on the 27th of June, by appointment, having asked him to discount a £50 bill: which Millingen proposed to do, by giving £20 cash, selling the watch for 15l., and taking 15l. to pay Tibbins's bill - the prisoner objected to purchase the watch, and declined the proposal; Milligen then offered 25l. cash, to charge 10l. for the watch, to take 15l. for Tibbins's bill, and the prisoner's I O U for 14l. 15s., which included a sum of 9l. for costs incurred on Tibbis's bill; this was acceded to, and the prosecutor made no application to him to return the watch, nor did he charge him with stealing it till after he found he could not substantiate a charge of forgery against him.)</p>

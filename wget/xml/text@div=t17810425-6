In two or three minutes after they were gone out, I looked and missed the watch, upon which I called out Stop thief! they were not out of sight; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250009"></xptr> prisoner and the other woman ran; I ran after them: a gentleman stopped the prisoner; and, when she was stopped, she likewise called out Stop thief! upon which that gentleman let her go: she was stopped afterwards by a person who had picked up the watch: when I came up to her, she said she had not got the watch.</p>

               <p>I was in the street at the time; I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw a person running; I also ran; I saw the watch dropped by the prisoner; I was about ten yards behind her, and the other woman was on the other side of me; I was between them; I took the watch up; I made up to her, and stopped her.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop with another person who was an old acquaintance of mine; she was going to buy some china for her mistress; she thought I was a better judge of it than herself, as I had been the mother of children: the young woman asked 7 s. for half a dozen cups and saucers; I said I thought it was too much: she said she would go home and tell her mistress the price. I asked to go backwards. I went into the parlour with this woman to write the direction; after I had wrote the note, I came out into the shop: we came out of the door: the person with me said she saw a gentleman pass that was a good friend of hers; she ran after him, and spoke to him; we ran together; I heard the cry of Stop thief! when this gentleman stopped me, he said, I believe you are the thief; I said, I do not know what you mean; if any thing is lost, pursue that young woman, as she has run away: then the gentleman let me go, and ran after the young woman; but whether he catched her or not I do not know. I put an advertisement in the paper, but could never find out the gentleman. I never knew her guilty of any thing of this sort before, if she is guilty now. I am above five months gone with child.</p>

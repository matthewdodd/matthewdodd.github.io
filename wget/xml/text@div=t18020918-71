               <p>Q. Were there any other persons in the shop? - A. There were other persons in the shop, but no one saw him besides me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what the parcel contained at that time, or only that he took a parcel? - A. I knew what it contained, for it was packed up and directed, I had seen it packed up that same morning.</p>

               <p>Q.When he had taken up the parcel, what did he do? - A. He walked out immediately, and said nothing; I called up one of our young men, and we pursued him and took him with the dimity, which is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking or running? - A.Walking across the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. I asked him where he was going with that parcel, he made for answer, "all's well;" then I took him back to the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. He would reply to nothing we asked him, but made as if he was drunk.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, all I can say is, that I have been at sea eight years, and was never known to do any thing dishonest, nor can any thing be alledged against me, except this; unfortunately I fell into my ship-mate's company, and they gave me liquor, which made me stupid; I really did not know what I was about.</p>

On the 4th of April, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in Fleet-street—an officer told me something—I looked, and my handkerchief was gone from my pocket—I never saw it afterwards—the officer begged I would return, as his brother officer had got a prisoner—I returned, and saw the officer strug<lb></lb>gling with another man who has been tried, and I believe transported.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a patrol in Fleet-street. On the 4th of April, I observed the prisoner and another of the name of Wales, following the prosecutor up Fleet-street—I saw Wales attempt his pocket—Martin was walking alongside of him—I had seen them speaking together before, and told them to go on—I had seen them together an hour—I watched them, and called upon the other witness to observe them—to they were crossing the end of Shoe-lane, Wales took the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and immediately gave it to the prisoner—I told the other witness to follow the gentleman—I immediately seized them both—Martin struggled with me very much, and threw the other prisoner and me down in the gutter, Martin got away—I had him in my left hand—as he got up—he had the handkerchief, and said to me, "<hi rend="italic">No go</hi> this time, Thorp"—and ran off—in getting up, I found his hat which he left under me—he ran away without one—I saw it fall from his head.</p>

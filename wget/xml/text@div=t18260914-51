The male prisoner was in the employ of my son and Mr. Gylby, whose office is in my house - I had retired, but live in the house. On Wednesday, the 9th of August, I paid some money away, and supposed I put the rest of my notes into my cash-box- but on Saturday I found in my hurry I had left 170l. or 175l. in notes on the desk in the office, instead of putting them into the cash-box; I missed a 100l. and a 50l. note among others - I had received the 100l. note from my son, Charles, that morning, and the 50l. from Mr. Humphrys; it was part of a sum he had received from Messrs. Hoares'. The prisoner continued in my son's service till the 9th, and came on the 10th, but was absent on Friday and Saturday - on missing my notes his absence made me suspect him - he never returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had the prisoner and Mr. Gylby a dispute on Thursday? A. Not a dispute - he admonished him mildly about some neglect, and said he suspected he drank, which, if he discovered, he should discharge him - he did not turn him out of the office.</p>

I said unless he changed his conduct I should dismiss him, as he had been long enough; I had blamed him about a parcel-book which was lost; we have twelve clerks - they all have access to the office. There is a railing which separates the desk from the other part of the office. Mr. Allen is vestry-clerk, and uses the office for his business.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not inform Mr. Allen of this till the 12th? A.

The prisoners slept in the next room - the second night they slept there I was awoke by their coming to bed, about half-past twelve o'clock - the man appeared much intoxicated - soon after I heard a conversation between them, but I was not thoroughly awake; all I could gather was, that he was much surprised, after being in the gentleman's employ so long, that he should be accused as he had been that afternoon; just after that I heard a rattling of paper, and the female expressing her surprise, in a kind of shriek - she asked him how he came by it - this thoroughly awoke me, and excited my curiosity; I got out of bed to listen; I went against the wainscot - the woman asked how he came by that money - he said it was no odds to her, that it was his own, and he intended to leave London, and asked if she would go with him; that he should first go to Dover, then to Calais, and two or three other places - she said she would not, and wished him to take the money back to Mr. somebody, whose name I did not hear;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140040"></xptr>he said he should go whether she would go or not - she said he had better not, but return the property, and not defraud so kind an employer or benefactor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time of the day was this? A. About four o'clock in the afternoon - our shop is not dark; I was questioned about this the next week, and said I should know him if I saw him - that he wore a dark coat, but I would not be certain of the colour; I did not say it was green; he might be a quarter of an hour in the shop - selling two watches to one person enables me to recollect him; I swear positively to him.</p>

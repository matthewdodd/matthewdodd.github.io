            . I am a watchman. I was going my round about eight minutes past ten o'clock, and I made a stand, as I always do, at one particular corner, I saw the prisoner come out at the wicket gate, with this malt on his shoulder; the gate opens into Brewers'-green, where Mr. Chamber's premises are - I went up to him, and asked what he had there; he said, "Malt." I asked where he was going, he said, "Round there;" I said, I should go with him, and he went round to No. 12; he made a stand, and a little girl came out. I felt the sack - I told him to put it down, and asked if Mr. Chambers knew of it; he said he did - I said I should take him and the malt to the watch-house, till I had authority from Mr. Chambers; he asked me if I knew him - I said, No; he asked if I knew his mother, Mrs. Bunn; I said, I did, by passing through my beat - he asked if I would allow him to send for her; I said Yes: by that little girl, which he did - the mother came, and asked what was the matter, and told me if I would come round the corner, she would explain things to me. I went round, and as soon as I got in at the door, she wished me for God Almighty's sake, to have nothing to do with it; as soon as I found how things were going on, I retreated away; the prisoner had then made his escape. I took the malt to the watch-house, and the prisoner was taken in bed, about twelve o'clock by the patrol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you leave him? A. By the wicket; I was not away above five minutes - I am sober now, and have drunk nothing but a pint of porter; I do not recollect whether I have been to more than one public-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The malt was not Mr. Chambers'. I cart malt and ask for the sweepings; I had saved it and meant to brew with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

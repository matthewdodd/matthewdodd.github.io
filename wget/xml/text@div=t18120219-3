On the 3d of this month, between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190004"></xptr>eleven and twelve o'clock I missed the table; I had seen it about half an hour before I missed it. When I missed it I pursued the prisoner, from information I went directly up the street, and into another street, through a court in Chapel-street, I found the prisoner and the table upon him; the prisoner was carrying it, he did not go any further; I halloaed out to him, and he stopped. I apprehended him, and here he is come upon that apprehension. The table is here at the door, my name is upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you written your name upon it before it was stolen - A. No, but I know the make of the table; it is not my own making, but I had observed the make before it was stolen. I know the table well.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to the prisoner when he stopped - A. I asked him how he came to do it; he said that somebody had told him to take it; he made some frivolous excuse. I hardly know what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the table standing at the door - A. No, rather round a corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house is in Middlesex - A. Yes, in Shoreditch parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at all before - A. I believe I have seen him somewhere about. I have lost many things, but that is neither here or there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I humbly acknowledge the crime laid to my charge, but it was distress that drove me to it. I have a wife and six poor children, and I humbly beg for mercy. My wife and children have been removed to the workhouse since my confinement.</p>

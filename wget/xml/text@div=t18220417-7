On the 14th of March, about twenty minutes after seven o'clock at night, the prisoner came to the house, and said he had brought a letter which required an answer. I said the family was not home. He said he would call the next night with it; he would not leave it. He brought it again next night, and requested an answer. I told him to come into the passage. - I took the letter of him, and shut the door; he stood on the mat. I laid the letter down on the sideboard, and went down stairs for my coat; when I came up he still stood where I had left him. I took the letter to Miss Sharpe in the drawing-room, but as I suspected something, I returned to the stair-case, and looked over the bannisters - I saw him take the clock off the bracket in the hall, and saw it in his hand; I ran down, calling Stop thief! He opened the door with one hand, having the clock in the other, and dropped it on the threshold of the door, and ran off. I pursued, and took him in Lamb's Conduit-street, without losing sight of him. I am sure he is the man. It is Miss Sharpe's dwelling-house.</p>

He dropped it at my feet - I collared him, but he got from me. The footman pursued him quite close; it is impossible he could lose sight of him. The prisoner is of the same stature and dress as the man, but I will not swear to him.</p>

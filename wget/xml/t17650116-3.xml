            . My husband is named Christopher, he and I had a few words about two months ago, and I went to a neighbour's house, name Mrs. White; the prisoner lodged there: I staid all night: she persuaded me to come to bed to her, rather than sit up in a chair all night; so I went to bed to her: I had my ring on my finger when I went to bed, and in the morning it was gone: the prisoner was taken up, and before Justice Welch she owned she had taken it, and pawned it to Mr. Humphreys; it was sent for to the justice's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphreys. The prisoner at the bar brought this ring to me on the 9th of November, to pawn; she said it was her own ring: I lent her three shillings upon it, (produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I picked up the ring on the stair-head: the prosecutrix came in very drunk, and went out again for a dram; and when she came back she had lost her cloak from off her shoulders.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She took the ring from my finger.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not say so at first.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She took it when I was asleep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Humphreys. Pray what is my character?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I have known the prisoner seven or eight years: I never knew but that she was a very honest woman.</p>

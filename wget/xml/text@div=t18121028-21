            . I live in Ivey-lane, Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this that you are now going to relate - A. Last Monday three weeks. I was going towards home. I was in <placeName id="t18121028-21-crimeloc131">Finsbury</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18121028-21-crimeloc131" type="placeName" value="Finsbury"></interp>

I went to see what was the matter. I found a hackney coach had broke down. The coachman had been thrown off his box. I asked him, if I could render him any assistance. He said, that he had lost the plates from his coach. I saw a man take the plates from under his coat. I told the man, he was a shabby fellow to act in that way. I told the coachman, if he would come after me I would take the man to the office. He said, it would cause a great deal of trouble, and I had better let him go. I then said to the prisoner, if I let you go, you shall not go without something. I directly struck him two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you hit him - A. In the mouth. He went away from me for three minutes, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was - A. No. I heard a man saying, where is the man that struck me. I went to the person that called out. He put himself in a posture to fight. I acted in the same manner, and struck him first. I struck him several blows. He made several blows, but never hit me once. I hit him several times with my blows, and as I followed him, he kept falling back. I followed him, hitting him again. I found something prick me on the left side. I followed him about three yards farther, hitting him. I then felt something run into me like an instrument. I directly cried out, I was stabbed. I believe the man was secured directly, and I was taken to a surgeon's. I was wounded just under the short ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man you was so engaged with - A. I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or not; I was so engaged, and it was a very dark night.</p>

I saw the prisoner near the clock; he had the clock door open - one of his hands was up at the clock, and his other hand had the hands of the clock in it; I asked him if I should put the hands on, and he said No, he would put them on himself; I went into the beer cellar soon after, and ran against something in the dark - I felt it, and it was the prisoner; he asked which way he should go out - I said not through the kitchen, as Mrs. Richardson was there, and he went another way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you for some beer? A. Yes, and you asked which way you should go out not to be seen.</p>

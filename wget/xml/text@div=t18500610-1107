                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Thompson, of Nelson-street, Bethnal-green—the prisoner lives in the same house; her husband is a black<lb></lb>smith—they have four children; the youngest is about eight months old; it is called Ann. On Tuesday afternoon, 21st May, between four and five o'clock, I went out with her and her husband and mine, and a few friends, to Victoria-park—when we were in Birdcage-walk, outside the park, a few words took place between the prisoner and her husband, but I did not hear them—I saw him strike her—about an hour and a half afterwards we were walking by the water in the Park—she had hold of my arm—her child was sucking at her breast—she slipped, and when I turned my head she was in the water—I became very much alarmed, I do not know what happened—about eight minutes after, I saw the prisoner and the baby out of the water—she had been fretting, and when I told her not to fret the made me no answer—I have lived twelve months in the same house with them—they appeared to live very happily indeed—she has got a boy who is deaf and dumb.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Tyson-street, Bethnal-green. On 21st May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Victoria-park, showing my boy the ducks in the ornamental water—I saw the prisoner leap into the water with the baby in her arms—she let go of it in the water—my brother went in and caught hold of the prisoner, and I went and got the child—it had gone under the water, which was about three feet deep—after the prisoner was got out she said, "Oh my child! oh Watson! it is a pity you saved me, for this is the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of my husband's ill-usage; I have got a deaf and dumb child at home, and I wish he was here"—she appeared to me as if she had been drinking—I sent for the Park-keeper—I knew her as a neighbour—I met her crying before I got to the Park-gates—she seemed in a great deal of trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it by smelling her that you judged she had been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, by the distracted way in which she spoke—I was six, or seven yards from her when this occurred—I did not see Mrs. Thompson—my attention was directed to the object in the water—the prisoner had the baby in her arms at first, and as she got deeper in the water, it slipped from her—it went entirely under water—I waited till it came up—the bank, was sloping—I was about two yards from it, in about two feet of water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the last witness, and live in Christo<lb></lb>pher-street, Bethnal-green. I was about four or five yards from the water's edge, and saw the prisoner leap into the water with the child in her arms—in her struggling she let go of it—I immediately went in after her—I had to go about two yards before I got hold of her—she was under water, and the child also—after my brother had saved the child, with his assistance I got the prisoner out—she said, "Oh, Watson, I wish you had let me be in there, for the ill-usage of my husband is the cause of this"—she appeared to me to be intoxicated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you noticed the prisoner before you saw her leap from the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she was brought out and laid on the grass—she called out for her child very much—I did not smell her breath—it was from the distracted way in which she was, that I thought she was intoxicated—she jumped in—she took both her feet off the ground at once—I did not exactly see her feet, the first time I saw her was when she was in motion—I am sure she jumped in.</p>

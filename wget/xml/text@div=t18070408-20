             lives in the house. On the 1st of April, about a quarter before four in the evening, the prisoner came into the sale shop and asked to look at a watch that was in the window; having several watches in the window I asked him what kind of a one, he said one with a going fusee; knowing that we had but one of that kind in the shop, which was a gold chronometer, with a label fixed to it price forty-six pound, I took it out of the window, took the label off and put it on the counter. He pulled out of his fob pocket a little metal watch, &amp;c. then took up the gold chronometer, saying, I shall try this for a few days; he put it into his side pocket of his great coat. I thought he meaned to leave it with us to try it; he immediately went off with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he give you his directions. - A. No, not knowing the prisoner I followed him, and within ten or twelve yards I came up to him; I then brought him back with the watch in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. What said he to you when you came up to him. - A. I said it is a strange thing taking away a watch of this value. He repeated the words that he should try it for a few days and then return it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who he was. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce the watch to you. - A. Yes, directly I brought him back to the shop he took it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the metal watch - A. About a pound or thirty-shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Did not you think from the manner of him, that he was more of a madman than a thief. - A. Upon my word by the manner of his going on I think he was.</p>

            . I know nothing of the robbery. I was called out of the parlour. I saw the two watches lay on the counter; the boy informed me that he asked for the sight of the chronometer, and he had taken it way. I asked him how he came to take a watch of that value, he said he had a right to take it away as the boy gave it him. I asked him his name, he said it was

            , that he worked for Mr. Hansard a printer. I asked him again what he meant by taking such a watch; he was very sullen, he said what is that to you; I told him for his impertinence I should make an example of him, otherwise I did not wish to punish him. I sent the boy for a constable, he returned and said there was no one could be found; upon hearing that he walked to the door, he said he should go out, he should not be detained. I said he should not go out, he knocked down some books and a glass worth five guineas, at last we secured him and took him to Hatton-garden; he behaved in the same riotous manner fighting and quarreling there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain how he came to take this watch.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080015"></xptr> - A. No, I could get very little out of him.

            . - Mr. Curwood. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar has worked for me and my father four or five years; he always bore the character of a very sober and honest man; for the last six or eight years he has been very strange.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that he is lately deranged. - A. I am fully persuaded of it. I have lately been obliged to get him out of the office by stratagem, and twice by force.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of derangement had you observed. - A. In his manner of doing his work, and particularly in his manner of talking. A week or two ago he got in some uproar and was put in the compter; when he came out he said he should enter an action against them and get twenty or thirty pounds, and he would purchase a watch and become a gentleman.</p>

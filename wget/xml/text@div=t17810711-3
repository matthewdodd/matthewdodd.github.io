               <p>I was driving the Towcester waggon, for Mr. Eagles of Towcester, from London to Towcester. On Thursday se'nnight, at night, the 27th of June, I was stopped between the twelve and thirteen mile-stone, a little beyond <placeName id="t17810711-3-crimeloc14">Barnet</placeName>

At about twelve o'clock, three men came to me suddenly, and stopped me; one put a pistol to my face, and said if I did not stop, he would blow my brains out; one laid hold of my left arm, with a cutlass in his hand, and said he would cut my bloody head off if I made any resistance; the other took hold of my right hand. The man that had the pistol, stood before me; the other two released me, and went and stopped the team; then he that had the pistol before me, ordered me to turn my face the contrary way from the waggon. They set a ladder that was behind the waggon, and asked me who I had got in the waggon; I said, a passenger, and a man that belonged to the waggon. My face was the other way; but I heard them take the ladder down from behind the waggon. They then asked for a portmanteau for which half-a-guinea had been paid for booking and the carriage; they told the man in the waggon they would blow his brains out if he did not deliver it directly; he said he did not know he had any such thing in the waggon: they said, if he belonged to the waggon, and was at the loading it, he must know it; and insisted on his delivering it out directly, and the best of the goods in the waggon. I heard them get the things down, and carry them away; and, by the lumber they made, I suppose they were putting them in a cart. While they were gone with the first of the things, the man that stood over me went towards the goods, and then I looked at him. He said they were tradesmen in London, and had met with misfortunes; but they would not hurt me or any man. They came the second time, and got up into the waggon, and found this portmanteau which they had asked for. When they had taken the goods the second time, they carried them the way they carried the first; then two of them came back to me, and ordered me to take my whip and go on, and not say any thing to any body.</p>

               <p>Was it dark? - It was a very star-light night.</p>

               <p>Where did you see him again on Saturday? - Before the justice, at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Was he in the same dress then? - No.</p>

               <p>How did you know it was the same man? - By his speech and favour.</p>

               <p>Did you see enough of him that night to know his face again? - Yes; he was with me about three-quarters of an hour: they talked to me.</p>

               <p>Are you positive he is the man? - Yes; I am certain of it.</p>

               <p>Do you know either of the others? - I can't be so positive to either of them, because I did not see so much of them.</p>

               <p>You will not swear that either of them is one of the other two men who were there? - No; I can't.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a day-labourer. I have been with Mr. Eagles's team three or four journies. Upon the 28th of June last, I was at a little distance behind the waggon with a cart; when I came up the hill, near the waggon, three men came up to me, and swore they would cut my head off if I did not stand still; there were four in sight; one said, Let him come up to the waggon, and stop there. When I came up to the waggon, Levy came before me, and said, D - n your eyes, if you don't stop and turn your face another way, I will cut your head off; he had a cutlass in his hand: and the little fellow with the green coat, Parker, had a pistol. One of them got up into the waggon; he is not here. Parker walked backwards and forwards, and talked to the waggoner. One went into the waggon, and threw the goods out.</p>



               <p>You don't know which is the man that got into the waggon? - Yes, I know him now; it is Abrahams.</p>

               <p>When did you see him first after he was taken? - At Bow-street. I know them all three now.</p>

               <p>Did you know them all three at Bow-street? - Yes; I did.</p>

               <p>Will you swear to all three of them now? - Yes, I will; I know them all.</p>

               <p>How many got into the waggon? - One only, Abrahams; he got into the waggon to Mr. Murrall; the other two stood on the ladder; one said, D - n his eyes, if he don't throw the goods out, cut his head off.</p>

               <p>Who said that? - Abrahams had the cutlass; he said he would cut Mr. Murrall's head off if he did not band him such things as they wanted. There were four of them in sight. It was a moon-light night; just before it went down, it came through an hedge as bright as the light of a candle at night.</p>

               <p>Did you know the fourth man that came up? - Yes; that is Robus.</p>

               <p>Only three came up to you? - Yes; one stood at a little distance from my horse.</p>

               <p>Where did the other stand? - He stood between my horse's head and the tail of the waggon.</p>

               <p>How near were you to Robus? - About three yards.</p>

               <p>Are you sure he was one of them? - Yes. When they stopped me, they went to the tail of the waggon. They asked who were up in the waggon. This man said it was only a poor passenger, and a man that drives the waggon. Abrahams got up into the waggon, with his cutlass in his hand, and used such ugly words no man ever heard of; and said, if he did not deliver out such goods as he wanted, he would cut his bloody head off. I saw them throw two boxes out then. I took notice of them all the while, after they threw these two boxes out, to see whether I should know them again. They put the boxes on the causeway by the road side; then they flung two or three parcels down; afterwards Levy and Robus carried the things from the waggon to the causeway. There were five in sight; where the fifth is now, I do not know; he was with the cart.</p>

               <p>How far was their cart from the waggon, when they were robbing it? - I believe, about as far as it is to the bottom of the steps. They carried them from the causeway into the field.</p>

               <p>Do you know what the two boxes were, they took out? - One was a box of toys, and the other a box of snuff. The snuff belonged to a man at Stoney Stratford, and the toys to Mr. Crosby at Towcester.</p>

               <p>How long was it from the time they first came up to you till they left you? - They came up between twelve and one; it wanted about a quarter of two when they left us: after they left us, when we got to the top of the hill, the birds in the hedge began to whistle.</p>

               <p>How soon after did you see any of the prisoners again? - Not till I came the next journey with the waggon: last Thursday se'nnight I was called up to witness against them in Bow-street.</p>

               <p>At the time you saw them in Bow-street did you know them all, or only some of them? - I knew all the four as they sat upon the top of the bench, before ever they went in before the Judge.</p>

               <p>Did any person point them out to you, or did you find them out yourself? - I found them out myself.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110097"></xptr>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>What kind of sight have you? - I have but one eye, but I have very good sight; I can see as far as those that have two, and have as quick a sight.</p>

               <p>What position were you in when the waggon stopped? - I was upon my horse on one side of the cart.</p>

               <p>As you have a good sight, I hope you have a good memory? - I hope I have.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect what you swore in Bow-street? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How many men did you challenge at Bow-street? - These three of them (pointing them out.)</p>

               <p>Did you positively challenge them? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you swear to the best of your belief, or to your knowledge? - To my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Did not you say in Bow-street, you believed Levy and Abrahams were the men? - I did not mention their names.</p>

               <p>You pointed to them? - I did.</p>

               <p>To the other two you swore, to the best of your belief? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You could not swear to them? - Yes, I could.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you, when you was before the Justice, swear all four were the men; or how many did you swear against? - I swore against two, I touched two of them.</p>

               <p>You did not touch the other two? - No, because this man had sworn to one of them.</p>

               <p>You did not swear to the other two? - No, I know them; but they did not ask me any questions about them.</p>

               <p>You swear now to Levy and Robus? - These two I swear to (pointing out Levy and Robus.)</p>

               <p>You swore to Levy and Abrahams at Bow-street? - I did.</p>

               <p>Now you think proper to swear to Levy and Robus? - I do not know what their names are.</p>

               <p>What induced you at Bow street to swear to Abrahams and Levy, and now to swear to Levy and Robus? - I know, Levy and the man behind him (Robus) were the men.</p>

               <p>When was the first time you saw them? - On the Monday that day week,</p>

               <p>When you was in Bow-street, you swore to two of them? - I did.</p>

               <p>You swore to your belief? - I did.</p>

               <p>Was you asked if you knew all four? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What answer did you make? - I said, I knew two: he asked me if I knew any more of them; I said I did not just then.</p>

               <p>First when you saw these men, they were upon the bench? - Yes, all four together.</p>

               <p>In the corner of the room? - Yes.</p>

               <p>They had all irons on? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did not you challenge one that had no irons on, that was not one of those four, and said, This is one? - A man put his hand over the other men's heads. I said I had nothing to do with him; he put his hand back, and laughed.</p>

               <p>How came you not to know them all four on the bench? - Because there was such a croud of people, they hid them as they passed by me; when they came out, I knew them all.</p>

               <p>I am book-keeper to Mr. Eagle. I was in the waggon at the time it was robbed: I heard the waggon stopped by some men: the ladder was taken from underneath the waggon, and put behind: they asked who was in the waggon: Huckle said, a passenger and a waggoner. The first goods they took out were two trusses, a bundle, a mat, and a long deal box containing cloaths; I can't say what they were, only as the person that the box belonged to informed the carrier: the trusses contained drapery goods, I apprehend.</p>

               <p>What time was it? - Between twelve and one o'clock.</p>

               <p>How long were they there? - Full half an hour, or more: they went away with these things; they were gone about ten minutes; then they came back and demanded a trunk that had paid half a guinea carriage. I did not know of any such trunk: I said there was a trunk that had paid half a crown; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110098"></xptr> not know whereabouts that was loaded. The man that was up in the waggon put a pistol to my head, and swore, if I did not find it and deliver it, he would blow my brains out. The second time they had this box, and two boxes of snuff, of

About ten minutes after, a man came back with a pistol, and ordered a man to pick up the things that lay in the road, which they would not have; accordingly, the man put them into the waggon again, and I received them: there was a cask of ink, some soft soap, and a bottle of oil. After they had got all up, they ordered the man to drive on gently, and I saw no more of them.</p>

               <p>My husband is a plane-maker in Red-lion-court, Grub-street. I have known the prisoner Robus about six months, by living neighbours in the court with him. He came to my house the 28th of June, about half after ten o'clock, to ask for his wife: she had been at our house, and was gone to look after Mr. Robus.</p>

               <p>Where was your husband? - Out; he works very late.</p>

               <p>How long had his wife been with you? - Two hours: he sat down and asked for something to eat; my maid went for some ham for him. Mrs. Robus came in, and some words passed between them. I went home with them, and saw them safe into their own house; that was after twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>How long did they stay? - Till past twelve.</p>

               <p>Did your husband come home then? - No, he was at his punch club.</p>

               <p>How came you to recollect the day? - I had paid my rent the 25th, the Monday; that made me remember it so particularly. I paid my rent on Monday the 25th, and the Thursday following must certainly be the 28th.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 1, Pultney-court, Golden-square. Levy has lodged with me five or six months. I let him in on the 28th of June; I believe it was last Thursday week.</p>

               <p>Court. What reason had you to believe it was the Thursday evening you let him in? I was at home all the Thursday evening, I was not at home on the Friday.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was not earlier? - Yes, I went to a person last Monday se'nnight in Tothill-fields: when I went in, I saw Levy sitting smoaking his pipe; I was surprised to see him ther e, not knowing any thing that had happened.</p>

               <p>Had not you made any enquiry after him? - I never knew that he was absent, or whether he was at home or not.</p>

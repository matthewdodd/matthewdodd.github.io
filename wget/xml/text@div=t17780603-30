               <p>I was called down stairs, it being dusk, to bring a candle; as I came down with the candle, I saw the prisoner going out; there was a woman looking at some goods. I was about to shut the glass door, because we could not hear what the woman said for the noise in the street. She said, do not shut the door, my husband is coming in: my husband then missed a bundle of stockings. I went to fetch a constable, and saw the prisoner, at the corner of George-yard, with the stockings under his coat; he attempted to run away; I laid hold of his coat, upon which he dropped the stockings, and a man took them up.</p>

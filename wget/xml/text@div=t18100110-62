I found the spoon at a silversmith's in Barbican, by the prisoner's direction. After she was in the watchhouse I looked about and missed three handkerchiefs and a towel; I have seen them since.</p>
               <p>SARAH COLE. Q. Are you the wife of Mr. Cole - A. Yes; he is a silversmith, 54, Barbican. On the 28th of December, about five o'clock in the evening, I bought a silver tea-spoon, I think the prisoner is the person I bought it of, I could not swear to her; I gave her two shillings and two-pence for the spoon, it was broken. I produced the spoon to Mrs. Catlin when she came and enquired.</p>

I found the apron in the passage, and pledged it, and when I came home my prosecutrix and I spent the money in liquor; then I found it was this poor woman's apron, I said I was very sorry, if she could lend me fifteen pence I would take it out and work it out; she told me she had not the money to lend me, but I might have the spoon. I had the spoon and sold it to Mrs. Coles, and then the pawnbroker's were shut up, I could not get the apron.</p>

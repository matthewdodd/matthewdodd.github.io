                  </hi>. I am an articled clerk, of 7, Furnival's-inn—on 13th August, about half-past 3, I was standing at the gate of Furnival's-inn—my attention was called to two omnibuses coming towards the City; one was a light green omnibus, and the other a dark green—the dark green was coming first; the deceased was conductor of that omnibus;—that was about ten or twelve yards in advance of the other when I first saw it—the omnibuses were very near Brook-street when I first saw them—that is not far from Furnival's-inn, between that and Gray's-inn-lane—I should think they were coming between eight and nine miles an hour; I think that is much faster than omnibuses usually go—the conductor of the dark green omnibus, I be<lb></lb>lieve, was going towards the pavement on the Furnival's-inn side to get a passenger; he got off the board for that purpose—his omnibus had then stopped—he was going towards the near-side. pavement, when the off-side horse of the light green omnibus knocked him down, and the hind wheel passed over his head, and he was killed instantly—there is no hill there—the light green omnibus went on about thirty yards before it was pulled up, nearly to Leather-lane—the prisoner was the driver of that omnibus—when the deceased jumped off the board, I think the prisoner appeared to go quicker instead of stopping—I did not see him pull up at all, or try to pull up—I was nearly thirty yards behind when he actually stopped—I followed him up—I did not hear anyone call out to him—at the time the wheel went over the deceased's head, the near wheel of the light omnibus was, I should think, two feet from the pavement—I can't say whether there was room for the prisoner to have driven on the other side of the dark omnibus; it was an open space there—I do not know whether there were any other carriages in the road at the time—there is a urinal there, in the centre of the street, about twenty-seven feet from the pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, residing at 1, Montague-place, Kentish-town—on the day in question I got into the dark green omnibus, of which the deceased was conductor, in Southampton-street, Holborn—I had been standing there five or ten minutes; I noticed two omnibuses coming along at a very rapid pace—I had scarcely time to get into the dark green omnibus before it went on; in fact, it did not stop to take me and my friend in, we got in while it was in motion—I noticed an omnibus in the rear, and by the stamping of the conductor on his foot-board, and other movements, I was led to notice that they were racing—when the dark green omnibus came near to Day &amp; Martin's factory, finding, I sup<lb></lb>pose that the proper side of the road, the near side, was blocked, it went round the south side of the cab-rank that is in the centre of the road there—nothing particular occurred till we came near to Furnival's-inn, except the constant urging of the conductor to his coachman to get forward, as the light omnibus was gaining upon him—when opposite the urinal in Holborn the dark green omnibus drew somewhat across the road, in a slanting position towards Furnival's-inn—the conductor had got down from his omnibus and gone in front of it to the side of the horses—as the window was open I heard him request his coachman to pull across the road, as the light green omnibus was advancing somewhat quickly—he said, "Pull across and stop them"—while he was in that position a very loud scream, as I afterwards learnt, from his wife, drew my attention to where the man was standing—he was then with his back to the upper part of Holborn, as if going to some passenger on the kerb, and I saw the light green omnibus advancing very rapidly; the collar of the off-horse caught the man at the back of his head, whirled him round and threw him on his back, and the hind hoof of the off-horse struck him on the side of the face—there was a slight attempt at movement on the part of the poor fellow—the fore wheel then grazed the side of his ear, taking it off, and the hind wheel caught the back, passing over the face, down the centre of the chest, and over part of his right leg—I immediately jumped out of the omnibus and picked him up—an immense volume of blood escaped from his mouth—he died about half a minute afterwards—his wife was a passenger in the omnibus—the light green omnibus went in on the near<lb></lb>side, and I should think from the swaying of the omnibus the wheels must have been close in to the kerb—there was certainly not room to have gone on the other side, between the urinal and the dark green omnibus.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then was the consequence of turning the dark green omnibus. horses' heads towards the pavement, to render it impossible for the other to pass it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I jumped out immediately I saw the accident, and while holding the deceased I called out to some one to run after the omnibus and stop it—I noticed it about twice the length of this Court before me, about thirty or forty yards, before I noticed that it had stopped—he passed on the left-hand side, between the kerb and the dark green omnibus, and went down Holborn-hill—the obstacle he met with was the deceased, no other.</p>

We calculated the quantity for the three shirts to be ten yards and a half; I took down a piece of irish to shew him, he then wished me to measure him ten yards and a half off, and on my moving a little to the right, I saw a piece of irish under Bereman's jacket, he stood behind Mears, which gave me suspicion, I immediately gave Mr. Newbury a signal of suspicion, he immediately went out of doors to watch them, Bereman settled very much confused, and told Mears to have the whole piece measured over, that he would take three at the same time, that was ten yards and a half more; In the mean time that I was measuring over the remnant of irish, Bereman put the piece of irish on the chair; I measured the piece over, it was twenty yards, I agreed to let them have it at twenty shillings each, I thought the price might be too high, I went to get another piece, and on my return, saw Bereman put it under his jacket a second time, they then agreed to take the remnant of twenty yards; immediately Bereman went towards the door, saying to Mears that he was going to fetch the money to pay for it; I stopped him, and searched him, I found nothing upon him; Mr. Newbury came in, and asked what was the matter; I told him that I had seen a piece of irish under his jacket, I suspected that he had got something more; Mr. Newbury sent out for two watchmen, they came in and searched them, they found nothing; the prisoner Bereman agreed for our little boy to go with them to their lodgings, and he should bring us the money; I said it was not proper that a boy should go, that one of us should go; we left Bereman in the shop, and me and the porter went with Mears, he went into a public house, had half a pint of beer, our porter came in with two watchmen, we seized him, and brought him to the watch-house, and on his being searched there, a scarf was found upon him.</p>

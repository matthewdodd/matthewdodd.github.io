At that time the prisoners came up to me, one on each side; the woman was very troublesome, and I thought to send for an officer; they said they would shew me an officer, if I wanted one. After her being with me a short time, I missed my watch, I accused them of robbing me of my watch, they both ran away; I ran after them, crying stop thief. Stanton was stopped and taken to the watchhouse, and after being questioned by the officer, he confessed that he had robbed me of my watch, and told where his companion lived. I saw Goodear the next morning at the Mansion House.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 14th of August the prisoner Stanton was brought into the watchhouse, charged by the prosecutor of having robbed him of his watch; he denied any knowledge of the watch for some time. When I told him I must take him to the Compter, he said, he took the watch out of the gentleman's pocket, that he had given it to Goodear, who had run away with it. He told me Goodear lived with his father in Union-court, Fashion-street, Spitalfields. I went there, and found Goodear; I charged him with the watch; he denied any knowledge of it; I told him I should search the house; then he told me not to make a noise, he would shew me where the watch was. He took me into the privy, there were some boards nailed up to form a cieling, there I found the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence, called two witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

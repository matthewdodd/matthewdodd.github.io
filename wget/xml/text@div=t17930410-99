               <p>I am the watchman at Aldgate. On Friday the 15th of March last, at ten o'clock at night I saw the prisoner at the bar with a bag at his back, the corner of Shoe maker-row towards Aldgate; when I came up to the corner of Jewry-street he crossed over towards the other corner; I turned my head round towards him, and he ran and I ran after him; he had got as far as the public house, the Three Tuns, I came up to him, I asked him what he had got there? He told me he had got some nails; I asked him where he was going with them? he said he was going into the Minories with them, I asked him whose property they where? he said they were his master's; then says I, you must go along with me; says he, you may go along with me, but I will not go along with you; he then told me they were his own, and I told him I did not think that they were his own, he had told me so many stories; says he, I am going to meet a man at the Two Black Mares in Tower-hill, and then he said he was going to the Minories to one Mr. Bowen's, then at the Black Horse; that made me have a strong suspicion; he then began to pull the bundle away and wanted to chuck it from off his shoulder, but I prevented him, and I brought him and the bag together, as he had, to the constable's house; going to the constable he told me that a man employed him in the Strand, and was to give him a shilling to carry them down to the Black Mares till the man came to him; we afterwards took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This man said that he was going to the Minories; did not he? - He did.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; I live at No. 7, Jewry-street, Aldgate. The watchman brought the prisoner and bag to me, Friday March 15th, between the hours of ten and eleven; I was eating my supper; says he, Mr. Pinner I have got this man with this parcel; why, sir, says the prisoner at the bar, it is my own property; then I said, I must see what you have got, so I and the watchman went with him to the watch-house and I found a parcel of nails, brass locks, &amp;c. Says I, now my friend where did you come from? says he, I came from nowhere, I am out of place; says I, how came you with these things; says he, I was employed by a man in the Strand to carry them to the Two Black Mares at Tower-hill, and I was to wait there till the man came to me; says I, do not you live in any place; no, says he, I do not, I am just come out of the country, I have no place, I want a place; says I, I am afraid you are telling me lies; says he, I really do not, I never lived in London in my life, I am in lodgings at the present; I want a place. Then I says to him, my friend, I shall take care of you; he says, for God's sake do not; if you will let me go I will give you a guinea. The answer I made was, if you give me five hundred I shall not let you go; with that I took him to the Compter. (The bag produced and the contents deposed to by Vincent.)</p>
               <p>Vincent. The prisoner was a porter to Mr. Vardon and slept in the house.</p>
               <p>Court to Vincent. Do you sell these articles in these quantities in London? - No, never; I never saw such a quantity sold in London since I have been in the shop, which is three years full, I am convinced they are my master's property by the marks on the papers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Your master is in a considerable line of business? - Yes, very.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a considerable deal of property of the same sort as you now produce in his shop? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. The mark on each of these is the mark of the quality and quantity what is contained in the papers; there is no other mark but this mark? - We never put any other mark.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner you say was a servant to your master, he had been accustomed to deliver things out of your shop as your master might direct him to do? - Certainly the orders he might receive he was used to do like all the other servants at different times of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was ordered to deliver any things this day you cannot recollect? - I am certain he was not ordered to deliver any such goods that day; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your master has a great many servants? - He has five.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - sworn.</p>
               <p>There are several of the articles with my own mark upon them; they were never sold from the house I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You believe? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>Court. Why are you certain? - Because I have examined the books and I never sell such a quantity in London of the nails.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100122"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. Your master has a deal of business I suppose? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your mark is on the nails; I take it for granted you mark a great deal of other property of your master's? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you put the same mark as you put on these nails to other nails? - Of the same denomination I do.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you mean to say then is, that from the mark on the nails you know they were of such a quantity and of such a quality? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is no other mark whereby you can ascertain the property? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say none of this property has been sold; how comes it you can ascertain that? - We have a book on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. How from your own knowledge do you know in the course of that day that none of these had been delivered out? - They are all entered in a book.</p>
               <p>Q Was you in the warehouse all the course of the day? - I believe I was only during dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time there might be some delivered for what you know? - There are none entered on the book, and there is no cash received for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave all to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

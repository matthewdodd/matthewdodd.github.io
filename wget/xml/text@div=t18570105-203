                  </hi>. I live in Leadenhall-street. The prisoner came to my house about some alleged difficulty in the drainage—he said that the pipe was cracked and wanted repairing, and that he should be passing down the sewers, and was employed by the Commissioners of Sewers—I gave him directions to do it, and two hours afterwards he came and said that he had made a good job of it, and I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He brought me into his cellar, where there were a lot of rat holes, and ordered me to get broken bottles to fill the holes up, for which I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., besides the mortar and cement; and when I was ready to do it he would not allow me, as he said it would disturb the wine, therefore he imposed upon me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That was on the next day to this, and at an<lb></lb>other house; I had my suspicions in consequence of the indirect way that he went into the sewer; and then he kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about the mortar and glass, and went away after blackguarding me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William H. Beecham, of the King's Arms public-house, Stepney—on the night of 27th July, a person, who I believe to be the prisoner, came for a glass of gin and peppermint, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling—I gave her the change and put the shilling in the till—there was no other shilling there, only sixpences and fourpenny-pieces—as soon as she was gone, my husband went to the till, took out the shilling, said something, and I put it on a vase on the parlour mantel-piece—on Saturday night, 3d August, the prisoner came; I am quite certain of her—I served her with a glass of gin and peppermint—she gave me a shilling—I gave her the change, and before she had well gone out of the door my husband looked at theshilling, and I said, "That is the young person I think that came last week"—I put it with the other shilling—I went to the door to see if I could see her—there was no other shilling in the till—my husband always takes out the large money on Saturday nights, and only leaves sixpences on account of our taking bad money—on Saturday, 10th August, the prisoner came again—I was watching for her—she asked for a glass of gin and peppermint, and gave me a florin—I passed it over to my husband who was waiting to look at it—he bent it with his teeth in the prisoner's presence, and said, "Do you know this is a bad one?"—I said, "This is not the first one you have given me; "you gave me one last Saturday, and I think the Saturday night before; I have been watching for you the whole evening"—she said she had not been there before—she drank up the gin and peppermint and stood waiting till an officer came—my husband gave her in custody with the shilling and the florin.</p>

               <p>the same person—I am certain she is the person who came the second and third times—my husband is a good judge of money—very few persons ask for a glass of gin and peppermint: people always ask for a half-quartern, and she asked in such a very polite way that I cannot be mistaken in her—we do not often take bad money—I was quite off my guard when she came in the second time—I went out in pursuit of her, but did not see her—my husband said that she was the same person when she came the second time, and that was why he came so quick to look at it—I knew the prisoner directly I saw her—I could pick her out of a thousand people—I described her to the barman in the presence of my husband—the barman is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this public-house, and am the husband of the last witness—on 27th July, I saw my wife serve the prisoner with a glass of gin and peppermint—I was just behind my wife—she put the shilling into the till and gave the prisoner change, and she left—I never let shillings remain in the till—I took it out immediately, and discovered it to be bad—the prisoner had on a bonnet with some flowers and a brown shawl—on the following Saturday, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner came again—she said, "Good evening; nice evening," and asked to be served with a glass of gin and peppermint—I am sure it was a glass—she tendered a shilling, which my wife put into the till and gave her the change—I went to the till, took it out, and said, "That is the young woman again," and my wife went to look after her—I am almost certain she had the same bonnet with the flowers in it—the shilling was bad—I gave it to my wife—on Saturday, 10th August, I saw the same person come in, dressed in the same way—she again asked for a glass of gin and peppermint, and tendered a two-shilling piece to my wife, who gave it to me out of her hand—I did not allow her to put it in the till—I said to the prisoner, "This is a bad one, and this is the third time you have been here"—I sent for a policeman and gave her in charge with the florin—it was about half-past 10 o'clock—my wife gave the shillings to the policeman—she kept them in a vase on the mantel-shelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You recognised her immediately, why did not you stop her? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, Do you suppose I could jump over the bar among a lot of people—I recognised her as she came in—my wife did not give me a description of her the first time, but the second time she told me how she was dressed, and I said, "You have no occasion to tell me, I can tell you the same"—she had a bonnet with flowers—the moment she entered the house the third time I sent for a policeman, but my wife was not aware that I had done so—I accused the prisoner of having been there twice before, and she said that I was wrong in the identity—she drank the gin after I had sent for a constable—the house was very nearly empty when she came with the two-shilling piece—the barman went for a policeman, but he heard the conversation at the side door—the prisoner was very polite—she tendered me the first bad money I have had—I have been in business ten years, but only three months at that house—the prisoner went out very quick the second time, before I could call anybody to stop her—she did stop to drink the gin and peppermint.</p>

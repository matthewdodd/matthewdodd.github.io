Thus she went on some days. I had looked out some things, expecting she would wash them one day or another: she came on the Friday, and the Tuesday after, my apprentice miss'd two shirts: she came the next morning about nine; she put on a boiler; I thought she was going to wash; she went away and left it on the fire, and I saw no more of her till three in the afternoon; then Mrs. Welch, who had recommended her, came and asked for her; I said I should detain her when I saw her, for I had miss'd some things; which were four shirts, two pair of stockings, and a sheet: Mrs. Welch turn'd short, and went away, and return'd in about an hour, with two of the shirts, and said, Here are two of your shirts, and I know where some of the other things are in pawn; in about an hour after, she came and shoved the prisoner into my house, and said to her, There you have robb'd the man; defend yourself. I told her she should not go out till she was conducted out by an officer. I sent for one, and gave him charge of her: she made and excuse to go backwards into my kitchen, and in her return she stole one of the shirts that Mrs. Welch had just brought home: I saw it found upon her the next day, before the bench of justices in Whitechapel; we found a pair of shoe pawned by her with my mark upon them, my property. The pawnbroker is not here: she had pledged a shirt at a chandler's shop for eighteen-pence, which I have got again; the prisoner acknowledged she had taken the things.</p>

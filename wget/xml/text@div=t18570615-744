I know Mr. Fuller, the surgeon; I saw him write this certificate last evening—I have been to inquire about Mrs. Evans, and hear that she was confined the day before yesterday, but did not see her—no member of her family is here—on Saturday night, about 9 o'clock, I saw the little boy Thomas Barnes, who is acquitted, standing outside Mr. James's shop—the prisoner was inside the shop—she came out to the boy, and they proceeded down High Street, and shortly afterwards returned, and she left the boy and went to Mrs. Evans's shop, and purchased a crab—I was close by her—she said to Mrs. Evans, "Here is a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece Ma'am"—Mrs. Evans gave her change, and I went into the shop and received the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece from her, and it was bad—the prisoner had then just left—I saw her join the boy again at the corner of Hare Street—I took her and told her the charge—I saw her putting her hand towards her breast—I took this other 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece from her hand, and told her that she must go to the station; she said, "Very well"—at the station she said that she lived in Plumstead, but she should refuse her address—she gave it afterwards at Sandy Hill, which is in Plumstead, but gave no particular place—this 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to me by Mrs. Evans—I was at the police Court when the prisoner was charged, she had an opportunity of cross-examining</p>

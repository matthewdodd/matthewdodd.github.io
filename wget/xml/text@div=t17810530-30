               <p>On Sunday night, the 6th of May, I was coming from Clapton near Hackney, to town, in a coach, at about nine o'clock. It was moon-light. Coming by <placeName id="t17810530-30-crimeloc135">Bethnal-green</placeName>

He presented a pistol, and asked for my purse. I gave it him. There were a guinea and three or four shillings in it. He then asked for my watch. I did not give it him immediately.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300030"></xptr> He bid me make haste, he must have it. I then gave it him. It was a gold watch in a single case. There was likewise a gold chain, two seals set in gold, and a gold key. They rode off immediately.</p>
               <p>How long were they about this? - About two or three minutes; not longer. The man on the right-hand I could not see: the man on the left's face was so hid, I could see little of him: he had a great coat over his chin, a hat flapped over his face, and a large handkerchief round his neck. I could not distinguish them. I looked out of the coach, and saw two men ride down the lane. My servant brought a man to me, who said he knew these two men I saw ride down the lane. I then told him I had just been robbed.</p>
               <p>What is that man's name? -

            , I think, he calls himself. He was a stranger to me; I never saw him before. I asked him if he would go with me to Justice Sherwood's office: I took him into the coach with me, and we went down to the office; and Justice Sherwood sent two men with that man to watch for these men. In the morning I heard they were both taken.</p>
               <p>Can you describe the person that was on your side, his stature, or his clothes? - He had a very large great-coat on, buttoned over his face; it was rather a dark colour, I think. He appeared to me rather a square man, of large features; I saw very plain that he had a very large nose. I thought he was a little marked with the small-pox.</p>
               <p>You did not make any observations on the other? - No; I could not: I did not see his face. I was alone in the coach; it was my own coach; and I had a servant behind.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found on the men? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Were the coachman and footman both sober? - The footman is a sober man; I cannot say much for the coachman.</p>
               <p>Was he sober that night? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>He is often in liquor? - So often, that I can hardly distinguish when he is and when he is not.</p>
               <p>Could you see how the other man was dressed? - In a light great coat: I only saw his back. When they came to the Justice's, there was a number of people attending for one of the prisoners, to prove he was at a public-house at the time.</p>
               <p>You did not observe any thing about the horses? - Nothing at all. I have had the coachman six months; he is a very good coachman; he drives as we I drunk as sober.</p>
               <p>He has not heard his character? - He knows it very well: that is the character I had with him, though he was recommended as a very good coachman.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday the 6th of this month, I was driving my master home from Clapton to Bethnal-green. I was stopped by two men that were riding on the road: one of them clapped a pistol before the horses heads, and made me stop directly; and after that made me look over the horses heads, not to look back.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations on the person or dress of the man? - He was a moderate-sized man; a pretty fair complexion. It was a very light night: he had a great coat on, and a handkerchief round his neck; but, being in confusion, I did not take notice of his dress. He went from me, and threatened the footman behind, and made him hold down his head. The other went and opened the door, and threatened my master very much, and bid him be quick. They turned round, and went as if they were going to Old Ford, behind the carriage.</p>
               <p>How long were they doing this? - Not above a minute.</p>
               <p>You cannot swear to either of the persons? - Perhaps I can: (pointing to Holliday) that is the man that threatened my life.</p>
               <p>You say, the business was only one minute in performing; will you take upon yourself to swear to the person of a man you saw only for the space of a minute, and never saw before; and under the terror of the robbery? - I mean to speak nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober, or drunk? - I was perfectly sober; I am clear of it.</p>
               <p>Had you been at a public-house at Clapton that afternoon? - There is no one can say they saw me there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300031"></xptr>Had you been at one? - I had not.</p>
               <p>You had had no strong liquors of any kind? - No, I had not; I had nothing but some small beer.</p>
               <p>Did you make any accurate observations upon the man, so as to be able to swear to him so positively? - I am certain he was the man.</p>
               <p>You was in a flurry at the time? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so sober on that day, more than any other day in the year? - I do not know that I was remarkably sober.</p>
               <p>You are apt to be remarkably drunk. - If I had been a drunken servant, I should not have staid so long in my place as I have.</p>
               <p>Your master gives a different account of you; he says, you are a drunken servant. - My master don't know when I am drunk or sober.</p>

             had robbed a gentleman. I then went with the gentleman to Justice Sherwood's, and gave information of the two persons names. I did not see them stop the gentleman's carriage, nor did I see them rob<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300032"></xptr> him. Justice Sherwood's clerk sent two or three of his men to watch for them. I went with them to Whitechapel, where I live; but did not go with them, to take them. When they were taken, Holliday sent for me, and said, he wanted to speak to me; and, when I came up to him, he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>How far might they be from the coachman when you met them? - About twelve yards from the coach.</p>
               <p>Were any other people riding upon the road at that time? - I saw no other.</p>

Mr. Sherwood's people called me out of bed on Sunday night, the 6th of May, and acquainted me they had had an information of a robbery on Bethnal-green; they asked me if I knew such people, mentioning the names of Holliday and Sherburd: I told them I had known them both some years. We went and waited by Holliday's house till half after three in the morning; and then we went to refresh ourselves: we saw nobody go in or out during that time.</p>

               <p>Is Holliday an house-keeper? - I believe he is; the house is in the Willow-walk, I believe they call it, near Bethnal green. We came again about six o'clock, and planted ourselves at each end of the walk, and waited for his coming home. I was reading a news-paper in a neighbouring public-house, and saw him come home, on horseback, about a quarter before eight. As soon as he alighted from his horse, I apprehended him, in his own yard. I left him in custody of Farrell, and searched the house: I found nothing but some powder, in a piece of paper. He asked me to go with him to Sherburd's father. Going along, this young man was coming by. Holliday struck at him, and hit him a blow on his face: he asked him what that was for? he said, For going to Sherburd's father that night. We went to Sherburd's father; he said, he knew where Sherburd was, and sent for him; his sister fetched him. I said, he must go before the justice likewise. I took them to Sherwood's, with the assistance of Farrell; and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Sherburd's witnesses appeared before the justice, to prove where he was that night? - Yes, I believe about three of them.</p>

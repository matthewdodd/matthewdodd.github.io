                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, and have been so ten or eleven years—I drive No. 3,657—on 16th January last I was on the Four Swans stand, Bishopsgate-street—I know Gresham-house—the Four Swans stand is about 100 yards, I should think, from the entrance into Gresham-house from Bishopsgate-street—I was called off the stand about 7 o'clock that evening—the prisoner Moore is the person that called me—he told me to pull round, and I followed him up Camomile-street to St, Mary Axe—I went about twenty or thirty yards up St Mary Axe—that was about 100 or 150 yards, I should think, from where I pulled off the stand—when I got to that part of St. Mary-axe, I saw Edgar standing there, with an iron safe by his legs—it was, I should think, as near as I can guess about eighteen or twenty inches long; it might be a little more or less, I can't say exactly; and about twelve or fifteen inches wide, I should think—I noticed two bars across the top of it, and a handle at each end—it was something similar to this (<hi rend="italic">looking at the drawing produced</hi>)—when I got there, they put the iron safe in the cab and told me to drive to the Marlborough Head, Bishopsgate-street—I did so—Edgar got out of the cab, went into the Marlborough Head, brought out a basket of carpenter's tools, and put them in the cab—he asked Moore whether he would have some beer—he said, Yes, and</p>

               <p>Edgar fetched out a pint of porter—they drank it—they gave me some—I gave Edgar back the pot and he finished it, and I took the pot back again into the Marlborough Head—I saw Mr. Field—he was in the front of the bar, serving customers—after taking back the pot, I got on my cab and Edgar told me to drive to the corner of Montague-street, Bloomsbury-square—I did so, and Edgar pulled me up at the corner—he jumped out, took the tools out and ran down Montague-street with them—I know Montague<lb></lb>mews—he went towards there—he was away, I think, a minute, or a minute and a half at the outside—when he came back, he had no tools at all—he paid me, and assisted in taking the iron safe out of the cab—he said his portmanteau was very heavy—I said, "Indeed it is"—it did seem rather heavy—I think one man would have a difficulty in getting it—they went down Montague-street with the chest, towards the news—Edgar paid me—I drove off and that was all I saw of them—on the Thursday, some days after that, I was at the public-house in Bishopsgate-street—I saw a policeman and a bill which I read over—I made a statement to the policeman and gave a description to him of the two men whom I had driven—I am certain the prisoners are the two men.</p>

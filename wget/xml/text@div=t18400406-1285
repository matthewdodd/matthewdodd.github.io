                  </hi>. I am the wife of john stevens, and live at No. 22, Praed-street, Paddington. I know the prisoner—I received her child into my care nearly nine months before its death—it was a fortnight and a few days old when it came to me—it died on the 31st of March, or Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning, the 1st of April—it was very well on the Friday before its death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had it been poorly before that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not lately—on the Friday before it died, in consequence of a letter I received, I went to the prisoner, who was living at Mrs. Kelly's, No. 49, Hunter-street, Brunswick-square, as wet nurse—I saw the servant first—the prisoner came down stairs to me, and asked me how I was, and how the child was—(the child's name was George Michael)—I said the child was very well—she asked me to walk into the parlour, which I did, and she said she had an old frock for the baby, and a bottle of medicine—she gave me a bottle which was full—this looks like the bottle—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it was tied down with a bit or paper inside the cork, and a piece of white paper outside round the bottle, and sealed with wax—the paper was not fastened on the bottle—the cork was tied round—the paper was wrapped round the bottle—I could not see what was in it till I got home—when she gave it me she said it would do the baby's bowels good—I said the baby was very well, and did not want medicine—she said it had done her mistress's baby good, and it would do her baby good—she said I was to give it one tea-spoon full every night—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060253"></xptr>
               <p>she said if any thing happened to the child I waft to let her knew directly—I do not recollect that she said any thing more—she said I might expect a doctor on Monday next, about five o'clock—I rather think she laid Dr. Reid, but I am not certain of the name—this was on Friday, the 27th of March. The prisoner paid me for taking, care of the child—she gave me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the first five months, I believe, and then I spoke about falling it to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I lowered it to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for one month, and then I fell it to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that waft the rate when the child died—the doc<lb></lb>tor did not call on the Monday—when I got home I took both papers off the bottle—I did not open the cork—the contents looked dark, something of a treacle colour—I never took out the cork—I took off the paper directly, to see if there were any directions—I never gave the child any of the contents of the bottle—I stood it on the mantelpiece directly, where it continued till the Tuesday, not intending to give it to it at all—I keep the house, but other people lodge in it—on the Tuesday afternoon I left the room at half-past four o'clock—there was myself, my daughter, who is eleven years old, the baby, my little William, who is five years old, and Richard, my son, who is three years old, in the room up to that time—those were all the persona in the room—about half-past four o'clock I was called out of the room—the baby was very well indeed then—all the persons I have named were in the room then—I could not say whether the bottle was on the mantel-piece at that time, but it had been there all that day—I had cleared the mantel-piece about eleven o'clock, and it was there then—I did not remove it afterwards, nor any body else to the best of my knowledge—when I saw it at eleven o'clock it was in the same state, as to the contents, as when I received it—I kept it for fear the doctor should come—I thought, in consequence of what she said, a doctor might come, and I meant to ask him how I should give it—when I went out of the room at half-past four o'clock I left the baby sitting on the floor, playing with my chil<lb></lb>dren—it was awake and lively at that time—at six o'clock I went into my parlour—I was in the kitchen, and I heard Richard cry—I thought he had fallen, and went up into the parlour—I found the baby then lying on the sofa asleep—I went and took him up in my arms, and his hands Were clenched—I could not open his fingers—I spoke to him, and endea<lb></lb>voured to rouse him—I said, "George, George"—he looked up, and closed his eyes again, aft if he was going to Sleep—I told my girl to go and fetch a pennyworth of castor oil, and gave the child half of it—he then went fast asleep—I looked at the mantel-piece directly I came in—the bottle was on it, and half the stuff gone—I sent my girl for a doctor, and called up a midwife who had been with me at a labour in the house—the medical man who came first was Mr. Sellick, assistant to Mr. Philpot—they looked at the child, and asked me what I had been giving him—I told them I had given him castor oil, but my little boy said something.</p>

               <p>—MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say where she got it from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said something about round the corner—she stopped about a quarter of an hour—she came again next morning, about ten o'clock—the child had been dead some hours then—I asked her to go into the other room and see it—at first she objected—she never made no notice—she said, "No," but after a little while her cousin, Esther Jones, who lives near me, said, "Go, Kate, and see the child"—she then rose up, and went with me and her cousin into the room—she looked at the child—she said, "It is better off," or something like that—she did not say she was very sorry—MR. Philpot was not sent for that morning—she went out, and said she was going to Mr. Philpot's house—nothing had been said about him—she was absent about a quarter of an hour—MR. Philpot lives about two minutes' walk from me—when she came back, I asked her if she had seen Mr. Philpot—she said, "Yes"—I asked her if it was all right, if she had had the medicine from the doctor—she said, "Yes"—I asked her whether it was doctor Reid—she told me, "Yes"—I did not ask her any thing else—she said nothing else—she stopped from ten till two o'clock that day—I did not see her again till she was brought to our house by a policeman, on the Saturday night—when she gave me the bottle, she told me to give it one teaspoonful of the stuff every night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity of laudanum administered in that state would produce the effect you found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One drop has been known to do it—it is never safe to administer one drop to a child—one drop would not produce the effect I found, but one drop has been known to poison a child—a tea-spoonful would—about sixty drops is an ordinary teaspoonful—that if rather a large dose—this bottle would contain about an ounce—half of it would be about half an ounce—a teaspoonful administered to an infant nine months old, such a baby as I saw, would be certain to destroy life—I gave it some medicine—castor oil would not be likely to do harm nor good unless it acted as an emetic—if it had, it might have done good—mustard and water would have been better—it appeared a hopeless case from my first seeing it—I first saw the prisoner on Wednesday morning—she came to Mr. Philpot when I was there, and said, "My poor little one is dead"—she asked if I was the gentleman who had seen the child—I told her yes—she said she was sorry to lose the child when it had attained that age—she then asked if there was likely to be an inquest—I said in all proba<lb></lb>bility there would be an inquest, and asked her whether she had inquired into the mistake—(I had heard people talking about one medicine having been given for another)—she said yes, she had been to Dr. Reid's, and that Dr. Reid had told her it was his young man's mistake—she said the young man had given it in mistake for another mixture off the counter—I then left her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the bottle precisely in the same stole in which it was handed to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it has rather evaporated—there might have been two or three more drops than there is now—there is now very likely one drop—there was about three times as much as there is now—the Coroner tested it—it has been very trifingly diminished by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able clearly to say that the mixture which is in this bottle has not been adulterated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that for certain—if adultera<lb></lb>ted by water, whatever quantity was given would certainly produce less effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If laudanum has been in a pure state in a bottle, and afterwards mixed with water, would the spirit remain, or would it amalgamate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would if shaken together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Upper Southwicstreet, Paddington. On the evening of the 31st of March I went to Mrs. Ste<lb></lb>vens's house—I found my assistant there, and saw an infant which I ex<lb></lb>amined—it was in a state of complete insensibility in a woman's lap in the room—it could not be roused—the pupils of the eyes were contracted—I</p>

               <p>smelt its breath, but could not detect clearly at that time the odour of lau<lb></lb>danum—the child had had two or three emetics given it before I saw it, but they had not operated—the stomach was insensible to all emetics—I attribute the state the child was in to a strong narcotic—laudanum would produce the effect I saw—every thing was done that could be done for it—I was shown this bottle, and examined it—there was a small quantity of laudanum in it—there was enough to enable me to form a judgment of it—I am convinced it is laudanum—one or two drops would be sufficient to destroy the life of a child in health—a tea spoonful would be quite suffi<lb></lb>cient—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found all the symptoms of poison by laudanum, by opium—I attribute its death to opium, laudanum—I have not the least hesitation in saying the child died by taking laudanum, from the symptoms during life, and the appearances after death—the prisoner came to the house in the course of the evening—I saw her—she said she was the mother of the child—I told her the child was labouring under the effects of laudanum—she asked me if I thought it would recover—I told her I thought it could not even live many hours—I then asked her respecting the medicine, and who had tent it to her—after some hesitation she told me that Mr. Reid, of Bloomsbury-square, had sent it to her—I asked her for what purpose Mr. Reid had sent the medicine, and if she knew the nature of it—she stated that it was some preparation of steel, and was intended to remove some offensive discharges from the bowels—I merely expressed my surprise that a medical man should send out that quantity of laudanum without a label, and shortly after left, leaving her there—about ten or between ten and eleven o'clock next morn<lb></lb>ing, she came to our house, and told me her little boy was dead—I said it was an unfortunate occurrence—she said she had seen Mr. Reid—(she had stated on the over night that as the went home she would call on Mr. Reid to inquire into the mistake)—I asked her how he accounted to her for the mistake—she stated that Mr. Reid regretted the circumstance, and that he said it was a mistake of his young man's; that the laudanum was intended for another patient of his, a lady who was in the habit of taking it, and could not sleep at night—she owned then that it was laudanum—she ex<lb></lb>pressed her regret at losing the child, after having reared it to that age at her own expense'—I asked her if her mistress was aware of the circum<lb></lb>stance, I thought she had better acquaint her mistress with the fact, as in all probability there would be an inquest, and her attendance would be required.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician. I live in Bloomsbury-square—I know the prisoner—she was confined in Queen Charlotte's lying-in hospital last year—I procured her the situation of wet nurse in the family of Mr. Kelly—I never furnished her with any medicine for her child in March—none was furnished by my house to my knowledge—she did not call at my house on Tuesday evening the 31st of March to my knowledge—I did not see her at all—on Wednesday evening the 1st of April, a little after five o'clock, I found her waiting in my room, and asked if she had come with a message from Mrs. Kelly, who is a patient of mine—she said she did not, that she had a favour to ask me—(I had not then heard of the death of the child)—as she hesitated very much I inquired what it was—she then said that her child was dead, that a coroner's inquest would likely be held upon it, and that she wished me particularly to attend the inquest—I in<lb></lb>quired if the child had met with an accident—she said it had—I men<lb></lb>tioned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060259"></xptr>
               <p>that as I was not conversant with the facts of the case, my attend<lb></lb>ance would be of no use, but I would attend if I was summoned—she then hesitated good deal, and stated that it was not at her own request exactly that she wished me to attend, that the child had had laudanum given to it by a child in mistake, and that the medical man who had seen the child said it would be necessary for me to attend—she made use of the expression, "If I am hanged for it, I could not support the child on my wages"—I then asked her the circumstances of the accident—she said she bad sent some laudanum in a bottle to be given to the child, and that it had neither label nor direction upon it—recollecting she had mentioned that a child had given it laudanum, I said to her, "But of course you directed what quantity should be given, or was to be given"—she replied that she had directed a teaspoonful to be given at night—I then told her I was exceed<lb></lb>ingly sorry I had asked her the last question, and still more sorry that she had answered it, that if I was summoned on the coroner's inquest I should be on my oath, and should have to repeat the whole conversation—I advised her to say no more to me on the subject—I felt it my duty to communicate what I had learnt to Mr. Kelly, and she was dismissed from their service—she came to me on the Friday to inform me that she had been dismissed by Mr. Kelly, and to ask me if I had heard any thing about the coroner's inquest, and that, if there was to be none, would I intercede with Mr. Kelly to take her back again—nothing more passed then—on the Saturday even<lb></lb>ing I saw her again—she came to consult me professionally on the state of her milk—I gave her advice, and she then asked me if I had heard of the coroner's inquest—I had found a summons on my table the moment before to attend the inquest—I had just come in—I showed her the summons, and told her so—she asked me if she might call the next morning to in<lb></lb>quire the result—I told her I should be happy to give her any professional advice, but on the other part of the subject I had rather she would inquire up at Paddington.</p>

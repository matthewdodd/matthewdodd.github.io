There was a stoppage of carriages; two brewers' drays were coming towards Westminster - the first passed without running against us, the second caught the wheel of our cart, and pulled us back, turned the horse round and threw us over; it caught the off-wheel - Sapwell was thrown out under the cart, he was hurt and taken to the doctor's. I afterwards saw him in St. Bartholomew's hospital. The dray was stopped by a waterman. There was room enough for both drays to pass; the prisoner rode on the fore horse of the second dray and drove it, it went at a smartish walk. Sapwell died on Monday morning. Our cart did not move till the dray caught the wheel.</p>

            . I was present at this accident. There was a stoppage of carriages - the first dray passed the cart quite clear, there was quite room enough for it to pass; the cart was drawn some distance, and the horse drove nearly round before it was thrown over. There was time enough for it to stop to prevent the mischief. The deceased, the boy, and the people hallood out, but he still went on - the horse went at a very smart walk. There was nothing to prevent his stopping, and if he had stopped when he was called to, the mischief would have been prevented. The man was thrown out of the cart, and fell under it. I ran after the <rs id="t18200628-37-deflabel210" type="occupation">drayman</rs>

The dray was about a yard from the pavement, when it passed - it might have gone a yard from the cart.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholomew Hospital. The deceased was brought in on Thursday, the 15th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon. He died on Monday, was opened and examined - the cause of his death was a fracture between the fifth and sixth vertebrae, which might have happened from this accident.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was tired, and jumped on my fore horse as soon as I got out of the City. I thought there was room enough to pass the cart - I stopped my horses as soon as I could.</p>

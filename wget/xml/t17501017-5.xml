On the 5th of this month, about seven at night, Baird (the prisoner) came into the house; these things were lying on the table near the door; she put her right hand under them, and her left upon them, and carried them away. I called to her, saying, where are you going with them? she said to iron them; I went after her. The other prisoner had a child in her arms. I went to a neighbour's house. Nichols swore that the things were none of mine. I found some small things at the door ; she took them from me.</p>

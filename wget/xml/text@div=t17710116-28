               <p>Q. Was it light enough to know his face?</p>
               <p>Ball. Yes. I told him we had but a few shillings: I gave him a shilling; he held his hat out, and I put it in his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any pistol?</p>
               <p>Ball. I saw none; nor no stick nor whip.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you frightened?</p>
               <p>Ball. I cannot say but I was a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing from the rest of the company?</p>
               <p>Ball. No, he gave me the shilling back into my own hand, and said he would not have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the shilling ever in his hand?</p>
               <p>Ball. He took it out of his hat with his own hand, and put it into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he at the coach door committing this robbery?</p>
               <p>Ball. He was hovering about five or six minutes, he was close to the coach four or five minutes; the man was very much in liquor I believe, or he would never have stay'd so long.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he returned the shilling?</p>
               <p>Ball. He swore; then the coachman got off the box, collared him, and took him off his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him?</p>
               <p>Ball. Yes.</p>

               <p>Ball. Gentlemen, your money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you when he gave you the money back again?</p>
               <p>Ball. He said, he would not have the shilling; he said, he wanted more; I said, I had a few shillings, and tossed one into his hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had he been that night?</p>
               <p>Ball. To Acton, he said, to dinner; he had been at a gentlewoman's there, Mrs. Fisher.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Fisher.</p>
               <p>Ball. I do not know, he went there to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of whip or stick had he?</p>

               <p>Ball. No, we told him to go away, he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160038"></xptr> not; and the coachman got off his box and collared him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect when he first came up, whether he said any thing of asking for your money?</p>
               <p>Ball. He said, gentlemen, I demand your money.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you think he was so much in liquor, he did not know what he did?</p>
               <p>Ball. I do think so.</p>
               <p>Witness. I was driving this coach home from Acton. Last Sunday night the coach was stopped by the prisoner, he rode up to the door and opened it himself; he bid me stop three times; he opened the door on horseback.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Witness. He demanded their money; Mr. Ball gave him a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do?</p>
               <p>Witness. He went backwards and forwards two or three times; I believe he was so intoxicated, that he did not know what he was about; after the coach was open, he asked me to get off the box to open the door after he had opened it, and after he had taken the shilling and returned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was so drunk that he did not know what he did?</p>
               <p>Witness. Yes, I do, if he had not he would not have desired me to get off of the box; I unhorsed him, and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared quite drunk?</p>
               <p>Witness. He did; he had no fire arms, nor stick, nor whip; he said he had been to Acton.</p>

            . I have known him two years. He lived first of all with a brother of mine. He went abroad with him, and staid abroad, I believe, better than a twelvemonth. He came home, very strongly recommended for his care and industry: (in consideration of that I took him into my service) he recommended him to his agent in London, telling him he intended to take him when he returned to England, and if he got a place for him, to give up that place before he returned to England. He commissioned him to let him have money. I took him into my service when I came to England; I think in the month of June last. My brother was at the West Indies. He lived about four months in my service; in which time he was, seemingly, often in liquor, and that was the occasion of my parting with him; otherwise, independent of that, I had no fault to find with him. He had things of great value in his care, but never wronged me. We parted upon good terms in every respect but that.</p>

            . I keep the Indian Queen at Acton. The prisoner came to my house on the 13th of January, about two o'clock, in company with Mrs. Fisher, gardiner; a lady that lives at Acton. He had been to see Mr. Pickering, a servant of Mrs. Fisher's. He being out, he came to my house. He had said that he intended to dine with him. He stayed at my house till near seven o'clock. He dined there, and drank two or three pots of beer, and then had some punch. He was very much intoxicated in liquor. He rid his horse through my passage, about forty feet long; and there is part of the stairs down. He rid quite through there into the tap-room. The stair-case drops down. There is stairs drop down about ten feet high. He rid quite under these stairs, (they drop down) and so up another stairs into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon him to know what he did?</p>
               <p>Frithey. No. I thought him very much in liquor. I could not persuade him scarcely to go home.</p>

G. W. Fletcher.")—the card had on it, "G. W.

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Langdon. On the morning of 10th Jan. I was present when Gollop came into the shop—I heard him say he had got a gentleman from the country, who wanted to purchase a quantity of things, and he gave the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> a card—I believe he said he wanted to purchase a quantity of second hand goods—the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> said it would be better to have new, and gave him a card—that was all I heard at that time; he went away—they were in the counting-house; there might have been more pass—in the afternoon I was absent at the time the prisoners came into the shop—when I returned I saw Kelly there; I think it was somewhere about 3 o'clock—I did not see him bring a card—he brought a few articles that had been selected, and helped me to tie them up—I wanted to clean them, but he said it was not necessary—he represented himself as servant, or something, to Mr. Fletcher, and he would clean them when he got down to Southampton—the things were packed up in parcels; there was no one in the shop at the time the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped at the door—the door was left open, and Kelly conveyed them out of the shop into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—there was no one in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that I saw—there were two or three with the <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up after Kelly had gone out of the shop—he took the things off the board, and took them into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Gollop and Fletcher were in the shop at the same time—they all three came in when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped; I did not notice whether they all assisted in putting things into the <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> a saddle, bridle, horse cloth, and other things were put in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant at the National Provincial Bank of England at Southampton. I know Fletcher—he had an account there in 1847—it was closed in Sept, 1847, and he has had no account there since that time—this check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Fletcher's writing—I believe he used to draw on printed forms when he had an account.</p>

On 12th Jan., the prisoners Kelly and Gollop came to my house—I was at work—I had seen Gollop before—he said to me, "There you are, old fellow, hard at work"—I said, "I do not know about that particularly"—he said to Kelly, "Come along"—they came to my forge, then went into the yard, and said, "Let us see what you have got here at the back"—when they came back, Gollop said, "There is a cart there that I think will suit; what do you want for it?"—I said, "I will take 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "We do not want it for ourselves, we want it for a gentleman; you must ask a little more than that"—they said they had got a gentleman waiting at an hotel close by, and they would fetch him down—they went away, saying they would not be more than an hour—in about an hour they came back with Fletcher, and Kelly said, "I have brought this gentleman down to look at the cart"—Fletcher went and looked at it, then returned, and said, "If it had been a patent axle-tree, I should have liked it better; I merely want it for a market cart"—he asked Kelly what he thought of it;—he said he thought it was a very good cart—Fletcher asked me what I would take for it—I said 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "That is a great deal of money"—I said it was a very good article, and that was about the selling price of it—the sum ultimately agreed upon was 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Fletcher said, "I must draw a check on my banker; you will have no objection to take that"—I said, "I suppose it will be as good as money?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Very well, that will do," and he drew this check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave to me—(<hi rend="italic">this was a check on the National Provincial Bank of England at Southampton for</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable to Mr. Thomas Ford or bearer, and signed, "George Withers Fletcher"</hi>)—he also gave me this card, "G.

Fletcher, engineer"—he said his name was Fletcher, and that he was in a great way of business at Southampton, laying down the electric telegraph, and that he was under another very heavy contract, which would amount to a great deal of money—I said, "I have not got a banker," and he said, "If you take it to the Joint Stock, they will give the money there I have no doubt, for they know me and my family very well; my father is a large ship-owner in Millwall"—I sent the check by my daughter to the London Joint Stock Bank, Princes-street—she brought it back again, and returned it to me—she is not here—the prisoners left my place together, and Kelly came back for the cart, and took it away—I showed him the card and the check, and he said, "That is all right; that is as good as the Bank of England."</p>

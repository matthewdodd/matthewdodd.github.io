             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a copperplate-printer in Round-court, St. Martin's-le-grand: upon Saturday the 1th of August the prisoner applied to me for a copperplate to be engraved; he gave me directions how and in what manner I should get it done; most of the directions were in writing; these are the directions set down in his own hand-writing; he said, he wanted a promissory note plate engraved: he first said, he wanted a 10 l. and then he said, he would have a 20 l. expressed; he said, in a black ground, and white letters; he said, he wanted it in a great hurry; this was on Saturday, and he wanted it on Monday; I told him I would get it done as soon as possible; he wanted it on very fine thin paper; he cut the size in paper; as soon as I got it I carried it to Mr. Terry the engraver, and gave him the directions I had received; I gave him the same paper the prisoner gave me; he called upon me again about it several times.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Mr. Long, where do you live? - In Round-court, St. Martin's-le-grand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What county? - The county of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the liberty of Westminster? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I did not say, don't offend the imitation of bank notes? - I don't remember that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you shew me some of Mr. Sayre's bills, and I said I would not have them like that; I would have it in bold German text: was not you yourself taken up on this affair? - Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>GARNETT TERRY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an engraver in Paternoster-row: Mr. Long came to me to desire me to engrave a plate, he gave me the directions in writing; (the directions and plate were shewn the witness) that is the plate, and those are the directions I received.</p>
               <p>Is that plate engraved for white letters on a black ground? - It will print so.</p>
               <p>You engraved it in Paternoster-row? - Yes, on the 17th of August.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I ever gave you any order? - Never; I never saw you till you was in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If Mr. Long had it executed in any other place, am I answerable for a trespass in the city of London? Mr. Terry had no orders from me; I have been detained four months and never admitted to trial; I have obtained the high favour this day to be tried; I am not guilty now of what is laid to my charge, tho'I have been confined four months; I ordered a black letter in bold German text.</p>
               <p>To TERRY. Was it completed before he was in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses, nor Mr. Long<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177612040040"></xptr> had none, there was none by; you have only his ipse dixit for it.</p>

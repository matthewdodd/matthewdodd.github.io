               <p>Q. Did your lighter lie on the Middlesex side or the Surry side?</p>
               <p>Sherwood On the Middlesex side. Two of the sacks were marked with my name.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. How many sacks were these three quarters in?</p>
               <p>Sherwood . They were in six sacks; they were taken out of my lighter on the Saturday night or Sunday morning, and I heard there were beans landed at Execution-Dock; there was a little cart and horse brought there, and I found this cart and horse belonged to Liggins; I got a search-warrant , and on Monday morning I went and searched his house, and found these standing in six sacks, as they were standing in my lighter on the Friday; I asked him how he came by them, he said he gave 24 s. for the three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they cost?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. They cost 17 s. a quarter, besides charges; we took Mr. Liggins before a Justice, and the Justice admitted him to bail.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he say he bought them?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. He said he bought them between four and five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he sold any of these beans ?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. He said he had sold one sack for nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Hoare say as to the taking them?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. He said he lent a man a boat to go, and he brought the boat to Execution-Dock, then went to Liggins's house, and sold the beans for 24 s. to Liggins.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this usual at three o'clock in the morning?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. I never heard of any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Liggins?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. He is a milkman.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the money distributed?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. Hoare gave 19 s. to Dunn and Fazakerly, and kept 5 s. himself.</p>
               <p>Pris. Liggins's Coun. Where did you find these sacks?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. Five I found in the back room, and one in the fore room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the marks of the sacks on the outside or the inside, or were the sacks turned?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. The marks were on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the sack that was in the shop, was that publick to every one's view?</p>

               <p>Sherwood. He said he gave 24 s. for the three quarters, and that he sold one sack for 9 s. and that my brother might go and take the money for it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Liggins's Coun. Did he know the value of them?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. He sold them for a market price, and that is a sign he knew the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if he had bought these goods, knowing them to be stolen, he would not have shot them out into other sacks?</p>

               <p>Q. What is the price of beans, are not they sometimes at eight or nine shillings a quarter?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. The market price at that time was from 17 to 18 s. a quarter for this sort of beans.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose these beans were for shipping?</p>
               <p>Sherwood . Yes, they were for the West-Indies.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. I think they are to prove where the beans were stolen from, and the Jury are to try the Prisoner for the fact where the offence was committed, and the indictment must be laid where the fact is committed; and as the river of Thames is always supposed to be in two counties, half the river to appertain to one county and half to the other; for this fact may have been committed in the county of Surry .</p>
               <p>Court. You need not give your self any trouble. Suppose the lighter lay in Surry , and he carries them into Middlesex, is not he guilty of the felony, wherever the goods are found?</p>

            . Mr. Hoare lived in my house about twelve months, and I never knew any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago?</p>
               <p>Burkey . About twelve months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Liggins Last saturday was sev'night, in the morning, I believe it was between one and two, somebody knocked at the door; I was in bed, and cried out, who is there? Said a man, here is one. What do you want, said I? He said, he had two or three quarters of beans to sell. I said, if they are worth my while, I will buy them, if they are honestly come by; said I, what sort of beans are they? He said, they were either fit for hogs or horses; (I had some hogs a fatting) Said I, where are they? He said, they were in a house by the water-side. Well, said I, if they are honestly come by, I will buy them. In about three hours time, Hoare and another man came and asked me whether I would have them; I took my horse and cart, and went. They went into a house by Execution-dock , and a man said, I could not have them just then; I stood at the arse of my cart some time, and a watchman came and unlocked a door. I said, bring them along, and I will load them, and I did: and I took them away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Liggins Coun. My Lord, we shall bring one witness to prove, that he fed hogs with these beans.</p>

            . I am a cornchandler, and live in White-Chapel.</p>
               <p>Liggins's Coun. Do you deal largely in these goods?</p>
               <p>Kempton. Yes, as much as most men do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Liggins?</p>
               <p>Kempton. I have known him twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what is the price of this sort of beans?</p>
               <p>Kempton. I have not been in the business for two years; I have known the price of these beans from six shillings and sixpence, to thirty shillings a quarter. I have known the price of these commodities to be raised five shillings in one day.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't talk so loud.</p>
               <p>Kempton . I must talk loud, for I am thick of hearing myself.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150029"></xptr>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Kempton. He is as honest a man as ever lived upon the earth, and that is right and the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this man was to be acquitted, would you employ him again?</p>
               <p>Kempton . Yes, as soon as any man in England.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Coun. Are you a master now?</p>
               <p>Kempton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not Mrs. Wilson's trade?</p>
               <p>Kempton. It may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are a partner.</p>
               <p>Kempton. May be I may, but we are not come here to discover every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the price of this sort of beans is now?</p>
               <p>Kempton. I don't know much of this sort, they are a lesser sort of Kentish beans.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them now?</p>
               <p>Kempton . I don't know justly what the price is now; I would not have given above twelve shillings for them for my own use; people may give what they please.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Coun. They are not in your way of business now?</p>
               <p>Kempton . Not much now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they would not fetch sixteen shillings a quarter at Bear-Key?</p>
               <p>Kempton . Not in my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. What not of your money?</p>
               <p>Kempton . Not of my money indeed.</p>

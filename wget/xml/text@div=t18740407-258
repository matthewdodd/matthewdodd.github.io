                  </hi>: I live at 109, Church Road, Islington—on 20th February, about 11.50 at night, I was going home to my father's house, and saw the prisoner inside the front garden standing at the foot of the house steps. I asked him if that was No. 109, he said that it was No. 1ll, and I turned to go out again—lie followed me—I found that he was wrong, laid hold of him, and asked him what right he had there, he gave me a furious blow in the face with his fist, causing blood to flow from my nose in great quantities. I was staggered but went up to him again about 5 yards from the house, caught hold of him and made two or three attempts to strike him—I succeeded in knocking off his hat, which is now in the hands of the police—the prisoner then drew a heavy instrument from the side pocket of his over coat and gave me a tremendous blow across my forehead, and I was partially stunned: I still kept hold of him and we struggled 10 or 12 yards further—he continued to beat me about my head, and feeling sick and faint from loss of blood, I called to him for mercy, but he still con<lb></lb>tinued</p>

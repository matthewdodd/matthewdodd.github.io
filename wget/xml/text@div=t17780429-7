               <p>Do you remember, whether on the 14th of March Mr. Edmondes was out of town? - He was out of town; the prisoner was the only man servant then in the house; my master had discharged the footman on the 1st of March; there was the prisoner, three maids, and Mrs. Edmondes left in the house; the prisoner asked to go out in the evening to see his wife; he returned with my mistress about ten o'clock; I went up to warm my mistress's bed; when I came down it wanted about ten minutes of one; I fastened the fore area door; I barred and bolted it; it is a half sash door; there are shutters over the sash, and a bar goes across; the prisoner laid in the Butler's pantry, on the same floor; I went to bed and left him up in the kitchen. At about half after three the watchman knocked at the door; the other maid went down, and I went down after her; I was not down till they had untied the prisoner.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; my box is in Queen-street; not ten yards as I imagine from Mr. Edmondes's house. At three o'clock I heard a pistol discharged in Mr. Edmondes's house; I turned back and rattled with my stick against the iron bars of the area where the prisoner lay, and knocked at the door; but there was no answer made; I stood there a few minutes, and then went and cried the hour; when I returned I leaned over the rails, but could hear no noise nor disturbance at all; at half past three, going my rounds, when I had got some few yards from the door; I heard the prisoner cry out; O Lord I shall be dead; I called out what is the matter; why do not you open the door; he said there were rogues, villains in the house; and he should be dead; I said why do not you open the door; he said he could not, that he was tied; I knocked hard at the door; and the maid servant came down with only her under petticoat on, and that untied; I asked her to show me the way into the kitchen where the prisoner lay; I went down and found him tied with a cord round his legs; and a garter tied loosely round his hands, and one end tied to the cord that was round his legs; I untied the cord, but cut the garter.</p>

               <p>Did you observe the pistol? - I cannot say I did; he said three villains had been in the house, and robbed the house; and he was afraid his lady was killed; he said they came in at the area over the rails.</p>

               <p>Repeat as particularly as you remember the description that he gave of the manner they came in; and what they did? - He told me that on the first man's entering his room, he discharged a pistol at him; we searched, but could find no dent of any ball in the wall.</p>

               <p>What other particulars did he give you? - I cannot recollect any other particulars. We went up stairs and searched every room in the house; there were a great many clothes thrown about the dining room; on the terrass wall, on the outside of the house, there was a gold laced waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Was the window of that room open? - Yes, in the inside.</p>

               <p>Did you observe any plate missing at that time? - There was some plate, some trifling things dropped in different places.</p>

               <p>Did the servants make any observation that a quantity of plate had been taken? - No, they did not.</p>

               <p>Were the places where the things were dropped in the inside or outside of the house? - Inside.</p>

               <p>The clothes were dropped on the terrass as if they were dropped as they were going into the park? - Yes.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner. Did I say any thing to you, how the thieves came in? - Yes; you did.</p>

               <p>Court. Were his hands tied in such a way that he could get them out without any trouble? - Very easily; I cut the garter in my hurry.</p>

               <p>I heard the noise of the watchman; and came down about a quarter after three; I followed the watchman down to the Butler's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290009"></xptr> room; and found the prisoner tied in his bed, with both his hands tied to his ancles.</p>

               <p>Did you observe how they were tied, whether tight or loose? - I was so frightened, I did not observe.</p>

               <p>Did he give any account to you and the watchman in what manner the house was broke open? - I do not remember that he said how the house was broke open; but he described three men that he said had broke into the house; he said there were three men came in; that the age of two of them was from thirty to six and thirty; and the other from twenty to four and twenty; that they had great coats on, and flapped hats; that one held a knife to him, and stood over him all the time; while the other two robbed my mistress.</p>

               <p>When you came down stairs, how did you observe the area door? - I did not observe the door; I saw the shutter open; I was not the first that came to the door; the plate which was kept in his room in the closet with two folding doors was gone; the prisoner said he believed they had taken all the plate in general; but I found a spoon on the stairs and some trifling things.</p>

               <p>From what place did he say they had taken it? - From out of the place where it was kept; I looked in the closet, and it was all gone.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner. As I was tied, whether she did not see the marks of the string in my legs and hands? - I believe I did on his legs, but none on his hands.</p>

               <p>To the watchman. Did you observe the mark? - Yes, upon his legs, but none upon his hands.</p>

               <p>Did you make any observation on the area door? - Some time after I was in the room. I was so alarmed with the thieves being in the house, and his hands being tied. I said I would go and see how they came in; he said three men came in; and he fired a pistol at one, and then they tied his hands and legs; and asked where his mistress's jewels were; and where his mistress lay; that then they took the plate out of the closet. I went and looked at the area door, and saw there was a pane of glass broke; and the bar taken down; and the door carelesly put to; it was neither shut nor open; I asked how they came in; he said, I thought at first it was you, when they came to my door; he said, the plate was all carried away; that they insisted on having the key; and he gave it to them out of his coat; that they doubled a silver tea board together, and tied it up in a table cloth, and carried it away. I went up stairs into the dining room; the house-maid found a silver sauce spoon dropped on the stairs, and some wearing apparel of little value strewed on the dining room floor; the shutter was half shut; and the door not latched that goes on the terrass; there was a waistcoat and pair of breeches of my master's on the terrass; I then went to my mistress.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner. Was the window broke on the outside or the inside? - I cannot say how it was broke, but the glass was in the area.</p>

            's house was broke open, it struck me that it must be done by somebody in the house; I went and saw the prisoner sitting by the fire, seemingly in very great pain, for he had two marks as if cut with a knife; I took him to the area with me, and on the outside there was a brick on which they were supposed to have stepped, which was a little broke. I got the cook to put the shutters up the same as they were on the night of the robbery; she did; and I asked if it was bolted or barred; she said both. I asked her if she would swear before a justice it was bolted and barred; she said she would not swear she bolted it, but she would swear that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290010"></xptr> she barred it. The bar was a little broke; it went into a tenter-hook, which must have been wrenched had it been forced open; there was a pane of glass broke, and on the inside a cobweb, which must have been broke had any body got in there, and the tenter-hook was not forced, upon which I was sure it must have been done by somebody in the inside. I examined the door, and found that what force had been used, had been on the inside, and none on the outside; the box that receives the bolt was broke on the inside, but not on the outside. I told my suspicions to the major; and then I told Mrs. Edmondes I was sure it was somebody in the house; she was unwilling to admit any suspicion against the prisoner. I took her and shewed her the place, and asked her if she had given the prisoner leave to go out that night; she said yes, she gave him leave to go and see his wife. I said, is he married? she said yes; I said depend on it then the things are at his wife's. I got a direction from the Major and gave it to Jealous and another person, and they went and searched his wife's lodging, and there they found the things. I then told him there was enough to injure his liberty, and begged he would tell me where the rest of the plate was, that there might be no imputation on any of the servants; he said, if I would not take him to his mistress, he would tell me where the rest of the plate was; he said, he had thrown it into the cistern at his master's house. I went there and found it in the cistern; I was obliged to get a ladder to get at it, it is behind the area door, where he said they got in. I believe it is nine feet and a half from the ground, and a yard and a half deep. I found in the cistern, among some other plate, the large waiter bent double; it is in court.</p>

               <p>Did you make any promises to him to induce him to tell you where the plate was? - No; God forbid that I should.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I beg you will describe how that cobweb is situated by the window? - I examined the glass of the window; the cobweb was so across the glass, that it was impossible to get in without breaking it.</p>

            's. On Sunday about twelve o'clock I received a direction from the Major to go to the lodgings of the prisoner's wife, at a grocer's in Goswell Street; I went according to the direction; they said there had been such a person lodged there, but was gone away, and the people of the house said there was a dustman in the neighbourhood who knew where they had carried the goods to; I desired the dustman might be found; he was, and he took me to Holywell Street, in Clare-market, there we found the prisoner's wife; we searched the room, and found a large trunk with a quantity of plate and clothes in it; I have an inventory of the things; there was a silver tea pot, and two silver cups; I took the woman into custody; the prisoner said when they were before Sir John, that she was his wife, and that those were his lodgings; that he took the lodging himself.</p>

               <p>Did you describe the street and place to him? - Yes, and he said it was his lodging.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gloucester-mews, Marylebone. On the morning of the 4th of August, I was passing the house, No. 23, Cur<lb></lb>sitor-street, Chancery-lane, about a quarter to five o'clock, and saw the prisoner come out of the kitchen window of that house—he got over the area railings, and dashed off at full speed with something in his breast under his coat—I pursued him—he nearly outran me, but I never lost sight of him—I held up my hand and the watchman stopped him—I per<lb></lb>ceived him throw something away as he ran, over a wall near White's-alley—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman of St. Dunstan in the West. I saw Boswell following the prisoner down Fetter-lane—the prisoner turned sound Rolls-buildings—I saw Boswell beckon with his hand—he did not call out—I took the hint, and pursued, thinking something was wrong; and in turning into White's-alley, I saw the prisoner throw something over the wall just as I took hold of him—I held him till a person came up, and then sound this shawl over the wall—I took him back to No. 23, Cursitor-street—the prosecutor came down stairs, and the servant identified the shawl as her property—I found a coal-scuttle, two brass candlesticks, and table-cloth, just put together, in the prosecutor's kitchen, near the win<lb></lb>low, handy to be taken away.</p>

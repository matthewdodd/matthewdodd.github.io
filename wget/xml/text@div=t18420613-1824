In the morning of the 8th of February, the prisoner came to our house and said he was in the employ of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a print-dealer, in partnership with Mrs. Tregear, and have been so since the 27th of last September. On the 8th of February the prisoner came to my shop—I was busy, and he spoke to Mrs. Tregear—she referred him to me—he said, he was travelling for Messrs. Shepherd and Button, in Foster-lane, that he was going on a journey into the country for them, and he thought he could do some good with one prints if we would allow him specimens, to show in the country—I said it was against our rule—he said "I am sure they have not been shown in the country; if you could make it convenient, I think I could introduce them, I am going to Bath"—I said I would see what I could do—I had known him some time, or I should not have trusted him—I directed our young man to look up one of each as samples, about 440 prints in all—I valued them at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the full price is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called in towards evening, and said, "Are these prints ready?"—I said, "They ue not" he came in again about six o'clock, and the folio of prints was ready—he took them up, and said, "I will try and do all I can, and you must do as much as you can for me, and I will push your business in every direction"—he said, "If I do do so, perhaps you will think nothing of these patterns I have got"—I said, "Understand me, these are not to be sold, but returned," and if they were a little soiled, we could varnish them again as we do soiled prints—I then took a memorandum of them, which he calls an invoice, and I wrote "samples" on the paper—it was for the samples he had with him, and the fall price attached and no other—it was to guide him in the full price of the prints—he took the prints and went</p>

               <p>away—the firm of Shepherd and Sutton sent a lad a few days after for dozen or two of characters—in consequence of information I had received I had reasons to doubt whehter the prisoner was living with Shepherd and Sutton—I sent to his lodging, with a message to return the prints immediately—they did not come back—I lost sight of him till Tuesday evening the 24th of May, when I saw him at Mr. Brogden's in the Strand—I said "I did not expect to see you here, is this your shop? he said, "No it is not"—I said, "I have been looking for you some time"—he said, "what for"—I said, "In consequence of those samples you had"—he said, "I will see about it"—I said, "That will not do, these goods must be returned; I have sent many times to your house for them, and could get no satisfactory answer, and these prints which are hanging up are part of the prints I sold you;" they were part of what I had delivered to him these 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. prints were marked up there eightpence—the prisoner denied every thing for some time, till Mr. Brogden stated, that he did not believe a person like me would come and make such a charge-he then said, "These certainly were the prints; the fact is, I hare got the invoice at home; I have sold some of them to Mr. Brogden, and I will arrange with you"—I appointed ten o'clock, on Wednesday morning, for him to come to my house in Cheapside, and bring him invoice with him, and we would go into the business, and see whether he had a right to sell them—he came about ten next day, with Mr. Brogden—I referred to the books in his presence—I have got 379 of the prints here—the book which I referred to is here—it is headed "Samples—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Mr. North to sundry prints as patterns"—there is no price to them—if I had sold them to the prisoner on his own account, I should have given him an invoice, and then there would not have been the full price—I went over the books with him—he said he had a right to do what be pleased with them—I asked him for the invoice, and after some time be took it out, and showed it me—I told him we must go by our books—he threatened me with an action if I gave him into custody—I said, "I shall go by the books"—I conferred with Mrs. Tregear, and said "We have made up our minds to give you into custody"—he said, "For God's sake, Mr. Lewis, don't do anything of the kind, you have known me some time, I will pay you half the price marked down there and in fact I will pay you the full price"—he begged very hard for mercy—some of the prints I saw in the Strand were delivered up to the police<lb></lb>man by Mr. Brogden, and after that I went to Ford's, and found ninety-five prints there—they were our property—I took them in stock when I entered the firm—they were all prints which belonged to Mr. Tregear's estate—I took all the stock remaining.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any arrangement that you are not to be considered as a partner till she has settled her late husband's affairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She administered to a certain sum, and that sum has been paid—she administered to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we estimated the stock at 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she is to retain one-half, and I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> to have the other if. I pay 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of five years, but the other property coming in from September last is a new concern, and new life altogether—these are coloured prints—there are no paintings among them—I have known the prisoner for eight years—I did not know him in business for himself—when I first knew him he was principal man at Mr. M'Cormack's, of the Strand, and I was shopman to Mr. Tregear—I then left him, and after Mr. Tregear's death I thought it would be a good opportunity to go into business, and some friends offered to lend me money to purchase the concern, but Mrs. Tregear would not sell the concern, and I went into business with her—I did not know where the prisoner lived—our young man is his brother-in-law, and the address is at the bottom of the account in the day-book—his-brother-in-law put it down—there was an understood price between the prisoner and me—I was to charge him one-third of the price I put down, and he was to take all expenses, and all risks—he was to sell for ready money, and to remit the money before the good were sent—he was not to sell the patterns by any means—I did not sell them to him—they could not be sold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say, "The prints hanging up are what I sold to you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have said so, but I cannot swear to it—he was not to pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for these things, nor any price at all then—he was to pay one-third—if a print was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the price to him was to be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did that to increase our country trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not charge these prints at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—that I swear—I gave him a memorandum for them, but no invoice—this is the paper I gave him—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is not an invoice—here is my writing on it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Samples. Mr. North, London, February 8th, 1842, Bought of Tregear and Lewis, 96, Cheapside, Roadsters, &amp;c. Agreed price 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—at the time the prisoner was begging for mercy in our shop he wrote this on it—"Proposed addition, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,"and he said, "I will pay another 25 per cent, sooner than be given in charge"—he said he would pay that, and come into our service, and travel, or do any thing if we would allow him to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week off—I sent to his house fifteen or sixteen times—I never went myself—I found him at Brogden's—he said there that he had sold them, and he had a right to do so as he had received an invoice which authorized him to do as he pleased with them, and then the appointment was made for him to go to my house next morning to make a settlement—he came at a quarter or twenty minutes past ten o'clock, and Mr. Brogden came in soon after—the prisoner came for the purpose of settling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you met the prisoner at Mr. Brogden's, did you walk with him to Shoe-lane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He walked with me—I was walking home—I said, You come to-morrow, and we will see what is to be done"—he walked by my side—I went a little way back with him—he begged I would not do any thing—he said he had committed great faults and errors, and this was one—we parted at last nearly opposite St. Bride's church, nearly oppo<lb></lb>site Shoe-lane—we did not part on affectionate terms—I was not harsh</p>

               <p>at all with him, for fear he would not come in the morning—I had been looking for him for five months, and I was rather dubious about this little invoice, I thought we had neglected to put "samples" on it—he threatened me with an action, and I thought I would be as sharp as he was—we certainly did not part affectionately—that I swear—I did not shake hands with him—he held his hand out, but I avoided it I said, "Come in the morning, Mr. North"—he importuned me to for. give him—he confessed it, and I wish he had confessed it now—I did not give him into custody then, because he threatened me with as action for false imprisonment if I gave him in charge, and I thought it was prudent for him to come and see our books—I cannot remem<lb></lb>ber that he threatened me with an action in my shop that morning—I did not ask him in the shop to pay me any money, that I swear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in your own shop, that morning, and in the hearing of Mr. Brogden and Wolf, your shopman, say, that unless he returned what he had on hand, and paid for the remainder, within twenty-four hours, it would be the worse for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not, I said no such thing—I told him, in Mr. Brogden's shop, that if he did not send me back the prints within twenty-four hours, he should be in the Computer—I did not say, if he did not return the prints he had, and pay for the rest—there was a great deal said when we were at Mr. Brogden's—we were there two ✗—I said, if he did not come forward at ten o'clock on Wednesday morning he should be in the Computer within twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, at your shop, after the invoice was shown, ask him to pay you for these prints? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I did not say, "If we take the money from you, how much can you pay down?"—I swear that—I did not ask him if he could pay half down—he said he had not a penny in his possession, but he would pay by instalments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came he to say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he had a wife and family; as he had been a very bad man, he had taken the prints and sold them, and his children were wanting bread; and he said, as a father, I must know it was very hard—he said he had pawned some of them at Kirkman's, in the Strand—he told me that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you this, did you not, after conversing with Mrs. Treges, say, that as he could not pay any thing down, you should give him it custody <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Mr. Brogden was present the whole time—the prisoner did not say, that although he felt confident the charge could not be sustained, yet rather than suffer the disgrace, he would pay the full price, nor any thing of the kind—here is, in his own handwriting, what he had done with the prints—he stated where he pawned them, and where I should see them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you not very much afraid this man will not be convicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> am in the hands of justice, I hope—the name of our policeman is Hampton, I think—I have spoken to him many times—I have promised to give him an accordion after the trial, as he has been very kind, but not if the pri<lb></lb>soner should be convicted—it has nothing to do with the prisoner—I did not know him before he took the prisoner—I told him I would make him a present of an accordion after the trial, as he had been very civil and he played it—I did not promise it him if he came and swore on the trial—I said after the trial, because I had not spoken to Mrs. Tregear about it—I promised it him yesterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not agreed that the partnership was not to commence between you and Mrs. Tregear, till she had settled her husband's</p>

Tregear—the price is charged here—this ledger has been used in Tregear's shop for some years—I think it was used while Mr. Tregear was living—I do not think he ever wrote in it, but I know it was in the shop—when the prisoner had the prints he lived in the last house in Kennington-lane—that address is down in the book—I was in the shop on the morning on which he was given into custody—I heard some part of what was said—I did not hear Mr. Lewis ask him what he could pay down, or how much he could pay—I am rather deaf—Mr. Brog<lb></lb>den was present—I think the prisoner came first, and Mr. Brogden after<lb></lb>wards, in about ten minutes—I have not got an accordion—I do not know any thing about one—I know Kirby—he is a brother-in-law of mine—he is in the newspaper line—I know Hampton, the policeman—he said to me</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and lire in the Strand. On the 13th of May the prisoner came and asked me if I would purchase some prints—they were at another pawnbroker's in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—I gave him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he brought me the prints—the number on the ticket was 338—I did not count them—on a subsequent occasion I bought four more tickets of him—after buying the first lot, the prisoner came and asked if I had sold them—I said "No"—he said what did I want for them, and I sold them back to him for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after that I had an application from Mr. Lewis, but I had no prints then but nine, which person had to look at, who came in the day after, and I delivered them to Hampton—these are them—they were redeemed with one of the tickets which I received the second time from the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a print-seller, in the Strand About a fortnight before the 28th of May, I remember the prisoner com<lb></lb>ing to my shop, (I had known him some time before)—he asked me to purchase a quantity of prints, which I did—I got them from Mr. Wassell's shop—I remember Mr. Lewis coming to my place, and having an interview with the prisoner there—I afterwards went to Mr. Lewis's, and saw the prisoner there, and he was given into custody—I afterwards delivered to the policeman some of the prints I bad purchased of the prisoner—I had sold some of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you at Mr. Lewis's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Per<lb></lb>haps half an hour—I did not go there to settle the business, but I had em<lb></lb>ployed the prisoner, and was about to employ him again—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what passed in my shop I said I would not employ him till the point was settled, and it was to clear up that that I went to Mr. Lewis's—Mr. Lewis produced some books, and I believe this invoice was also produced—something was said about the price of the prints—Mr. North proposed to pay for them at so much a week, or at certain intervals—I do not remember what the price of them was—I think there was something said about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. North offered to pay more than the price charged—Mr. Lewis said he did not want that, business was business—I did not hear the whole of the conversation—I agreed to meet them at ten o'clock but I did not arrive till nearly half an hour after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q. Do</hi> you remember Mr. Lewis asking this question of the prisoner, what money he was prepared to pay down then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have an indistinct recollection of something of the kind being said, but I could not swear to it—I remember the prisoner saying he had not a penny at that time, and that the only way in which he could pay would be by instalments—he repeatedly proposed to pay by instalments—I do not remember Mr. Lewis saying, "As you can't pay any money down I shall give you into custody"—I do not remember his saying, "Then, Wolf, go and fetch a police<lb></lb>man"</p>

               <p>but be sent for "a policeman—the bulk of the conversation took place in my shop—some of the prints were hanging up there—I do not remember Mr. Lewis saying, "Some of these are the prints I sold you, Mr. North"—Mr. North acknowledged that he had done wrong in selling them, but he was willing to pay him so much a week, or how he could—Mr. Lewis said that was not what he wanted, but I understood he wanted his prints—I rather think he said he must pay him for them at once—I remember something being said about the re-delivery of the prints, and Mr. North said it was impossible, as he had sold them—there was some dispute as to the amount the prisoner ought to pay—I think the prisoner began to pay the instalments on the next Saturday—I have known him from about February last—he had obtained orders for me, and paid the money—he had discharged his duties in such a manner that I was about to employ him again but for this—the bulk of what I had were caricatures, some litho<lb></lb>graphs, and some engravings—I did not take much notice of them—I bought the last lot of him because he had not money to get a dinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These are not paintings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should never call these pic<lb></lb>tures—if a person asked me for pictures I should never show them a print—if a countryman came in I might show him a print with the great-Best quantity of red and blue in it; if a person asked me if I was a picture-dealer, I should say not—a picture is something painted, the result of the genius of the artist; a print is from a plate; there is mind about the one, and not the other; there can be no picture without painting, as I understand—I have been in business in London but a few months; I was in business in Lincoln for five years.

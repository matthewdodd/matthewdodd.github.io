            . I am constable. About a half-past eleven o'clock at night I met the waggon near Brentford Bridge; the prosecutor came and told me he had been robbed, and a young man told me he had seen the prisoner running away from the waggon; I enquired and found the prosecutor had been drinking with him - he was a little the worse for liquor; I went to Old Brentford and found the prisoner in bed - I saw the woman whom he lives with at the door; I went up to the prisoner, and asked for the bag which he took from a pensioner; he said, "What bag" - I said, "If you don't produce it I shall take you out of the house;" I pressed him and he fetched it and gave it me - he was quite sober; I have known him a long time.</p>

            . I am a gardener; about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock that night, I went into the Castle public-house, to have a pint of beer - I saw the prisoner, the prosecutor, and some others in the tap-room - they made some movement - the prisoner took the bundle, and ran out; the other man went to the prosecutor, and said, "Come, you must go, you can't lodge here tonight." They all rushed out, and the prisoner went quite in a contrary way to the waggon - I told the constable, and went with him to the prisoners.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

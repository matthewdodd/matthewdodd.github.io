             sworn. - I am in the East-India Company's service: On the 17th of May, 1809, I was present at a ball-room at Tottenham-court-road; it was between twelve and one when I went there; soon after I entered the room, Mr. Hobart came to me in the room, and informed me he had been very grossly insulted by Mr. O'Reilly; I had some conversation with him, he informed me of the substance of what Mr. O'Reilly had said to him; Mr. O'Reilly had used such language to him that no gentleman could put up with; I had some conversation with the friends of Mr. O'Reilly upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar observe to you what was the cause of this quarrel? - A. I understood it was something that amounted to a challenge, I endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation of parties.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom and to whom did you understand the challenge to pass? - A. I understood the challenge to have passed from Mr. O'Reilly to Mr. Hobart; I soon after that left the room; I had seen both the parties before; I had known Mr. Hobart some years; I always understood he was studying law at the Temple.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, Mr. Dixon, you have known Mr. Hobart some time? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. He has always conducted himself extremely well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that Mr. Hobart wished there should have been a settlement of the business? - A. I have reason to believe both from Mr. Hobart's conduct and from what I know of him, that he could not have acted otherways.</p>
               <p>Q. That he would have done every thing he could to avoid so serious a quarrel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160034"></xptr>Court. Q. Do not go by conjecture, was not there something done on his part at the ball-room? - A. I believe there was, but the offence of Mr. O'Reilly was of such a gross nature, that he could not put up with it, it could not be compromised.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Dixon, from what you know yourself, or from what you heard Mr. Hobart say; are you clear who it was that gave the challenge? - A. I always understood that it came from Mr. O'Reilly, from what passed before I came into the room; I learned it from Mr. O'Reilly's friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was it in Mr. O'Reilly's presence? - A. It must be in the presence of Mr. O'Reilly's friends.</p>
               <p>Court. Unless you state facts, and was present when the challenge was given, I cannot hear that.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DIXON sworn. - I live in Camden Town: On the 18th of May last, I saw some hackney-coaches go up the lane to Chalk Farm, about six in the evening; when I came within half a mile of <placeName id="t18040516-46-crimeloc263">Chalk Farm</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you follow this unhappy man to the farm? - A. I did, and I saw him after the ball was extracted up stairs, he looked in a dying state as I thought.</p>
               <p>JOHN RUTHERFORD sworn. - On the 18th of May I saw two gentlemen take a position, and then fire, they were about fifteen or sixteen paces distant; they stood in a field the north side of Chalk Farm; I did not see nor hear the signal given, I heard them fire, I was about thirty yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them fire? - A. No, I heard them fire it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pistols did you hear fire? - A. I only heard one; I am not confident, it might be two; I only heard one report; I saw one of the gentlemen put his hand to his hip, and run towards Chalk Farm, his friend ran after him to assist him; I observed the other man run away, I believe there were two or three with him; he ran towards Haverstock-hill as if he was going to Hampstead; I saw the whole of the transaction, my father keeps the house called Chalk Farm, I saw him after the ball was extracted, he appeared in a dying state; he died on Thursday, the day after, about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that the prisoner was one of the two that stood opposite to each other? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MONTAGUE sworn. - I am a surgeon, I was dining at Chalk Farm on the 18th of May, when this accident happened; I was called from my dinner to attend him, about five or six in the evening; I had known Mr. O'Reilly some years before in the East Indies; they were bringing him to the farm, I saw the wound, I had him carried into the house, and extracted the ball.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find him? - A. I found a little wound upon the right hip, I discovered the hall upon the opposite side, and extracted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it nearly perforated the other side so that you made no deeper incision for it? - A. It had.</p>
               <p>Q. From the direction you have described, it must have passed through the lower extremities? - A. From circumstances afterwards it certainly must, at first I did not suspect it had; I saw him on the morning the next day, I dressed him, I saw him sinking, I had little hopes then; I left him about ten o'clock, I did not go to him again, they brought me word that he died about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you of opinion that the shot you extracted was a pistol ball? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that that was the cause of his death? - A. I am clearly so.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surgeon and apothecary, I was at Chalk Farm, I was in the field about two or three hundred yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not notice the persons that were engaged? - A. Not till I took hold of the deceased; I assisted in taking him to Chalk Farm, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160035"></xptr>dressed his wound, I have no doubt it was the cause of his death; I saw him on the morning prior to his decease, he told me his antagonist had offered to compromise matters with him, but he had refused; he did not say his name.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Dixon.) How long have you known him? - A. Five years before I went to the East Indies, we lodged in a house together for about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. After that time you went to India, how long did you stay in India? - A. Till last year, January, 1803, since then I have met him once or twice a month at dinner, and within these last two months he has called on me, and I have called on him at his lodgings; I have seen him walking about the town, he lodged in South Moulton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that you have at times used some endeavour to persuade him to come forward? - A. I cannot exactly say how to answer that question, I do not know the law; when he was before Sir

               <p>Q. In consequence of your advice, he appeared before Sir Richard Ford? - A. He did, but not entirely in consequence of my advice.</p>

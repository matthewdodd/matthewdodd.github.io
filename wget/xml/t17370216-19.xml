The Night this Murder was committed, I was upon the Watch with him, and as I was giving the Hour of Twelve, I heard some body coming along, so I turn'd my self about, and cry'd, - who comes there? The Prisoner, - (I am almost sure, is the same Person) he had a Cask upon his Back, and a Woman was with him. I asked him, what he had got there? Damn thee (says he) what's that to thee? He pass'd over to the other Side of the Way, and I call'd out to the Deceased; he asked me what was the Matter; no Harm, says I, in the Name of God. When he came up to me, no Words in Anger pass'd, for I told the Prisoner, tho' he damn'd me, I would not damn him: But when the Deceased came to my Assistance, the Woman fell back from the Prisoner, and I went after her about 6 or 7 Paces; while I was pursuing her, my Partner cry'd out, - O Lord, Watch! Watch! the Rogue has stabb'd me! I caught hold of the Woman, and told her I would secure her till we found the Prisoner; and as I was carrying her to the Watch-house, I heard some body tripping after me, and turning round to see who follow'd me, the Prisoner stabb'd me in the Arm - I wish I was as sure of the Kingdom of Heaven, as I am that the Prisoner is the Man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any Blow given by the Deceased?</p>
               <p>Sturgeon. No; the Deceased was not a quarrelsome Man; I never heard any Harm of him in my Life; I look'd upon him to be a careful good Watchman.</p>

Next Morning, about Eight, I went into their Room, and asked them what Time they came home; they told me, between 3 and 4. I look'd upon him, and saw a Cut cross his Nose: I asked him how it came; he said, he was set upon by two Watchmen, and they were so resticall, that he was obliged to draw his Bayonet, and play away with it.</p>

Well, - that is not all that I do know, he did say and make Answer, that this Woman did know nothing of him, and he was not afraid. Well, - this Woman she did go to Newgate, and she did say to him, with a Proviso he would produce Money, she would do for him; and he did say and make Answer, his Substance was gone, and a Bed to lye upon in Newgate, would signify nothing to him.

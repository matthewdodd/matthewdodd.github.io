                  </hi>. I live with my father-in-law, Mr. Gunn, who is a tobacconist in Old Compton-street. On Tuesday, 7th Nov., the prisoner came to the shop about 8 o'clock in the morning—he asked for a pennyworth of tobacco—I served him; he gave me a sixpence; I gave him change, and he went away—I put the sixpence in the till, where there was no other silver—in about an hour I went to the till, and found the sixpence that I had placed there, and no other silver—I examined the sixpence, and found it was bad—I showed it to my father-in-law, and he put it on a shelf apart from other coin—the same evening the prisoner came again and asked for a pennyworth of tobacco—I served him—he gave for sixpence</p>

I am father-in-law of the last witness—I was in the parlour on the morning of 7th Nov.—I saw the prisoner through the window; I am sure he was the person—I did not serve him—about an hour afterwards, the last witness showed me a sixpence—I found it was bad, and I put it on the shelf; it remained there, apart from other coins, till I gave it to the officer—I was at home that same evening, and the prisoner came again; my daughter went to serve him—I felt so confident that it was him, that I put my hat on ready to go out—the prisoner offered a sixpence; I took it, and found it was bad—I passed the prisoner in the shop, and shut the door after me—I wanted to get a policeman—I held the door, and the prisoner forced it open, and pushed past me, and got away—I cried, "Stop thief!" and he was stopped by a policeman—he had run out of the passage that my door goes into—the officer brought him back—I gave the officer the two sixpences.</p>

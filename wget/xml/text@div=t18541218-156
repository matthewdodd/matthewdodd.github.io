                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Teed, a grocer, in Bishopsgate. On 9th Dec. I was in the shop—about half past 10 o'clock at night, the prisoner came in, and I served him with half an ounce of tea and a quarter of a pound of sugar—he gave me a shilling to pay for it—it was bad—I went from behind the counter, and called in the warehouseman to take care of the shop while I went out for an officer, leaving the prisoner in the shop—I found an officer about half a dozen doors off—I overtook the prisoner, and gave him in charge—he did not go quietly to the station—there was a scuffle, and I saw a bad sixpence drop from his hand—I am quite sure I saw it drop—I took it up, and when we got to the station I marked it and gave it to the officer on the Monday, at the Mansion House—I gave him the shilling I had received from the prisoner.</p>

I was on duty on 9th Dec. in Bishopsgate-street—the last witness called me, and pointed out the prisoner as having passed a bad shilling—I took hold of the prisoner's right arm, and when I got him out of the shop he asked me if I understood a Lancashire kick—a scuffle ensued, he gave me a kick, and a sixpence dropped on the pavement—just after I recovered from the kick two men came up, and said, "What is <hi rend="italic">up?</hi> What is your <hi rend="italic">game?"</hi> and nearly knocked me backwards—I saw the prisoner pass between those two men, and the man on the left side took something from him—the men went away, and I got the prisoner to the station—this is the shilling and sixpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a picture-frame dealer carrying on business in Essex-street—the prisoner Stanley Selway had been in my service as errand-boy for three weeks, and was under notice to quit the following Saturday—on Tuesday, 19th April, about half-past 9 o'clock, Mrs. Dear had gone out—I have been paralyzed for three years, and cannot move without assistance—my servant had placed me in the shop near the counter—Stanley was in the shop gazing out of the window, and to occupy him I gave him some bank board to cut—he would not do it the way I wanted, and I told him that if he did not, he would cut his fingers, or break the boards—at that time I heard a whistle, and Stanley turned round to the window and laughed—it was a sort of signal which boys give to each other—Stanley broke the board in half—I told him to get the portfolio—I then told him to go in and poke the fire, as I must go and lie down—he came back and said that there was a good fire—while I was looking over the engravings, I saw William Selway who I knew by sight, pass the window; and immediately after that I heard another whistle, and Stanley turned round to the window and laughed as usual—I had to call his attention to the prints, as he was putting them in cross ways—he then intimated that he was going over to the urinal—he went out and stayed about seven minutes—about ten minutes after he went out I heard a third whistle—I remained in the shop till he came back—I the servant Ann Tanner came to see about the fire, and I directed her to take me into the parlour and lay me down—she gave me my medicine and left me sitting on the end of the sofa—I did not lie down—while I was sitting on the sofa I beard somebody coming into the shop, but could not</p>

               <p>see them; and to my surprise, the two boys, Stanley and Wynne, stood at the end of the sofa, without any invitation to come in—I was rather taken back at the sight of Wynne, bat made no remark—I did not wish to wound his feelings, but did not like his appearance—he was pale and cada<lb></lb>verous, and not respectably attired—Stanley said, "Here is a boy come after the place."—I asked Wynne what he had been doing—he said that he had been in the book trade—I told him that that would be no benefit to me if he did not understand engravings, and asked him how long he had left his situation—I directed Stanley to go from me twice, as I did not wish him to hear our conversation—Wynne made one step towards me as if to listen to what I was saying, and at that moment Stanley passed behind him, forced open the cupboard, took the cash-box, and turned round—at that moment I stooped forward and saw Wynne's hand with something black in it—I cannot say whether it was this (<hi rend="italic">a short crowbar</hi>); and I received a blow on the head, and cried, "Murder!"—a second blow was given, but his hand and wrist only struck me, and I heard something fall out of the back of his hand—I shouted "Murder!" again, and he put his hand across my mouth—the servant girl opened the door, and I found my<lb></lb>self about six yards from the sofa, lying on the floor of the shop—this is the cash-box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw the money in it counted afterwards, and there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was nearly 12 o'clock when the blow was struck.</p>

On the morning of 15th April I gave him his medicine, assisted him on to the sofa, and left the room—Stanley was at that time in the shop—some little time afterwards I heard my master cry, "Murder!"—I immediately ran down, opened the parlour door, and saw Wynne with his hand over my master's mouth, trying to stop him from calling "Murder!"—I ran into the street, and called "Police!"—I did not see what became of Wynne—(I saw nothing of Stanley when I came down)—I afterwards found my master lying on the shop floor, bleeding from his head—shortly after that, both the Selways were brought back to the shop—I found this crowbar behind the chair where my master was sitting.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 205, Fleet-street—I saw the prosecutor about twelve o'clock in the day—he had a jagged wound on the head, with a good deal of swelling round it—he had blood all over his face and head—he was supported in a chair by several people, and carried into the parlour where I dressed his wound—it was a serious wound; such as might be inflicted By this instrument—there were also bruises from the hand on his face and nose—supposing the chisel to have slipped from the hand, and the hand to have caused the bruises, it must have been a very severe blow indeed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, of Wych-street—I saw Stanley running, and Skidmore pursuing him—I went to see what was the matter, and after he was secured, I saw Samuel attempting to take something from under Stanley's coat—I seized him by the collar, and threw him out of the way—he recovered himself, came up to me in a sparring position, and said, "I will punch your b—y nose; what have you to do with it?"—I said, "If there is a policeman handy, you will find what I have to do with it; what have you to do with it?" he said, "My brother" or something to that effect, and then I let him go—I followed the crowd to the prosecutor's house—there was a great number of people in the lobby or entrance to the shop; it was full of boys—I said, "Get away, boys; you have no business here"—Samuel was then forcing his way through the crowd—I seized him by the collar, and said, "Here, if you are his brother, you know something about it"—I tapped at the door, they opened it, and I shoved him in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> From his excited manner, did you think he knew something about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; my opinion from his outward appearance was that he knew of what had been going on—he appeared to be attempting to take what had been stolen: not getting to his brother, but stooping with his hands ready to grasp—there were perhaps 100 people round him—he was going back, and his brother was going forward—my motive for judging that he had an ill motive in getting what had been stolen, is created by hearing that a boy had gone into the shop to ask for a situation, that another boy who was in the service of the prosecutor had stolen the cash<lb></lb>box, and he was his brother—I did not know that up to that moment that he was in Mr. Berni's service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Anthony Berni, a hatter, of 203, Strand—I was there a fortnight, and during that time Samuel Selway was under my direction—I had to show him his work in every point—he has been an honest, steady, industrious lad, and well conducted—I have only known him a fortnight; for though I have been in Mr. Berni's establishment 12 years, it has been at another establishment, in Pall Mall.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I saw the prisoner coming from Richard Buckill's farm with a sack on his shoulder—he entered the gate of another farm of the prosecutor's—before I overtook him he threw the sack down—I took him, and brought him to the prosecutor—I asked the prisoner what was in the sack—he said he was going to London, and that it was bait for the horses—I found it contained oats—the prosecutor said he was satisfied it was stolen from the farm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am labourer to Messrs. Tilyer—I take care of their corn—on the Saturday before this Sunday the prisoner was employed to remove some oats from one barn to another—we moved 110 sacks from Mr. James Tilyer's farm to Mr. Richard Tilyer's—76 from one place, and 34 from the other—at half-past three on the Saturday I locked the barn in which I had put 110 sacks—they were all right—I went again at six o'clock on Monday morning—I then discovered that there was a sack gone—there was a hole in the barn big enough to let a man through—I had fastened the door with a string inside, and the string was cut—I have looked at these oats and com<lb></lb>pared them with a sample which I have in my pocket<lb></lb>they are similar oats, and are my masters'.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a button manufacturer, of 26, Ely Place, Holborn—Hopper entered my employ in December last—it was his duty, amongst other things, to take care of my cheque-book—he remained in my employment until two days before he was apprehended—on 14th June he came to the office, late, and I spoke to him about being absent previously and late then—he said that he was going to the Inland Revenue Office, and would soon be back—he never returned—I went to the Bank the same day I think, and in consequence of what the manager said I came back and looked at my cheque-book, and missed from it this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was nothing on the counterfoil—Hopper sometimes filled up the bodies of cheques for me—I also found one or two other counterfoils which had nothing on them—to the best of my belief the body of the cheque is in Hopper's writing, especially the endorsement "Collins"—I saw Farrow once in my inner office, somewhere about the Derby day—I did not speak to him—Hopper said Farrow was a friend of his. (<hi rend="italic">The cheque was on the National Provident Bank of England, St. Marylebone Branch, dated</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">payable to Mr. Collins, for</hi> 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d, signed "Bective," endorsed E.

Shoolbred's—he said, "That is quite right, I did; but am I to be answerable for that if I got them in a betting transaction?"—I said, "I don't know anything about that; you will be able to make your defence"—I spoke of the note endorsed Smith, of Epsom, and he said it was quite right—I had apprehended Hopper on 17th June at 59, Rockingham Street, Southwark—I told him that I was an officer, and that I was going to take him in custody for stealing a bill of exchange belonging to Mr. Mendelstam—he said, "I have stolen no bill; I had a bill, but I left it on the desk"—I brought him to the station, and told him he would be further charged with stealing a blank cheque from Mr. Mendelstam's cheque-book, which had since been forged and uttered in the name of Bective for a large amount of money—he said, "I stole no cheque; Mr. Mendelstam sometimes took out blank cheques; they are getting it up for me," or "mixing it up," I am not certain which.</p>

            . I am an officer of Whitechapel. I produce the certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I obtained from Mr. Shelton's office. I apprehended the prisoner at the Duke's Head, at Walthamstow, Essex, on Sunday, the 27th of July, I knew him before; I found some tools in his pocket, and believe he has worked at the shoe-making business since he returned.</p>

            . I am turnkey of Newgate, and was so in the fifty-fourth year of the present reign. I was present here in the April Sessions that year when the prisoner was convicted; I delivered him myself on board the Retribution hulk, at Sheerness. He is the same person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I have delivered a great many men. I know the prisoner very well.</p>
               <p>(The certificate of the prisoner's conviction was then put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my case to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner produced two witnesses, who gave him a good character; and stated him to have been industriously employed since he returned.</p>

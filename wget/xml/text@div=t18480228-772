                  </hi> I am a window, and live in Eastcheap. On Monday, 7th Feb., I saw a watch, a ring, a seal, a key, and a locket, safe in my drawer, at half-past three o'clock—the prisoner came to me that day, and was in my house till eleven at night—he was servant to me about nine years ago—I left the room to go up stairs while he was there—I missed the watch about six—there was no one there but the prisoner, that I am aware of—I sent him out on several errands from four till six—I asked him about these things when I missed them—he said he knew nothing of any of the property, but he would endeavour to get information—he came to me on the Saturday, and told me had traced the watch to a pawnbroker in Holborn—I accompanied him there, and I identified the watch—the pawnbroker said he had taken it in of a woman whom he knew nothing of, but he afterwards said he knew her—I redeemed it on the following Wednesday, for a sovereign—he had lent 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—the policeman took me to a pawnbroker in Clare-market, last week—I identified a locket, which was mine.</p>

I am a warehouseman—on 24th August, about 12 o'clock at night, I met the prisoners; they asked me to treat them with a little beer, and I did so, at Mr. Short's—I don't know the sign of the house—after being there some little time I left, and the prisoners came out immediately—I had to cross the road; they came after me—after I had gone a little way Jenkins wanted me to go with her—I said I would not, and</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, 98 G</hi>). On Friday night, 24th August, I was on duty in Middle-row—I saw the two prisoners running away, about fifty yards from where I afterwards found the prosecutor lying insensible on the ground—I asked him what was the matter—he complained of being robbed and assaulted—I asked him by whom, and from what, he said I took the prisoners in custody and took them to the station—I assisted in taking the prosecutor to the station—I brought in the prisoners, and he at onoe identified Roberts, but being in such agony he had a doubt about Jenkins and they were both let go—the next day I received information and took the prisoners to the station—the prosecutor was sent for, and he at once identified the two prisoners—I likewise apprehended a man whom I saw running with the prisoners, but the prosecutor could not identify him and he was let go.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 40, William-street, New-road, Mile-end—I am seventeen years of age—I am employed on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi>, which was lying in the Eastern Dock, London Dock, on 29th May last—the prisoner was employed on board as a labourer—about 1 o'clock that day I got down from the ship, and got into a boat that was there to put people to and fro from the ship to the dock—the boatman had gone to dinner, and had left the boat in charge of a caulker's lad—George Witherington got into the boat with me, and another man followed—as he was coming down the labourers looked over the side of the ship, and said, "You can't have that boat," and called the attention of the foreman—one of us said, "Why can't we have the boat?"—the foreman said, "Because you can't"—somebody said, "You are a nice lot of Christians, not to let people go to dinner; how long will you be?"—they said, "A quarter of an hour, and you must stay there"—we said, "We must go ashore"—the foreman said, "You can't have the boat; I dare you to do it; somebody go down and stop the boat"—the prisoner slid down a rope at the side of the ship, and just as we were pushing off, he got one of his feet under the head of the boat, and pulled it back again—he got into the boat, still holding the rope, and said to me, "I will throw you overboard if you push this boat off—after some</p>

               <p>words passing I saw Leonard Francoti looking over stern of a collier brig close by, and said to him, "Leonard, these fellows will not let us have the boat to go to dinner"—with that the prisoner said, "Who are you calling fellows?" I said, "You and your companions," and he caught hold of me by the chest, and pitched me head first into the water—I was strug<lb></lb>gling about for several seconds, and when I came out of the water I was quite exhausted, and felt very ill indeed afterwards—I can't say what the depth of the water is there; I sank—I had on a blue serge, a loose pair of trousers, and a large monkey jacket, which pulled me down in the water—I can't say whether the prisoner attempted to get me out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer living at Plaistow-Marsh—on 29th May, about 1 o'clock, I was on board the Persian—I got into the boat after Cates to come ashore—the foreman of the labourers sung out, "Don't let that boat go ashore; we want it; jump down there one of you, and don't let the boat go off—the prisoner took hold of a rope, and jumped down, and held the boat on—a man on board a brig asked what was the matter, and Cates said, "These fellows won't let us take the boat to go ashore"—the prisoner said, "Who do you call fellows?"—he said, "You and your com<lb></lb>panions"—with that the prisoner took him by the collar of his coat, and chucked him into the water—he pushed him back, and he fell over the side of the boat—I had heard the prisoner say something about chucking him overboard if he did not hold his tongue, but what it was I don't know—the water there is between twenty and thirty feet deep, it will float a ship that draws twenty feet water—I got hold of Cates's coat, and helped to get him out—the prisoner says that he assisted; I don't know whether he did, ha might have done so.</p>

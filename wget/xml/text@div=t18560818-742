I locked them up all safe; next morning, about half past 5 o'clock, I found the shed broken open, and missed two hens and two pullets—Moore the policeman has since shown them to me—they were then dead—I am sure they were the fowls I lost, they were not plucked—I saw the prisoner up to as late as 10 o'clock at night on the Sunday, in front of my door; I am a</p>

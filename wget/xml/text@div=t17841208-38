             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>I am Mr. Pitt's servant's wife, I was left laundress of these chambers, Mr. Gascoigne gave up possession of these chambers in July, he delivered up the key to me for Mr. Gascoigne's servant.</p>
               <p>At the time these keys were delivered to you in what condition were the books in the book cases? - Perfectly safe, and the cases locked, I saw the books there.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner servant to Mr. Gascoigne? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many keys were there to these chambers? - Three, I went out of town to Oxford, in July the 23d or 24th, I took one key with me, the other I left at Mr. Pitt's uncle's, in Westminster, and the other with Mr. Rose's servant.</p>
               <p>When you left the chambers, and were setting out for Oxford, were the books perfectly safe? - Yes, the prisoner went to Oxford with me that very day, he stayed till the 11th of August, it was of a Wednesday.</p>
               <p>How long was he absent before? - He was invited down by my friends, on account of his civility to me, my father who is a bookseller in Oxford, had got the prisoner to do some business for him in town, which business he did very punctually; I saw him the following Wednesday or Thursday, I think he stayed till Saturday night, he came the following Thursday morning he never left Oxford till I came to town, when I came to town, it was the 6th of September; I had a friend came to meet me at the coach, I came to the chambers immediately, as it was my home.</p>
               <p>Describe the manner in which you found these chambers? - On my arrival in town, I was met by a friend as I expected, and we had a coach and came to the chambers, I found the outer door open, which alarmed me very much; I went into my room, and found my cabinet broke open, and what was in it was thrown out; I also found a desk of my husband's broke open, I went into Mr. Pitt's dining room, and there I found every book case broke open, I think there are sixteen in the whole, but only fourteen are locked, two are left open for Mr. Gascoigne, some of the books were taken out of one case and some out of another, they were not all taken; I found Mr. Pitt's desk also broke open, one of the windows was open, and a long cord hanging out at that window, the window looks into the Temple-garden, I did not look out to see the length of it.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in company with you you at the time? - Yes, and the watchman whom I called up as it was dark.</p>
               <p>Were these book cases in the same condition when you went out of town to Oxford, as they were when Mr. Pitt left it? - Yes, I never missed a book that I know of, I cannot say I know all the books, but I never missed any; in consequence of this I applied to Mr. Pitt's uncle.</p>
               <p>Court. Who had the keys of the book cases? - I had them, I locked them up in the desk when I went out of town, I had opened them several times myself to have a book to read, I always took care to lock them again perfectly safe; I first informed Mr. Pitt's uncle, I then applied to

             the smith, the next day I sent for him to repair some locks, I had some conversation with him.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner after this evening? - I saw him several times, I got the watchman to sit up that night, and the prisoner being a person that I thought I could rely on, I got him to sit up with the watchman, I went to sleep at a friend's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Had the prisoner been a <rs id="t17841208-38-deflabel231" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. Two I fancy Mrs. Fenner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080113"></xptr>Mr. Gascoigne hired the prisoner by the week, you during the whole time was the laundress? - I was.</p>
               <p>Was it understood by Mr. Gascoigne, that you inhabited the chambers of a night? - No, I had always a lodging, I have slept frequently there when Mr. Gascoigne was out of town; I have had friends visiting me from the country.</p>
               <p>This occurred frequently, that you had visitors from the country at the chambers? - Yes, when I liked.</p>
               <p>You preferred to have your visitors when Mr. Gascoigne was out? - It did so happen.</p>
               <p>When he was out was his servant generally with him? - Not always.</p>
               <p>How many of these revels may you have had? - Revels, Sir! I do not understand you, I do not know.</p>
               <p>They were so frequent, you cannot recollect? - Not at all frequent, I was my own mistress.</p>
               <p>Did it suit your convenience now and then to have your visitors sleep in chambers? - It so far suited, when Mr. Gascoigne was out I have had them sleep there.</p>
               <p>Your keys of the book case were deposited in your desk? - Yes, that desk was always locked; I do not know that I have left it open.</p>
               <p>You occasionally resorted to Mr. Pitt's books yourself, did you lend them to others? - No, Sir, not to my knowledge, I do not know that I let any one person have a book.</p>
               <p>Are you so certain, that upon your oath you can say, you never did? - I cannot say upon my oath, I may have lent them for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>There were three keys to these chambers, for what purpose was either of them left with Mr. Sadler? - I left them for safety, I expected nothing to happen but fire.</p>
               <p>Was there no other reason for depositing the key with Mr. Sadler, but security? - Only his living opposite to the chambers.</p>
               <p>Had you any inventory of the books - No.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Pitt went abroad, were the books delivered to you with any account of what they were, or only the keys? - Only the keys.</p>
               <p>What was the purpose of this young man's visit to Oxford? - Sir, when I had these friends from the country before, his genteel behaviour induced some of my friends to ask him down to the races; he was not at my father's house, but he was at liberty to come when he liked, his good behaviour induced my father and brother to look upon him as a friend, my father's name is Richards; I found the chambers doors open, I thought they had been broke open, and somebody had concealed themselves.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing curious in the locks of the book cases? - No, not that I know of, common locks.</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Sadler any particular directions to look at the chambers? - Not particularly, he had directions to Mr. Pitt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manley. At the time you slept in the chambers, they were persons of you own sex that slept there with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do not mean to impute any thing impure to this lady; I believe, while you was at Oxford, you and the prisoner had some difference? - I do not know that we had any particular words.</p>
               <p>I believe it was not unfrequent for you to have words? - Not that of, many friends fall out, and the more intimate they are, the more apt they are to fall out.</p>
               <p>Only those little squables that arise in common life; do you recollect now at the Lamb inn, a little misunderstanding there? - I remember being there by the prisoner's sending for me, he came to Oxford privately.</p>
               <p>Why he came in the stage coach, that was pretty public; you had some words? - I do not know that we had.</p>
               <p>You will not say that you had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I believe in the latter end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080114"></xptr> July I went out of Oxford with you? - You did.</p>
               <p>I returned again the 11th of August? - You did.</p>
               <p>Was not your proposals to go to Margate, and our intentions to go to Margate? - I know nothing of your intentions.</p>
               <p>On the 11th of August I arrived in town, on the Monday following I received a letter from you by the Oxford coach, signifying you had wrote a letter to me from Oxford, and directed to me at chambers, and was surprised you had no answer, therefore you had sent that letter by the stage? - I sent a letter, but not by the stage as you say, I sent a letter by the post the next day after you set off, I do not recollect sending another by the stage, but I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 18th of August, which was a week I returned to Oxford, by means of the letter I received from you? - I will be upon my oath, I did not desire him to return to Oxford.</p>
               <p>You desired me to send a letter to you between some leather, that I was to send you for some shoes, that your friends might not see it? - I do not recollect it, they were such indifferent things, that I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the reason you do not recollect it, that it is so indifferent a thing? - I told him if he sent the letters to my father, I would receive them and answer them, but it was not my wish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you give him any particular directions, with regard to the leather? - I did not, I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not? - I cannot recollect, I cannot swear.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner send any leather down to you to make shoes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any note in that? - There was a little note in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent a letter to her between the leather, and I sent to her for some shoes intimating to her that I was then at the Cross-inn at Oxford.</p>
               <p>Did you or not, immediately on receiving the letter, come to the Cross-inn at Oxford? - By your desire I did.</p>
               <p>You then said, I am greatly afraid my friends will see you? - No, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday you and I went to the Lamb at Oxford? - I saw him there, we went there.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday I reproached you with your conduct towards me, and I advised you to come to town? - He did not that I know of, we had words.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The question is, whethere at that place he did not reproach you with some advice? - As to his advice I looked upon it as nothing, I do not know that he did then, I did not come to town for a fortnight after, had he advised me I should not have taken it.</p>
               <p>When was that? - It was on Saturday the 21st.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did he advise you to come to town? - For a purpose I did not know, he stated many frivolous things.</p>
               <p>State some of those frivolous things? - We had words, and he upbraided me with something of my conduct, I was amongst my friends.</p>

               <p>What did he say were the reasons why you ought to come to town? - I do not know any other reason than being at Oxford at the time I was, he thought the inhabitants and my friends would take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Court. He advised you to go, that you might be together more privately? - I did not follow his advice at all.</p>
               <p>I observed an expression that dropped from yourself a few minutes ago, which I took notice of at the time, it is more observable now, you said he came to Oxford privately? - Nobody knew of his being there, that is what I call privately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At this time I fancy I told you my reasons why I came privately, it was through your letter you wrote to me, that I would not wish to come publicly, therefore I told you to come to town, if you could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080115"></xptr> not behave with more prudence, that it might be kept a secret? - Upon my oath I had done nothing in town or in country improper, you had the impudence to introduce yourself there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You told us he was invited by your friends, did not he upon the 21st of August explain to you his reason for coming to Oxford privately was this, that as your behaviour was such, you should not be seen together? - It might be his vanity perhaps.</p>
               <p>But was that the reason he assigned? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>But did he say to you that your conduct during the last three weeks had made you the subject of observation together, and that therefore it was to go on, you had better come to town? - No, Sir, I mean to say that positively.</p>

               <p>He did not assign it as the reason that it was in obedience to your directions, to send his letter between the leather? - To be sure he did wish me to go from Oxford.</p>
               <p>And for those reasons? - I do not know that they were.</p>
               <p>Did not he state the reasons? - I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. To convince the Court that what I have said is truth, at that time when we were at the Lamb together, you said you would not come to town? - I said I would come to town when it suited my own convenience.</p>
               <p>Did you or did you not say the same evening after that, that you would go to town, for home to your friends you would never go more? - No, indeed I did not.</p>
               <p>After that, did I or did I not call for pen, ink and paper, and write a note to your brother, and deliver you into his hands? - I do not remember such a circumstance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did such a thing pass? - I do not know that it did, I remember well I said, there is my brother passed the window, I said there is my brother gone by, shall I call him in, no says he, I do not want him to know I am here.</p>
               <p>Did he or did he not in fact say, he would have some conversation? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did he write a note to your brother? He did not.</p>
               <p>Did not he call for pen and ink to do it? - I cannot swear that he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you inform your friends he was at Oxford at that time? - No Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you drink tea with him at the inn? - I believe I did drink one cup of tea with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I called for pen, ink and paper, and wrote a note to your brother, and was determined to send to him, did you or not get off your chair, fall down upon your knees immediately and say, my dear Evans do not? - I will be upon my oath Sir, it is not true.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing of that sort? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was that the way you did sometimes call the prisoner? - No Sir, it was not, I never was heard by any body to call him so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not take you from your knees, saying that if you would wish to save yourself from being exposed, you must behave with more prudence? - It is false, and you know it is.</p>
               <p>Well, here is further than that still, after that did not you express yourself thus; my dear Evans, I never spent so agreeable a time in my life, not even with Fenner, and of the two I do not know which I love best; I sooner would live with you Mr. Evans? - It is false, as there is a God in Heaven, I never made use of such expressions, I am not that kind of woman, nor never was.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you preserved any of these letters? - No, we came to town the 6th of September last; we were in town about ten days or a fortnight, and her brother's wife in Oxford hearing something of our behaviour in Oxford together, which was rather singular, she immediately came up to town on that occasion; then they knowing I had some letters I had received during the times I came to town, they said they would not believe that there was any intimacy between us, nothing should prove it but her hand writing; I immediately produced five or six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080116"></xptr> letters to her sister in law, which she said was her hand writing. I had them in my pocket, and she coaxed me to burn them, and said, my dear Evans do burn these letters; I burnt them before her face.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this true, that you solicited him to burn these letters in your presence? - No Sir, I never uttered a word about them, he burnt two letters in my presence, which is all I wrote, but I never asked him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I first saw the prisoner the latter end of May, or beginning of June; he applied to me, to know if I could make him a key to a chamber door, the key was made at my shop by one of my men.</p>
               <p>Did he bring a lock with him? - He brought the lock to our shop, he asked me if I could make him a key, I told him yes, if I had the lock or the key; he said it was for chambers, No. 4, Pump-court, the key was left in my shop, I did not receive it.</p>
               <p>When did he come again to your shop? - About six weeks afterwards, I was in the shop, the prisoner came and asked me if that key was made, he said he had been in the country; he took the key, and asked me if it would fit, I said I would go with him and try it; says he I am in a hurry, I will try it, and he came back with some of the bits of the key broke; says he can you mend it, says I, I cannot, I must have the lock, for some of the bits of the key are in: I offered to go with him to take off the lock, he said he could take it off himself; he brought the lock, and the bits of the key in the inside were taken out, and the same key was mended and made to fit.</p>
               <p>Did you offer to go back with him to put it on? - I cannot recollect, but as he had taken it off himself, I let him put it on himself.</p>
               <p>Did you in fact offer to go back with him? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see these chambers after they were broke open? - Yes, Sir, it might be some weeks afterwards, I went there to repair some locks, I took off the lock off the great door, it is the same lock the prisoner brought to me.</p>
               <p>After this transaction, did you see the prisoner at any time? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Did he ever come to your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him after, when Mr. Pitt's chambers were broke open? - Yes, the prisoner came to me, and desired I would be favourable to him at the examination, for he was suspected of being the person that had the key made in my shop; he told me the family were so connected, it would be the ruin of himself and his character, and the ruin of the young woman and her family; I told him it was a serious affair, I did not like to do it; when they first came to me to look at him, I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Fenner send for you? - Yes, or her sister.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner afterwards? - There was no great deal passed, he desired me to be favourable to him on the key which he had made, he acknowledged then he had that key made; he said it would be a material thing, it would injure him, he sent for me once or twice to speak to me, he sent for me to the Bible, it was still to want me to be favourable to him on the same occasion.</p>

               <p>What was the particular reason that he gave for it? - Concerning his connection with the laundress, it would ruin her family, and with some other woman, and it would ruin her character; Mr. Manley examined us all round, and the prisoner denied having the key made for these chambers, for any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Did he deny having the key made? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the subject of that enquiry at the time he denied the key being made? - He was charged with having the key made for Mr. Pitt's chambers; Mr. Pitt's chambers had been robbed, and they wanted to find out the person that robbed him; he was accused of having this key made, but for what purpose I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080117"></xptr>Was he charged with having this key made to rob the chambers? - I do not recollect any charge of that sort being given, but he denied any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before this examination by Mr. Manley, had the prisoner been accused of the robbery? - He was suspected.</p>
               <p>And had been accused of it? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Why was not Mr. Manley's enquiry into the cause of the robbery? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>It was so understood by you and all that were present? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner as well as the rest knew that was the subject of the examination; then I take it his answer was just as you have stated, that he had not had the key made for any thing of that sort? - Mr. Manley accused him of having the key made, which he denied.</p>
               <p>In what words? - Mr. Manley, when he came into the room said, Evans, you are charged with having a key made to these chambers.</p>
               <p>What words did the prisoner use? - I cannot recollect the words that he said, he had not had the key made.</p>
               <p>He said I never had a key made to these chambers? - It might be so or it might not, what I put in of that sort had no meaning.</p>
               <p>Did not you take his answer to be, that he never had the key made for the purpose of robbing the chambers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said he desired you to be favourable, what did he say?</p>
               <p>Court. Tell us what he said, not what you thought?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did the prisoner say to you, that induced you to suppose he wanted you to favour him? - Says he, Mr. Jackson, this is an unfortunate affair, we are going to be examined this day, and I hope that you ill be favourable to me; when we came before Mr. Manley and Mr. Pitt -</p>
               <p>What did he say more? - This is an unfortunate affair, I having a connection with this laundress, and she being the servant of Mr. Pitt, if she is found out, it will be the total ruin of her and the family, and it will be the ruin of my own character; he mentioned to me, that he had a connection with another woman, and that he had this key made for the purpose of introducing that other woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are the Temple smith? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are more frequently employed to make locks for the Temple than any body else? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does this frequently happen, that our servants losing their keys, conceal it from us, and get new keys from the Temple smith? - They may do so, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have not you reason to know it, have not you known a number of instances of servants and laundresses coming for keys? - Certainly, I have received orders from laundresses to have keys made, it always had the approbation of the master.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you always think it necessary to go and ask the master? - By no means, I always was paid by the master.</p>
               <p>Was you never paid ready money for those keys that have been made? - Many a time.</p>
               <p>Then what do you mean; when it has happened that you had an account with the master, it has been put in the account, but in a multitude of instances they have been paid for by the laundresses? - I am paid by the master.</p>
               <p>Has it not happened to you to know, that it has been the neglect of the servant? - Never in my life, that never happened to me in my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am afraid that, besides the bad practice of multiplying the keys of our chambers, there is another bad practice, which is, that servants very often introduce ladies into the chambers? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>When you took in the bill to Mrs. Fenner to be paid, what did she say to you respecting this key that had been made by the the order of the prisoner? - Nothing that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080118"></xptr> I know of particularly, she said she had not the money then about her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you any conversation with Mrs. Fenner about this key? - We had some conversation, she asked me whether I thought he was guilty or not, but I thought he was guilty.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Fenner say to you about this key? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with her about this key? - Yes, she asked me if I did make the key, I told her, yes, I did make it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did she not tell you that she was exceedingly sorry that she had mentioned any such thing, that she was exceedingly sorry that she had asked you any questions about a key being made at all? - Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Fenner. You say there were three keys belonging to these chambers? - Yes, they were all left in my possession when Mr. Pitt went abroad; during the time Mr. Gascoign had the chambers, Mr. Gascoign had one, I had another, and his servant had the third.</p>
               <p>Were there two or more returned to you? - Two, and my own made the third.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever any conversation with Jackson, the lock-smith, about the key he was supposed to have made for the prisoner? - When I sent for Jackson, I asked him if he had ever made a key for that door, he said he could not tell, he believed he had, he would go home and see; he took the key and went home, and returned with the key, and said there had been such a key made at his shop; he did not give me a positive answer of the person, but by the description, I concluded it to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did you say to Jackson after that about it? - He said if they had made a key, his man knew about it, and he had repaired the lock at the same time, I desired him to take off the lock, which he did; when he returned, he said the man would swear it was the lock he made the key to; Mr. Jackson was sent to, the time the prisoner was in the chambers, I took him and asked him if that was the man, he said he could not be sure, and he wished me to go into my room, that he might have a full view of him, and then he said he could not be sure that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say you was glad this discovery had been made? - I said so far as this, as Jackson was not sure that was the man, and as I had informed Mr. Pitt of it, I was sorry I had made such a discovery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Mr. Gascoign was not to leave the chambers on the 23d of June, and she expected I was to leave the chambers at the same time? - His time was up then, I expected it, as the twelvemonth was up.</p>
               <p>Whether in the middle of May we did not often have a few words at the chambers? - We have had frivolous words.</p>
               <p>Court to Jackson. You told me positively, that you took off the lock and took it home? - I was quite sure, as well as my servants.</p>
               <p>Are you equally sure that the prisoner is the man you made the key for? - I am sure he is the man I made the key for, and gave it to.</p>
               <p>What has made you more sure he is the man now, than when he was shewn you at chambers? - I knew he was the man, but when the prisoner came and desired me to speak favourably of him, I told Mr. Manly I believed he was the man, but I would not chuse to swear t o him; I was always sure of the man after he came to me, and reasoned with me, which confirmed my suspicions.</p>

Gentlemen of the Jury; on the latter end or middle of May, Mrs. Fennell and I had many words, we used to cohabit together in chambers, the same as man and wife; she told me after Mr. Gascoigne was to leave the chambers, she would use me just as she pleased, and lock me out, and if I could get in by any means, she would give me leave; by that means I had a key made for that account, but in the room of leaving chambers, I did not leave them at all; Mr. Gascoigne left them the middle of July after term, he then discharged me, and told me he would take me again in November; I staid at chambers from the 17th of July, when Mr. Gascoigne discharged me, to the 23d or 24th of July; on that day we quitted the chambers, I left them perfectly safe, I went out of town, I staid three weeks, I came to town to go to Margate; on the Wednesday I received a letter, on the Saturday I received another letter, on the Monday following I went down to Oxford, and staid till the Saturday; we had a few words on the Monday night in the evening; on the day I fetched the key from Mr. Jackson, I received another letter by the Oxford coach, desiring me to come down to Oxford again, and not to come as I did before, but to come to her friends, and say I was going to Birmingham; when I went I called her brother up, and told her friends according to her desire; they told me to stay there, I thought her conduct was rather singular, I advised her to behave otherwise, and treat me as a common acquaintance; we fell out a great deal, then I took the key and was determined to have no farther connections with her, I threw the key away; on the 6th of September we came to town together, we arrived about eight in the evening, and as we were going to the chamber door, says she, Lord Mr. Evans the doors are open, says I, it is impossible; the door was open, the windows up with a rope from the top to the bottom. Gentlemen, with respect to the books in question, I can account for: about 1779 I lived with Mr. Jones, I was servant to him at the time he had a commission in a new raised regiment at Hilsey barracks, he was taken very ill and was obliged to leave the regiment, and was ill at his ready furnished lodgings four months, and was like to die; he gave me ten pounds in money and his furniture, and a great number of books; here are witnesses here to prove, that they had the books in their possession two years, here is a person that had that book that Mr. Pitt has sworn to, before ever it was taken from me; I will leave it to your opinion, whether I could commit that robbery in chambers in that condition, in the height of summer.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lived with me till Christmas last, he was sober, diligent, and honest; I frequently entrusted him with sums of money to go to the bankers, and never found him deficient, but perfectly honest; I had so high an opinion of him, that I would have kept him, but he did not chuse to wear a livery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Gentlemen of the Jury, my trial was appointed for last Thursday was a week, Mr. Lucas and Mr. Gascoigne attended almost all last week, they are gone into the country, and I wrote down to Essex to let them know my trial was coming on to day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Mr. Clutterbuck's estimation of him is equivalent to an hundred witnesses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have three very particular witnesses that had these books in their possession long before, that Mr. Pitt swore to.</p>


               <p>Court to Prisoner. You are aware of the marks that Mr. Pitt speaks from.</p>

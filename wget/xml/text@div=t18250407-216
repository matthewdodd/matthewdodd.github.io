I advertised for a situation as housekeeper - the prisoner came on Thursday to hire me as housekeeper and bar maid; he said he kept the Hope hotel, at Ramsgate; he remained at my house till the Monday - I was to go on the 1st of April, but would not, as I did not like to be made a fool of - I missed a handkerchief and reading glass on Friday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He breakfasted with you? A. Yes, and dined, and slept at my house for three days.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the play together? A. Yes, I paid for him, as he had no money - we supped when we came home - I cannot say what we drank; he always took a bottle of wine after dinner and after supper - I did not lend him the handkerchief and glass - I did not go to the play in my widow's dress.</p>

            . I keep the Pitt's-head, public-house, Old-street. On Sunday morning, the 20th of March, about six o'clock, the prisoner came to my house and requested I would make him a pint of ale purl; he said it was very unfortunate for him, during the time he had been in London, he had not been able to get purl early in the morning - but at home, his servant always brought him up a pint in bed; he drank it, and ordered another half-pint; he shuffled about in his pockets, and said,</p>
               <p>"God bless me, it is very unfortunate, I have come out without money," and at the same time dropping this handkerchief over the bar, said,</p>
               <p>"Have the goodness to take care of this, while I go to St. Bartholomew-close, where I live, and fetch the money;" he did not return.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to ANN HOWELL. Q. He was apprehended at your house - did he not come voluntarily to visit you? A. He came in to dress himself; I had two officers ready to take him - I went with him to several houses, to get 5 l. which he owed me; I had not then found the handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 23d of March I took the prisoner at Howell's house, and found a duplicate of the eye-glass on him, pawned at M'Dowell's, in Surry-road; I told him to be here, but he is not - he was not bound over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many different houses did they call at? A. She said he owed her 5 l., and called at three houses for him to borrow it, at his own request - if he had got it, there it would have been an end of it for what I know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she mention a glass and handkerchief? A. She said she had missed them.</p>
               <p>(Handkerchief produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The handkerchief she lent me before we went to the Theatre, and the eye-glass she gave to me from a basket under her bed.</p>
               <p>ANN HOWELL. It was never under the bed - I kept it on the side-board in the parlour. I lost the handkerchief before we went to the Theatre.</p>

               <p>sent to 10, Alfred Place, nearly opposite, and gave me a bad florin—she said that there was no hurry to send them, as she was going into the road for some tea and sugar—I said, "You came here last night and bought some potatoes and gave me a bad shilling"—she said, "I was not here"—I bent the florin and gave it to her—she said she was very sorry, she did not know that it was bad, and it was all the money she had—I said, "It is not the first or the second time you have been here"—she said, "I have not been here before," and that her husband gave her the florin—my husband said, "If you are a respectable woman, as you say you are, you will not mind stopping here while I go and see whether you live at No. 10"—she stepped in the shop while my husband went—he came back and said, "You do not live there"—she said, "I do not, sir"—I said, "If you give me the money you have had of me I will not lock you up"—she said that she had nothing: to pledge and nothing to leave, or else she would—I gave her in charge—the constable asked her for the florin, and she said that she had thrown it into the road—I marked the shilling I had received on the Friday, and gave it to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch maker, of Hackney Road Crescent, Bethnal Green. On Sunday, 29th March, about mid-day, the prisoner brought me this bowl of a silver spoon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in this state, and I offered it for sale—Iasked her where the other part was—she said she had it at home—I bought it, and she said that she would bring the other—she went away, and returned in about an hour, and brought me the other part, in two pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Iasked her address, and she told me—I asked her where she got it—she she said she bought it of a woman for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and thought it was plated—I gave her 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave her address, No. 24, Birdcage Walk—she had been to the shop before, and sold me a small piece of silver and a thimble—on leaving, she said she would go and see if the woman had any more, and returned in half an hour, and brought me this other (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said that there were ten more, and would I purchase them—I said, "Yes," and she went away—I gave information, and had a constable waiting—she came back in two hours, and brought the ten spoons; they are all of the same</p>

On 29th March, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Mr. Carter's—I was in the parlour, and saw the prisoner come in, and offer these ten spoons for sale—I asked her where she got them—she said, "I bought them of a woman for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and I thought they were plated, but afterwards I tried them with some stuff, and thought they were good, and came to London to make a little money of them unknown to my husband"—I asked her where she lived—she said, No. 24, Birdcage Walk, Bethnal Green—I told her to give me the right address, and then she said, No. 24, Hill Street, Woolwich, and that the other was her brother's address—I took her to the station—she was taken to Worship Street, re<lb></lb>manded for a week, and discharged on 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bail, as no owner of the property appeared at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Royal Artillery, and was stationed at Woolwich—I left on or about 20th Nov.—I had a chest of plate in a storehouse, in the barracks there; it was locked—I did not miss any of it till three weeks ago; I then found that the chest had been forced open, and missed twelve large table silver spoons, with a crest on them—these pro<lb></lb>duced are the same size and pattern, and there is an erasure where the crest was—here is enough left of the crest to enable me to identify it—it is a bull's head coming out of a coronet and four legs—here is another with a little bit left—I have no doubt about them.</p>

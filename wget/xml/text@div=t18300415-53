            . I am a private watchman in Savoy-street. On the 21st of February, about one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another person; the prisoner had this sack under his arm - I said, "Wise, who does that belong to?" he said a person who sells coals - I said "He has no such sack;" he then said he found it at a public-house - I took him to the watch-house, and on the Monday morning I saw the name of Mr. Capper on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Where did this take place? A. At the Savoy-palace public-house. I saw him go out; I did not see the sack lying at the bar- it was under his arm; it is a house much frequented by carmen - I cannot tell whether they are in the habit of leaving sacks there; I have seen small ones, but not large ones there - he did not make any resistance, but he threatened that he would punch my head; he went quietly to the watch-house - I never swore I would do for him; I have known him three or four years - we might have had words, but no quarrel; he was a <rs id="t18300415-53-deflabel306" type="occupation">coal-porter</rs>

            . I was in the Savoy public-house. I saw the prisoner come in about nine o'clock in the evening; he had a two-bushel bag - he stopped till about twelve - the witness and he were having a few words together - when they came to the bar, I asked him if he was going home; he said Yes; he went to look for his bag, found this sack, and held it up; the watchman said, "Now I will do for you, I owe you a grudge;" there was no mark 
on the sack - he took it home from the office, and said he would have an Old 
Bailey job of that.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say this openly? A. Yes - I am a coal-porter; I know a two-bushel bag from a sack; this is the bag he brought in - this was taken away about ten o'clock by a man who had been working with him, and who is here; the prisoner did not see the bag taken at ten o'clock - he was in the tap-room and this was under a seat; I cannot tell why the other man took it out - the prisoner looked under the seat at twelve o'clock and found this one.</p>

            . I am a coal-porter. I took away the bag belonging to the prisoner a little before ten - I took it to take care of, because he was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. So you took the bag? A. Yes, for fear it should be lost; I did not take him home to his wife, I had no business to do so; I took the bag back the next morning; I should not mistake these two bags if I had time to look at them; I did not see the sack there when I took up the bag - I can not tell how it got there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. What hour was this? A. Nearly one o'clock on Sunday morning - it was not my duty to see whether that house was shut.</p>

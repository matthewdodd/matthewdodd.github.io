                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer On Friday evening, 28th July I was at a meeting, in the Theatre, in Milton-street, City—I got there about a quarter to eight o'clock—the defendant was appointed chairman of the meeting—there were then about 500 persons present—they increased to upwards of 1000 in the course of the evening—they were composed princi<lb></lb>pally</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180014"></xptr>
               <p>of the poorer classes, mechanics, principally Irish—the chairman and speakers addressed the meeting from the stage—I took notes of the defend ant's speech—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—" Friends, you have placed me in rather a responsible situation to-night; however, I obey the call with alacrity, and with pleasure to myself, and I trust any despotic conduct of mine, or on my part to-night ill be excused by you, because I believe you have all assembled here for the same good and religious purpose that I have been induced to attend here for I will just read you the bill calling this meeting. I believe the meeting was only agreed on to-day; I was not privy to any of the arrangements, and therefore, however I may express my ignorance of the arrangements that are made by the conductors, I trust you will excuse it on the score of ignorance. It is as follows, 'Is Ireland up <hi rend="italic">V</hi> That is a most important question to me, 'A great public meeting will be held to-night, Friday, July 28th, at the Milton-street Theatre, Cripplegate, to take into consideration the momeatous crisis in Ireland. Chair taken at eight o'clock. Several talented patriots will address the meeting. Englishmen, Irishmen, attend! attend Admis-sion, pit and gallery, one penny; platform and boxes, twopence.' I believe it is not the intention of the conveners of this meeting to shut any poor man out, be he Englishman or Irishman, for want of the means; therefore if there are any of those persons outside, I trust, as your chairman here to-night, that the managers of this meeting will announce the same to them, and give free admission to every poor man. (Applause.) My friends, let the police all com in—let the walking telegraphs come in if they please—let the living telegraphs, that are placed over you to watch over your every act, come—make room for them all if you can convert them, if there is the slightest probability of making honest men of them at all, let them all in: however, I despair of any great utility arising from any such task as that. My friends, I was about to say, I rejoice to think, and I verily believe it, that Ireland is up! (Cheers.) Not-withstanding the garbled reports that we receive continually day by day, and every express that arrives, in order to delude and deceive the people of this country, I believe sincerely that Ireland is up, (cheers,) and I believe that Ireland will do its duty to itself. The time has now arrived when it is too late to mince the matter; the time has now arrived that both Englishmen and Irishmen should be up to do their duty. (Cheers.) I will tell you a little bit of intelligence that was conveyed to me about half an hour ago, intelligence that I deeply deplore; our worthy, patriotic, straightforward, indomitable friend Patrick O'Higgins, is apprehended on a charge of high treason, (Groans). Now, there is no question in my mind, that every other honest and patriotic fellow, both in England and in Ireland, will be pounced upon by the same ruthless hands, as soon as there is an opportunity. My friends, Patrick O'Higgins is in durance vile, I have every reason to believe; and as soon as ever the government are prepared to arrest your indomitable cham<lb></lb>pion, Smith O'Brien, they will serve him precisely the same. However, I am glad to think they have not got him yet; (cheers;) and I do hope they will have something to do to take him too. While Smith O'Brien is sur<lb></lb>rounded by 100,000 brave Irish hearts, the government will have something to do to shop him. They say that he carries a brace of pistols with him Now, these things perhaps ought not to be indulged in by a public meet<lb></lb>ing like this; but I sincerely hope to God that such is the fact, and the first dirty fingers, be it a policeman in his own uniform or otherwise, that lays a hand upon Smith O'Brien, or any other man who dares to viadicate the rights of his country, I trust that—(cheers)—I dare scarcely trust myself for our respected friends here, on my right and on my left, are sent here for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180015"></xptr>
               <p>the purpose of performing a professional duty; and I do hope and trust you will excuse them in the performance of their duty;"—that alluded to myself and Mr. Bennett, who accompanied me—" they are but men, and they must perform that duty for which they are sent here, faithfully, and in accordance with the employ under which they labour. Is Ireland up? (Cries of 'Yes.') I should like to answer that in a very Irish method practised by this country, by patting another question—Is England up? (' No, no; it soon will.') I trust we are up; at all events, my friends, we are up this night, to listen and be advised by those gentlemen who will presently address you. This is a very critical period of our history, both for England and for Ireland. I believe, and I do hope and trust, that we are up in this way, that we shall calmly discuss the subjects that may from time to time be brought before us, and that when this meeting concludes, that we will give no possible pretext to the common foe to pounce upon any man; no processions, no <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, or any<lb></lb>thing of that sort publicly made, so as to enable them to lay hold of you and your friends to-night; but every one will leave this Theatre, and he will pur<lb></lb>sue his own quiet and calm way on again, and reflect on what he has heard. I hope, nevertheless, that you will agree with the sentiments that will be uttered here to-night. I do not believe that there is one man that will address you to-night, but are your best friends; consequently, they will give you no bad advice: but, at the same time, I think it is the duty of every man here to register a vow in heaven, that he will never rest contented till both England and Ireland are in possession of their rights. (Cheers.) I think, my friends, that it is a duty incumbent upon all; and it is of no use for Mr. John O'Connell, or any other sham patriot, threatening me, or Irishmen, or Englishmen either; that if the people do not agree with his advice, and will not act upon it, he will walk his body away, and take his father's bones with, him. (Cries of, 'Let him go, in God's name.') If he should, my friends, carry his threats into execution, I do not think it will be any great loss to his country at all. (Cheers.) My friends, I shall presently introduce Mr. Dwaine to your notice, to move the first resolution. (Cries of,' Let the dead rest!') In reply to that, I am sure I have not the slightest disposition to disturb the bones of Daniel O'Connell, or any other dead man; but I think when we are threatened by the man who has taken that illustrious man's place in the affections of Ireland, when he threatens to deprive us of such a valuable blessing as that, namely, the bones of the late Daniel O'Connell, I think we ought to pass ouropinions on his advice and conduct. I will not ad<lb></lb>dress you at any further length to-night, my friends; but I have this request to make, that those gentlemen who are inconvenienced towards the entrance of the pit, will be allowed to move on here." Dwaine, Collins, and Wad-dington spoke subsequently; and directly after Waddington, the defendant spoke—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Friends, the veteran Waddington has alluded to petition<lb></lb>ing I believe; and I merely mention this fact to put this meeting to rights, that it is not the intention to petition that House any more—I believe so. The next petition (and this is open and advised speaking, recollect) I hope and trust that you will present, every man will be prepared with his own petition. (Great applause.) I hare no patience with these set of <hi rend="italic">rapscal<lb></lb>lions.</hi> See how the Irish nation was treated last Saturday, when Lord John Russell, in reply to one of the noble and bold fellows; (and there are very few of them indeed that dare stand before that House, and advocate the rights of the poor man;) mark how significantly and how derisively Lord John Russell handed over to Feargus O'Connor the oath of allegiance. I can have no allegiance for any such abuses. I am no M. P. I never took the oath of alleginance, and I declare to you, (and it is in the presence of the reporters,)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180016"></xptr>
               <p>now, if I was to be sacrificed this very night, I am an alien to any such damas. able abuse. (Cheers.) I hold no allegiance to either Queen, Lords, a Commons that would do these things. I cannot owe allegiance to any such damnable doings as these! When I recollect that there are upwards of a million of my fellow-beings, called Irish, that have been treated worse then the pigs that they fatten for English eating—I say, when this comes to my knowledge, and I have no reason to doubt it, because, according to the very best statisticians, there are upwards of a million who, in sixteen months, <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> been sent to untimely graves by such misery, I can hold no allegiance to such damnable doings! We have no intention to petition; it is our intention to make known our wishes to that government, and if they are still regardless of our feelings and wishes with reference to the Irish nation and people, let them drive the Irish people to rebellion, as they are doing; let the blood fall upon their own heads. The English people are not accountable for this The English Chartists have been, from time to time, warning well the govern-ment, all the time that they have been trampling upon the liberties, of what the ultimate consequences must be; and I do hope and trust—(and here is open and advised speaking again)—I hope and trust that Irishmen will at: be satisfied, and that Englishmen will also fraternize with them; not going for a simple repeal of the union, but that they will never rest satisfied until they cry out with one thundering voice, 'Republic for ever!' (Great applause and waiving of hats.) Gentlemen, I am not one of the maudlin royal loyal repealers. I do not wish the Queen to visit Ireland, and yet I would not wish to see a hair of her head injured. I have no personal animosity to the Queen; but I declare myself now, and in tit presence of this meeting that—would to God the noble and valiant field-marshal, her husband, was here to hear me, I should to his teeth, and to Lord John Russell's too, express my unqualified opinion in this way—that the sooner we throw off these trammels the better; I am a Republics (Cheers.) My friends, we can bear this no longer; and would to God that every Englishman and Irishman would shake hands, as has been recom<lb></lb>mended—(cries of 'We will')—every man be armed to the teeth, I say, sooner than submit to this abominable oppression and misrule. I am not recommending you to arm, decidedly not; I want you to arm morally, and be prepared to combat and battle your own opinions against their abuses; and depend upon it, as was very justly observed by Mr. Dwaine, as soon as ever they see you prepared, they will grant you both the Repeal and the Charter, and they cannot help themselves. (Cheers.) My friends, I will just read you the resolution that is expressive of the opinions of this meeting"—(there was a slight disturbance, and a person was turned out of the meeting)—"I conjure you all, both Englishmen and Irishmen, for your own sates, for the sake of the noble and glorious cause in which you are all engages, that no tumult will take place. I tell you that there are spies amongst you, and you must expect to meet with them. Let them alone, treat them with that disdain which they deserve for their filthy and their abominable em<lb></lb>ployment; treat them with that scorn that their servile, degrading services deserve at your hands. Be as temperate and as calm as you can under the circumstances; because, I can assure you, that the Government have taken such precautions; the City authorities, also, they are in constant communi-cation; and I alluded before to the living telegraphs, the working telegraphs, that are at the corner of this street, and perhaps at the corner of every street and are taking to the proper quarter every sentence that may be uttered from time to time; but do not lay yourselves open to any such charge as creating?. riot; you will involve yourselves, depend upon it, and every man him</p>

               <p>upon this platform, if you unwisely come in contact with the police; tolerate their presence, for they are prepared for you. I have been informed to-night that they have got a new sort of sword, and these are the means, depend upon it, that they will put you, a defenceless, unarmed people, down with, if you unwisely come in contact with them. My friends, I will just read you the resolution; it is as follows:—'Resolved—That the alarming state of Ireland, at the present crisis, demands the strictest investigation of all true philanthropists and well—wishers to the British empire; and this meeting comes to the conclusion, that continuous misrule on the part of Great Britain has produced these disastrous results.' My friends, all of you, who are of that opinion, signify the same by holding up both hands.—Carried unani<lb></lb>mously."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the defendant Chairman when Willses spoke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is what Wilson said—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—" Mr. Chairman and brother Chartists, I rise to support the present resolution, that we do assist the Irish in Ireland to the best of our abilities as far as we possibly can-at the same time I hope and trust that the Chartists of England will not lav so lose idle as the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> anticipates that they will do so; that is for five as six weeks. In the event of Englishmen standing idle and looking on for five or six weeks, I believe that there would scarce be an Irishman or a Repealer left in Ireland. I hope and trust, Mr. Chairman and brother Chartists that it they really are up in Ireland, that we really too will be up in England—(chess)—I hope and trust that if to-morrow's news brings it authentic that they are up in Ireland, I hope and trust that there will be something like 50,000 to 100,003 meet on Sunday in some part of London—mind when I say I hope we will be up, I do not mean physically up, but I mean to say I hope we shall be morally up and doing, to assist our brethren in Ireland, so that we can keep the soldiers away from there. (Cheers.) Let us agitate, but let as keep good agitation up in England, and that is sufficient for us to do; if any thing suggest itself further, you will be best able to judge what is the new step to do. We know very well that on the 10th April we had no blows struck, and yet how panic-stricken the Government were; they wanted the whole of their disposable force in London: that was only a moral agitation, and that is all that we want now. You assembled 50,000 or 100,000 strong in Trafalgar-square, or in some other part near the House of Commons morally they are determined to sympathize and to assist your brethren in Ireland; then I say that Lord John Russell and the Whigs will not be able to spare one single soldier from England to go to Ireland. (Cheers.) You must show yourselves determinedly resolutely to assist the Irish in any struggle by any or every means at your command. It will not do, as I said before, to let the thing go on week after week, and waiting for this day's paper or the next day's paper, and to know whether this report is true or false; but as soon as you can ascertain the authenticity of the fact that they are up in In land, I say that we must be up in England. (Loud cheers.) I hope you will not lose sight of it, and that we shall not meet day after day merely to hear long speeches made, and to end in that, I hope not. I hope as Mr. Meagher and Mr. Smith O'Brien stated, that in Ireland speech-making now is all over; now is the time for action—now is the time to be up and doing, and if we are not up and doing now you may rest assured that our chains will be fixed far more tighter than ever they were. With these few observations I bid you a very good night, hoping and trusting you will look out for the earliest new when it makes its appearance to<lb></lb>morrow, and if there is anything of the kind in Ireland, that you will not forget on every man's holiday to have a grand holiday too."</p>

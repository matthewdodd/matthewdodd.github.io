                  </hi>. I live at Plaistow, and am a mariner. On 2nd Aug. I left the Victoria Dock Tavern with my wife and sister about 11 o'clock at night—I went with them towards my home—after going some distance I saw the prisoner, he came past my wife and sister, who were about 50 yards ahead of me—I heard him say some words as he passed them, but what it was I do not know—he came up to me, and he said, "What do you think of that?"—I said, "Of what?"—he said, "Of <hi rend="italic">them</hi> women"—I said, "I know nothing about them"—no other words passed between us—with that he made a blow at me, but missed me—he said, "I have missed you, and a good job for you"—and with that he made a second blow at me—I put up my arm to ward the blow off, and on pulling my arm down I found my hand full of blood—the blow was given as if he made it at my face—after my receiving the blow, Mr. Smith came up and wanted to know what was the matter—my wife said, "This man has struck my husband"—Mr. Smith said, "Where is he?" and before he could get the words out of his mouth the prisoner made a blow at Mr. Smith, and hit him—Mr. Smith kicked him down with his foot, he got up and ran away as fast as he could—I had only one blow, but I had three cuts—Mr. Smith took me to Mr. Morris's surgery—I did not see any weapon with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at West Ham: On the night of 2nd Aug. the prosecutor came to my surgery about half past 11 o'clock, he was suffering from an incised wound, extending from the palm of the right hand about four inches up the wrist—the wound was not very deep, it had gone through the two skins, and some of the superficial arteries were cut—there was an incised wound on the back of the middle finger about two inches long, and about a quarter of the top of the right thumb was cut off—there were small scratches up the arm as if the knife had gone up, but very trifling—there was a great deal of hemorrhage—the wounds were not particularly dangerous—they were produced by some sharp instrument.</p>

The prisoner and his wife lodged in the same house with me-they had left the lodging three nights. On Friday, the 9th of October, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was going out; the deceased came past me, and asked me how I was? I saw a man standing behind her, and asked her if it was her husband? she said Yes. He came forward, and asked her if she would go home? she said, "Go along!" and moved her hand. He walked past us, turned back, and said, "Nance, come home, for you are drunk." She said, "If I am drunk, it is by prostituting myself for an idle fellow like you"-upon which he came forward with great violence, and forced something to her side - I did not see what was in his hand. She staggered a little on her left side, fell on her back, and called to me to take the knife out of her two or three times, but I never moved, I was so alarmed. She pulled her clothes up - I saw her bowels gush out. The prisoner never ran away, but said, "Here I am, to be taken as a prisoner, if you choose to take me." Several persons gathered round - I saw no more.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Lawrence-yard. I was standing about a yard behind the deceased, opposite Lawrence-yard - She was talking to Diamond. The prisoner was standing on the right side of the deceased, talking to her in a low tone of voice - I could not hear what he said. I heard her say, "If I am drunk, it is with wh-r-g for you all day." I observed the prisoner put his right hand up to his side, as if to put his hand in his waistcoat-pocket. He walked up to the deceased - I saw something in his right hand - I could not see what it was. He went up to her, and made a violent plunge at her belly - She staggered backward, and screamed out "I am murdered!" She staggered very near to me - She turned very near upon her half-face, and exclaimed, "Oh my G-d! will any body take the knife out of me?" She was then staggering. I observed the blood streaming down her thigh, but saw no weapon. I lifted up my right hand to assist her-she staggered from me, fell on her left side, and rolled on her back, and made use of the same expression as before.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the prisoner - A. I saw him near the wall - He had moved a very little way; he extended his arms out, and said, "Here I am, I am not going to run away, any body may take me." I went for a constable; I could not find him, returned, and met the prisoner in the custody of two men near the spot. I found the deceased where I had left her, lying on her back, and her bowels coming out of her side-she was put on a shutter, and taken away. I saw her afterwards, before the Coroner's inquisition - She was dead.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and live in George-street, Sloane-street. I was crossing the road, heard the alarm of the murder, and the deceased say,"Take the knife out of me." I saw her lying on the ground, her bowels were coming out. The prisoner stood just-by, and said, I am the person, take me. I took him to the watch-house. As we were going along, he said, let me go, I will not run away, I have thrown the knife into the road. I had seen them both about ten minutes before in my street - they had been having a few words; he struck her with a bundle which was in his hand, and kicked her; she did nothing but cried-it appeared a casual quarrel. At the watch-house the prisoner said it was through jealousy.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CARTER. I saw the deceased on the ground, with her bowels hanging out. I assisted in taking the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>ELIZA HOLLOWAY. I live near Lawrence-yard, and keep a stand in Jew's-row, about twenty yards from Lawrence-yard; I heard a dreadful scream, went to the spot, saw the deceased lying with her clothes up, and her bowels out-several people were there. The prisoner was standing at a little distance, with his hands out. I said, "Losch, you have murdered your wife, you have stabbed her." He said, "Yes, I have, and you may take me; I do not mean to run away." I got before him to prevent his running away, and called the last witness, who secured him - He did not attempt to get away. About ten minutes after I saw several people going to look for the knife; I found one near the gutter, two or three feet from where the deceased had laid. I gave it to Maybank.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MAVBANK. I am the watch-house keeper. The prisoner was brought to me about ten munutes after eight o'clock. He said he had done it, and thrown the knife away, opposite the Three crowns. The deceased was taken to St. George's Hospital. Holloway gave me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280017"></xptr>the knife, which I produce. The prisoner said, "It is the knife, and now I am happy."</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was attending St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought there about half-past eight o'clock at night, and died at five next morning, in consequence of a wound on the right side of the abdomen.

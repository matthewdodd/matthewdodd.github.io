On the 3d of June, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came in - I went up stairs to take something to the servant, and left him alone in the bar; he had frequented the house for the last three years; the till was not locked. I had just put a five shilling piece in the till, and there were some shillings there; I returned to the bar in about a minute, and saw his hand in the till - and saw some money in his hand. I knocked him on the wrist, and the five shilling piece fell from his hand into the till; I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cosier, you have got some more money in your hand" - he said he had not; I tried to open his hand, but he would not let me, and scratched my finger. I called my father, and then he let me have the shilling out of his hand. I asked what he was doing at the till - he said he was looking for bad money; my father let him go away, and in about a quarter of an hour had him taken up; he is a constable himself.</p>

            . I keep the house; the prisoner used to come two or three times a day. I went into the tap room with some beer, and in about a minute my daughter called me, and said she had knocked a five shilling piece out of his hand. I asked what he was doing with his hand in the till - he said he was looking for bad money. I never knew him go to the till before. I was angry about it, and sent for an officer.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and have known the prisoner a long time; his mind has been exceedingly weakened, not only by misfortunate, but by drunkenness. I think he might do this without knowing he was doing a guilty act.</p>

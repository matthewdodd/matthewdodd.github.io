I took Wise on the 3rd January, and read the warrant to him—he said "I did send Moore and a labourer to Stepney, I was asked to do so by Gibbs; I was not aware that Barton had booked their time to Mr. Walker"—I found Reynolds in custody on the 6th—I read the warrant to him; he said "I know nothing of it"—I had seen Reynolds about 10 o'clock the previous morning, and said "You were very quiet that morning round the corner"—he said "Very likely"—I cannot hnd Barton.</p>

On the 16th of May I was placed to watch in their yard - Beasley was in their employ, and on that morning I saw a cart of dung in their yard; I did not see Styles go to the yard - the cart was unloaded by order of Hobbs, the Policeman, and under the dung I saw a truss of hay and a truss of straw; it was Beasley's duty to attend to the horses, and to take out property - my employers had hay and straw in their yard; I did not know that the cart belonged to Styles - I did not see it come to the yard - Hobbs told Styles that he must see the cart unloaded, and Styles said he would tell him what he would find when it was unloaded, they would find a truss of hay and a truss of straw; Beasley was close to him - Bates then came up, and I left the matter to the Policemen; I compared the hay found in the cart with that on the prosecutors' premises - I could not swear it was the same.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Who drove the cart? A. It was standing still when I saw it, but Styles had the whip in his hand, and he unloaded it when the Policeman desired him: when I approached the yard the gate had been opened to let the cart out - as I went up Beasley said to me, "Sir, this person (meaning Hobbs) prevents the cart from going out of the gate;" I replied I supposed he knew what he was doing - Hobbs then directed it to be unloaded, and Styles told him what he would find; the dung is Beasley's perquisite, to dispose of to whom he pleases - Styles signified that he brought the hay and straw from home - that his father sold hay and straw, and he had designed to leave it at a public-house at Brompton; all the hay and straw on those premises belonged to my employers - there was no other stable there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When was this? A. On the 16th of May - it was a cart boarded all round.</p>

I said, "I have a suspicion something is wrong here, and I shall have it unloaded;" Styles said, "I will tell you what I have got - I have a truss of hay and a truss of straw;" I said I should see it unloaded. and as soon as I saw that under the dung, I should seize it, and take them into custody - I found it, and sent for Bates; Beasley then said to the foreman, "I don't know, it is a bad job;" I took the hay and straw to the station - Styles said he had brought it from his father's, and he was to leave it at the Bell and Horses, at Brompton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The foreman, I suppose, knows as well as you do, what Styles said to him? A. Yes - he said it was a bad job; there was not only me to hear it, but others; I do not think I mentioned that till to-day - Beasley said a good many more things that were not mentioned.</p>

               <p>Styles' Defence.

            . I live at No. 11, Jew's-row, Chelsea. I was in this cart, but I do not know the day of the month - Styles gave me a lift; there were some greens and a truss of hay and straw in it - Smith rode in the cart; we came to Old Brentford - we had not bought the pony; it is five or six weeks ago.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Do you know Styles? A. No, he was quite a stranger; we were passing his father's house, and my partner knew him - I was desired to attend here last Friday, but I had heard of his being in custody about a week before, from some of the neighbours; I live with Smith, but I did not hear it from him.</p>

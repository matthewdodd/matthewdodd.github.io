                  </hi>. I am a labouring man residing in Kent. I became entitled to some premises at Shore ham, and at Horsham, which was left me by my grandfather, and considering the prisoner an attorney, I employed him to get possession for me—I employed him as a lawyer, and had paid him before this from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I spoke to the pri<lb></lb>soner about it, he told me he was clerk to Mr. Collyer, in Chancery-lane, and that be was authorised to act for him, and to use Mr. Collyer's name—he said he was carrying on the proceedings to aid me in getting posses<lb></lb>sion of my property—he told me he wanted money to carry that on—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 9th of March, in consequence of what he said—he was to carry on the business for me—I was to go to Maidstone, and see him there on the 11th of March, but he was not there—I never got my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back.</p>

On the 5th of November, one of my workmen came down to me after my breakfast, and asked me if I had taken the draw tube off his work bench; he said there were two pieces gone since Saturday. The prisoner did not come to work on the Monday; he told me there was a piece of drawn tube hid behind one of the men's benches, I told him to let it be till dinner time, and I would go up into the work shop myself; I did, and I found the piece of tube as described by the other workman. On the next morning after breakfast the other workman was coming in, I asked him if the tube was gone, he said it was; I went to Hatton Garden and got a warrant to search Willett's lodgings; he was one of my workmen.</p>

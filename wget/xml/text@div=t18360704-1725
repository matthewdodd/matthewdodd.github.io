                  </hi>. I reside at Upper Ebury-street, Pimlico, and am a publican. The prisoner came into my employ, I think, on the 16th of February, 1835—I had a guarantee for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of something that was said, I had suspicion of her—she attended to the till, and took money as the bar-maid and house-keeper—she had access to the till constantly—she had the entire management of it—I lost money at different times; and from the 8th of June I kept a more strict account—I marked some money, and missed part of it from the till—I marked shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns—I do not know exactly what quantity I marked, because I did it from day to day, not in one individual day—on the 17th of June I taxed her with my having lost money—Mr. Herbert and Mr. Goodison were present—Mr. Herbert told her he suspected her of having taken it—he asked her if she was aware I had been robbed—she said, "No"—he asked her the question a second time, if not a third time—she still denied it, and said she knew nothing of it—then I told her I had been robbed, and I suspected she was the person who had done it—she said she never had robbed me, at first; then she said, "I have taken a few shillings, but it is only within this day or two I have done it," and she begged and prayed very hard not to expose her to her friends—I said it was too late, I had already written to Mr. Rogers and Mr. Johnson—Mr. Johnson came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you before you were a publican? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was a gentleman's steward—the Marquis of Bute was one person I was butler with, and I was steward afterwards to Lord Lorton—three months elapsed before I took the public-house—I am married—I cannot tell where Mrs. Gould is—my niece was in my service at the time the prisoner came to live with me, and she assisted under the direction and control of the bar-maid—she had no wages—she was a person I took in to protect—she was in the habit of being in the bar, and had access to the till, as well as myself and my nephew, (a little boy named John Bowditch, brother to my niece)—he is not here—I never emptied the till, but always made a point of keeping a very short stock of money there—I did not take the money out entirely at night—five shillings in silver, and two shillings in copper, was the regular sum I left there—not exactly—I was the only person who superintended my affairs, unless I was absent—if there were any small things wanted, such as green-grocery, or what not, it was paid for by the prisoner or my niece, with instructions to enter the pay<lb></lb>ment on the slate—I usually get up between nine and ten o'clock—I swear it was not my usual habit to get up as late as eleven o'clock—I shut up at half-past eleven at night—I have no other business—I might have come down in the morning and found the five shillings and few half<lb></lb>pence I left had increased to a sovereign—I might have observed to the prisoner, that the business must have ben brisk, as I found the money I had left over-night had increased to a sovereign—I will not swear that she has not said the money was hers, she having paid money out of her own pocket, some tradesmen having called in—to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge she has never paid a penny for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your solemn oath, and as you will have to answer it hereafter, did you not state to her that you had found a sovereign, in lieu of the small money, and did she not give you the answer I have just repeated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear positively—it might have happened, but I have not the slightest recollection of it—that did not occur after I suspected her—I suspected her a fortnight before I discharged her, which was on the 17th—I think I might have stated before the Magistrate that I had marked as much as 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from beginning to end—some days I am sure I marked about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per day—this book is my hand-witting, it is my memorandum-book, reads "Marked money, June 8th, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., June 9th, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., June 10th, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., &amp;c" altogether amounting to about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the whole—I might tell the Magis<lb></lb>trate</p>

               <p>that I marked as much as 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I began these marks on the 8th—I made these marks in the book, as I found the increase in the purse—I had been to her drawer before, five or six times—my niece, first called my sus<lb></lb>picion to it—the prisoner never stated to me that she had charged, if not detected, my niece, in committing frauds upon me—she never made such a statement to me—on the 8th of June, seven shillings was in the purse—on the 9th, eight shillings—this is a memorandum of the money I found in the purse—I found on the 8th, 9th, and 10th, some of the marked money, that is the way it increased—the amount of this number of shil<lb></lb>lings refers to all the money found in her purse—not the marked money, but all the money together, as the increase was made in the purse—the day I charged her there was an increase of sixpence—on the 8th of June, I found seven shillings in her purse, and it increased according to the figures—no marked was in the purse on the 8th—I did not tell her I was going to her purse—I and my niece had always access to that drawer—I do not know whether my niece's clothes were kept there—it is in a large wardrobe—I think there was one shilling of marked money on the 9th—it was either the 9th or 10th—I would not speak positively, without I had the memorandum—you see across in the book, that means on the 10th of June—there was nine shillings, and one marked—I cannot tell how the purses increased two shillings, there being only one marked—my niece first told me the purse was there, that excited my suspicions—I made Mr. Herbert ac<lb></lb>quainted with this before I marked the money—that was on the 6th, I believe—that was not before I looked into her purse—I began to look in it five or six days previous to the 8th of June—it must have been the beginning of June, or it might be in May, but later than the 20th or the 25th—I west on the 6th to Mr. Herbert, he advised me to look into her purse day by day, in the presence of other witness, but not alone—he said my own statement of evidence would not be sufficient to convict of felony, and I took Mr. Goodison—I did not take him to her bed-room—my niece brought the purse down to another room, and showed it to Mr. Goodison—I went to her bed-room with my niece—it was brought down to my bed-room, on the floor below, where Mr. Goodison was, for the purpose of witnessing the increase—Mr. Herbert was not there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have told us the memorandum-book refers to the money found in the purse, and its increases from day to day, including the marked money—I see in the whole there are three crosses—what marked money do you mean to charge the prisoner with ever having had belonging to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four shillings and one sixpence—that was the 17th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How comes it, that on the 17th, when you found 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there is no cross? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After the 13th I did not take any further notice of the increase—to the best of my recollection 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. came in on that day—on the 17th I found no increase of marked money—the crosses amount to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put down every day distinct from the 8th of June what I found—these entries are made on different days, as the increase made its appearance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say to Mr. Rogers and Mr. Johnson, "I look to you for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They asked me the question, and I said I should, as had no doubt she had robbed me of double the sum—one of them said he did not believe a syllable I saw saying, and I had great difficulty of harbouring any idea of her dishonesty—no man could have a higher opinion of her than I had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you marked in silver, you believe as much as 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., what gas become of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I put it in the till, and it went of course, for change and for other purposes—I do not preceive that the prisoner could have had some of this innocently—I remember Mr. Rogers calling with Mr. Potter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they not tell you the girl was perfectly ready to meet the charge, and want to know what you intended to do—and did you not state you must have? 50, or case must be gone into? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, I never dreamed of it—the prisoner was not in the habit of advancing money of ber own to pay the tradesmen, as the till was low.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you authorize Mr. Herbert to say, that he was at liberty to enter into any reasonable arrangement that he thought proper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the nature of it—on the day this unfortunate affair occurred, I sent for Mr. Rogers and Mr. Johnson—I told them what had transpired, and Mr. Johnson had arranged to come on the ensuing Tuesday, to receive the wages due to her and about the responsibility to me.</p>

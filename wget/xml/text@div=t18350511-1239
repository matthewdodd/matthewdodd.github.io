                  </hi>. I am shop-boy to Mr. Richard Henry Ashford, a pawnbroker, in Bethnal-green-road. I was shutting up his shop on the 9th of April—I received information, and ran about a hundred yards—I there saw the prisoner with this hat under his arm—I asked him to give it to me—he said, "What for?"—I said, "Because you stole it"—he threw it down, said, "Take it," and walked away—I took it up, and got him into the shop with assistance—the hat had been hanging on the side of the door-post, outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was ten or twelve yards past the shop, and saw this hat—I took it up, and was looking at it—this boy came and said I stole it—I said "I did not," and threw it down, and was going on—some man came and said, "Is this him?"—I went back with him without difficulty.</p>

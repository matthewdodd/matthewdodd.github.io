I miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them by name). I had seen them all that Sunday morning in the kitchen: I suppose they got in at the kitchen window: there was a pane of glass out of the casement before, by which means a hand might be put in and open it; there is no shutter to the window. On the Monday morning we saw the marks of feet as coming over my neighbour's pales. Last Sunday se'ennight a neighbour came and said, there were seven or eight people to be re-examined before Justice Fielding. I, and several of my neighbours, went on the Monday. I heard it call'd out, Has any body lost any brass or pewter? I said, I had: then I was taken in before Sir

            . Taylor, Perry, and I, did this Robbery: it was at Poplar, about ten weeks or three months ago, about midnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before, or since Christmas?</p>
               <p>Cook. Since Christmas, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week?</p>
               <p>Cook. I don't know. We got over several yards, and the door was upon the latch we went in at. There stood a pot with some water in it; I took and handed that to Taylor, over the pales; it was a larger pot than either of these. I had that at home till I was taken up, and my house-keeper says she sold it to by victuals for the children. That was burst at the sides.</p>
               <p>Q. Where abouts did you find that?</p>
               <p>Cock. It stood on the left hand of the back-door, by the side of the house, some distance from the house: Perry was in the next garden, and Taylor came over to me: he pulled out his pistol and gave it to me, while he handed the pots and things over the pales; he and I went in, and struck a light; he always carried a tinder-box, candle, and dark lanthorn.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270027"></xptr>Q. Where did you take the pottage-pots from?</p>
               <p>Cook. They were standing edge-ways on a form, and the other things on the mantle-piece: the plates were on a shelf: we took six plates, five candlesticks, four pottage-pots and covers, two sauce-pans, a pestle and mortar, a pair of scales, and a white apron that lay upon a chest of drawers, in the kitchen: after we had handed them to Perry, we took them among us, some in our pockets, and some in bags that we had, and carried them to Perry's house; we got there between two and three o'clock; the prisoners lived all together.</p>
               <p>Q. What share did you carry?</p>
               <p>Cook. I carried the plates, the large pot and candlesticks: we went first into a field with some fowls we had stole and left there: a few days after we shared them: after that Taylor gave me two sauce-pans for one of my pots. Ball was taken up first, and he impeached me, and I was taken up about a month after the things were shared: he knew nothing of this fact, only we told him of it; Sparrow was not with us in this: I lived about 200 yards from Perry's house, in St. Catherine's Lane.</p>
               <p>The prosecutrix was called in, who was sent out of court while Cook gave his evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Had you any thing taken from the yard?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes; a larger pot than any of these was standing in the yard, with rain-water in it; that I never saw since.</p>
               <p>Q. how near the back-door did it stand?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. About six or seven yards; it was burst, and ran out at the ears.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any linen?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I lost an apron out of the kitchen, but I did not put that in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Cook. I was at the Rising-Sun at Hackney, about five weeks ago; Perry, Taylor, and Ball were there: Ball was taken; they said he would impeach them, and they said they would go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Ball live?</p>
               <p>Cook. He lodged in Sun-Yard, within about a hundred yards of Perry's house.</p>
               <p>Perry. He used to bring fowls and things to my house when I was in bed.</p>

               <p>Callow. On the 20th of January they brought more powder, and asked the landlord and others to buy it: and on the 21st the prisoner, Ball, Cook and Perry, came with a canvass bag of powder. I believe it to be about 30 lb. weight in all; nobody would buy any of it.</p>

            . Taylor and I went and fetched four barrels of powder away one Saturday night, in the month of August, about nine at night, from a place called Jones's field, near Wapping chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get in?</p>
               <p>Cook. Taylor had a key that unlocked the door; we took it out of the powder-house in that field; they were what they call half barrels, fifty pounds each: Taylor had a bundle of keys. The head of one of the barrels was out, it was not quite full; there were two tubs of it glazed powder, very small; one tub was mixed, it was small and large powder: we carried two tubs to the top of the field, and set them down, and went back again and fetched two more, and locked the door: then we carried them to Taylor's house; we were stopped by two custom-house officers, and I told them what it was, and they let us go: we disposed of three tubs to a man at Wandsworth, either on the Monday or Tuesday after; we took it on the Saturday: we carried it in two butter firkins to Queenhithe, and sent it up; and we went up and met it: we had agreed for 8 d. per pound before: when we came there the man said, if we would not take two guineas for it we might take it back again; so we took the two guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Cook. There was about an hundred and half of it; some we sold to other people: that we did not sell was not glazed, it was a small sort of powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sell the mixed powder?</p>
               <p>Cook. That went to Wandsworth: I was in company with the prisoner at the Rising Sun, at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you to Wandsworth?</p>
               <p>Cook. Taylor did; he was with me at Hackney: we had some in little bags, and sold some to chandlers-shops, and to two or three people about: we had sold some at the Rising Sun two or three times; the last time we were there we left about 20 lb. weight with the landlord, that was too large for shooting.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was there at that time?</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first discover this matter?</p>
               <p>Ball. I was taken up at Hackney, the 26th of January, at Mr. Callow's, and carried before Justice Fielding the 27th: that day I made a discovery of these turkeys, to Sir John's clerk.</p>

            . I have known Sparrow about a year and a half; he is a sawyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Farmer?</p>
               <p>Cook. Yes; he is a goose-feeder: I was in his field and his yard, about two months, or better, ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before Christmas or after?</p>
               <p>Cook. It was since Christmas: I know the prisoner did not come home from Twittenham till Christmas-eve; and it was after he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. What can a sawyer get a week?</p>
               <p>Cook. They can get sixteen or seventeen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you, when you was in Mr. Farmer's yard?</p>
               <p>Cook. There were Sparrow and his mate: I do not know his name, any farther than we called him Thomas, and Ball; Sparrow and Ball broke the gate open, with a wrench they had, and pulled it open together.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a wrench?</p>
               <p>Cook. It is a thing that was made to screw the breech of a gun with; they always carried it with them: I fancy Ball had his hands to the gate, and Sparrow had the wrench: then Ball, I, and Sparrow's man went in: that door was about the middle of the place where the turkeys were, between the field and the yard: the prisoner stood at the door, with the broken end of a screw-gun; it screwed in three place: he had lost the piece that belonged to the shoulder; so the muzzle end of the barrel was left at home. The piece he had, had the lock and breech of the barrel on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176502270030"></xptr>Q. Was the gun charged?</p>
               <p>Cook. It was; I brought out two turkeys: as soon as I came out I heard a dog bark; Sparrow's man came next, with three; the dog flew at him, and he threw a turkey at him: then Ball came out with two turkeys, and the dog flew at Sparrow, and catched him by the heel: I, seeing the dog at him, ran away with my two turkeys, and saw no more of them, but went home by myself, and lay at my own house: I got home between one and two, and went to bed directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of them that night after?</p>
               <p>Cook. No, I did not; only my four children, that lay with me in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Ball lie with you that night?</p>
               <p>Cook. No: Ball did lie with me one night; when we got some fowls, but that was before Christmas; he lay a-cross the bed's feet: the next morning I saw either Ball or Sparrow's man; they told me Sparrow was bit: then we went over the water, and sold the turkeys that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that you carried them over the water?</p>
               <p>Cook. It was either Friday or Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turkeys had you in all?</p>
               <p>Cook. We had six; we sold five on the other side the water and one on this side: the next morning I went to see Sparrow; he was in bed at Perry's house, in Mouse-alley: he wanted me to get him some beer-dregs, to make a poultice to put to his leg; I went and got some the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he confined with this lameness?</p>
               <p>Cook. He was confined three weeks, or better: he never went out with us afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he taken?</p>
               <p>Cook. I don't know: I was in prison when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where abouts was his wound?</p>
               <p>Cook. He was bit very much behind, just below the calf; the dog's teeth came through.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. I desire to know what man that was which you call mine?</p>
               <p>Cook. It was a man they called Thomas, which the prisoner brought from Twittenham; he knew of a place where were then fowls, at Twittenham; and Sparrow, he, and I, went there and fetched them by night.</p>
               <p>Ball called in again.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you that with you when you took the turkeys?</p>
               <p>Ball. To the best of my knowledge we had not that with us that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the door open?</p>
               <p>Ball. To the best of my knowledge we pulled it open with our hands?</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you lay at Cook's the remainder part of that night, along with him?</p>
               <p>Ball. I am sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else were in bed at the time?</p>
               <p>Ball. There were three children with him: I lay on the side of the bed: I did not strip.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turkeys did Cook take?</p>
               <p>Ball. He took two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went home with him?</p>
               <p>Ball. He was gone away before I came out with the turkeys.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cook. You see how you two differ in this circumstance.</p>
               <p>Cook. To the best of my knowledge he did not lie there that night.</p>

            . I live at Towcester, in Northamptonshire, and am a staymaker; the prisoner was taken there one Sunday morning, five weeks ago to-morrow, for having stole some things: I saw him searched; there was the part of a gun found upon him that contains the lock, and breech of the barrel, it was in his side pocket: he had also a cannister, with a great deal of gunpowder in it. I came up to town with him. (The part of a gun produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Cook. This is the part of a gun that the prisoner stood with at the door.</p>
               <p>Ball. I know this to belong to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Chidley. Was the prisoner lame?</p>
               <p>Chidley. He was lame of one leg: I saw the wound the morning just before he set out to go to Northampton gaol; it looked very much as if it had been shot through with a ball; he said it was cut with an ax; it was near the calf.</p>

            . I found this piece of a gun (producing the muzzle part of a barrel) in a chest in Taylor's house. He screwed it on to the other piece, found on the prisoner; it exactly fitted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer. On the 21st of September, about eight or nine o'clock at night, I called on a young wo<lb></lb>man in Charles-street, Drury-lane—I went to bed with her—the prisoner arrived after I was there to clean the room—I put my money under the pillow—there was a sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and about one pound's worth of silver, in a bag—when I was coming away, between ten and ele<lb></lb>ven o'clock, I looked for my money, and it was gone—I had been asleep—I told the young woman that either she or the prisoner must have taken it, and she had better go and look for the prisoner—she went and brought her—I accused her of it, and at last she admitted it, and asked me if part of it would do to give me back—I insisted upon having it back, or I would give her in charge—I called in the policeman, and he went to the prisoners daughter, who gave up one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

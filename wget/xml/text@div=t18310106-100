I was at Bath on the 29th of October, and sent a brown paper parcel, containing three sovereigns, 20s. in silver, a shirt, flannel waiscoat, handkerchiefs, and some other things, from the York House coach-office, Bath; I have the entry in the book - it was directed to my wife, at my house in Finch-street, London - it was to arrive at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What sort of paper was it in? A. The usual brown paper; I remember the direction - it was fair and legible; it was, "Mrs. Levy, No.8, Finch-street, Old Montague-street, Brick-lane, London;" the ink might have run - it was on brown paper; I am almost certain I wrote, "Carriage paid"- I generally pay the carriage of parcels and letters too; I think I never stated I was sure the ink had not run, but to the best of my knowledge it had not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Samuel say there was a parcel for her? A. He said there was a parcel for Mrs. Levy; he did not say for her - the direction was in a bad state; the ink had run - there was No. 8, upon it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what part had the ink run? A. We could not make out whether it was Finch-street, or Princes-street - Mrs. Levy was distinct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure it was not Lazarus Levy? A. Yes; she said, "All my parcels are carriage paid;" I said it was so, but there was 8d. to pay for the porterage - she offered to take me to her house and pay me, but she borrowed the money of Samuel; I did not summon her before the Magistrate - I do not know how she came there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the state in which the direction was? A.

            . I am a Police-constable. The prisoner was given into my charge about the 13th of December - she denied taking the parcel; I am sure of that - she said she had not taken the parcel, that her sister had settled with the bail, and the person who had given her in charge, had better mind what she was about - I asked if she had seen the bail; she said No, and asked if I would go with her to her sister - I said No, but I supposed the person who gave her in charge would - she said she did, and they brought the prisoner down to the watch-house, about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Was that about the bail? A. Yes, she was out on bail - I was not there at the time she gave bail; I was there when she was committed - the Magistrate offered to bail her, if she had bail.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, and live in Lower Rutland-street, Bedford-square, Commercial-road. The prisoner has a brother and a sister in the country - they were at Bath in October; when my sister was married she found her husband was severe, and she and I made an agreement that she would assist the prisoner, but I was never to suffer any of her husband's family to know it, as he would have used her ill if he had known it - I know parcels were sent to the prisoner, and I have seen them - she is single, a cripple, and an orphan.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is your brother and sister now? A. I do not know - the last time I heard from my sister she gave me a hint that she had sent the prisoner something, and I know they had some thoughts of going to Scotland; she did not know when I should hear from her again - I know they were at Bath in October, as I received a letter from my sister at my own house; I wish I had preserved that letter - it was dated from an inn; they had no settled place of residence - I had but that one letter from Bath; I cannot tell when I had a letter before, or where from - they are always travelling with pencils and pens; my sister said in that letter."I hope my dear sister Leah will do well;" that was the hint agreed upon between us when she meant to send her any thing - she used to send her caps and millinery, which they sell cheaper in the country than they do in London; they have been married better than twelve months - they have no children.</p>

               <p>LAZARUS LEVV re-examined. There was a letter in the parcel addressed to my wife, signed by me; and some sweetmeats for the children; I put the number distinctly on the parcel, and the day of the month also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it so clear a direction that no one could mistake it? A. It appeared so to me; I carried it under my arm - whether I rubbed it or not I cannot say,</p>

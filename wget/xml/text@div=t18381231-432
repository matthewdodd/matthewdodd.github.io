                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Hewitt, a cheesemonger and poulterer, in the Edgware-road. On Saturday, the 22nd of December, a person next door gave an alarm, and I ran out after the prisoner, who was in company with another—when they saw me they ran away in different directions—the prisoner ran across Edgware-road into the New-road—the policeman followed him—I came up with him and collared him—he said, "What do you run after me for, I know nothing about the fowl"—I had not mentioned a fowl—he had run about 120 yards—as I took him back I met a lad with the fowl in his hand, on the pavement in the way the prisoner had run—the lad returned with us to the shop—the prisoner said he hoped Mr. Hewitt would look over it and forgive him—this is the fowl we lost—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Edgware-road. I saw the prisoner with another about a quarter before twelve o'clock, coming down the road—I saw the prisoner take the fowl from Hewitt's door, put it under his coat, and go away—I told the shopman next door—he went after him calling "Stop thief"—when the prisoner was brought back I recognised him as the same man.</p>

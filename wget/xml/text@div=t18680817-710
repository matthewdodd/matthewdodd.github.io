                  </hi>. I am a plate-layer, in the employ of the London and North-Western Railway Company—myself and three others have charge of the line between Primrose Hill and Kilburn Station—on Monday, 29th June, about 5 in the afternoon, as I came out of the Primrose Hill Tunnel, in the direc<lb></lb>tion of Kilburn Station, I saw the prisoner on the line, stooping down; when he saw me he ran away—I went to the place and found this bolt lying on the top of the rail—I went a few yards further, and found two other bolts also on the rail—I took them off—the express train came up about five or ten minutes after I had moved them—it ran over the rails on which the bolts had been placed—after the train had gone, I got up the wall, and saw the prisoner—I have no doubt that he is the boy I saw on the rails.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you saw the prisoner stoop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; and when I got to the place, I found the bolts on—I did not see him place them on—the second bolt was four or five yards from the first, and the third further still—I only saw the prisoner over the first bolt—the bolts are not left on the line by the men after they have been working—there is a hut to put them in, about forty yards away—there were two other boys on the wall, but I never saw them on the line—as I was going into the tunnel, I saw them on the wall, and I said, "You young b—if you don't go away I will lock you up"—the prisoner ran away when I came out of the tunnel—I saw a boy there named Keen; he was taken in custody and discharged; he was not taken before the Magistrate—it was in consequence of a state<lb></lb>ment made by him that the prisoner was taken—a summons was taken out against the prisoner the same night—he was taken about eleven days after—I took Keen to the station, and he was discharged that night—I knew he was not the boy I saw on the line—I took him to find out the other boy's name—if I had not been there, the train would have been thrown off the line.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never charged Keen with placing the bolts on the line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was in the tunnel about an hour, and when I came out I saw the prisoner on the line—the line was clear before I went in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 334). I had a warrant delivered to me, and took the prisoner in custody in Kentish Town—I said he was charged on a warrant with placing some iron bolts on the London and North Western Railway—he said, "I did not do it, the others did"—I asked him who, and he said, "Keen; he brought them from the elder-tree, and I put them on the line."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you get a summons to serve on the prisoner previously? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there had been a summons taken to his house, but he could not be found, and then a warrant was issued—I think we had some conversation on our way to the station—I did not urge him to admit that he put the bolts on the line—I did not say that I would drive him fifteen miles in a cab—he said "What shall I get?"—I said, "I do not know; it is a very dangerous thing to do"—he afterwards said that Keen brought them and put them on the line.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>. It was not me who put the bolts on the railway line, it was Thomas Keen. I went to take them off, but the engine came along, and it was too late. The engine knocked it off the line, he put it on again, and I took it off. He ran to the elder-tree and picked some berries, and put another on the line and got on the wall, and I got on the wall. That gentleman came out, throwed them off the line, and called me a young b—, and said he would lock me up, and I got over the wall and ran away.</p>

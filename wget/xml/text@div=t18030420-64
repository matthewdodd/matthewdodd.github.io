On Monday the 28th, I had information that a woman was stopped with a parcel of goods under her arm; on the Tuesday morning, about eleven o'clock, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200074"></xptr>them at Worship-street; I knew them to be my property; I never saw the woman near my premises; the woman prior to this happening, had been a customer at my house several times, about a week or ten days before I lost the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were removing your goods at this time into another house? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the girl was taken? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether, at the time she was taken, she did not say she was desired to carry these things for two men who ran away? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>- FITZGERALD sworn. - I am a watchman, in the parish of St. Luke's: On the 25th of March, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Play-house-yard; on the Friday evening, I saw two men come up, one after the other, there might be about two yards difference one from the other; they seemed rather alarmed when they came out of the yard; I did not see any thing upon them; at the same distance came the prisoner at the bar, and perceiving a bundle under her left arm, I caught hold of her, and asked her what she had got there, she told me that she had nothing; I felt on the outside of her cloak, and I found there was a bundle of some kind; I said she must have stolen it, or somebody else; I did not take it from her; one of the men immediately turned back, I thought his meaning was to liberate the prisoner, and therefore I sprung my rattle for assistance, and the man made his escape through Play-house-yard; I took the woman to the watch-house; she said, on going along, and at the watch-house, she was employed by three men to carry that bundle; I saw but two of them; that she was offered a shilling to carry it to some house in Golden-lane. I know no further about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The two men got away? - A. Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not give you to understand, that the men of whom she said she had the bundle, were the men that had ran away? - A. No, she never said a word about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did these three people follow one another, had they any conversation together, and did you hear them talking together? - A. I did, very familiarly, and laugh together; I never saw the bundle in any persons hands but the prisoner's; I left the bundle at the watch-house, in the charge of the officer; I should know it again.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FRENCH sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 25th of March, about a quarter before eleven in the evening, I heard a rattle spring, and I went to give assistance, and there I saw my brother watchman and the prisoner together, and we took her up to the watch-house; I saw a bundle under her left arm; there was in that bundle some muslin handkerchiefs, and some cotton and linen handkerchiefs; we took her from the watch-house to the New-prison; the goods were left at the watch-house in the hands of

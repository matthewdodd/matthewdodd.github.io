                  </hi>. I keep Messrs. Smith's stall at the Cannon Street Station—I am responsible to them for newspapers and books sold there—on the evening of 4th December, about half-past seven, I marked some money to the amount of 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was put in the till—some of the pieces I marked myself—I looked them all over and they were all marked—among the money was nine marked shillings—I left the stall at seven o'clock—the prisoner was left in charge of it—the marked money was not put into the till then—it was put in at twenty-five minutes past eight in the evening—the prisoner was then in charge of the stall—the next morn<lb></lb>ing I examined the till, but not before the prisoner came—I had examined it over night and detected the loss—it was about a quarter past six in the morning when I examined it—the till was in a drawer belonging to the prisoner—the prisoner was there when I examined it, and missed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said to him, "Bring out the till"—he brought it out, and I then said, "Count up the money"—he counted it, and I then said, "There is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—he said, "I know nothing of it, I assure you"—I said, "I know more of it than you suppose," and I then taxed him with stealing the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that was missing—he strongly denied it several times, and begged me to be aware of the gravity of bringing such a charge against him—I said I was aware of the gravity of the charge, and was prepared to go on with it—he then seemed very much confused, and tremblingly put his head on his hand—I then asked him if he was prepared to deny it altogether—he made no answer—I again asked him if he was prepared to admit it at once—he made no answer, and I asked if I should have to expose him in the stall by bringing a policeman to search him—he then seemed very much more anxious and confused—I was just about to leave the stall to call one of my boys to go for a policeman when he said, "I took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. last night"—I then called the boy Holmes—I believe he was just on the threshold of the stall when the prisoner admitted his guilt—I said to him, "What have you done with the money?"—he made nojanswer—I then said, "Turn outyour pockets"—he flung down a shilling and a sixpence—Holmes picked them up from the floor, and handed them to me—I looked at the shilling, and recognised it at once as one of those I had marked and placed in the till—I then said to Holmes, "Richards has confessed to me of robbing two shillings out of the till last night, and this is one of the marked shillings; go for a policeman"—the policeman came after a short interval, during which the prisoner implored me to forgive him, and begged me to pity him—I went with him to the station, and charged him there—he again admitted taking the money—I believe he said, "I took the two shillings last night."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been long in the position you occupy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years—I have been at'various other situations—the prisoner had been at Cannon Street about four months—he went with me when I was appointed there—before that he was at the Lewisham Station—that was not considered as a promotion—he was merely sent there for a stop gap—I don't know what his salary was at Lewisham, or whether it was increased—I believe he was only there a week—before that I believe he was in the employ of the Brighton Railway Company for some time at London Bridge—I did not mark all that money—a friend of mine marked the rest, Mr. Charles Lamb, of Mincing Lane; but I examined all the coins as they were marked—I am quite sure they were all marked in my presence—it was about half-past nine in the morning—it was done in my friend's office</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186712160018"></xptr>
               <p>at Mincing Lane—I came from Mincing Lane and went into the first-class waiting-room—Holmes put the money in the till—I was not present when he put it in—my friend gave him the money—I was not present, but I saw him from the first-class waiting-room window, which is exactly opposite the stall—Holmes was at the stall at the time—it was about twenty-five or thirty yards from the waiting-room—there is the width of the pavement between; nothing intervenes except passengers passing and repassing—I was standing at the wiudow of the waiting-room, and had a full view of the stall—my friend gave the money to Holmes about twenty minutes past eight—I did not go to the stall after that—not till after the prisoner had left for the night—when I was absent he had the sole managemeut of the affairs at the stall—if I was absent at the time he closed he would not have to take possession of the money—he would put it into his drawer into the till—I have known on three separate occasions the prisoner taking sums of gold home with him—I told him when I first went there that if there were large amounts of gold to take it home for safety—he did not take any gold home on the night of the 4th September—I am positive of that—on two separate occasions he has removed silver from the station, when I had the contents of the till counted, and I found on one occasion 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deficient, and on another 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never knew him to take the silver home to take care of it—my usual time for going to the stall in the morning was about nine o'clock—on this morning I went at six—I was there before the prisoner came—it was usual for him to produce the till to me when I came at nine—no contingency could possibly arise for him to have to pay money on account—it was the usual course when I went there in the morning for him to produce the till—I never counted the money—it was produced without my request—on this morning I requested it, and he produced it, and he counted it by my direction—he was going to count it out in one sum, and I asked him to count out the various coin, a list of which I held in my hand—when he came to the shillings there were but seven, and I then told him there were 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—I did not say to him, "Confess that you have taken it, and I will deal leniently with you, and receive a week's notice"—I told him I considered the matter was out of my hands—I said I might have dealt leniently with him—I did not say I would—I did not say I would accept a week's notice, not at any time—the prisoner said at the station that I had promised to forgive him, but I denied it—he also said that he believed I had promised to give him a week's notice—I did not know that he had been very respectable, and was respectably connected—I don't know it now—I have not had any misunderstanding with him—he was appointed by the firm—there are five boys at the Cannon Street stall besides the prisoner and myself.</p>

STRAIGHT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner any authority to borrow money from the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the slightest—when he took away the gold it was by my express directions; he did not take any silver by my direction—I believe he stole it—I was at the stall before he came on this morning—I called him into the stall—I was present when he took the till out—I had been to the till the night previously after the prisoner left, about a quarter-past nine, and examined it and found the two shillings missing.</p>

On the 4th of August, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop with a coconnut, which he offered to sell for 6d.; I said I did not want any thing of the kind - he then offered it for 4d., and 3d., and down to a halfpenny, and then wanted to leave it and call for the half-penny next day; I made no reply. but turned my back; and when I turned again I missed a pair of boots which had stood by his side, and which I had been cleaning three minutes before - I ran down the hill, saw him running across Monument-yard, and followed him round the chapel in Eastcheap; he made a full stop - I saw him take the boots from under his left arm there; I saw them in his hand - I sprang forward, and took hold of the skirt of his coat; he threw down the boots and ran away, but I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Was it darkisk? A. It was nearly day-light; there were not many persons passing - there were two or three; I met hardly any body-he turned three corners, but I had him in sight each time; he turned round before me, but was not out of my sight a moment - we call the property Blucher boots; they are not shoes.</p>

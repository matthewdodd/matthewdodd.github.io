                  </hi> I am a clerk in the General Post-office, and live in Hatfield-street. Mr. Gale is the landlord—the prisoner lived on the same floor with me. On Sunday afternoon, the 5th of Sept., about half-past five o'clock, I went into my room and found my trunk open—it had been locked before I went out—I missed 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, two half-crowns, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a four penny piece—I had put some of it in on the Saturday afternoon before—one of the shillings had a hole through it—I had locked up my box, and taken my key with me—I went with two policemen to the prisoner's room and saw then—they gave leave to have their boxes searched—I saw two half-sovereign found, and two half-crowns and five shillings, the same amount of coin as my silver, except the fourpenny piece—one of the shillings had a hole in it, similar to the one I missed—the gold is gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William Jolly. Q.</hi> Did you describe that shilling to the policeman? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; I described the coin, but forgot the shilling with the hole in it—there is no other coin which I can identify—the gold was nearly new—I know the half-sovereign was dated 1847, the one found is of the same date—the fourpenny piece was one of King William's—the other people's boxes were not searched.</p>

                  </hi> I am wife of James Gale, of Hatfield-street—my husband rents the house, lives in it himself, and lets out apartments—I believe it is is the parish of Christchurch—on Wednesday, the 18th, the prisoners came to lodge there—they passed as man and wife, and said they had just come from Man<lb></lb>chester—Corlett lodged there on the Friday before this happened—he sent me for change for a sovereign—I gave it him, and noticed a shilling with a hole in it—on Sunday, the 5th of Sept., about five o'clock in the afternoon, William Jolly came down stairs, he seemed rather confused, and asked me for the bellows—I said I was using them—he after wards came down, I gave them to him, and he went out—he was out about fan hour and a half—I was not out of the house during that time—I opened the door to him—I had not opened the door to any one while he was out, except Mr. Corlett—no stranger came in during that time—there was no other person on that floor but Corlett, the prisoners, and myself—I am quite sure this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one I got.</p>

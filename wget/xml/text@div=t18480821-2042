                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Shadwell. On 18th July, I was in front of the Red Lion, Deptford-road, drinking with other people—I went into the back yard to make water, and saw the prisoner sitting with two females—in a minute or two a stone struck me on the head, I did not see who threw it—I was at a regular place, out of thefemales' sight—I went up to the prisoner and asked him what he did it for—he said, "I meant to pitch the stone into the second butt"—I said, "It is very strange you should throw it at me when I am a stranger"—I spoke quietly—he said, "If you don't like it you can have more of it," and wanted to fight—he made a blow at me—we had two rounds, and both fell—he pulled out a knife, opened it, showed it to me and said, "I will give you this"—an officer came and made him shut it up—</p>

               <p>said, "Then, b----your eyes, I won't go," and bit me in the eye—Mitchell he put it into his pocket for a minute or two, and then pulled it out, and wanted to fight again—we had another round, with the knife shut in his hand—I knocked him down—we got up again—I was rather enraged, and knocked him down again—he got up on his knees, opened the knife, and stabbed me in the lower part of my belly—I went down the street, but could not find a doctor—I felt the blood trickling down—some one put me into a cart, and took me to the hospital—I was there nine days, and continued an out patient afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an iron-moulder, of Duke's-place. I was at the side of the public-house, heard a noise, went into the back-yard, and saw Scott: knock the prisoner down—he got up, and had some severe words—Scott <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> into him again—they both fell, kicking each other—Scott went outside the gate, and then came back, and began abusing the prisoner—they came to high words—the prisoner said if he struck him again he would use his knife—it was in his hand, closed—a policeman came—the prisoner said, "You are a policeman, do your duty," and gave Scott in charge—the police<lb></lb>man said, "If I do my duty, I shall take you, for having a knife," and parted them, and went away—Scott turned back, and said, "Do you dare to take out a knife to me?"—he said, "I do not want to fight you, I am not able to fight you"—Scott knocked him down two or three rimes, and went towards him as he laid on the ground, and was going to strike him while down, and the prisoner put the knife into him—I consider he did it in his own defence.</p>

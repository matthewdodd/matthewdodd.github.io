I persuaded him to go home where I live, in East Smithfield; and I unbuttoned his jacket, and the blood flew out all over me entirely, as there was no vent for it before; I scraped some flue off his hat, and got some cobweb to stop the blood till morning; and then I sent for a Doctor, and he said, he was a dead man, and advised me to send him to the London Infirmary. I saw him several times at the Infirmary; he lived till the 17th of December, about three weeks ago, and then died. He never was like the same man afterwards.</p>

               <p>I keep the public-house in Catherine-wheel-alley, where this unfortunate affair happened. Near twelve o'clock I heard a noise, and I went out, and I saw the deceased laying on the ground, and Taylor on the top of him; and he had this knife in his hand, (Produced) shutting it against his breast. I said to him, Give me that knife, and took it from him, and have had in my possession ever since. I left them lying on the ground.</p>

               <p>I am surgeon to the London hospital. I saw the deceased in the hospital; I found him with a wound on the left side between the second and third ribs; it penetrated into the cavity of the breast about three quarters of an inch wide; appeared to have been made with a cutting instrument. I judged it to be highly dangerous. I believe, after he had been two or three months in the hospital, he went into the country for better air, at his poor mother's, by Stamford-hill. He became somewhat better, then he relapsed again, and was re-admitted into the hospital. He went out again, and I think this was the case three times. The last return might be about a month before he died; but he never in my judgment recovered from the injury he received; and I am obliged to say, that I have no doubt but he died of the wound he first received.</p>

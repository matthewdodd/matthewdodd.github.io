On the 9th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was going home, and two doors below the Duke of York, public-house, I saw the prisoner coming along with a gang of six or seven; he separated from them, and knocked me down with his fist. My hat was then taken off, and he ran off. I called out when I recovered myself; I ran home, and applied at Queen-square next morning, and told the officer the prisoner's name - I had known him well for upwards of two years, and have not the least doubt of him - there was a lamp about forty yards off. He was taken that morning; I have seen him loitering about the streets, and heard him called by his name.</p>

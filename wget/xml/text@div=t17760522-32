             replied, what is that to you? we are not troubling ourselves with you, you may go about your business: they walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220026"></xptr> from us twenty or thirty yards, and then gave a loud whistle or two; upon which we all went up towards Blackheath, thinking to meet the smugglers with the goods; but not finding any, we turned to the left into a road that leads, I believe, to Deptford new town; and some time after we came round to the same place we were before at; we waited there for about twenty minutes, then there came past ten or twelve men from Blackheath; they had no sticks or any thing; they passed us and went into Church-street: two men that were in the rear stopped behind the rest; we went up to them and asked them what they were waiting there for? they said, what was that to us? we asked them whether they were waiting our motions or not? we suspected by their being there, that the goods were a coming that road; in the space of about twenty minutes some men returned, to the amount of about ten or a dozen; I am certain there were not less than ten.</p>
               <p>Were they the same men that had passed you before? - That I am not sensible of: they came up with bludgeons and sticks; one cried out, Here they are: they immediately knocked down Mr. Bacon; Pierson and I took towards the watchmen; Mr. Burr made his way, and several of them after him, towards Duke-lane; immediately we went to the watchmen; we had not been there a minute before three or four of them surrounded Pierson and me as we stood against the wall; we desired them to keep off or we would shoot them.</p>
               <p>What arms had you? - We had each a pistol; but not with any intent to fire.</p>
               <p>Were they charged? - I believe one was, but I will not be certain; they said, B - t you, ye dogs, we will sacrifice you: in the space of about six minutes afterwards six men came up to their assistance; I said to

            , which way shall we proceed? he said they are gone, the best way will be to proceed to the watch-house, and make our escape as well as we can: our own party had left us, we could see nothing of them, it was prodigious dark; then six men came to the assistance of these men; upon which we took to our heels in order to get to the watch-house; we proceeded down Church-street; they set up a cry immediately and followed us: at Trinity-alms-houses at Deptford I ran against the chain, and then one struck me; I got under the chain and followed Pierson, who kept strait on; I got under the chain and kept close under the wall, following Pierson towards the old church; when we came upon Deptford-green we desired them to keep back; they were then very near us.</p>
               <p>How many might there be then? - To the amount, I believe, of six or seven, I cannot justly say; Pierson said to me, follow me, I know the way; we went down towards Deptford-green; after we came upon the green, instead of keeping strait on, he went into a turning that goes towards Hughes's-Field; I kept strait on the green; I heard him, but could not see him, it was so dark: of the people that were pursuing us, some followed me, others followed him, three followed me; I heard him cry out, O dear, at the first blow; I suppose they struck him as he was going into the turning; I did not hear any blow; I never heard no more of him till I saw him going into the boat.</p>
               <p>What time of night do you think it was when you parted? - Half after two or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you saw him going into the boat? - About half after four, about an hour afterwards; I came up to the London-hospital with him; I perceived he was violently wounded; he had many cuts upon his head; Mr. Dickerson the surveyor of Deptford had had him dressed by a surgeon before I came up. He died upon the 10th of May at near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of the people that were pursuing you? - I cannot recollect them; I never had any sight of them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you had any sight of them since so as to be able to identify their persons? - To the best of my knowledge Henman is one, but I cannot be positive to him.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed then as he is now? - He had a frock on, and he kept down his head in his bosom to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Is he the only one you can speak to even in that way? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a custom-house officer; I attended at this time to search for smuggled goods: when we were at Deptford, we proceeded to the turnpike leading to Blackheath, where we waited some time, I believe an hour, or an hour and half; between eleven and twelve two men came through the turnpike, who spoke to the deceased, and Mr. Anchor; we were apprehensive they would ill treat them, therefore we came out to them; we were standing by a house, they immediately withdrew about a stone's cast, and gave a whistle, upon which we all four proceeded towards Blackheath; we imagined the smugglers were coming down the hill; when we could see nothing of them, we turned several different turnings to the right and left, at length we came up to Deptford Upper Town again, and at last came to the place from whence we set out; we saw a watchman, we asked him if he had seen two men go past him; he said, yes, they went down Church-street; we waited about half an hour in Deptford Upper Town, under a butcher's shamble, when we saw six, seven, or eight men pass us without any arms, and go down Church-street; the two last men stopped behind, then we withdrew to some elm-trees that were about a stone's cast from us: we asked the watchman what those men were, he said they were riggers come from Woolwich-yard; we did not suspect that these were smugglers; we stopped about twenty minutes at the elm-trees, then we saw about a dozen men coming up Church-street, every one of them armed with a stick or bludgeon; they said, Bugger them, here they are; they came up to me, I kept my back against one of the trees, I said, gentlemen, keep off; they surrounded the tree, and drove me from it, and knocked me down; I was senseless some time with the blow; after I got up again, I was among the crowd of them.</p>
               <p>Was any noise made by any of these persons? - Yes, they gave a war-hoop, something of a whistle, after they came up; they have a particular method of whistling, they clap their knuckles up to their mouths, and make such a shrill noise, that they may be heard for a mile or two. I saw Mr. Burr knocked down on one side of me; while I was knocked down, the other man got off; Mr. Burr and I ran to the right; after some little way, Mr. Burr turned to the right, and I kept strait on.</p>
               <p>Though you do not know who the men were, did you observe the dress of any of them? - There were two dressed like two of the prisoners, Henman and Harley, but I cannot swear that they were the people; it was a darkish morning.</p>
               <p>In what respect were they dressed like these two men? - They were dressed in white frocks; they had flapped their hats over their faces.</p>

               <p>Who keeps the King's Head? - I do not know his name. Gypsey George fetched another bottle of gin; they drank that; they staid an hour, I believe, and then went out; they went up Church-street, searching all the places after these officers; they staid about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220028"></xptr> Broadway some time; then Gypsey George said, we shall not meet with them to-night; come home, and I will give you some gin, and then we will part and go to bed; in the mean time two men knocked at Gypsey George's door, Gypsey George opened the door, and let them in; they said they wanted some money; they all had a glass of gin a-piece, and they set off to seek these custom-house officers.</p>
               <p>How many might there be in the whole? - I believe ten in the whole; they went immediately over the bridge, where, they said, the officers were gone; then they divided into two parties, one went towards Blackheath, the other towards Greenwich; soon after, those that went towards Greenwich came back, and waited till the other party came to them; then they came all together over Deptford-bridge, and went down Church-street; two men that had staid behind, came up and said, they saw the officers run to the butcher's shambles just over against where the watchman stood.</p>
               <p>Can you tell their names? - No; Gypsey George said, There are enough of us now to go and lick them; Gypsey George came up the street to where the officers were, by three elm-trees, and the other party followed; as soon as Gypsey George came up to the elm-trees, he made a loud alarm, and immediately knocked one man down with his stick.</p>
               <p>Who was there at that time? - All of them; we lost them all for that time; we heard an alarm of them in Church-street; we ran down after them; then I saw Gypsey George take down Hughes's Field; when he came down to the bottom of Hughes's Field, he seized Pierson by the collar, and said, if he did not tell his name, he would cut his throat.</p>
               <p>Who were with him? - The prisoner and myself; Gypsey George knocked Pierson down, and the other three came up and beat Pierson as he lay upon the ground.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon at the London-hospital.</p>
               <p>I believe you attended this poor man? - Yes; he had three or four very dreadful wounds upon his head; he was very badly bruised upon his breast, in short there was not a free place but what was beat and bruised in a very bad manner, even so that I asked leave of the governor to suffer his wife to be with him; she was with him all the while he was there; he was so bruised that he could not stir himself the least in the world; his head, the os frontis, the forehead was laid bare, the occipitis was cut, his breast was dreadful, his right arm was so bruised that we laid it open; there was a large extravasation of blood daily.</p>
               <p>How long did he live in the hospital? - About a month.</p>
               <p>Did he die of these wounds? - Certainly; I begged leave that the poor woman, his wife, might be indulged in staying with him, and she did not leave him the whole time.</p>
               <p>Did he give any account how he came by those bruises or wounds? - I never asked him about that; there was a deposition taken by two magistrates.</p>
               <p>He was in his senses? - Yes, always.</p>

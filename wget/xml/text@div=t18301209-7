            , but I never use the second name; I have never gone by it and am not known by it - Mr. Lynam rents the house, and lives in it. On the 22nd of November, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I went up stairs to dress; I had a purse with four sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and four half-crown in it - I had seen all that money in it that afternoon; I had been saving it in order to make a present of it to a servant - one sovereign had the letters A. C. on it as my initials; I left my purse at the foot of the bed, is my room, about five o'clock - I went up stairs again about seven, and the purse was not there; the prisoner was a servant in the house, and it was her duty to attempt to that room - the bed was turned down then, but not at five o'clock; I searched for my purse, but it was gone - in the evening of the next day I saw the prisoner in the presence of Mrs. Lynam; she was dressed with her bonnet on, ready to go out - she told Mrs. Lynam she was ready to go, and asked for her wages; Mrs. Lynam said it was at her pleasure, she might go if she liked, but without her wages - she went down stairs, and I told Mrs. Lynam of the loss of my purse; I was afterwards present at the station-house, and saw the prisoner's box brought there - it was locked: I saw it opened with one of her own keys, which she gave to the Policeman; I saw four sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and four half-crowns found in her box altogether - the sovereign marked A. C. was among them; I had marked it myself, and have no doubt of it.</p>

I recollect the prisoner being charged with taking this purse - she had been about six weeks in our service, and had notice to quite of the Monday, the day of the loss; she was to quite at the expiration of the month - in consequence of information from the prosecutor, the Policeman was sent for; the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090009"></xptr>applied to, to have her box searched - she refused, and was taken to the Police-station; the keys were taken from her at the station, and applied to a work-box, which was found at her brother's house-her brother had called that evening; I saw the key applied to the box, saw it opened, and the money found in the manner described altogether - she claimed the work box directly she saw it, and said repeatedly that she had earned the money as her wages; Mr. Campbell had been with us nine months - I never knew him by the name of Edward.</p>

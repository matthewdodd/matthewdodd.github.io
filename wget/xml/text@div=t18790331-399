I am a carman, and have been employed at the Metro<lb></lb>politan Meat Market—the prisoners came to me on 28th February between 7 and 8 a.m.—I knew them by sight working in the market—they asked me for 4 quarters of meat for one of their little masters; I cannot recollect the name, but he said he lived in Ball's Pond Road—I agreed to take the meat; it was to be obtained from Kilsby's—I first sent Richardson, who came back without the meat, but said nothing in the prisoners' presence about what would be required—the prisoners knew that I could not get it without a written order, and Ford got a sheet of paper next door at the Little Bell—I cannot tell whether this is the sheet, but it was similar to this—I cannot read—I stood inside the public-house door and saw Jordan writing—Ford then handed it to me and said, "Give that to the porter outside and he will fetch them," and I did so—Jordan was in the bar at that time—they took the paper and returned without it, but with the beef—it was put into my van, and by Jordan's instructions I drove to the Angel—they were to meet me up John Street, which is on the road to the Angel, but they met me a little farther on at Liverpool Road—I did not go to Ball's Pond Road because he wanted his beef to go to another place—I took it to Hill's, 69, Bingfield Street, Caledonian Road—Ford went in to deliver the beef, and I just went into the shop—I do not know how much it was sold for—having two quarters left we proceeded to Mr. Gray's shop in the Roman Road, which is a little place, half of a bootmaker's shop; we left the other two quarters there—I do not know what they fetched—Ford gave me a sovereign, and Jordan said, "Give him another 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and I got it—I did not charge anything—the ordinary charge for the carriage of four quarters of beef would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas King, and live at No. 20, Collingwood-street. The prisoner's brother, George Jeacock, lives in the front parlour—I knew the deceased for about a year and a half—she lived in Nelson-street, and was sometimes called Matilda Bailey, and sometimes Matilda Jeacock—she and the prisoner used to visit George very often in the front parlour—on Wednesday, the 16th of August, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, they were in George's room—I heard the prisoner and deceased at very high words, and heard very bad language; in consequence of which, I went into the room—the deceased was then sitting, with a pair of scissors in her hand, and the prisoner was sitting on a table by her side—they were quarrelling very much—the prisoner asked the deceased for the key of the door—she denied it, and said she would not give it him—he asked for it again—she said she would not give it to him, and she would run the scissors into his b—guts—they were both the worse for liquor, but the prisoner more so than the deceased—the prisoner desired her to put the scissors down—she said she would not—I begged of her to put them down, and she dropped them by her side on the floor—I picked them up, put them on the sideboard, and begged of her not to take up such things as those any more, as they might do one another an injury before they were aware of it—I was then coming out of the room—the prisoner said something to the deceased, but what it was I cannot say—she jumped up, took the scissors off the sideboard, and stabbed the prisoner with them in his left arm—I cannot say whether he took them out of her hand or out of himself, but he instantly stabbed her with them in the side—I saw them in his hand—it was done very suddenly—they were both in a passion—on receiving the stab, the deceased only gave one scream, and fell on the chair—I never heard any more of her afterward—Mrs. Jones came in, and we assisted the deceased—she bled very much from the stab—we let her be till Mr. Gillatt, the doctor, came in, in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—she remained in the chair till the doctor came—the prisoner sat on a chair by the side of her—she died on the Friday af<lb></lb>ternoon following.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Jeacock, and live at 20, Collingwood-street—I knew the deceased by the name of Matilda Boreham—the prisoner and her were in the habit of visiting my husband almost every day—they were living together as man and wife—at the time of her death she went by the name of Mrs. Jeacock—I saw her and the prisoner at our house on the Wednesday in question—they had been drinking—the prisoner came into the room in the afternoon, about four o'clock—the deceased said, "This is a pretty birth-day for me; if I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I would spend it"—he directly took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his pocket, and said, "Will you spend this?"—she said, "Yes," and he went and got some beer—they began quarrelling—he said he would go to his work—she said he should not—an old gentleman came in and spoke to them about quarrelling—I left them and went home—the prisoner came after me in about five minutes, and then the deceased came in—he asked her if she would go home, she said, "By and by"—he asked for the key—she</p>

               <p>said she would not give it him, the door was open—they begin quarrelling about the key—I know she had the key, because I had seen it in her hand—they were at very high words, and used very vulgar names to each other—she then took up the scissors, which I think were lying on the table or side<lb></lb>board, and swore she would run them through him, mentioning a very bad word—he said he would knock her d—d head off, if she did not put them down—Mrs. King came in and told her to put them down—the prisoner then desired her to put them down, and she let them fall on the ground—Mrs. King picked them up, and put them on the sideboard—I tried all I could to pacify them—she took hold of the scissors again, and made a rush from the chair and struck him between the shoulders and breast—he was standing not a yard from her—he directly took them, whether he took them from himself or from her hand, I cannot say; but he directly stabbed her in the side, before I could rise from the chair; she screamed, and fell on the chair she rose from—I did not see any blood then, not till she was undressed—I saw her between that and the Friday when she died.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Shoreditch—I was called in to see the deceased, on the Wednesday afternoon, about five o'clock—I found her perfectly insensible, and sitting in a chair propped up against the wall—I had her removed to the bed, and undressed her—animation was re<lb></lb>stored in a short time—I found a wound in her side which I probed, and found to extend about three inches in depth, above the seventh rib—I gave her brandy and stimulants and she recovered a little, I then dressed the wound, and from the symptoms, saw there was some very serious injury—I attended her regularly till she died, which was on the Friday following—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found the point of the scissors had entered the left lung, opposite about the fourth or fifth rib—it was such a wound as one of the blades of a pair of scissors might have inflicted—I am quite satisfied that wound was the cause of her death—she had no disease—I did every thing I could for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the wound appear to have been recently inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite recently—the prisoner was present when I first saw her—he seemed very sorry—I examined his wound, it was on the muscles of the chest near the heart; the clavicle, scapula and other bones are there—persons frequently recover after receiving wounds in the lungs—I probed the wound very slightly—I was satisfied that the wound entered the cavity of the chest,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184309180016"></xptr>
               <p>and I considered it improper then to probe any farther—I probed about three inches—there are no arteries of very great importance within those three inches—if the wound had not penetrated the chest it would have been of trivial con<lb></lb>sequence—if any artery had been grazed by the passage of the scissors, the probing might have some effect on it, and therefore I did not proceed further—I closed the wound immediately—I administered brandy in the first instance, and good doses of sal-volatile—on the post mortem examination, I found a very slight enlargement of the liver, but nothing to affect her lungs—the stomach was perfectly healthy—it did not exhibit symptoms of inflamma<lb></lb>tion—there was inflammation round the wound in the lung which was pene<lb></lb>trated, the other lung was perfectly healthy—in a bad constitution, a wound not otherwise dangerous, is frequently mortal—taking a large quantity of alcohol produces an inflammatory habit, which is very dangerous—I am a member of the College of Surgeons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Police-court, Worship-street—I attended Mr. Bingham, when he went to the deceased's house to take her depositions, about half-past one o'clock—I was there about half an hour—she appeared to be perfectly still, in a state of collapse; but when spoken to she rallied, and spoke with a tolerably audible voice, and gave her statement very uninterruptedly—I took it down as she spoke it—this is it—the prisoner was present as well as Mr. Gillatt—and in answer to questions put to the prisoner, he also made a statement—she signed her statement, and the prisoner his, and it is attested by the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The information of Maris Boreham, &amp;c.—I am a single woman, and live with the prisoner. I have got a wound on my side—it was done with a pair of scissors. I received the stab, I think, on Tuesday or Wednesday last, about half after five o'clock in the afternoon—it was William Jeacock, who is now sitting before me, who gave me the wound. I threw the scissors at him first, and then he struck me with them; he had been drinking, and was the worse for liquor. I had also been drinking. I believe we had a quartern of gin and a pint of beer between three of us. I have been living with the prisoner very near four years. He stuck the scissors into me, and I fell down from the blow; he is wounded on the shoulder; he was wounded by my throwing the scissors at him. I was excited by his using very bad language to me. I think it happened in the room we are in now, No. 20, Collingwood-street—I am thirty-three years of age."—"The prisoner says, 'We had been drinking together; I asked her for the key of Our lodging; we had words together in this room—she took the scissors from the table. I told her if she did not put them down, I would take them from her—we had more words; she dropped the scissors on the ground; we had more words, when she picked the scissors up, and stuck them into my shoulder. I took them from my shoulder and from her, and then in my anger I struck her with them.'"</p>

            . I sat in my Mistress's shop, which is opposite to Kennedy's shop; about the 1st of April, between nine and ten at night, there came three boys together down from towards the Minories, it was dark; they lifted up the sash of Kennedy's shop and one of them took something out, but what it was I could not tell, and they all ran away. I went over and knock'd at the door. Kennedy came to it, and I inform'd him what I had seen; he sent his servant after them, who catch'd Plastow, and kept him in custody that night, and the next morning, carried him before justice Richards, where he said he'd assist in finding the others concerned with him, but took an opportunity, as they were about to see for the others, to give them the slip.</p>
               <p>Perkinson had nothing to say in his defence.</p>
               <p>Plastow, that he was but twelve years of age, had neither father or mother, and knew nothing of the affair.</p>

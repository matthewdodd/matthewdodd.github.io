                  </hi>. In September last I sailed in the barque Snowdrop—I shipped as carpenter—her burden was 396 tons; she was bound for Cronstadt in ballast—the prisoner White was the captain, and Sutton the mate—on the morning of 4th October the vessel struck upon a reef called the Stonescar reef, to the eastward of Revel, about a quarter of a mile from Stonescar island, and about twelve miles from Port Cundar, the mainland nearest the island—the vessel struck twice; she got placed between two rocks, one on the port bow and another on the starboard quarter—the wind was W. N. W.; it was not blowing very hard; it was blowing a pretty fresh breeze, but nothing very hard—after she struck the sails were clewed up; they were not furled at that time—I sounded the pumps when she struck; I found she was making no water—I did that three times, and reported it to White—he was then on the quarter-deck, the poop; there were other per<lb></lb>sons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300050"></xptr>
               <p>there who heard me—after that the captain called me down into the cabin; he said, "Come down and have a glass of grog"—he then said, "Now, carpenter, the ship is here, and I don't want her ever to get off; she is not making water, can you make her make water?"—I replied, I could—he asked by what means—I said, "By boring a couple of holes into her"—he said, "Go and do it, carpenter, and I will see you all right"—he said that his brother and he were young men, and if they did not get their in<lb></lb>surance they would be ruined—he talked about the qualities of the vessel, that she was the fastest sailing vessel in the Baltic, and that he was the best navigator in the Baltic—he said, "Go on and do it, and I will keep the crew employed about getting the anchor out astern during the time you are doing it"—I then went on deck, went down into the half-deck, and took a half-inch auger; I am wrong, it was an inch and a quarter auger I took at that time, a chisel and a hammer—I took them out of my tool-chest, I brought them on deck, and hove them down the fore-hatch on the top of the ballast; then I went down myself—I took up the tools and put them on some dun<lb></lb>nage-wood aft—then I came up out of the hold again, and went down the half-deck, and took, a half-inch auger out of my chest and put it in the hold in the same way—then I went down into the hold myself again, followed by Button, the mate, and he asked me if I could not start the wooden ends for<lb></lb>ward—I said I could not—I went aft on the starboard side and took a graving piece out of the ceiling; that is the inside lining of the ship, and I bored a a hole with a half-inch auger between the timbers—Sutton was standing be<lb></lb>side me at that time—I bored the hole in the outside plank, and the water came in—I then replaced the graving-piece—I then went forward on the port side, and took out another graving-piece and bored a hole in the same manner, and returned the graving-piece—I put it in the same way as it had been before; I put it in with my hand—I hammered the one aft in on the inside—Sutton was there when I bored the hole in the port side—I then went on deck—the crew were getting the anchor ready, and the boats—they made an effort to take the anchor astern—they went about a boat's length from the ship, on the starboard quarter, and returned in about ten minutes—they then took the anchor on board again—White then asked me to sound the pumps—I did so, and reported that there was twenty inches of water in her; that was about between 10 and 11 in the day—I went into the cabin again; the captain asked me—he said the ship was not making much water yet—I said no, but I could make her make more if he chose—he said, "Go on and do it then, carpenter"—I went on deck again, went down the hold, and took an inch-and-a-quarter auger and bored two inch-and-a-quarter holes in the same places as the half-inch holes were—I stood upon the ceiling to do it; I took out the graving-pieces again—I could not manage to put one of them back again, for the force of the water—I then went on dock and found the crew getting their things ready to go ashore—I Went down into the cabin again and had some conversation with the captain and mate—we were talking about the ship, and we had a glass of brandy each, and then the captain and I went down into the hold to see if the ship was making the water—we went aft on the starboard side, and were standing by the water-tank; that was about six feet from where the holes were, and the captain said, "Now, carpenter, between you and me and the water-tank, this must never be known; you must not speak about it, and I will see you all right"—while we were there I saw the steward come part of the way down; he came half way down the ladder, down the main hatch, with the captain's belt—he said, "Here is your belt, Captain White"—the captain said, "Take</p>

               <p>it away, keep it, I don't want it"—we went on deck after that, and the cap<lb></lb>tain went down in the cabin and packed up his things—he and I left the vessel; we left at different times—we were not all ashore before 3 in the afternoon—there was no pumping at any time—I went to Revel, then to St. Petersburg, and then shipped for England.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I reflected upon what I had done on the passage home, and I thought I was in a critical position, that I was endangering myself—that was the first time I so thought—it was in coming from Cronstadt in the vessel I shipped in; I dare say it might be about half the passage home—it was then for the first time I thought I was in a difficult position, and had done wrong; I swear that—I did think it was wrong at the time, but I did not reflect upon it; I mean that the first time I reflected upon it was when I was coming home—I was not drunk on that morning; I had been drinking; I was not the worse for liquor; I don't say I was quite sober, never having tasted liquor; I took three or four glasses of liquor—I went to Mr. Downward to ensure my own safety, thinking, perhaps, some of the crew might give it in in London, and that I might be brought up—that was my reason and no other—I had heard of Mr. Downward before I went—I bad not heard of any reward offered by Lloyd's Salvage Association; I swear that—I never heard of any reward—I did not know anything of Mr. Downward before I went to him first—I was told to go to him by the master of the house where I was stopping—I have not been earning my living since then; Lloyd's Salvage Association have been supporting me, they have been clearing my expenses, giving me sea wages, and paying my board—that has been for ten or eleven weeks, I dare say—I have never heard of any reward offered by Lloyd's Salvage Associa<lb></lb>tion for giving information; I swear that—I don't expect any reward; I</p>

"Let the vagabond come on board"—I did not hear the mate say anything—I never said I would not go on board unless I had some more money—the captain scolded me for not being on board in London—he said, "Carpenter, this is a pretty time to come on board; the ship has been detained through you"—I sent Brown to ask the captain for money to pay for the boat for bringing myself off, bat not with any threat that I would not come on board—Mr. Brown did not tell me the captain refused to give me any money—I was sober at the time the officer of the Board of Trade came to me—the captain did complain that I had detained the ship—I did not, that I recollect, say to Mr. Brown, "Never mind, Mr. Brown; d—the old tub; I will be one with then yet"—I will not swear positively that I did not—I did not say those words—I swear that I did not say the words, "D—the old tub; I will be one with them"—I did not say I was d—sorry I had come to the ship—I dare say I said the vessel was an old vessel, and I could get a better, but I did not say, "D—the old tub"—I did not say "She is nothing but an old tub; they are a bad lot"—I said it was only a short voyage, and I dare say I could put up with it—I saw Mr. Brown on my return home—I did not owe him anything when I came home—his wife had a pawn-ticket belonging to me, which I went for; I had left it with her—I did not say to Mr. Brown, "I have got plenty of money, "or "shall get plenty of money"—Brown did not ask what for, nor did I say, "Why, for scuttling the ship; I have been to the Insurance people, and they will pay me handsomely"—I said I had been to Lloyd's, and reported what I had done—I was very badly clothed when I returned—I did not say to Mr. Brown, "I shall have to get plenty of money from Lloyd's next week, and then I will come and pay you for the ticket of ray pawned coat"—I never said to anyone that I was going to get money from Lloyd's—I do not expect it; that I say on my oath—I am living with my wife now; she is in London—After leaving Stonescar Island, we went to Port Cundar—I had not deposited my chest of tools with the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the mate complain at Cronstadt of your getting drunk every day, and spending your money in that way instead of paying him what you owed him after the wreck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never complained of my drinking, or of anything else, until the money I had was all spent, and I bad shipped again, and then he complained that I did not pay him when I had the money—he did say that I had spent my money in eating and drinking instead of paying him—he complained to me, and he kept the coat—I signed a protest at Revel—I was sworn to the truth of it—an oath was administered to me—I could not tell you who administered it—the oath was to this effect, "We swear to God, the Lord, that all that the cir<lb></lb>cumstances mentioned by us, and contained in the underwritten declaration, and again at this present fairly read before us, are the real truths as sure as God and His Holy Gospel shall help us now and for ever Amen."</p>

I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Snowdrop</hi> as cook and steward 1—I was awoke from my sleep at 4 o'clock, on the morning of 4th October, with the ship running on the rocks, and bumping occasionally—I ran up the companion before dressing myself—I saw reefs in front of the vessel, and on the right an island—I went down below again, and the captain, not knowing I had been on deck, said, "Turn out, steward, old boy; the ship is on shore"—I said to him that I was sorry for him—he said, "For why?"—I said it was a serious job—he told me to pack up his things, as he had 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth in the state-room—I heard the men clewing up the sails at this time—I heard the carpenter tell the captain that the ship made no water, two or three times within about half an hour—I went down into the hold of my own accord to examine whether she was making water; I found her per<lb></lb>fectly dry; that was about an hour and a half after the vessel had struck—she was then in an upright position on the rocks—I asked the mate if there was any tide flowed there, whether the vessel could be got off, and the reply was, no there was none—I do not recollect seeing Craig and the mate to<lb></lb>gether—I saw Craig and the captain together in the cabin at 6 o'clock—I was there also—I was sent on deck by the captain with a mug of rum to give the men—I was absent on deck about ten minutes—I then went down into the cabin again, and went on packing up the things—Craig was still in the cabin when I went down again—I went in the jolly-boat—I think that was about 9 o'clock; I can't positively say the time—I went with the mate, one seaman, and two boys; we went to take the long-boat in tow, by rights, in point of fact, we never left the side of the vessel, only went a little way—the anchor was over the stern of the long-boat; it was not put into the water—when we were in the boat I remarked to the mate that the car<lb></lb>penter ought to have been sent into the boat in place of me, for he was more of a seaman than I was—he made no reply—I can't say particularly as to</p>

               <p>the time we were before we returned on board the vessel; I suppose about a quarter of an hour—the ship was dry when we went back—I did not go into the hold; I passed the main hatchway, and I heard water rushing in; it seemed to be in the after part of the hold, and I told the captain—I said, "The water is coming in aft"—he said, "Never mind that, steward; go on about your work"—I went down into the cabin again—when I was there I heard a hammering, and a rush of water; I heard the hammering first—I had finished packing up nearly all the captain's things, and having his belt out, I went on deck to find him; he was in the hold at the time, and I went half-way down the ladder, and saw the captain standing with his back to me, and the carpenter standing sideways, by the pump-well—I heard the captain say something about making him all right, or words to that effect—I said to the captain, "Here is your belt, sir, you had better put it on"—he started, and looked confused at seeing me, and said, "Take it away, steward; I don't want it, "meaning that I could keep it—I then went back again into the cabin; the mate was there, lying on the after lockers—I believe we had two pumps on board—there had been no pumping up to that period; I never saw any pumping, only at the time the hold was being washed out—when I came to England I made a statements to Captain Downward.</p>

N. E.—the captain then came on deck—he asked what I had done; I told him, "Nothing"—I told him I had called him at 3 o'clock, and he did not turn out—he said he perfectly under<lb></lb>stood that I did do so—all hands were called on deck, the sails were clewed up, and the pumps sounded—the carpenter sounded the pumps, and I heard him say to the captain that there was no water; I heard him say that twice; it might be three quarters of an hour between the times—the sea did not break over the ship—the boats were got out some little time after, I dare say about 5, or half-past 5, in the morning—they were got out by tackle, put over the side into the water—a man got in to make the line fast to them as soon as they were over the side—I saw the jolly-boat got out; that was the first one that was got out—there was an effort made to tow the long boat; they tried to do it—that was after we got the anchor in, at 9 o'clock; that was the first and only time the anchor was got into the boat—I have been at sea fifteen years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything to your knowledge to prevent that being done sooner than 9 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, we <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it as soon as we could; we were clewing the sails up, and the like of that, and getting things ready—the jolly-boat was manned with four hands, two boys and two men; the steward was one of the men and an able seaman—we tried to pull the anchor a-stern—we never got from the vessel at all—while we were getting the anchor out, I saw the carpenter pass his tools down the hold, and heave them on the ballast—they were an auger, a chisel, and a hammer—the carpenter went down the hold himself shortly after; that was about 9 o'clock—the ship was making no water before that—at that time the captain was in the fore-hold with me, getting the warp ready—that was after I had seen the carpenter go down—the captain remained with me a quarter of an hour—the mate, I believe, was in the hold at that time, because I know he followed the carpenter down—the pumps were not used at all—after I came out of the long-boat, I heard the carpenter report that there was twenty inches water in the ship; that was about half-past 9; about three-quarters of an hour after I had seen him throw his tools down the hold—the pumps were not used after that—I was called down into the cabin: the captain, the mate, the steward, and carpenter, were there—I was asked to have</p>

                  </hi>. I now live at Mrs. Garraway's, 7, Prospect-place, St. George's-in-the-East—I am sixteen years old—I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Snowdrop</hi> in September, 1864, on a voyage to Cronstadt—I remember the time when she was wrecked—for some days previously to that the weather was not very good; there were head winds—we were obliged to anchor—the captain was on deck night and day, part of that time—I was in the watch on the night the vessel struck—it was our watch from 12 till 4 in the morning—the boatswain, Brewer, bad charge of the vessel during that watch—I held the reel for the purpose of ascertaining the speed of the ship during the watch—I don't remember how many knots she was going exactly; I think it was seven—the yards were squared about ten minutes before 4—the boatswain ordered that, the wind being more aft—it was a dark night—I was on the look out—it was my duty at 4 o'clock, eight bells, to go below and call the carpenter and Joseph Banter, on the aft deck, and as I was going down the ladder I was knocked right down—I called the carpenter and Banter—the carpenter said "Good God, what is the boatswain doing?"—directly I got on deck the mate ordered the sails to be clewed up—before that I heard Middleton say, "Here is an island on the starboard bow"—the ship struck just after that—it was after she struck that the mate called out to have the sails clewed up—they were clewed up directly—while it was being done, I saw the captain—he ran forward with a lamp or lantern to see what rocks they were—the sails were furled after breakfast—we had breakfast just after 8 o'clock—the wind had effect upon them when they were clewed, but not near so much as before—clewing means tucking them up by pulling the ropes loosely up—that can be done almost in a moment; furling takes a long time—it was quite dark then—the captain ordered the tackles to be rove for getting out the boats—he assisted in that himself—he did everything that was necessary that he could do; he worked with his own hands along with the crew—it took about an hour or two to get the boats launched—the ship was bumping every</p>

I belong to Hamburgh—I was an ordinary seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Snowdrop</hi>—when the ship struck I was down below, calling the watch—I ran on deck—the ship was stern on a rock—I thought at first it was a sea run into her, but when I came up I saw the land—the ship was going about seven or eight knots an hour at the time—I saw the captain on deck when I got up—he was in his drawers and shirt—he caught hold of the helmsman, and said, "God Almighty, where is the ship going to?"—he was frightened—after that I heard the captain and the mate give the carpenter an order to see what water there was in the ship—the first thing we did was to clew up the sails—I have been at sea about five years; that was the right thing to do—we did not take down the topsails; we clewed them up after we got the boats out—the captain afterwards gave orders to get the topmast down to lighten the ship, to get her off from the shore—the sails were furled after we had the boats out; we clewed them before—when we furled the sails it was getting break of day—as the men were going up to furl them, the captain said, use very careful, and hold yourselves fast, that you do not fall down, "because the ship jumped so much, she was striking on the rock so hard—the forepart of the ship was on the ground, on the rocks, and the stern in the sea—the sea was strong enough to lift up the ship—there was a good sea; the sea knocked against the ship; that was what made the ship jump so much—when it jumped up it fell on the rock—that was going on constantly, all the time after the wreck—the carpenter had been drinking a little that morning—I was in the long-boat, when I got into it, I noticed that a thole-pin was broken—I was going to pull the hind oar—a bolt and hammer was first handed down to me—we tried to get out the broken pin, but could not, and we sung out to the carpenter to come down and get it out, because we thought he could understand it best—he came down, and ho could not get it out with the tools we had in the boat; he sung out to one of the boys to hand him down a gimlet or something like that, to bore it out—it was a good big gimlet, bigger than my finger—the long-boat had the anchor in her, and the jolly<lb></lb>boat was trying to take her from the side of the vessel, in order to carry her astern—I had an oar—we were all standing clear for a pull, but the first boat could not come out of the way, because it was too heavy a sea, and it was blowing too hard—everybody was in the two boats, except the captain and Jackson, who had a bad arm, and could not come down—we made a little way, but were not able to get clear—we were trying for about three quarters of an hour, or an hour—as far us I could judge, those who were in</p>

I reside at South Shields—I was for many years in the Merchant Service as a captain—I think I commanded some<lb></lb>where about thirty years—amongst other parts of the world, I have been in the habit of navigating the Baltic—it is very intricate navigation at the latter part of the year when the days are short—I have been in Court and heard the evidence as regards the course the vessel was steering; it was a correct course—supposing the vessel had not struck on the rock, but had successfully passed Ogland, the navigation becomes much more difficult between that and Cronstadt, and in my judgment would require the constant presence of the captain on deck—he would have no other opportunity for rest than he had that night—the clewing up of the sails and getting out the anchor was the proper course to pursue; I don't know of any other—I do not think it was possible to get the boats out with the heavy sea there was, with the ship's company; I mean, not with that number of hands—doing their best, I do not think they could do it—the sea would be such that it would be impossible to pull a boat to windward, even without the anchor—it appears that the ship was going seven or eight knots; therefore there must have been a strong wind to drive the ship—from the bumping up and down of the vessel as has been described, I do not think she would be long before there was a breach in her bottom; it would depend on the nature of the ground she was on—I know Stonescar island—it used to be uninhabited</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could she have gone clear fourteen or fifteen miles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is some time since I looked at the chart (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>); I should suppose she would have gone ten miles at least; she might have gone a little more—if a ship got on a reef at 4 in the morning, the first thing I should have done would be to clew up the sails; I would then make an attempt to get the anchor away—there would be no other means of getting a ship off than the way she got on—I should make that attempt by getting the boats out—I would have run a small anchor out first in the jolly-boat, if I could have got away, and fixed it—perhaps it would take longer than half an hour to clew up the sails; they would be in a state of confusion—it would depend upon the state of the weather whether they should have begun to get the boats out the moment the sails were clewed—daylight was coming on; I should think they would let the boats remain until daylight; I would have prepared for getting them out—ropes do not require much getting into order on board ship; they are always ready—the longboat would be on deck at the time the vessel struck—if the boat was not launched at once, they would prepare the oars, tholes, and such things—I should give orders to some of the officers to see that the boat was ready—whatever opinion I express would entirely depend upon the state of the wind and waves—supposing water gets into the hold; if there was any possibility of getting the vessel off I should try to pump it out—the anchor would be the first thing I should attend to; to launch the boats as soon as there was an opportunity, as soon as it was daylight; not pump—if they could not take the anchor out there would be no alternative; the ship would have to lie—I should not pump then, because it appears the water was coming in so fast—it is useless to use the pumps in some cases; if the sea was not coming in so fast then you might pump, but if it was coming in fast it would be use<lb></lb>less to attempt to pump it out.</p>

               <p>twelve to sixteen or seventeen ships—I have known Captain White from his infancy; his mother, his grandmother, and the whole family—he has always borne the character of an honourable, upright man—I know the Baltic, and I know Stonescar Island very well—there is sometimes a slight current there, but not strong—there is no rise and fall of tide—after leaving the island of Norgen, on his course towards Ogland, east half north would be as near a direct course as he could possibly steer—I think, as the wit<lb></lb>nesses have stated the wind was in the south, the captain could not have bad a better opportunity for taking a little rest than on that night, as he was going into a narrower channel after passing Ogland—the bumping up and down as described by some of the witnesses would, in my opinion, soon cause a hole in her; I should say in less than three or four hours—the pace at which she was going would indicate a good sea and wind—I have heard a description given of what the captain did; the getting out the jolly-boat and longboat, I think that was a right thing to do, as far as my judgment goes—whether they would use the pumps would depend on the number of persons there were to do it; in this case there were only twelve persons, and I think they were fully occupied the whole time in clewing the sails and getting the ropes and anchor into the boats, and such like—I don't think they would have much spare time—I think if there had been a few smacks near at hand, and forty or fifty hands, it might have done to use the pumps, but not with the number there was—the island is uninhabited.</p>

            ; she is here. I secured the door when I went to bed; I secured the door at eleven o'clock at night. There is only one door to the house; it was the wash-house that was broken open. The wash-house is part of the dwelling-house; it is under the same roof; it communicates to the rest of the house; that door was secured by two bolts and a bell. I fastened these bolts myself; I see every night that they are fastened; there are no key to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. There is not a separate door that went out of the house, is there - A. No, only the outer door of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any body else up in the house besides the maid servant - A. No; I was the last person up, and between three and four, the servant saw a light in the wash-house; she informed me that she saw a light in the wash-house. I arose, and went and fetched a constable. I did not see the prisoner: I saw a light. The constable came as fast as he could. The constable and my son took the prisoner; he was taken when I came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there were any articles taken from the wash-house - A. He was seen to take the linen out of a copper; I did not see him in possession of these things. I examined the house; there was nothing gone but what he had by him in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the yard - A. Yes, and I saw the goods that belonged to my husband in the yard; they were glass-cloths and kitchen-rubbers; eight glass-cloths, one pinafore, a round towel, seven rags, two aprons, and two knife-cloths; these I had seen in the copper the over night; when I returned I saw they were gone from the wash-house, and were out in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see how any person get into the house - A. Yes, by boring holes over the door large<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200040"></xptr>enough to admit a hand to pull the bolt back. The officer has got the things found in the yard; I shall know them when I see them.</p>

I awoke: I thought it might be between three and four; I looked round me; I saw a light in the wash-house. I got up. I saw the prisoner take some things out of the copper; I went and told my mistress of it.</p>

               <p>Q. You perceived a person take something out of the copper - A. Yes; he had a light with him. I awoke my mistress, and then my young master; I told them there were thieves in the house. My young master's name is

               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the person with the light - A. He was taking the things out of the copper I when I first saw him; when I came down I saw him again; he was taking the linen out. He took them outside of the wash-house; he was going to wring them out, to tie them up in a bundle. The constable came before my mistress, and took the prisoner in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing that was done to the door - A. I saw the way he got in, he bored a hole that was large enough to put in his hand and arm to draw back the bolts. The prisoner is the person. I shall know the things again; I examined them then.</p>

            . I was called up by the last witness. Upon receiving the alarm I went down stairs; I looked through the staircase window; I saw the prisoner with a light in his hand. I then went down stairs, and opened the street door, the outer door at the front of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the door that was unbolted - A. The wash-house door. I waited at the door till the constable came. As soon as the constable came I went round to the back of the house, where I found the prisoner in the act of wringing some of the linen that he had taken out of the wash-house. I then struck the prisoner with a stick that I had in my hand, and with the assistance of the constable I secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I did not.</p>

            . I am a Queen-square officer. I was applied to by the last witness to receive the things. On Friday the 8th, at two o'clock in the morning, I went with the last witness to the place where the robbery was done; there I found the things in a wet state at the washhouse door; some of it had been wrung, and some not. We brought them away. I examined the premises where the robbery had been done. On looking at the washhouse door there appeared to be seven or eight cuts with a centre bit, which had all been broken into one just over the top bolt, and there was one round one just over the bottom bolt, so that any person might put their finger in and pull the bolt back. I took the things away, and went to the watchhouse at Knightsbridge, where the prisoner was confined. I searched the prisoner; here is a silk handkerchief and a white apron I found upon him. I had information where he lived. I searched his lodgings the next morning; I there found tools of various sorts, such as chisels, centre bits, tools used by house-breakers. These are the articles that belong to the prosecutrix. I am sure they are the things I found in her premises.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. I understood you at first to say there was only one outer door to the house; we find now there is a door to the washhouse at the back of the house, and an outer door at the front of the house - A. Yes. The front door was fast when I came down stairs; I fastened it the over night. There is a lock to that door, a bolt, and a bar. These articles produced by Cooper are my property. They are marked, Hatchett's hotel. They were in my copper for the purpose of washing; they were in a wet state when taken away; they were washed the same night; they were safe in the copper when I went to bed. I fastened the washhouse door with two bolts and a latch. The constable left the linen some time in the the washhouse; they had not been meddled with at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing his defence.</p>

            ; I am a mantua-maker; the prisoner came to work with me the last day of March; on the Tuesday following I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I missed the muslin shirt just as she came to work; I said to her what is become of the muslin gown; she said she would own to taking that, but as to the other articles, she said she never touched them; she said she had pawned it for four shillings, and if I would let her go, she would fetch the duplicate; I then went to her lodgings, and found the duplicate of the other things; I then took her up, and found the things at Mr. Cooper's, pawnbroker, in Wych-street.</p>

               <p>She was recommended by the Jury.</p>

               <p>2nd COUNT. For feloniously uttering a like forged order for payment of money, well knowing it to be forged with the like intent.</p>
               <p>MARY DOWSON. I live in New-street, Shadwell. On the 14th of September, the prisoner came to me and asked me to be kind enough to let her have cash for this note-she told me the ship was in the London docks, and going to sail for Demerara on the Monday morning - she said, she got it from a particular friend of hers, and I might be sure of the payment - I gave her the money - the ship was not gone, it was in the London docks - she said, the young man was going away in the ship the next day, or it might be the day after - I gave her two sovereign - I went to the docks the same night, and there was no such ship there - that was on the 14th, the day I received it - there was no such person as Large in Birchin-lane - it was said no such person lived there - I could find no such person as Large - when it was not honoured, I went to her, and she said it was all right, and I should get my money - Large is the person to whom it is addressed - I could not find him at No. 6, Birchin-lane - it is a baker's shop, instead of being a broker's - nobody had told me it was a broker's, but all these notes are on brokers - I thought the note was good when I gave her the two sovereigns for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. She came by herself, did she not? A. Yes; I did not see another woman with her - she has kept a lodging-house for sailors, but not lately - I never had notes from her before, nor had any communication with her - I know she lives in my neighbourhood - I have known her a good many years by sight, but not to have dealings with her - she did not tell me she received the note from a woman - she mentioned no woman to me - she gave me the note on the 14th of September, and said the ship was to sail next morning - when the pilots came back from the ship they brought the account from the Downs - they always bring a note for the broker to pay the money - I went and found there was no such ship or broker- I found out there was no such ship that very day, by going to the docks the night I received it from her - I could not take any steps to have her apprehended till the latter end of the week following, when the pilots came from the Downs; I then went to find the broker.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150078"></xptr>Q. When you found it was all wrong, why not have her instantly taken up? A. She had a large family, and it was not till somebody else made a complaint, and her insolent tongue to me, I got a policeman and had her taken - I did not go about with her to find a woman named Hall - I gave her 2l. - the amount of the note was 2l. 5s., but these notes are never paid for a week or fortnight, or perhaps a month- I do not deal in them - if the sailors go in the ships, they are paid the same as bankers pay their notes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is a note of this sort ever paid before the person sails? A. They are given for the seamen to get their sea stock before they go - if it had been a genuine note, and I had taken it to the broker's, he would not have paid it till the ship had sailed, and the pilot came from the Downs - I did not go for a week after to find the broker - they do not pay them till they have an order from the captain from the Downs, and a certificate that the men are on board.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How many of these notes have you cashed? A. Very few - I believe she said the young man had lived with her, but she did not have a lodger then, because she had only one room - nothing was said about Mrs. Hall - I called on her at different times to pay the note, because she promised she would pay me; but she never would - she did not go out of the way - she was taken into custody on another charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told her he was a lodger of mine - she asked where the man was - I said at the King's Arms - she went there and partook of some beer and gin with the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she produce to you any young man who she said belonged to it? A. There was a young man in the public-house - she did not take me there, but I went there - she pointed out to the man from whom she said she had it; but when I told her of that months ago, she said that was not the man - he was not a seaman in appearance - she called him Henry Brown, but his name is Plumkett - he never spoke - the two sovereigns were paid in the public-house - the prisoner took it up - the man was present - she did not hand it to him; and he was not the man, for I knew him - he was a neighbour of mine - it was

            ; but I did not then know he was not the man - I knew his name - she was sitting in the public-house - I went in while she was there - a man was sitting by her - I gave her the money - she said that was her friend; but that was Henry Plunkett - I knew that at the time - I did not think she was going to deceive me - I went to the public-house, because I wanted change for a £5 note - she had told me the man of whom she had it, was in the public-house.</p>

On the 12th of October, the prisoner came and brought a bay mare - he told me he was Mr. Best's servant, and that he was stopping at Long's Hotel, in Bond-street; he brought an old bridle and saddle with the mare, and said his master had bought her of Mr. Shirley, of Staines, who had lent him the bridle and saddle to bring the mare home, and he asked me to lend him a bridle and saddle for his master to ride out with the next day; I lent them to him for his master, as I supposed - he took them away; he said his master would send me three or four more horses; he came again on the same day, and hired a horse and gig for a friend of his master's - it was brought back, but I have never been paid for it; the bridle and saddle I lent him were very good, but not new - I have never seen the mare since, but I have found the saddle and bridle at a pawnbroker's - I knew the prisoner before.</p>

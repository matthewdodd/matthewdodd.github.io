                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday, the 2nd of April, about ten o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Peckham-fields, north from Taylor's-bridge to Box-bridge—she was on the side footpath, crossing the fields, a very few yards from the canal—I said nothing to her then—I met her a second time, and said, "Good night, ma'am"—she said, "Good night, sir, good night"—she had a child at her breast—after she had passed me about five or ten minutes I heard some gentleman hallooing—I listened a moment, ran back, and when I got up the gentleman told me he thought there was somebody in the water—I turned my light on the water, and found a female there—I sang out for the drag, which was brought—I threw it in three times, and Ulrick got a boat and reached her—I and Taylor went over the other side of the canal, and pulled out the prisoner with a child lashed to her with this string—they both appeared to be dead—we took them into George Taylor's—a surgeon was sent for—they had recovered before the surgeon came—the string was tied round the child's neck, and two or three times round the prisoner's left arm.</p>

You were kind enough to say you would take him home; I have been thinking there will be much jealousy in your doing so, so I think of ending our lives in the canal, which I hope if George will not see us when alive, he will see us when dead, and hope you will bury us both together, me and my darling boy. I hope you and all my friends will pardon my sins. I am praying, and trying to seek repose in the bosom of God, which I have in vain sought for on earth; my own folly has brought me to this unhappy death. I hope you will think no more of me, but pray that my sins may be forgiven me, and that we may meet again in the next world. I hope you will forgive me. I hope you will all live happy together, my dear sister, you and George. Your dutiful daughter—<hi rend="smallCaps">REBECCA RUMBALL</hi>."</p>

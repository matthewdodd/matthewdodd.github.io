On the 8th of November last Henry Dunn was my servant, he had lived ten weeks with me; I discharged him that night. Next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I found my house broken open and robbed. I examined my premises, and found a covered cart, which was usually placed in the mews (which was at the back of my finishing shop), drawn up immediately under the door; above the door there were marks of the footsteps of one person; the windows of the finishing shop(which is immediately opposite the mews door looking into the back-yard), were open, which led me to suppose they had got over the roof of the finishing shop-the lock of the mews door was forced inside, and the bolts drawn. On a bench in the finishing shop, I found some bags of copper. I think they must have got in by getting over the roof of the finishing shop. By getting on the cart a person may lay hold of the water-pipe, and so get on the roof, then over two roofs, and drop down to a window, which looks into the finishing shop. I found this window open-it had been painted the day before. There were the footsteps of one person coming in; they would then be in the finishing shop. When he got in he must have forced the locks, drawn the bolts, and let the others in. I found three bags and a pile of copper on the bench, which had been left in the store-room the night before-the bags were not mine, the copper was. The store-room, where it was taken from, is part of my dwelling-house; the only way to the finishing shop is through my own yard. The store-room door was locked as usual. There were marks about, which shewed me the way they had gone. They must have dropped from the finishing shop into the yard, and got into the house by the sky-light, which has no fastening. On a sand-heap, under that skylight, there was the impression of two knees of a person who had worn corderoy breeches. Immediately opposite the sand-heap is the door of the time-keeper's room, where some things had been disturbed-the keys of the store-keeper's room bung there; they could be got at, and the doors opened. The lock of the time-keeper's room, which is part of the dwelling-house, had been forced open and shut again. I missed my umbrella and several things of Mr. Cox's, who lodge with me. I apprehended Dunn, and he made some discoveries to me.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK COX, ESQ. I occupy the first-floor in Mr. Phillips's house. I was not at home at the time of the robbery - I came home the next day, and missed all my clothes; five coats, one great coat, three pair of boots, and several silver spoons, a silver mug, a tea-caddy, and several other things.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Phillips. I got up at half-past seven o'clock, found the house broken open, and alarmed Mr. Phillips.</p>
               <p>HENRY DUNN. I lived ten weeks with Mr. Phillips. I left him on Saturday evening, and went under the Piazzas in Covent-garden, to Bellshaw's public-house, expecting to meet the prisoners. They were not there. I came out, and waited under the Piazzas a minute or two, and saw them come from New-street. Summers said he had been looking for me, and asked, is all right? I said, I believe it is. He asked if I had any money - I said I had. He said he had been nippered three times, at Chelsea, that day. I went into Bellshaw's, and gave them a pint of beer-it was about half-past seven. We then went to Summers's house, in Charles-street, Drury-lane. They asked me to lend them some money. I went down to the parlour, which is a cook-shop, and got 3s. worth of victuals, and took it to them. We left there about ten o'clock, and returned to Bellshaw's, where we met a man named Shannon; he asked me what screws (which means a skeleton key) would do, and shewed me one; I said I thought it was too small; he said, never mind, he would try it; it was to open the door with. We had been talking about entering the prosecutor's house on the Thursday before; it was about eleven o'clock in the day. I was with Summers at Shannon's, in Vine-street, Chandos-street, and we staid there from half-past nine in the morning till nine at night; and the next day I was with Summers from eleven to one o'clock, in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at Bellshaw's on the Saturday evening? - A. I and Summers went to a person in Vine-street, at an old iron-shop, to get a bag to put the property in; we got six sacks and a dark lanthorn there; the largest sack would hold about a bushel and a half; we hid them in Covent-garden, and went to Bellshaw's again; it was about half-past ten; we staid there drinking till about a quarter after twelve. Shannon said, it is a quarter after twelve, will you go? we all went. Summers and Knight walked together, and I and Shannon; we went to the back part of Mr. Phillips's house, up the mews. Shannon asked me which was the way to get in; I directed him to get up the spout; he climbed up the stable door, but could not get up; we got a cart from the mews, and lifted him up; he got on the roof, and came through and opened the door leading from the finishing room; he forced the lock back; we all three went in. Shannon took the dark lanthorn, and Summers looked round, and saw some ornaments; I told him there was some copper below; he asked how we were to get out; he got down into the yard by the water-butt, and let us out of the door into the yard; we walked along; he asked how we were to get down; he got down by the sky-light in the yard into the foundery; I followed him down; I directed him into the window of the time-keeper's room, and followed him; he got in, and forced a lock back; we then got into the passage of the kitchen; I shewed him the metal-room; he tried his skeleton key, it would not open the door; he returned into the time-keeper's room to look for something to force it; on looking round, he saw the keys hanging up, and said, here is a screw; he tried it; it was the key of the door; we went in, and let Summers and Knight in through the kitchen, out of the yard; we left Summers in possession of the door to whistle if any body came; we three went into the store-room, and filled four sacks with each ten pieces of copper; Knight tied them up; they carried these sacks into the finishing shop; while we were filling them, Shannon asked me what was up stairs; I told him I did not know; he asked if any body lodged there besides my master, and if he was worth property; he said he would go and try; he and Summers went up, and brought down an umbrella, a tea caddy, and a pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030012"></xptr>pantaloons; he ran across the yard to me; I said I should be off, that the gentleman must be in his bed-room; he asked for a sack - We emptied the largest, and gave it to him; he and Knight went up, and came down with it full - I did not know what was in it till it was emptied at Mr. Woolf's, in Bell-yard-there was six or seven coats, about eight pair of pantaloons, eight waistcoats, a great coat, stockings and drawers, a tea-caddy, and an umbrella. Shannon and Knight fetched a coach; we took the clothes away, and left the copper. The coach passed by three doors; Shannon came and said, bring it out - I said I would not carry any thing; Shannon saw the watchman speaking to the coachman; Knight took the sack, and threw it into the coach with the umbrella and things. I got on the coach-box in Drury-lane - We drove to Phillips's, in Wych-street, and then took it to Woolf's, in Bell-yard, Templebar; we got there about two o'clock-he was up ready to receive us; we got 6l. for the clothes. I had known Summers six months, and Knight about four days.</p>

I had seen Dunn and the others at our house several nights before; I remember Knight being with him that night; I can hardly recollect whether the other prisoner was there or not - I am sure Knight was there, in company with Dunn; they went away together; the last time I saw them was about twelve o'clock.

               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS re-examined. The kitchen is on the second floor; I do not think they went further than Mr. Cox's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the account which Dunn had given appear to be true as to the manner in which the robbery was committed? - A. Perfectly so; it corresponds with the observations which I made.</p>
               <p>SUMMERS'S Defence. Dunn came to my father's on Thursday morning, and asked me to rob his master's house; I said I did not like to do any thing of the kind; he said he would bring the copper out, and I should take it away; I refused; he asked me again on Friday - I refused; I met him and Knight at Bellshaw's on Saturday night; he asked me again - I refused to have any thing to do in it, and left there about a quarter before ten; he said he could get others to go; I did not see him again till Tuesday evening, when we were taken.</p>
               <p>KNIGHT'S Defence. I was coming through the Piazzas; I went to drink with him; he asked me to rob his master - I refused, and left him; on Tuesday night I met him again.</p>

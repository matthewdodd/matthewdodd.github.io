                  </hi>. I am a brewer, and am in partnership with Henry Lar<lb></lb>chin and Henry Smith, at Ratcliff-cross—the prisoner was in our service—it was his duty to receive money, collect orders, and to account to me for the money he received—he had an allowance of ten per cent, and twopence in the pound for expenses—there is no commission remaining due to him on any monies that he has paid—he has never accounted to me for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Scott, on the 20th of Sept.—on the following day I learned he had received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I asked him the reasons he had not paid it, with other money he had paid on the Wednesday—he said he had not enough by 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would bring it on Saturday—he promised to call with it—I did not see him afterwards—he has never accounted to me for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., received from Mr. Glass on the 21st and 23rd of Sept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you make any inquiry whether he had received these two sums? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not an opportunity of doing so—I did not see him afterwards—he solicited us to employ him—we did not go to him—there was no writing executed between us—I told him he ought to keep a book to enter the money, and, in fact, he had a book when he brought the first money—he was to pay me once or twice a week—not less than once a week cer<lb></lb>tainly—there was an understanding about that.</p>

I received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him through Cook, and that he balanced with me on the 20th of Sept.—here it is in the book—I had received the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him before that, and we balanced it on that day—I do not know what period of the supply of goods this 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ran over—I asked him about this 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Thursday the 21st—I think I have not stated that it was several days after—I believe I said it was the next day—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Scott's ran over a period of a fortnight—we never settled with Mr. Scott at all—it was a running account—it was on the 21st that I received an account that he had received money—I do not know whether he remained at home from then till the 10th of Oct.—we sent for him two or three times—we sent Mr. Cook, and I believe he saw him—I never was at his house but once, that might be on the 26th—I believe in answer to that call we had a letter—we let the prisoner be at large two or three days after that—we consulted our attorney—here is a small paper on which I settled an account—here is 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. poundage to the cus<lb></lb>tomer, and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his expenses—it is not marked expenses—it is my writing—the last I received was this 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about the 18th of Sept.—I did not swear it was the 20th—the balance was settled on the 20th—it was on the 18th be paid that 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Cook has the memorandum that he received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Collins, Mr. Cook, and Mr. Larchin, used to receive money on account, as well as I did—I was not present when the prisoner was taken—he did not claim a commission on such beer as we sold to customers whom he had intro<lb></lb>duced—he did not say, that after he got an order or two, instead of sending him I went myself—we have furnished beer to Mr. Lane, since he introduced him to us, to the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have received 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Curtis—I do not believe the prisoner had anything to do with Mr. Beal—I think we have received 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Scott—we have not received 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Jones—there is an account—I am sorry to say that we have not received 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Miller, there is not 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due—he received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe there in 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from Mr. Glass.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

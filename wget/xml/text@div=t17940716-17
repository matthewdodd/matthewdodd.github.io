On the 2d of June, I had fifty guineas in gold, and ten pounds in silver; I had placed it in a room that I kept locked, in a drawer, and had the key in my pocket, and the door was shut when I went out at ten o'clock in the morning; I returned again to my house about five minutes after twelve; but I did not miss the money till I returned from my dinner near one; I then went up to my room, and found the door broke open, and my money gone.</p>

               <p>I am the daughter. On the 2d of June, my father went out about ten; after he went out Pitshold came and knocked at the door; my father had locked the front door and taken the key with him; I looked through the key hole and saw him perfectly; this was almost immediately after my father was gone, I should imagine he could hardly have got out of the buildings; I spoke to him through the key hole, told him my father had gone out and taken the key with him, and desired him to go round to the back door, and I would go and speak to him. Payne and Pitshold came to me before my father went out, to the front door; I see them both and spoke to them, they came to invite me to go a walking with them; and I rather objected to it; but they insisted on it in an agreeable manner; and I desired them to wait for me about a quarter of an hour, and then I would go; they agreed to go to the public house close to the Hospital, in Pitfield street, and there they were to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160030"></xptr>wait for my coming. Immediately after my father was gone Pitshold came back to me to the front door, and I desired him to go round to the back door; when I opened the back door I asked him where his brother was? Which was Payne; he said he had left his brother waiting at the public house, at the Queen's Head I understood; I told him I was not quite ready. I look upon it at the time I went out it was near eleven o'clock; it was about half an hour after my father had left the house or better.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out did you lock the door? - Yes, I am perfectly sure of that, and put the key into my left hand pocket. When we came out instead of turning to the right, the way to the Queen's Head, he turned to the left hand; then I observed to Pitshold, what do you go that way for? He said, they had had a pint of porter at the Queen's Head and they did not like it, and he had sent Payne on to the White Swan; we went to the White Swan, Payne was not there; I look upon it we stayed there an hour or an hour and a half, waiting for Payne; he came at last, in about an hour or an hour an I a half; when Payne came in he asked whether we had any thing to drink? Pitshold answered we had had something; Payne complained that he was sick; and we took a walk altogether. I returned back to the Hospital the next morning.</p>

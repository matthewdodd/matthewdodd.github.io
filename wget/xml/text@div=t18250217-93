               <p>JOHN FRANCIS THEBEAUDIER. (Through an interpreter.) I live in John-street, Spitalfields. On the 16th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18250217-93-crimeloc543">Brick-lane</placeName>

I had two sovereigns and some silver. I gave her money to fetch a candle; she did not come back, but another woman came into the room in about ten minutes, and said the first one had run away, and I must pay her - another woman then came in, and demanded money for the room; she did nothing to me, but another came in, and she robbed me - that is the woman (the prisoner Perkins;) she took it out of my waistcoat, which was on the table: the male prisoner was there, and she passed the money to him. I was on the bed with the third woman at that time. I saw two the sovereigns in the man's hand. I was quite sober.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prosecutor about one o'clock in the morning - he took me to a house. I took two girls to the watch-house, to whom he had given money - I then went back and took the two prisoners, who he said had robbed him. He stated that the woman took the money, and gave it to the man, they both denied it - they were in the room when I took the first two, but I could not understand the prosecutor at first.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Tagg. Did you go to her in the prison? - Yes; but she said nothing about guineas, nor any thing else; I only wanted to know what she wanted; says-she, not to appear against me, or you will hang me; I said, I have nothing to say to you, Bett; I did not know her before.</p>

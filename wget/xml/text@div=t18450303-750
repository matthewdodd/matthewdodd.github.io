                  </hi>. I live in Gibraltar-walk, and am a cork-cutter—the prisoner was in my employ. On the 20th of Jan. I gave him twenty-three gross of corks to take out to sell for me—he was to bring me back the corks or the money—he returned the same afternoon, and said he had sold them to Rowley and Dellmore, in Castle-street—that it was not convenient for them to settle, but the first time I went that way I was to call, and they would settle—satisfied with the respectability of the firm, I let it remain—the prisoner demanded his commission, and I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that after<lb></lb>noon.</p>

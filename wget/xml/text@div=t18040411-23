               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. At the great gate that leads into the yard; I went up immediately to Mr. Hargrave's, and told him there was certainly somebody in the warehouse; he told me to call his men up; I went, and called the men up; they got up, and they all came down stairs together; Mr. Hargrave came down stairs, and unlocked the warehouse-door; we went into the warehouse, there were the two prisoners standing by the window; they had the sash up, if possible to 
make their escape out, but they could not; then the ostler secured one of them, and the other man belonging to Mr. Hargrave pricked the tall one, his name is Barnett, on the left shoulder; he begged for his life; he said, behave like gentlemen to us, and we will surrender as prisoners; accordingly they did; we bound their arms behind them, and brought them to the watch-house.</p>


               <p>Q. Which way had they got into this warehouse? A. They got in at the great gate; they forced the spring-lock at the great gate with an iron crow; the warehouse door is under the gateway; they unlocked the warehouse door.</p>

I am housekeeper to Mr. Daniels, who keeps a receiv<lb></lb>ing house for letters in King-street, Covent-garden—I sometimes attend to assist in that—I remember, on 21st July, making up the dispatch for the 2 o'clock collection; there were thirty-two letters—I tied them together in a bundle, and put them on the counter—it is a stationer's shop—at the time I was making up the bundle a man came in, and asked if there was any letter at our place directed to J. H.—such letters are kept just behind one of the counters—there are two counters in the shop—I had to look for such a letter, and that slightly took off my attention from the bundle of letters—I did not find the letter, and told him so—he then asked for the second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to look at—I gave it him—whilst he was look<lb></lb>ing at it, a woman came in for a penny postage stamp, and another man came in close behind her; he wanted a "London Journal"—he took it him<lb></lb>self from the counter, paid me, and went out; the woman left after him—the first man was still standing there; he did not remain half a minute after the other had gone out—about seven minutes after these persons had left the shop, I missed the bundle of letters—I had not had any other cus<lb></lb>tomer in the shop in the interval—a Mr. Cutler came in before the two men came—the first man was there while Mr. Cutler was there—Mr. Cutler came in with a letter, which he wanted me to include in the bundle—I did so—at that time the bundle was safe—after that was done, Mr. Cutler went away, and then the other went—I do not remember either of those men that came in, so as to speak to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, York-terrace, Albany-road, Old Kent-road, with my father and mother; I am sixteen years of age. On Tuesday, 22nd July, I was at Charing-cross, near Buckingham-court, about 12 o'clock in the day—I saw the prisoner Thomas there—I had seen him before, several times—I had seen him in the Albany-road; he asked me if I wanted a situation—this was by the Admiralty—I had gone on there from Buckingham-court—he stopped me there, and asked me if I wanted a situa<lb></lb>tion—I said, "Yes "—he asked me if I would go and change a cheque—I said, "Yes"—he asked me if I knew Coutts's—I said I did—he said if I would make haste, he would get me a situation, and peak as if he had known me a long while—he mentioned the name of Mr. Robertson—he pointed over the way to Whitehall-place, and said it was where the door was open—he then gave me the cheque in a piece of paper, and I put it into my pocket—I then left him—he told me I was to get it <hi rend="italic">short;</hi> that I was to take it to Mr. Robertson, his <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>, if he was not there, and give</p>

               <p>it to him—he said <hi rend="italic">short</hi> meant notes—he pointed out the place where I was to take it, in Whitehall-place, No. 22, I understood him—I then went to Coutts's, I presented the cheque to one of the clerks there—they kept me there about a quarter of an hour, and then the clerk wrote on the cheque "Ordered not to pay "—he, afterwards, gave it to me again—I took it, and went out, and went to Whitehall-place, where the prisoner had pointed out—I knocked at the private door, and a footboy came to the door—I inquired for Mr. Robertson, and he said he did not know any such name—I went next door, there was a door open, and a lot of names written up in the door way—I did not see the name there, so I came out, and crossed over the road to No. 2, thinking that might be the place—I went in there; there was a man having his dinner in the hall, and I asked him, and he said I was to go over to No. 22—I went over there, and saw Thain, the detective officer—I did not know him at that time—I asked him if he knew a Mr. Robertson—he said, "It is about a cheque, is it not?" and I said, "Yes sir;" of course, thinking he was Mr. Robertson—I gave the cheque to Thain, and he and I went into No. 22 to inquire—they said there that Robertson bad been dead eight years—I was afterwards with Thain for eleven days looking after Thomas—I saw him at the corner of Fleet-street on 5th Aug., about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon—Thain was with me at the time, about two or three yards off—Hillyer was with Thomas—I went and spoke to Thain about them, and they went on, and went into an ice shop in Fleet-street—they were there two or three minutes—Thain told me to keep out of their sight—I kept away as much as I could—Thomas came out first, and went towards Temple Bar; that was when I saw him—Hillyer came out a little while afterwards—Thomas stopped all at once when he came out—I think he saw me—Hillyer came up to him—Thain kept beckoning me to keep back—I saw them talking together—Thain then came up and took them into custody—this is the cheque.</p>

I was desired to go to Coutts's bank, in the Strand, on 22nd July—I found the lad Davidson there—upon his leaving the bank I followed him—I had no communication with him before he left the bank—I do not know that he was aware that anybody was following him—he went along the Strand, down Charing-cross, and turned into Whitehall-place—he went to a house in Whitehall-place, and from that house to another, and then another—he was carrying something in his hand—I was standing on the pavement in Whitehall-place at this time—after he had gone to three houses; he asked me if I knew the name of Robertson—I said I did not—I said, "Is it about a cheque that you have been to Coutts's bank about?"—he said, "Yes, it is," and he gave me the cheque, which he had in his hand—he then gave me an account of how he became possessed of it, and gave me a description of the person from whom he said he had received it—after this it was arranged that he and I should go about the principal streets to look for this person, and we did so until 5th Aug.—in the afternoon of that day we were at the corner of Fleet-street and Bridge-street, on the south side of Fleet-street, and the lad drew my attention to the two prisoners—he said, "That is the party that gave me the cheque"—in consequence of what he said, I followed them—they went along Fleet-street, and went into an ice shop, ten or twelve doors up—they remained there about three or four minutes—Thomas came out first, and turned towards Temple-bar—he stopped a little, and then Hillyer came out, and walked towards St. Paul's—he afterwards turned round, and joined Thomas</p>

               <p>—I do not know where the lad was when Thomas stopped; I told him to go away out of sight, but to keep sight of me—when Hillyer joined Thomas I saw them talking together—upon that I went up and took them into cus<lb></lb>tody—I said, "Gentlemen, I wish to speak to you over at the station house"—they said nothing at that time—I took them over to the station—I then told them that I charged them with stealing a bundle of letters of letters from the Post-office receiving house, in King-street, Covent-garden—Thomas said, "I know nothing at all about it"—Hillyer said, "I am sure I don't; I should like to see my solicitor"—the station sergeant asked them their names and addresses—they refused to give them—I think they said, "We decline giving any address "—I afterwards got from them the names of George Thomas and Henry Hillyer—they did not give any address—I searched Thomas, and found on him a duplicate, a key, and a penny; I did not search Hillyer—I learned from Davidson that his parents lived at No 8, York-terrace, Albany-road, Camberwell—I found Hillyer's residence to be No. 24, St. Mary's-square, Kennington—Thomas's mother lives at No. 2, Paragon-place, New Kent-road—I have not been there—that is about ten or twelve minutes' walk from the Albany-road—it is in the same neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. Mary's-square, Kennington. I have known the prisoner Thomas about twelve mouths—I knew him by the name of Harrington—I lived with him during that time, by that name—I have known Hillyer the same time—I knew him by the name of Thesiger—he was called Harrington also; I never heard him called Hillyer during the time I have known them—they have been frequently together at my lodging and at other places—I saw them together on the morning of 5th Aug.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City of London. On the day the prisoners were taken into custody I searched Hillyer—I found on him a memorandum book and a pocket handkerchief—I said to him, "What is this, before I open it?"—he said, "It is a memorandum book of my own, with a few private memorandums in it"—I afterwards found where Thomas lived, and went to the place—it was No. 27, John-street, Blackfriars-road—I found Ellen Harrington there—I searched there, and found a white hat, two caps, a photographic portrait of himself, thirteen letters, and thirteen duplicates—I afterwards found that Hillyer lived at No. 24, St. Mary's-square.</p>

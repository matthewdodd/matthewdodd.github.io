                  </hi> I am the wife if William Tucker, of Warren-street, Fitzroy-square. The prisoner has occupied a room in my house four years—three weeks or a month ago, in consequence of an annoyance, I went to her room—she was not there—I staid there till she came, and spoke to her of the filthy state of the room, which annoyed the house exceedingly, and begged her to clean it—she said she would, but did not—about a fortnight ago, when she was out, I went to clean the room myself, as I found she was not likely to do it—I had her boxes removed to the leads on the top of the house—a bundle was found in one of them—I untied it, and found what I supposed to be a child—I called in the police, and a beadle took it away—about three years before I had spoken to the prisoner about being in the family-way—she said she was not, and I believed her—her appearance gave me that idea—I ob<lb></lb>served no difference in her appearance afterwards.</p>

               <p>I live at Pinner, in the parish of Harrow; I lost a horse either the 22d or the 23d of July; the horse was put into the field in the evening, and he was missing the next morning; I was twenty miles from home.</p>
               <p>What sort of a gelding was it? - A brown bay gelding; we call him a bay gelding, but he is rather of a brownish colour, about fourteen hands three inches high, as near as I can tell; three years old at most, bald-faced, and either two white feet behind or one I cannot be certain; he was taken on the Wednesday, and I had him again on the Saturday; I found him at Paddington, in the custody of a man whose name is Kettle; I think it is the White Lion, but he has been sent for by order of the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Were the gates fast? - I cannot say; it is just by a school; I shut the gate after I had put the horse in.</p>
               <p>Are there more gates than one? - I cannot particularly say, because the boarders very often throw it open; I went home and told my mistress; she sent me away after it, and there was another long tailed grey colt got away along with it, and I found the grey colt about three in the afternoon in my master's field; I heard of the gelding on the Wednesday; I was looking about after it; I came home and heard how such a thing was taken in Paddington; I knew the gelding when I saw it.</p>

               <p>How do you undertake to swear to their faces, if you could not see the bald faced horse? - I was nigh the man, and could see the colour of the horse.</p>

               <p>Had they any horses with them at that time? - They had not; they had turned the horses loose on the green opposite to my house.</p>
               <p>What horses were they? - A bay horse and a black one; I followed them immediately down the green; then they were got into Black Lion Lane, and I called watchman to come along with me; I said I believed they were thieves; I took hold of Fenvell and said, you villain, you was going to steal the ass; he said he was not; says I, I believe you to be three thieves, I will see what you have got; immediately I pulled a horse-cloth from him, and it fell on the ground with some poultry in it, I believe six or seven fowls, and a shoulder of mutton, and they were taken; the horses were on the green facing my house; I never saw them with the horses.</p>

            . I took this man up, and told him he must go with me. He then turned round and saw the prosecutor, and said he had taken the sovereign, and was very sorry for it. He told me where he left the sacks. I found them at the place he represented.</p>

I told him I did receive it, and would pay him the money. He said he would see me again, and I waited for him, but he did not come.</p>

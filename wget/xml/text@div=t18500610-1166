                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Stimpson. I arrived at the Shoreditch station, from Chelmsford, on Tuesday, 11th June, about ten o'clock—I called a porter to take my luggage to the omnibus—while there, I was pushed about by two persons; and when I was going to get into the omnibus, I found a man's hand in my pocket—I turned round, and it was the prisoner—I said, "You good-for-nothing fellow, you are robbing me"—he had his hand in my pocket when I spoke to him—I laid hold of his hand, and the porter came up, and laid hold of him—at that time he had got his hand out of my pocket—the officer came up, and took him—I emptied my pocket, and found a half-crown and two sixpences were gone—one half-crown and two shillings were left—I had had it all safe when I left Chelmsford, at ten minutes before nine—no one had sat near me in the train when I came up.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What train did you come by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The third-class train—my mother was with me, and several ladies and gentlemen were there—I did not get out at any station—I felt my money at Chelmsford station, where I paid my fare—I had nothing else in my pocket but my handkerchief, and that I had not taken out all the way—I paid two half-crowns for my fare, which I took out of my right-hand pocket, the same pocket the handkerchief was in—the handkerchief did not come out at the same time—no one sat by the side of me in the train—my mother sat opposite me—when I was turning to get into the omnibus, I found the prisoner's hand in my pocket; I took hold of him—I had a baby in my arms—the prisoner and his companions pushed me about—the omnibus-man did not interfere—I mentioned before the Magistrate about the prisoner's companions—I believe it was taken down—the deposition was read over to me, and I signed it—I named to the Magistrate that there was another man with the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read, did not state that the prisoner had any companion</hi>)—I named it—he is the man that robbed me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter to the Eastern Counties Railway. I was on duty on the night of 11th June—I took Mrs. Stimpson's luggage up to the omnibus—I observed the prisoner and another young man by his side—I thought he was waiting to take a seat—after I had put the luggage on, Mrs. Stimpson went round to get in, and the prisoner followed her round—she said, "This man is robbing me"—I instantly collared him, took him on the platform, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-inspector at the railway-station. I took the prisoner—I asked him his business—he told me he was going to Romford—I found nothing on him but &amp; handkerchief when I searched him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

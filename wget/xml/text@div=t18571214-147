                  </hi>. I am a plumber, painter, and glazier, of No. 4, Maddox Place, Greenwich Road. On 5th Dec. I left my shop, and went into the parlour at a little before 10 o'clock, and had just taken my seat when I saw the prisoner enter the shop, and take some brushes and a glazier's diamond off the counter—in rising from the table I stumbled against a chair, which prevented my getting on as fast as I ought, and by the time I had got to the street door he had gone—he pulled the door to after him, and got twenty yards from my house—I had a loose coat on, the pocket of which was torn behind, and my pocket book, containing a number of papers and letters, flew out, and a person who was coming along the road, facing the prisoner, picked it up while I went in pursuit of him—I lost sight of him in turning round to look for my pocket book, but saw him four or five minutes afterwards, within twenty yards of where I had been standing looking for him—he had made his way to Deptford Bridge, and Matthews, who had picked up my pocket book, showed him to me—we secured him, and I said, "Where are my brushes?"—he said, "I know nothing about them"—I took him into custody—about half an hour after I had been at the Police Court a young girl came to my shop and offered the brushes for sale.</p>

                  </hi>. On 5th Dec. I was going down Greenwich Road, about a quarter before 10 o'clock, and saw Mr. Wilkinson running after the prisoner—he passed me, and his pocket book and papers flew out of his pocket—I picked them up—I was present when the prisoner was taken, and am sure he is the same person that Williams was running after when</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live in Ryder-court, Leicester-square. On the 5th of June I met the prisoners by Coveot-garden market—they asked me to go with them, I refused, they then asked me to treat them with a glass, which I did—I went out—they followed and asked me to give them another glass at another house, which I did, and went with them to a house, which they took me. to, to a bed-room—there was a bed and a sofa—they asked me to go to bed with them—I said, they might go to bed, I would go on the sofa—I undressed myself on the sofa, I felt my purse in my fob where I had placed it, and went to bed—I had eleven sovereigns and a half in gold in it—I had been three or four minutes in bed speaking to Wellington, when I found Walker searching my purse in my fob—I immediately jumped off the bed, and said, "You have robbed me"—she said, "Oh no, sir"—I took my trowsers and said, "Where is my puree?" and I found it in the other pocket, not where I had put it, with 11 sovereigns and a half-sovereign gone—I was exasperated—when I was in bed I saw Walker searching my pockets—I saw my purse in her hand—she was hastening as much as she could, when I ran to her and told her she was robbing me—I said, if they would not give me back my money immediately I would call the police—they were whispering together at the head of the bed by this time—I again said I would call the police, when Walker handed me two sovereigns, and said, "There is your money, you fool"—I said, "You have nine or ten still, hand them back"—I several times called to the people of the house, and at last an old woman came—I said I had been robbed, and she began to abuse me in every way possible—I dressed myself, went out, and watched at the street-door for some time—at last I met a policeman and told him I had been robbed, and pointed out the house to him—he knocked with his stick at the door and went up stairs with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 5th of June I took the prisoners into custody—I did not search them—I searched the room, but found nothing but a few shillings in silver lying on the table—it was about five o'clock in the morning when I went to the room—the prisoners were both in bed then—they said they had no pockets on—a female searched them at the station—I did not propose to search them myself.</p>

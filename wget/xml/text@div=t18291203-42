I saw the prisoner take the cloak from his shop, about six o'clock in the evening of the 14th of November - he ran away, and another with him; the prosecutor sent the Police-man after him - I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. No - it was dark, but there were four or five gas-lights in the window; a person could take the cloak without going in, by putting in their hand- I did not see him for more than a minute - there was another waiting for him; I saw them together - the other went in, and the prisoner took it.</p>

               <p>CHARLES CLIFT. I keep this shop - I heard a rustling at my door, and ran out; a boy told me a man had taken it - I ran a few paces, saw a Police-man, and told him; he brought it back, with the prisoner - this is it.</p>
               <p>EDWARD DRURY. I am a Police-officer. I received notice, and pursued in the direction; I saw the prisoner and another crossing to the other side of the street - I followed them; they looked, and saw me coming - they ran, and dropped the cloak; I took it up, and still pursued till the prisoner was apprehended - they were so near together I cannot say which dropped it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had they turned any corners? A. They turned one, but it was very wide; the lamps had been lighted - the other person was rather taller than him; there was no alarm, but what I made myself when they dropped the cloak - I was some distance from the shop when I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

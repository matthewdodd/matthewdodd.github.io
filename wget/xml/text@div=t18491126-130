It was part of the prisoner's duty to pay the wearers—he kept a book to enter the sums paid—I supplied him with the money—he kept it in a desk, of which he had the key—it was his duty to enter the money paid, in this book, called the wages or cash-book, which was cast up once a week—on 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> Sept., here is entered, by the prisoner, "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," paid to John Ogle, and "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." to Frances Williams—the last time the book was cast up, before 1st Sept., was on 25th Aug.—he then had in hand 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 1st Sept., after he bad paid all, there is a balance of 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 l/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in hand; that is, assuming that he had paid these 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

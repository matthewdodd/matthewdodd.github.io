On Saturday, the 6th, I saw the prisoner between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, go out backwards with bundle under her arm - I asked her when she came back what bundle she took out in the afternoon - she said it was her husband's shirts - I went out to a pawnbroker's, and found the prosecutrix's things there.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I received the prisoner in charge on Monday, the 8th of September, and asked her if she actually broke the box or not - I neither threatened or made her any promise - she said not - that she received the things from her mistress, a gown and shawl, and had pawned them - I went to the pawnbroker's she mentioned, and found the things - the pawnbroker gave them to me to-day.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the habit of pawning things for Mrs. McClean for three weeks successively - I did not know but it was her own property when she gave it to me- I did not like to tell her husband, because he would been her - I was in the habit of pawning things for mistress, and said they were my husband's that her husband should not know - I took the policeman to the pawnbrokers - that is the only reason I had for saying they were my husband's - I did not wish her husband to ill use her - on the Sunday she gave me her ear-rings out of her ears to pawn, and I pawned them - I did not know but this was her property - as to the box, I never touched it - I lodged there, and slept there with my husband.</p>

             re-examined. I went with her to the pawnbrokers, and the things were produced - she came out of the room she slept in with the bundle - she slept in the same room with Mrs. Mead - I never knew of my wife employing the prisoner to pawn things to get gin - I have no reason to believe any such thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Swan public-house, Kingsland-road. The prisoner Heaps has been in my service for five months, as pot-boy—on the 13th of November I missed these things from a box in my dress<lb></lb>ing-table, in my bed-room—I had seen them safe a week previous—I asked Heaps if he ever saw the watch—he said he had not—I asked Mary, the servant-girl, if she had seen it—she said yes, Heaps had shown it to her—Heaps was present—he then owned he had seen it—I insisted for some time that he must know something of it—I promised that if he would give it up, and acknowledge that he stole it, I would forgive him—he still said he knew nothing of it—I got a policeman to the door—he then called me, and said he would take me to where it was—he took me to the prisoner Style's, a short distance from the house, in Mill-lane, I believe it was called—I called Styles up—I did not say any thing to him myself—I let them go a short distance off—they took us to a man of the name of Wolfe—I do not know where he lived—It was in Hoxton—one of them knocked at the door, and asked for Wolfe—the wife would not open it at first—Style told her his name, and then the door was opened—they said they came for a watch—I cannot say which it was said that—I believe he said a watch—she said "What watch?"—they said a watch that her husband had got—one of the prisoner then asked it Wolfe was at home—she said, "Yes," and they went in to see Wolfe—one of them asked Wolfe for the watch—I believe it was Style—Wolfe said, "What watch?"—he said, "A gold watch"—he said he knew nothing about it—after that one of the prisoners said, "D—n it, you know you have got the watch; give it up, it will be all right"—I really do not know which said this—Wolfe said he should not give up the watch, unless the other Style was there—we them went to call John Style up, and went with him to Wolfe's—I waited out<lb></lb>side—I had two policemen outside, who afterwards went in, and the watch was produced—the key-ring and seals ere gone—I asked Heaps where the key and ring were—he said he had lost them—I am sure he said that—I first of all promised to forgive him if he would give it up, but he still denied it, for some time after that—I gave him no further hopes—I told</p>

               <p>him I would give him in charge on suspicion—If he had produced the pro<lb></lb>perty I certainly should have forgive him—I have no recollection of tell<lb></lb>ing him so after the first time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Style</hi>. When he, and Mr. Ford came to my father's Ford said if the watch was produced, or we would tell him where it was, he would forgive us. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  </hi>. I live in Lam-place, Kingsland. I was at Mr. Abraham's on the Friday night when Heaps said he would take him to where the watch was—he did not say he had found it—I heard his master promise to forgive him—I went with him to Style's—when he came down they walked some distance together—I went between them, and said, "Now you had better confess where the watch is"—Style said, "You behave like a man, I will tell you where it is"—he then took us to Wolf's house—Wolfe strongly denied having it, one of the prisoners then said, "D—n it, Wolfe, give up the watch, you know you have got it, the gentleman won't hurt you"—It was then produced.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You promised forgiveness if they would give up the watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Mr. Abrahams did—I told the boy he would be for<lb></lb>given—I am not a solicitor—I said to Wolfe, "You had better give it up, I am a solicitor"—I am on the Stock Exchange—I did not advise their being taken into custody—I came out and told Mr. Abrahams that the watch was in the house, and he went in with the two policeman—I had nothing to do with the charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Style.</hi> I did not know at first what watch he meant—my father is in the watch business, and when Heaps told me it was the watch he found, I took him to where my brother sold it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner on 5th May, 1858, at the Scotch Church, Sydney, Australia—Dr. Laing officiated—I was married at Dr. Laing's house—I don't know what they constitute a church—there is no congregation held, I think, at the place where I was married—it is Dr. Laiug's private residence—I have heard of people being married at private residences—Dr. Laing, his sister, and another person were present—the form of service gone through was not exactly like the Church of England service, but similar: a long ceremony, rather longer than the Church of England service—I have never before heard the marriage service in the Scotch Church performed—the prisoner put a ring on my finger in the course of the service, and the minister then said, "Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder," and long prayers—no one gave me away—I do not think the prisoner was asked whether he would take me to be his wife—I do not remember whether the prisoner said anything when he put the ring on my finger—I lived with him after that for about six weeks in the colony, and then I went to England alone, and he joined me here some months afterwards—that was by agreement with him—when he came home the first time I was very ill, I had just got out of my confinement—he stayed with me two days, and then went a voyage; then he came back, and I joined him in London, and he came with me to my father's house, living with me as my husband—he represented himself as steward of a mail steamer—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the certificate that I received, at the time of the marriage, from Dr. Laing, immediately after the ceremony—the prisoner represented himself as a single man.</p>

I am Chief Justice of New South Wales; ordinarily residing at Sidney—there are several Scotch Cburches—the account of the marriage by the last witness would be legal according to the mode practised in the colonies, if words of present acceptance were used—a marriage by a person ordinarily officiating as a minister of religion, without any prescribed form of words, would be a marriage according to the law of New South Wales, since March, 1856; no church or place of worship being absolutely necessary—I cannot state, of my own knowledge, that Dr. Laing is a minister ordinarily officiating—I know him in a certain way—of my own knowledge, I cannot answer the question whether he is a clergyman of the Scotch Church—I never heard him preach—I never saw him officiate.</p>

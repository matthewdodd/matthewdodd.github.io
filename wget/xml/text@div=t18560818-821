                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and carry on business in North Woolwich-road, Essex. The prisoner has been in my service since 22nd February—on Saturday afternoon, 12th July, he was serving customers in my shop, and in consequence of information, I kept a watch on him—about half past 6 o'clock that evening my wife made a communication to me and I followed the prisoner from the till to the butter and cheese side of the shop—I charged him with having money in his right hand, which he had taken from my till—I requested him to open his hand and show it to me—he refused to do so—I saw he was inclined to put his hand into his pocket, which I prevented his doing—he put his hands behind him and put the money from one hand to the other—he then opened his right hand and had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180120"></xptr>
               <p>nothing in it—I then requested him to show me his left hand, which he refused—I asked him to go into a small sitting room—I then desired him to show what money he had in his hand, but he changed the money again to his right hand and opened his left—in two or three minutes afterwards he laid half a crown down on the table—the officer arrived, and I gave him into custody—he requested me not to give him into custody for the sake of his wife and family—I had looked in the till not two minutes before, and there was no half crown there and the customer was in the shop at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. On that Saturday night I examined the till just previous to the prisoner being taken—I cleared the till and there was no half crown left in it—I saw a customer come in the shop and put down a half crown—I saw the prisoner put that half crown in the till and take it out with his right hand—I made a communication to my husband and be told him of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the service of Mr. Griffiths three months. On the Saturday afternoon on which the prisoner was taken, just before Mr. Griffiths spoke to him, I saw a piece of silver taken from the till; to the best of my belief, it was a shilling—I went and told Mr. Griffiths, and just before Mr. Griffiths spoke to the prisoner, I saw another piece of silver—I did not see him take it out of the till—I saw his hand come from the till—I saw the silver passed out of his right hand into his left.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HUGGINS: I keep a horse and cart, and remove things for people that employ me. I live in Green's-court. About the 5th of February, the prisoner Smith came to me to hire my horse and cart, to move some goods; he told me to come to Hanover-square. I put the horse in the cart, and went to Hanover-square, between five and six in the evening. I stood up close to the rails of the square. Reeve came and brought me three tables, and I put them in the cart, and told me to go on. On the next day I went with my cart to the same place. Reeves brought me a card table, and a pembroke table; Reeves told me to take them to my house until the next day, and then he would send Mr. Lawrence for them. Lawrence came to me about four o'clock in the afternoon, and told me to bring the two tables to his house; and when I took the tables to his house, I met Smith by the Marsh gate. Reeves helped me to load the cart. Smith was not there at all.</p>

             . I believe the prisoner is one of the men that robbed me; I cannot swear to him; it was in the dusk of the evening, about six o'clock; I was robbed of eighteen or nineteen shillings by two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any arms?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. They had each a pistol; they clapped one to one ear. the other to the other; they damned my eyes and limbs, and bid me deliver my money; one had a long pistol the other a short one.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the long one?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. Wallis. The accomplice took my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to you when they went away?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. They d - d me a good deal; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160023"></xptr> returned it, and bid them give me something to drink, and not take all away: Wallis turned back and gave me a shilling. I met them about the middle of Notting Hill .</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass when you first met them?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. I wished them a good night; they wished me a good night as I did them; they passed me, and when I looked back they were standing still; I went on, and they followed me about two hundred and fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance did they follow you?</p>
               <p>Bowkett. I did not see them again till they put the pistols to my ears.</p>

            . Some time before the other robbery, I cannot say to the day, we had been almost to Shepherd's Bush to rob somebody; coming back by a house that used to be a brew-house, I think they call it the Dial house , about the dusk of the evening, between six and seven o'clock, we met the prosecutor; we were a-foot; we passed him; he wished us a good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Never a word; we passed him about the space of one hundred yards; then we agreed to rob him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop any time or immediately turn round?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. We stopped and hesitated, and then we agreed to follow him and rob him; we passed him under a wall by the side of the Dial house; Wallis was some yards before me; I turned round and stopped him and demanded his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or Wallis turn round and rob him?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. I myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pistols?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Yes, each one; I turned round, stopped him, presented a pistol to his breast, and demanded his money; he gave me eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your pistols both of a length?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. One was longer than the other; Wallis had the longest. When I demanded his money, Wallis came up and presented his pistol to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he present his pistol, to what part of him?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Rather towards his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any expressions when you robbed him?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Wallis d - d him, and asked him if he had any more money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say, did you swear?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. No, not at all. Wallis said, d - n you, you have more; he got nine shillings or nine shillings and sixpence; I cannot tell which; it was all we got; then we went home to Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man you robbed?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. He d - d me, and asked for a shilling to carry him home, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. To carry him home, did he say?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. To spend or to carry him home, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you taken up?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore . I have been in custody eleven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Which robbery was you taken up for?</p>
               <p>Flaxmore. Neither of them: I was taken up going along the Park, and charged with having fire arms about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of these men appear against you at Sir

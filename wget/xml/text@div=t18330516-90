            . I have come out of the prison. On the 30th of March, I was barman to Mr. Clarke, a publican of Battle-bridge; I had previous to that deposited sums of money in the Provident Institution, St. Martin's-lane - I saw the prisoner on the 30th of March, and asked him to put 5l. into the Savings'-bank for me; I gave him five sovereigns and my deposit book, and told him to tell the clerk at the bank to put the amount of interest at the bottom of the book; (looking at a book) that is the book I gave the prisoner; here is 62l. 13s. added up, neither of the sums after that amount were in the book when I gave it to the prisoner; "£5, and £2 0 0 1/2. C. Boodle, 175," have been added since; it was not there when I gave it to the prisoner - I saw him again in the evening of the 30th, between five and six o'clock; I had no conversation with him about the money that night - I asked him for the book, he said he had left it at home, and would bring it, down to me in the morning; but I did not see him again till Monday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, the 1st of April, he called for a glass of ginger-beer, which I served him with - I asked him for the book, and he gave it to me; he said nothing - I put it into my pocket being busy, without looking at it - I went to bed about half-an-hour afterwards, and then I looked at the book - it had been in my pocket from the time I received it from him; I then saw this entry of "£5, and C. Boodle, £2 0 0 1/2," at the bottom - I applied to the Provident Institution on the 20th of April, to take out all my money - I saw Mr. Morton, and showed him the book; Mr. Morton then made these figures 175 in it then; this was on a Saturday- it requires a week's notice to get the money - I applied again on the 27th of April, to receive my money, and saw a gentleman named Arnott, and produced the book to him; and in consequence of something which was said, I went with the book to Mr. Boodle at his seat in the office- in consequence of some communication I made to him, the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q.Were you not in the habit of lending the prisoner money? A. I never lent him any in my life - I could not get out to take this money myself, and got him to do it - I am certain I saw this entry the first time I opened the book after he returned it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe your master accuses you of stealing this money? A. He has done so, and the Grand Jury have found a true bill against me; I am now in custody on that charge.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Is not your master's charge for embezzling half-a-crown? A. It is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When Mr. Boodle pointed out the forgery to you, did he ask if you had given the book to anybody to bring to the institution for you? A. Yes, I said to no one but who had brought it to the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, "No, I have not?" A. I said so, but I said to no one but what had brought it to the bank - he put the question to me two or three times, and told me to be careful how I answered - he asked if I had trusted the book to anybody, and I said no; I said I had not given it to any person but who brought it to the bank; and he said, did I know the person.</p>

            . I am one of the clerks in the Provident Institution. It is a rule for people to give a week's notice before they can take money - by the books it appears that the last witness deposited several sums in our bank - I remember his applying to me on the 20th of April; he produced this book, and I marked it 175, which is the folio of the notice book, where all the sums to be drawn out are entered - I produce the notice which he signed to withdraw the money - I took down the amount as being 67l. 8s., which included the last entry of 5l. - I told him to apply that day week - the amount, when I had the book, was 67l. 8s., but a witness can explain a difference in it.</p>

            . I am ledger clerk in the Provident Institution. On the 27th of April, I recollect the prosecutor applying to me for payment of his money - it is part of my duty to compare the amounts in the ledger with the pass-book - this is the book produced by Jutsum; the entry 5l., and 2l. 0s. 0 1/2d., were there when he produced it- in consequence of suspicion, I sent Jutsum to Mr. Boodle's desk - the notice for 67l. 8s., arises from the amount of interest not being entered on the 9th of February, when 10l. had been paid in - the entry of 2l. 0s. 0 1/2d., is an irregular entry, it is incorrect whoever made it.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BOODLE, ESQ. I am auditor of the accounts of the Provident Institution, and am a barrister. The prosecutor was brought to my part of the office on the 27th of April, by Mr. Arnott - It is my duty when deposits are made, to enter them in a book of my own, and sign my name to the deposit-book - this signature to the 5l. entry is not in my hand-writing - this is a pass-book; the entry 5l., purports that 5l. was paid in by Jutsum, on the 10th of March; it purports to be a receipt by me on account of the institution, of 5l., from him, which, if correct, we should have paid on application - here is "30th March, 1833, 5l." - that is not in the hand-writing of anybody authorised to make the entry - the signatures before that are in my hand-writing, but not the amounts - the Duke of Somerset's name is

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it the last signature in the book which you say is not yours? A. Yes, all the other signatures are mine; nobody is authorised to sign my name - the managers attend at the office, but then they attest payments by their own signatures.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When Jutsum was brought to you, did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160052"></xptr>ask if he had given the book into any other person's hands to bring? A. I asked if the book had been in any other person's hands; he answered no, two or three times - my impression was, that he thought I was asking if he had left it in any person's hands; I repeated the question, and he said he had never parted with it, except to the party who had brought it the last time.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. In consequence of information which I received, I took the prisoner into custody on the 29th of April at Battle-bridge - I told him Mr. Clarke's young man had got himself into trouble, and that he had brought his name in question; I said he must go before a magistrate and account for it; he seemed confused, and his father asked him if he was going on business - he said, "Yes, it is bad business."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him how his name was brought in question? A. I said it was with respect to 5l. - his father asked what it was about, and asked him, and he said it was respecting the 5l. he had of Mr. Clarke's young man - his father said, "If that is all I think we can make it right" - I don't think he made any reply - I then took him into custody - I cautioned him not to say anything, if he did I should take notice of it - before I brought him out of the house; but on the way to the office he said, "I see what this business is, it is a forgery" - I said, yes, you have acted very foolishly indeed, and if you had spoken to the young man about the circumstance I think it would not have come to this - he said he had met Jutsum several times but never had fortitude enough to tell him the circumstance, or otherwise he thought it would have been better - I searched him, and found a piece of writing-paper on him, which he said was his hand-writing, but afterwards denied it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure what he said was not "If it is a forgery it will be a bad job for Jutsum?" A. No, he did not, nor anything to that effect.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say you mentioned to him something about 5l., and he afterwards said, it was about 5l. of Clarke's young man which got him into trouble - did anything occur between those two statements to give him any knowledge that was the 5l. referred to? A. No, he appeared to be aware of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him Clarke's young man had got into trouble about 5l.? A. I said Clarke's young man had got into trouble, and his name was brought in question, and he must account for it before the magistrate - he asked me what it was about; I said, respecting 5l. - he told his father it was about 5l. which he had had from Clarke's young man - he said nothing about the money being lent to him.</p>

My school-room is in a house in the garden, which was formerly a dwelling-house. The upper room is a school-room. There is a staircase leading to it from my garden. On the 17th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I found a square of glass had been broken in the door, and some books stolen from the the desk which is near the door. The door was not opened. A female servant went into the room before me, she is not here. I saw every thing safe at half-past eight o'clock - it was then dark.</p>

            . I am watchman of Spitalfields. On the 17th of March, at a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Wentworth-street with a bundle under his arm - the day was just breaking. It was three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's house. He said to me</p>
               <p>"Watchman, can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120023"></xptr>you tell me where there is a cook-shop?" I said, what bundle is that? He said, a bundle of clothes. I took it from him - he then said a bundle of books. I asked him where he had brought them from? He said from Hackney, and was going to take them to Stepney, and they were his own. As I was taking him to the watch-house he ran away, and hid himself in a house. Another watchman brought him out. I am sure he is the person.</p>

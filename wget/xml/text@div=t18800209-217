                  </hi>. I live at 2, Hancock Road, Bromley-by-Bow, and am retired from business—I was by trade a carpenter—on Wednesday afternoon, 12th August last, about 10 minutes to 5, I was walking in High Street, Bromley—four men came forwards; the first one snatched at my watch, and tore it off and took it, and I was knocked over in the mud and a good deal injured; I was hurt a good deal on the left side—they kicked me a good deal—one of the men, named Marchant, has been convicted at this Court; he was the man that took away my watch—I swore to him, but as to the other three I could not identify them—I could not swear to the prisoner being one of them—the man that took my watch was in front; the other three were behind—I have got my watch back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I could not positively say that I saw you there, but I believe you were one of them, from the circumstance that one of the party had on a white jacket, and the policeman said you were the only party that had on a white jacket.</p>

At 4.30 on 12th August I was in High Street, Bromley, in company with R 610—I saw four men; the prisoner is one of them—they were about seven yards this side of the corner of the Seven Stars in High Street; we were keeping observation upon them—as the prosecutor came round the corner from Si Leonard Street they all four instantly set upon him, and forced him to the ground, and stole his watch, but at the time I did not see what they took; they seemed to take their departure as soon as possible down St. Leonard Street—I am positive the prisoner was one of the four men—I caught Marchant, and he has been convicted—the prisoner was brought to the station on the 18th January for not answering as an expiree—I have known him well by sight for about 12 months—he had on a white jacket—he ran away.</p>

I was on duty with Phillips on the afternoon of 12th August, and saw the prisoner there in company with three others; I knew him before—I saw all four take hold of the prosecutor round the neck—he raised his stick, in the attitude of striking one, when he was knocked to the ground—I did not see anything done to him when he was on the ground—I and Phillips ran and I caught Wood, and Phillips caught Marchant—the prisoner got away; he had on a white jacket—I am positive of him; I have known him for the last four years.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday the 19th of February I attended with the search warrant; Mr. Champion and Miss Champion were present; I went to No. 6. Tabernacle walk; they had a shop and a little back room. I read the warrant; then I asked if she had any property in her possession belonging to Mr. Champion; she said none at all; there was a piece of carpet mentioned among other things, I saw it lay on the floor of the back room; Miss Champion believed it to be theirs; a copper was standing on the fire in the back room. Miss Champion believed that to be their property, they had lost such a one. Bishop took a blanket and sheet out of the bed. Miss Champion knew that the prisoner seemed confused, I did not think it prudent to ask her any more questions. In the two rooms the prisoner occupied I found all the articles.</p>

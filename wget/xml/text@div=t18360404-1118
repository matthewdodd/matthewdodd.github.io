                  </hi>. I live in New-street, New-cut. On the 28th of March I had been to Deptford, and on returning I stopped at the king's Arms, in the Old Kent-road—it was about a quarter before eleven o'clock at night—I got off the coach at the door of the King's Arms, and went in to meet my husband—I had been to Deptford to fetch a rabbit, but I did not bring it, as it was a very wet night—as I was going into the King'hesaw thesaw the prisoner and two other men—I went into the King's Arms, and my husband was not there; and as I was coming out again, the prisoner came behind me and knocked me down—I have the wound now on my face and hand, which I received when I was knocked down; and my eye was closed up—my shawl was pulled off me—I screamed out "Police," and the policeman came and took the prisoner directly—I am sure he is the person who came behind me, and I was knocked down directly on my face—this was within two yards of the door of the house—my shawl was pulled on me, but I caught it on my arm.</p>

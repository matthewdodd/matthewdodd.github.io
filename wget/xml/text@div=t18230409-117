               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know Taylor - A. Yes; from a child. I very seldom saw him and my brother together - we slept at my father's on the Common. I heard of the robbery next morning; he slept with me every night. I went to know where he was, and found he was in custody; he said he was charged with stealing two coats from Mr. Mills, and I told the people outside the office that I slept with him at the time. Mr. Mills lives about two hundred yards off. I did not go and tell him what I could prove. I did not tell Webb, for he is no friend to a poor man. My father and mother, and brother Henry could also prove it, but they are not here.</p>

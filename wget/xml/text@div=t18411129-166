                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Franklin, a pawnbroker, in Tottenham-court-road. On Saturday, the 13th of November, about twelve or half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner at our shop, looking at a gown which hung in the shop for sale—I soon after missed the pri<lb></lb>soner and the gown—it was afterwards brought back by Clench—it is my master's property—it was not sold to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in John-street. About the middle of Saturday, the 13th of November, I was going past Mr. Franklin's shop, and saw the prisoner inside—I saw her take a gown off a hook, put it under her shawl, and run away with it—I followed her, and called "Stop thief"—I came up to her in Greek-street, Soho—there was no policeman by to give her in charge—I charged her with stealing the gown from Franklin's—she said it was false, she struck me, and walked up and down—a mob of people got about, and she threw the gown down—I took it back to the shop—she prayed of me to let her go.</p>

As I was coming along Tottenham Court-road, three females and two boys passed me, and dropped this parcel—they seemed drunk—I hallooed after them, but they ran different ways—a woman came across the road, picked up the parcel, put it in her apron, and said, "Don't say any thing about it, we will go and pawn it, and halve the money"—I said I would do nothing of the sort, she then took it, and said I should have nothing of it—a mob came, and she went away—I went to Bond-street, to see a friend, and returned in about two hours the same way—as I returned, these boys came up to me, and asked if I knew any thing of the party who took the parcel—I said, no—they said if I could tell any thing about it, they would give me half a crown, and if I did not they would give me in charge—I said, "I did not care," and they gave me in custody—I know no more of it than the dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Registrar of the Edmonton County Court—I produce the proceedings in the bankruptcy of James Charles Harding—the petition is dated July, 1874, it was filed the same day—the adjudication was July 23rd, and on August 11th J. B. Bradfield was appointed trustee—that appointment was afterwards vacated by order of the Judge, and George Frederick Flower was appointed, trustee—this is the bankrupt's statement of affairs, it shows a liability of 2, 936<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he represents his assets to be 878<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., showing a deficiency of about 2, 057<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no de<lb></lb>ficiency account—I find two or more orders by the Court for filing cash accounts, but he has filed none—I sat as judge in an examination held before me on 22nd December; I took these notes of that examination (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These are not official notes taken by a short-hand writer, nor are they made from my recollection; they were made at the time and I will undertake to say that they are correct word for word—official short-hand notes would be filed but not my notes—I cannot say that my notes contain all he said; the answers only are put, not the questions—I remember the purport of it exactly, but there are other matters which I cannot remember without refreshing my memory.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he say A. He was examined by Mr. Lewis as to Butcher's loan of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said that the debts were received in capacity of an auctioneer, and appropriated to his own use; that Mr. Bowron's claim was for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was instructed in October or November in 1873, to sell live and dead stock—the sale realised over 2, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the balance owing to Bowron was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less commission—he said "I did not pay all I received"—I do not say that part of Mr. Butcher's loan went in discharge of Mr. Bowron's debt—it went in the business generally—as to John Luigay he said "I was instructed to sell live and dead stock, <hi rend="italic">—t</hi> realised about 1, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; fifty sheep were not sold, and came into the assets; that was paid into my account in the usual way of business"—as to David Kidd he said "The house and homestead at Tanner's End were purchased through me, 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit was paid to my bankers. Alfred Lott is not a creditor for 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he is a creditor for 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the proceeds of a sale; the greater part was not received by me, and is owing now. I received money from the local board and handed it over to him"—as to Mr. Gilbert he said "The farm produce was sold, the estate owes him the money, 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a little over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is owing now"—as to the Provident Building Society he said "Holder of lease</p>

               <p>held house for residue of ninety-nine years, executed a mortgage to them, received clear money, about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I knew then that I was hopelessly in<lb></lb>solvent. I was then in treaty for a partnership. I had told my proposed partner of the fact—the treaty went off after I was gazetted—I was pressed by my bankers, my account was considerably overdrawn; this 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. went into the Imperial Bank. I wanted two bankers, because the Imperial had a branch at Waltham. The receipts being about equal to the office and house-hold expenses, the sums received in business went into the general business"—Bradfield the horse dealer, was then mentioned, and the prisoner said "He is a creditor for over 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I paid him very likely as much as 1, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for borrowed money had at different times, between June 1873 and another date; 25 and 30 per cent. I was sometimes paying him at a time when I knew I was hopelessly insolvent. I continued borrowing money of Bradfield on the same terms. I can't say how much I borrowed of Bradfield; I kept no private book of account. I may have borrowed from first to last of Bradfield 2, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I won't swear to any amount, not even that it was more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the expenses of advertising, &amp; c., where property has not sold. There were a great many sales in two years; I cannot say how many. There were other sources of loss, bad debts; some are brought forward as assets, and some crossed off"—then the new offices and lease were touched upon "part paid for the lease, and part paid for the building"—Batten was mentioned "Had no interest in his business; borrowed no money of him; have paid him money for horse hire. I did not pay him so much as 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He used to exchange cheques for me. He has not dined at my house; I lived at Ingleside the house is not furnished. There is not furniture in every room; in one room, a back one, there is none. The furniture now in the house is the same as it was before the sale; 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture was given back to me by the trustee, Bradfield; Hart, a broker, purchased for Jay, the auctioneer who was acting for Mr. Bradfield, the trustee. I have an appointment bringing me in 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; rent of Ingleside is 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; I keep no servant; I consider I am living rent free; I am holding the house for the mortgage, simply taking possession of the house. The trustee has all books I kept; I had a kind of ledger, sale book, rough journal or cash book no other book. Monies received on account of customers were entered on separate memoranda. I did not know I was insolvent until Christmas, 1873; I found I was short of money in February, 1874. In June, 1873, I did believe I was solvent. I never made out any balance-sheet. April 25, 1874, re-sale of property in Cambridge shire. Mr. Rudd lives at Enfield"—then he was re-examined—those are all the notes I have—the re-examina<lb></lb>tion was not taken down—Mr. Bignall appeared and asked leave to cross-examine the bankrupt, and I believe it was objected to—I have no recollec<lb></lb>tion that he proceeded with any examination, and probably that is the reason I have taken nothing down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If he was re-examined not a word has been taken down—I believe Mr. Bignall appeared for the defendant; he also appeared for one of the creditors, and there were other people there—I have nothing to refresh my memory as to whether there were interpolations or questions by different solicitors—the words "hopelessly insolvent" might have been Mr. Lewis' words, but the bankrupt adopted them—the last examination was on the 22nd December, 1874—the application was made on February 6th, and the order was filed on February 9th—the examination had been adjourned then and the adjourned examination has never been held yet, because he was</p>

               <p>ordered to be prosecuted—I think Mr. Bignall offered to answer any requisi<lb></lb>tion that might be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the examination an order was made on more than one occasion for him to file a cash account; the adjournment was to give him the opportunity of doing so—a further examination was of no use whatever without his filing a cash account; everything hinged on the cash account; requisitions were of no use till we got that—he simply said that he could not do so, because no accounts had been kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of Southampton Build<lb></lb>ings, Chancery Lane—I was not the original trustee, I was appointed trustee last October and saw the bankrupt about a fortnight afterwards—I had: received his books from the Edmonton Bankruptcy Court in his presence; a large number of them were of no use, with the exception of a cash-book and a ledger which was labeled "Day-book" and which was used as a sort of ledger—there are about forty-eight accounts in it, half of which commence in 1874—I sometimes find the debtor side on the right and sometimes on the left and sometimes the two are intermixed—on folio 1 4 the debtor account is on the right and the creditor on the left, and on folio 18 they are both on the same page—I also received a book called the day-book containing about 500 pages, it is not labelled "Day-book," but it appears to have been used as a day-book—it commences in 1872 and contains records of business up to May, 1874, during which time 11 pages only have been filled with the records of the business—I was not able to gain any information from the way in which the books were kept—this is the banker's pass-book and this is the sales-! book which commences in 1874—I also received a book of blank forms with counterfoils, apparently to be used to represent contracts for sales—one leaf of it has been torn out, but otherwise it has not been used at all—in conse<lb></lb>quence of not being able to glean information from the books, I applied to him from time to time for a cash account and he told me that he would give it, but he never performed, and I applied to the Court to compel him—his explanation of the deficiency was that it arose from the illness of his first wife and that he had expended a great deal of money in advertisements which he could not charge his customers with—he delivered to me two banker's pass-books from which I found cheques payable to himself amounting to 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., wages to 282<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., expenses 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. rates and taxes 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; amounting altogether to 738<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in thirteen months—the 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is for "self," 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for "wages," and 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for "expenses"—I find the name of Bradfield occurring frequently in the pass-book, but not in any of the other books—I find no account in the sold ledger referring to Bradfield—the first entry relating to Bradfield in Barnett &amp; Hoare's pass-book of 1873 is "10 June, Bradfield 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and on 19th June, I find Bradfield, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 4th July 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10th July 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 18th July 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 2nd August 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 23rd August 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 2nd September 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Major Butcher, we live at Waltham Abbey—the prisoner was introduced to me by Mr. Gardiner, his cousin, and in April, 1874, he and his wife called on us and the prisoner asked me if I would let him have a loan of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as he required 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make an; advance for a client of his to secure a large sale of freehold, leasehold, and copyhold at Cambridge, and if I would let him have 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he had the rest by him—I said that I would let him have it if it was perfectly secure because it would reduce my income—he said that it was as safe as the Bank of England, and that the writings were in his iron chest, and he appealed to his wife to say if it was not so—she said "Yes"—I said that I could not let him have the money then as I should be obliged to sell out some stock—about three days after that his wife brought me this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 16th <hi rend="italic">April</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to the witness, requesting her to let him have the</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">at once.</hi>) They afterwards came together for the money and he told me that he had just come from his brother Paul, who would let him have the money in a moment, only he had just been paying a large sum, and knowing them to be established people, I believed him—he repeated several times that the writings were in his iron chest—after that I let him have the money and took from him a bill of exchange—he said that he only required the money for a month, but Major Batcher said that it would be impossible to get the money in a month, and the bill had better be drawn for two months, which was done—it was dishonored and I have never got a penny—I afterwards let him have some furniture to sell for me which I had to spare—it realised about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I never got a penny—I am now a creditor for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have parted with my money if I had not believed his statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to the ordnance factory of small arms, Enfield, and am entitled to an estate at March in the Isle of Ely—Messrs. Lewis of Southampton Street, Strand, are solicitors in the matter—five or six months ago the prisoner made a proposal, to raise 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to redeem a mortgage of mine prior to selling the estate, I did not put him in possession of the title deeds or give him any authority to sell the estate—he never told me that had received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that he had the other 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ready to pay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—I do not know this estate, but I know of it; it is at present held in two moieties; the title deeds to the entirety are I am informed are in the hands of some bankers at New-market—I have been there a great number of years, but I never saw them—the title deeds of the moiety to which my client is entitled 1 have never seen; she takes under a will—I believe Messrs. Lewis have some deeds; I have none, and never had any—I have never instructed the prisoner to sell her moiety; she is a lunatic; nor have I received from him money raised by him on that estate on behalf of my client's moiety.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Lewis &amp; Co., solicitors, of Southampton Street, Strand—Mr. Rudd is interested in one moiety of some property at March, and my client is the mortgagee—I did not ask the prisoner to sell, nor have I received the money;, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is about the value of the whole; 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>
               <p>----Petard. I am solicitor to the London Permanent Building Society—I produce a mortgage of the prisoner's leasehold residence at Edmonton—I saw the deed executed by him on the 21st June, 1874—I gave him a cheque on that day for 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a further sum of "100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 18th June.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I no not know whether the house had been completed before the mortgage—we reserved the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that our surveyor might have an opportunity of seeing whether the house was finished; it was only a question of value.</p>

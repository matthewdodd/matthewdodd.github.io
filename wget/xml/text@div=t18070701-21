               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - on Sunday morning the 14th of June last, between two and three o'clock, I saw a man whom I supposed to be a deserter; I followed him sharply, he took to his heels and threw himself under a gateway; when I came up to him; I asked him what he was doing there, he replied what is that to you; I called the watchman, and charged him with being a deserter. My lord, there is a set of people that live opposite of me, that would deprive me of my life and liberty, by false swearing; they are eternally calling me a crimp. After securing the man in the watchhouse, coming home I stopped to speak to a woman who lived next door to me, these people rushed out of the house, knocked me down in the passage, and secured the sword from me, and broke the blade; and in their securing the sword from me, I have every reason to believe the parties were cut; I got away from them, went up stairs to a neighbour, I staid in her room, and when I thought every thing was quiet I got over the yard, and went to my own room; these people came and broke my room door open. I declare I am an innocent man.</p>

One morning as I was coming from my work, I heard Carrol cry out bloody Conway, I will send you to Pimlico, to get another silver plate in your head; Carrol's wife said she should be very well satisfied if she saw him hung in the Old Bailey.

               <p>Q. About what time did this happen. - A. To the best of my knowledge about half after two in the morning. About a week before this happened Mr. Carrol came out in the middle of the day, he pulled his shirt sleeves up and called Conway, Conway looked out of the window and asked him what he wanted, he said I want no more of you than to come down stairs; the prisoner said he would not come down; I told Carrol to go in doors, I thought he wanted him to fight with him. The next time I saw him was when the fight was; the prisoner's room is opposite of mine, Carrol lives in the next house to me; I saw a little short man, he wanted to take the sword out of the prisoner's hand. I fancy his hand was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Carrol. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Davis. - A. That was the name of the little man; his hand bled very much, Carrol went to his assistance, Conway went into Slater's house to save himself; they both pursued the prisoner to get the sword out of his hands.</p>

Between two and three in the morning; he said Carrol and his wife and Davis had been ill using him, and they had taken his sword from him; I told Mr. Conway if he would stay in the house I would go down.

                  </hi>. I am a merchant of 18, Mark-lane—on Saturday-after-noon, 3d December, I was getting into an omnibus in Gracechurch-street—I had missed the twenty-minutes before 5, and had to wait for the 5 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—when the omnibus turned round another man, who undoubtedly belonged to him, prevented us from getting in—I stood where the conducter stands—the prisoner stood by me, and I felt a tug from his hand, and said, "You vagabond, you have got my watch"—he ran twenty or thirty yards, and fell down, or I should not have caught him—I laid hold of him—he wanted to get into Leadenhall-market, but there was an omnibus in the way—my watch was worth forty guineas—I have never recovered it.</p>

               <p>let us in—he said, "I cannot open the door"—I was standing on the ground, not on the board—I am not in the habit of getting in backwards; but I was waiting for the conductor to come and open the door—he came up a minute afterwards—the omnibus was standing still—my left side was to the omnibus; otherwise they would have knocked me down with the door—I wear my watch on the right side, that I may not break my eye-glass—other people were in the omnibus trying to get in, but they were on the other side, on the pavement—the man who would not let me get in did not touch me—I do not know whether he had his foot on the step—I saw no more of him when I came back—he was holding the door at the time my watch was taken—the prisoner was not trying to get into the omnibus—I did not hear him say that he was running across the road to get in—I was not in a state of excitement at losing the former omnibus—I was going home to dinner, but I do not dine till half-past 6—I was annoyed; there were no people in the omnibus; they could not get in—the man said the door was locked: I said, "I never heard of such a thing"—the prisoner ran four or five houses from the omnibus—he said nothing when I seized him—he did not lay hold of me—we did not both fall in the gutter; he fell—it was very slippery.</p>

I am conductor of this Dulwich omnibus, and live on Dulwich common—on 3d December, I saw some people waiting at the back of the omnibus, and Mr. Cox among them—I heard him call out to the prisoner, "You vagabond, you have stolen my watch"—the prisoner said nothing, but ran away—I saw the prisoner's hands taken away from Mr. Cox's pocket—I followed and saw Mr. Cox catch hold of him, but he broke away—I caught hold of him, but he got away from me, crossed the road, turned back, and endeavoured to run across again—he ran against a waggon and was stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Piko at Union-wharf, on the right-hand side of the City-basin. On the morning of the 17th of December, I had two empty barges and one full one, lying there—I was on the bridge looking over towards the basin about half-past one o'clock, and observed a fly-boat come through the bridge—I observed the name of the <hi rend="italic">Alert</hi> on it, in black letters on a white ground—it steered its course alongside my barge—I was not in a situation to see the people on board the boat, but I saw two men jump from the boat on board of my full barge, the <hi rend="italic">Emma</hi>—I observed one man steering, and another on board the fly-boat—I cannot speak to either of the prisoners, as being the per-sons—the man who was steering was a considerably larger man than the others—I saw the two men who were on board my barge stoop and take up something and throw it into their boat-they took something from the stern of my barge and put it in the bow of the boat, which was along-side</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701020124"></xptr>
               <p>the stern of the barge—the <hi rend="italic">Alert</hi> was passing as slow as a child could walk, and as they came to the head of the barge, they took something from the bow of it—I then heard a voice from Mr. Pickford's side, call out, "It won't do, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>"—I think it was repeated twice—the man on board the fly-boat put the tiller off, and the two men on board the barge jumped into the boat, which went towards Pickford's—I went and got a policeman, and he obtained others—three attempted to go to the boat, but one could not get over the gates of my wharf, and he remained behind—I and two policemen went on my wharf, got into the barge, put it off, and they went on board the <hi rend="italic">Alert</hi>—I did not go on board—I acted as waterman for them-the <hi rend="italic">Alert</hi> was moored outside some boats of Mr. Pickford's—I described to the policemen what I had seen, and the place where I had seen something put—I heard the question asked by some one in the boat, "What do you want here?"—"We come to search for coals," was the reply—I was not on board then, but I think I did go on board—three of the prisoners were then at the stern of the boat, and one at the head—they were in hearing when I pointed out the head of their boat to the policemen, which was quite filled with Bellmoor Wallsend-coals—the same as I had twenty-eight tons of in my barge—I found from two to four or five hundred weight on board the boat—the prisoners were taken in about an hour, or an hour and a half, afterwards—some of the policemen staid, while others went for assistance—I heard Mills, who was the captain, say he would not go, he could be found in the morning—the policemen said, "You must go now"—I examined my own barge, and saw holes where it appeared the larger coals had been taken out.</p>

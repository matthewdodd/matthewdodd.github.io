On Friday afternoon 31st January, I went with Brown and Lanley to Thomas Terrace, Mile End—the prisoner was then in custody—we saw his mother and searched the house—in the ground-floor front-room we found thirteen rolls of ticking, one of which is here—in some drawers in a back-room I found these two receipts—(<hi rend="italic">These were dated January</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st, and January</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th, for</hi> 420 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 423 <hi rend="italic">yards of ticking, bought of Edward Morrisson</hi>, 48, <hi rend="italic">Packington Street, for</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Signed, Paid, Edward Morrisson.</hi>)—I showed the prisoner the ticking and the receipts—he said "The ticking I bought of a man named Morri-son, who attends salerooms," and I believe that is the correct address.—I</p>

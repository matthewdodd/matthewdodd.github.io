             sworn. - Q. Are you a shopman to Mr. Brooks? - A. Yes: On the 18th of January the prisoner came into the shop alone; she asked to see some muslins; it was about one o'clock; I shewed her two pieces, which she thought were too thin; I then went to another part of the shop to shew her some thicker ones; on my return I saw that the first piece of the two I had shewn her before was gone off the counter. On enquiring of her where one of those pieces was, she said she knew nothing of it; I then told her that she must have the piece of muslin, as there was no other person in the shop; she again denied it; I then sold her a quarter of a yard of muslin, to the amount of eighteen-pence halfpenny. She went out; I then told the young man at the bottom of the shop to bring her back, as I was confident that she had it; the young man brought her in immediately; I then asked her for the piece of muslin; she denied having it, or knowing any thing about it. I then told the young man to go up stairs, and tell Mr. Brooks; previous to Mr. Brooks coming, she went behind a wrapper of muslins, and stooping she dropped the muslin on the ground; then said, here it is lying on the floor.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you undertake to say whether it was not, before the young man brought her back into your shop, laying there before she came in? - A. I am sure it was not, I looked all about there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where she took it from? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Are you the young man that was sent after the prisoner? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the shop? - A. No customer but the prisoner; I went up to state the circumstance to Mr. Brooks; it was found when I came down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to buy a piece of muslin, and four yards of white tape, I gave one shilling and seven-pence for them. I was not gone out of the shop when they called me back; they wished me to turn out my pockets; I said, gentlemen, look among the muslins; they looked there, and found it; there was a woman in the shop at the same time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

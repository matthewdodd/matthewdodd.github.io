            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the morning of the 14th November, about six o'clock (it was not day-light), I called on Pople and Handley. We went to No. 13, Castle-street, Seven Dials, the street-door was open; the house is full half an hour's walk from the prosecutor's. We went up stairs; I being first, went to the top of the attic-stairs, and found an umbrella very wet, the wet running from it; this was claimed by

            , as belonging to her fellow servant. I listened at the door, and heard the voice of two or three men speaking in a low tone. I burst the door open, and saw silver articles on a deal table. Watts, Fuller, and Brown were sitting round the fire; the table was between Watts and Fuller. I knew Watts, ran to him with a cutlass held it to his breast, and told him if he moved I would run him through. Handley then was holding a pistol to Herd's head, who was in bed with Banfield. Cooper secured the property - there were fourteen silver spoons, and a wine-funnel on the table. I handcuffed Fuller and Brown - while doing so, I saw a snuff-box (which I now produce) drop from either Watts or Fuller, but which I cannot say. Handley handcuffed Watts. We then ordered Herd to get out of bed, which he did; he dressed himself all but his coat, and then said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go to the other side of the room for my coat, which hangs on a chair." I followed him, and when he had his coat in his hand, and was going to put it on, this knife dropped from the pocket. We ordered Banfield to get up and dress herself. Cooper asked the prisoners who the plate belonged to; neither of them made any reply, that I recollect. When Cooper had searched the room, I said I would have a search, and by the right-hand side of the fire-place, I found a board loose in the floor, which I took up; there was a hollow space under it, and some way from the hole, as far as I could reach my hand, I found five skeleton keys, and one other key, tied together, a hook, a chisel, a screw-driver, a stock for a centre-bit, an iron crow-bar, and dark lanthorn; and on the back of the chair where Fuller sat, was this old blue coat, very wet; and on the side of the bed where Herd lay, I found a pair of old worsted stockings, very wet and very dirty. We took all the prisoner's to the watch-house, and from there to the office. The coat Fuller had on was dry, and had feathers on it, as if he had been on a bed. Brown's hat, coat, waistcoat and pantaloons were very wet indeed, and all their shoes were dirty with fresh dirt; they appeared to have been dried by the fire. They did not say where they had been. On the Monday following, I and Cooper went to the prosecutor's house, with all the implements, also the knife and snuff-box, and on examination I found the sash had been forced up, and the chisel and screwdriver exactly fitted the marks on the cill and and bottom of the sash; the window-catch was forced off and a hole bored through the shutter. We found in the front kitchen a cupboard forced open by the side of the fire-place, and the same two instruments fitted the marks on that door. In the middle door of the back kitchen were marks of centre-bits; at each corner of the pannel which was taken out (I produce it), the beading which confined the pannel was cut away with a knife, so that it came out. We examined the wall and the vault door, it appeared that they had climbed up on the door, and then on the wall. It would take a full half hour to make an an entrance with these instruments; the robbery altogether would occupy above three quarters of an hour. The prosecutor claimed the knife and snuff-box immediately on seeing them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you get to Castle-street - A. About seven o'clock - it was day light then and did not rain. I got up between five and six o'clock; it rained hard then, and I went to bed. I arose again about a quarter to six, it was then a gentle mizzling rain, and did not rain heavy afterwards; it left off about six o'clock. It rained hard in the middle of the night - I do not know whether the previous evening was wet. I was never in the house before. I did not then know who belonged to it. I only saw one bed in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Five people don't usually sleep in one bed - A. I have seen as many. There was a good fire there. Brown sat in a chair on the left of the fire - the bed was in a recess. I think the room is not twenty feet square. The moment the door was opened, Brown looked over his shoulder - he had his shoes and hat on; his coat was very wet; it was a blue one. I did not ask to see his shoes; they appeared wet, and it was fresh wet as if he had been out that morning. He was very wet altogether - his clothes and shoes satisfied me that he had been out that morning. They were all sitting round a good fire. Euston-place is on the same side of the way as Pancras New Church.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Watts and Fuller were fully dressed - A. Yes; their clothes were dampish. Fuller's coat appeared to have been taken off the bed. He denied that the coat at the back of the chair was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Herd was in bed quite undressed - A. Yes - so was Banfield; she said she was very ill, and I beleive she was; she had a black eye and bruises about her. There were nobody besides the prisoners in the room. I looked at the stockings by the bed before Herd got up; I wrapped them up, and brought them away - he put on a clean pair of white ones, his coat was on the left hand side of the bed - I found nothing on him, but saw him drop the knife, his coat was dryish, it did not hang by the fire; his breeches were not exactly dry, they were not in the state they would be if he had been out in a heavy rain. I believe his waistcoat was dry, but did not notice it - his hat and shoes appeared to have been out in a heavy rain; he might have dried his clothes - his hat appeared to have been dried by the fire; I can tell that because I am a hatter by trade. Herd asked me before the Magistrate if the stockings were not in the pocket of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040037"></xptr>coat - I said No, I picked them up by the bed side, and then put them myself into the coat pocket. The snuff-box, implements, and pen-knife have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. DE REIMER. I think the pen-knife is mine; it appears the same as was taken that night. I had it three or four months - I have no mark on it. I am certain of the snuff-box, it is marked with my initials.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It is a common pen-knife - A. Yes; if I saw it in a person's possession I should not claim it by any mark.</p>

            . I went with Pace to Castle-street. We got there about seven o'clock. Pace had called on me a little after six; it had been a very wet night, but did not rain when I came out. We went up stairs, broke the door open. Fuller, Brown, and Watts, sat by the fire. Herd and Banfield were in bed together. We told them we came to take them into custody, and on the table we found a wine funnel, and fourteen silver spoons in a blue rag, which was very wet, A tortoiseshell box was dropped, which Pace picked up. Herd was dressing at the time. Pace found a hole at the corner of the room, and pulled from under the floor the house-breaking implements. We did not find the centre bit belonging to the stock. I took from the mantle-piece a gardner's pruning knife; and after Herd and Banfield had got up, I found a silver box in the bed, with thirty silver counters in it; we found the owner for that. I found a wet blue coat hanging on the back of a chair in which I believe Fuller sat. By the side of the bed was a pair of worsted stocking with the feet wet. When Herd got up he put on a pair of clean while stockings. Two pair of their shoes out of the four were wet; one pair which Herd put on were soaking wet through. I think Brown had on a wet pair too; and the other two pair which appeared more dry, looked as if they had been dried by the fire. In a box claimed by Banfield I found a red pocket-book of this year, with a silver lock to it, with several cuts of a knife in it. After taking them away. Handley and I went back, and made a second search in the same room; this was between eleven and twelve. Handley found a letter and a file. We then went to Russell's, White Lion-Court, Seven Dials, to the first floor, back room, and found a woman's reticule basket, with seven picklock keys, and one latch key; and in the table drawer we found a googe bit, which would drill a hole. We also found a hat and coat there, which Fuller claimed; there was a bed in that room; we found nobody there. An umbrella was found on the landing-place in Castle-street. The prosecutor's cook claimed it as her fellow servant's property. The wet had ran from it; it must have been there some time, for the wet from it had soaked into the floor. We went to the office, and the prisoner's were put to the bar for examination; and Fuller claimed the hat and coat which I brought from Russell's. On the Monday following, we went to the prosecutors; the chisel and screw-driver fitted the marks in the window. I have no doubt those instruments had been used there. and also at the kitchen and cupboard doors.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The spoons were concealed in a blue rag - A. Yes, I did not see them till I undid them. I found what they were, and asked them all round if they were theirs; nobody claimed them. I did not take them out of the rag; the funnel was not covered over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Herd and Ban-field were undressed and in bed - A. Yes, I believe Herd's coat was damp, but not so wet as the others. I did not examine his waistcoat; his shoes were wet; his hat was very wet; it did not appear to have been dried by the fire; the streets were wet and damp. Banfield appeared very ill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was not the night before very rainy - A. I went home about eleven o'clock, and it had not rained all the evening then.</p>
               <p>MR. DE RIEMER. The fourteen spoons are mine and have my initials on them. I believe the funnel to be mine from its size and appearance.</p>

            . I am officer of Queen-square. I accompained Cooper and Pace to Castle-street. We broke the room door open, and found the five prisoners there. Herd and the woman were in bed; the other three sat round the fire; there was a table standing between Fuller and Watts; the spoons and funnel were on it, and I took off a phleme. I saw the impliments of house-breaking found under the floor. Herd's shoes were very wet, and some of their clothes. I went to a lodging at Russell's, White Lion-street, which I suspected to be Fuller's, and he claimed a coat and hat which was brought from there; they were dry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You examined Herd's things attentively - A. I examined his shoes, coat, and hat. I did not examine his waitcoat or breeches; his coat appeared dry, but his shoes very wet and dirty.</p>
               <p>MR. DE RIENER. I lost a phleme from the parlour, but cannot swear to this one.</p>
               <p>HERD'S Defence. I was in bed from twelve o'clock till I was apprehended, and I let these men in when they came in the morning.</p>
               <p>WATT'S Defence. On the night previous to my apprehension, I was with Fuller at a public-house, in St. James's. I told him I was going down to Richmond next day, and asked him to accompany me, which he agreed to, and appointed me to to call on him before six o'clock in the morning to breakfast. I called at his lodgings at the appointed time; he got up and dressed. His wife (who is Herd's sister) had words with him about going; he said he would go to his brothers and get breakfast, and we went there to breakfast. I knocked at the door. Banfield asked who was there and said, if we stopped while she unlocked the door and got into bed she would let us in, and did so. We asked for Herd; she said he was out, but she expected him in every moment, and asked us to sit down. We sat by the fire; and in about quarter of an hour Herd came in alone; and about ten minutes after Brown came up, and then Herd went to bed; the room was so dark I could discover nothing on the table till I pulled the curtain aside, I saw the funnel, but know no more.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040038"></xptr>BROWN'S Defence. I called up there as I passed, but know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>BANFIELD'S Defence. I went to bed about eleven o'clock. Herd came home between twelve and one, and never got out of bed till three men knocked at the door. I awoke him; he got out and let them in; two very decent men saw Herd home in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Radnor-street, St. Luke's—on Wednesday evening 28th January, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I went, with several other offices, to 9, Cross-street, Mason-street, Old Kent-road—I found the street door open, proceeded upstairs to the first-floor back-room, and found the prisoner sitting on a bed—I told him my name was Brannan, and that I had re<lb></lb>ceived instructions from the Solicitor to the Mint to look after him about coining, and that I had a search-warrant to search his place—he said, "Yes; you will find all I have got in the wash hand-stand drawer," pointing to a wash hand-stand which stood in a corner of the room—I went to it, and pulled out the drawer; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the bottom of it, on paper lay forty shillings, all separate, nothing else—I searched the room, and between a box and the wall, in a corner of the room, I found a parcel con<lb></lb>taining this galvanic-battery plate, those cylinders, a pipe with white metal in it, as at now appears, two files, with white metal in the teeth of one, copper-wire peculiarly bent, which had been dipped in solution, several brushes, and near them a pipkin, containing white metal, which had been diluted, and eight counterfeit shillings, some of which had been cut, and some bent—I produced the galvanic-battery plate to the prisoner, and he said, "Oh, you are very clever, you seem to know all about it; that is not a galvanic-battery plate"—I said, "We won't discuss that here"—he became very violent—when we found the cut shillings he said, "Yes, they are <hi rend="italic">crippled</hi>;" that means that they had been tendered and returned—I also found some pads, which I believe have been used for holding the mould when the metal is in a state of fusion—several bottles containing acids,</p>

               <p>some Britannia-metal spoons, some plaster of Paris in powder, some sand some syonite of silver, and all the things necessary for making counterfeit coin, except the mould—I also found this good shilling, which bears the same date as the counterfeit shillings—this wire is bent to hold coin while it is being coated with silver.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, G</hi>). I went with Brannan on 28th January, and saw him search the room where the prisoner was—I produce a jug nearly full of some liquid, which I found on a shelf by the fireplace—the prisoner said, "Mind, if you spill that on your clothes it will burn you"—I also found on the mantelshelf half a counterfeit shilling, dated 1826—two Britannia-metal spoons were found, and the bowl of a third—there was fire in the fireplace.</p>

I have examined all the things produced, and find everything necessary for making counterfeit coin, except the mould; but I find a good shilling, which is a pattern used in making the mould, and I find that twenty or thirty of the shillings here are made from that pattern—Britannia-metal spoons are frequently used in making coins.</p>

            . I am a <rs id="t18130915-30-viclabel172" type="occupation">serjeant in the 15th regiment of Hussars</rs>

On the 6th of September I had to attend Bartholomew fair to enlist recruits, which induced me to stop to a late hour. In the evening I went to the sign of the <placeName id="t18130915-30-crimeloc173">Bull in Cow-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130915-30-crimeloc173" type="placeName" value="Bull in Cow-lane"></interp>

After I drank in company I came down stairs in company with the serjeant of the 18th Hussars and four privates, and hearing a noise in the parlour where there were more than twenty people, it induced me to go into the room to see whether there was a man that would wish to engage with me. On my entering the room there were four coal porters; one of them asked me whether I was not a Don Cossack; I said I belonged to the 15th Hussars; they asked me if I thought they would do for recruits. I said I should be glad to take such fine men as them, and as I was going to the door I found the prisoner had got hold of my watch-chain and seals. I felt the watch go from my pocket. I seized the prisoner, took the watch from him, and pulled him into the room by force. Immediately the company arose in a disturbance; they said I was not robbed. I persisted that I was. The prisoner went and concealed himself at the upper end of the room; he was there five minutes. A man got upon the top of the chair or stool, he said, you scoundrel, how dare you say you have been robbed; do you know who robbed you; am I the person? I said, no. I went to the upper end of the room, and discovered the prisoner under the table. I gave charge of the prisoner, and surrendered my watch to the constable. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

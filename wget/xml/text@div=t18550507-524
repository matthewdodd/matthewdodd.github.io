                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary to the People's Provident Assurance Society. On 28th April, I was in the office, Mr. James Knight, the secretary, was there—the prisoner came there—I was copying letters—Mr. Knight told me, in the prisoner's presence, that the prisoner had come for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said that the prisoner stated he had come from Scott and Hall's, with a parcel, to the Cross Keys, Wood-street, and in coming along he had lost his purse, and would Mr. Knight let him have the money to pay the carriage—Mr. Knight told me to go with the prisoner to the Cross Keys—I went, and in going the prisoner told me the parcel was for Edinburgh, and that it contained envelopes—when we got to the Cross Keys, instead of going into the booking office, he went down to the stable—he came up and went down again, and I followed him—I asked a man there if he had any<lb></lb>thing to do there; he said, "No"—I took him to the booking office, and asked the clerks if he had brought any parcel there—they said, "No"—I left there, and went with the prisoner to Cannon-street, which is the way towards Scott and Hall's—I saw a policeman in Cannon-street, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody in Upper Thames-street—I asked him what had become of the parcel—he said he left it at the booking office—he then said he sent it by the ostler—I told him to be careful what he said—he said he was seduced by a man of the name of Cooke to go there, and he had no parcel—he was not sober, he was not drunk, but he had had more than he ought to have had.</p>

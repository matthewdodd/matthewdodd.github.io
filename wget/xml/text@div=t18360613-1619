                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Ann's-place, Hoxton. On the 23rd of May, I was at Greenwich fair, between the hours of three and four o'clock in the afternoon—Wild, the officer, tapped me on the shoulder and told me something—I immediately turned round, and at two or three yards distance, I saw the handkerchief lying on the ground—Wild picked it up, and collared the prisoner, and Dyke (another office) collared another person, and they were taken to the station-house—this is my handkerchief,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 141.) I was on duty on the 23rd of May, at Greenwich fair—I saw the prosecutor there, and the prisoner and another young man were attempting several gentleman's pockets, going up and down the fair—another was with them, smoking a pipe—I then saw the prisoner and the other two men go behind the prosecutor—the prisoner took the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into his trowsers pocket—he then pushed away from the prosecutor, and turned back to the fair—I torched the prosecutor, and told him—I then laid hold of the prisoner—he took and threw the handkerchief behind on the ground—I picket it up myself and took him.</p>

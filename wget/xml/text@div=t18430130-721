                  </hi>. I am not in business. I live at No. 3, Wells-row—I have an empty house belonging to me in Somers-place, New-road—there were fixtures consisting of stoves and other things, to the value of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw them safe on the 25th of Nov., when I gave the key of the house to the prisoner—on the 20th of Dec. I went there, and the fixtures were gone—I had not entered into any arrangement with the prisoner about letting the house—the agreement I entered into with him was, that he would deliver up the key to Mr. Gurney, my landlord, when he received orders from me—I saw part of my fixtures on the prisoner's premises on the morning of the 20th of Dec.—they were the six stoves and the other articles stated in this indictment—the prisoner was not there then, and I left the premises—I went there a second time with a policeman—I saw the fixtures—the prisoner came and told me to walk in a little room, and he would arrange matters—I refused, and gave him in charge.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300152"></xptr>
               <p>Gurney for me, the application came from the prisoner himself—he was a house-agent—I do not know whether he carries on business now—I do not know a person named Page—I did not know a person named Dowelswell till he was called as a witness—I have seen him, but I could not swear to him—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Page</hi>)—I never saw him in my life till I was subpœnaed, and then wherever I went he has been following me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Mr. Dowdswell</hi>)—that is the gentleman that used to be working in the shop—I never saw Mr. La<lb></lb>timer or Mr. Stedall before (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) to my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were going out of England, and had failed in making Mr. Gurney take your lease off your hands, did you not give the key to the pri<lb></lb>soner, and, in presence of these men, give him leave to make any arrange<lb></lb>ment to take the lease off your hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there was no one present when I gave him the key—I never gave him authority to go to Mr. Gurney, or to take any steps; he was only to hold the key till he heard from me—he was to receive a sovereign for his trouble in delivering up that key—I had a brother living in Islington.</p>

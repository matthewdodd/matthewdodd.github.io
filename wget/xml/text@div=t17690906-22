I was in a one horse chaise. It was a fine moonlight night; one of them shewed me a pistol and demanded my money. That was the prisoner Litchfield, for he came first. I observed, before they came up, they walked about fifteen yards from each other. When he bid me stop, I did not understand him. I said, What do you say? He replied, Your money, your money. Then I immediately stopped. I saw his pistol. Then Stackhouse came up to the head of my horse: he presented a pistol, and took hold of my horse. Then the other that was behind came and jumped upon the shafts of my carriage. I had my hands down, with my reins and whip. He said, What do you hold your hands down for? Hold them up. He said, Your watch as well as your money. He took my watch and my money, and gave them to Litchfield, on my left hand. I was some time pulling off my gloves. Stackhouse said, Blast his eyes, if he is not quick, clap a pistol to his head, and blow his brains out. I said, Gentlemen, have a little patience, and I'll give you my watch and money. After they had got my watch and my money, which was about seven or eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060015"></xptr> shillings, they clapped their hands on the cut-side of my breeches; then they jumped from my carriage, and I came about my business. They went towards Harrow, and I came on to town. As I came along, I gave intelligence to all I met. When I came to the back of the Foundling Hospital I met a coach, I said to the coachman, Are you going upon the Harrow road? I told him three men had just robbed me. I found they were some of Sir

I found they were not the people that robbed me, they were in different clothes. I described particularly the dress and persons of the men that robbed me; I had taken such notice of them, that I was able to swear to their persons and cloathing. On the Tuesday I went to Sir

I went into the country on the Friday, and staid there ten days. After Litchfield and Temple were taken, Sir John sent me a card and letter. I came home on the Saturday night, when I was shewed them. On the Monday I attended Sir John, there I saw them, and knew them. Sir John admitted Temple an evidence. They both of them were on my carriage when I was robbed. I was very sorry they were the men. I saw my watch at Sir John's when Stackhouse was there.</p>

               <p>Cotrell. These boxes are private places for gentlemen and ladies who do not choose to be seen when they come to the shop. He asked me a guinea and a half upon this watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Cotrell. I believe I have seen him before: he used to live with a parcel of women at the end of our lane. My master lives in St. Martin's lane. I took the watch to the window to examine it; then in came Temple and Litchfield, to ask the price of a pair of breeches, that lay in the window. I never saw either of them before, to my knowledge, I told him, I had no breeches that would suit him. They went out, and came in again a second time: they said, if I would shew them the breeches, they were sure they would do. I said I had none that would do. They went out again, and I observed then to loiter about the door. I went then to Stackhouse, and desired he would write his name upon a ticket. He wrote upon it the name,

The moment he wrote his name upon the bill, I went round the counter to the side he was, in order to prevent his getting away. I asked him whose watch it was, that he offered to pledge; he said it was his property. I had observed it answered the bill. I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it of a milkman, or a slopman. I asked him whether he knew where the person was to be found; he mentioned first Litchfield-street, then Titchfield-street; then he mentioned another; and he said, if I would go along with him, he would shew me. I then told him this watch was taken upon the highway from a gentleman near Paddington, and he must go with me before Sir

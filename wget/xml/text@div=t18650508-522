                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 110). On the morning of 11th April I was on duty in Stoke Newington—between a quarter and half-past 12, I saw the prisoner and another man in a narrow lane at the back of St. Matthias Church—I hid and watched them, but had not an opportunity of seeing them—I came out again and saw them come down off a wall at the back of the church, and hide under the hedge—about five minutes afterwards they came down very silently, watching and listening, trying to find where I was hiding—I then walked out and met them, and asked them what they were doing at the back of the church—the other man had a pair of these carpet <hi rend="italic">mufflers</hi> in his hand—I said, "What are these," and he said, "That is what they are," giving me a push, "go about your business"—I laid hold of him, he had some heavy lumber about him, up his waist-coat—I then asked him where they lived, and he said, "At the back of Shoreditch Church"—I said, "You have no business at the back of this church then, I must take you to the station"—they said, "Come on then," and I made a grab at them—I was in the act of taking hold of them when I received a frightful blow on the top of the head from the prisoner—I looked round, it was a very bright night, and then saw that he had this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand—he struck at me again; I received altogether about three blows on the head, the last one knocked me down on my face, and he then struck me with something under the shoulder when I was down—I asked him not to murder me, because I had got nothing to protect myself—he said that he would, and swore something or other, after striking me again he ran off up the lane; I was nearly blinded with blood—I followed him up this lane—when he found I was after him, he turned into some fields—I followed him over some hedges till he came to a low wall, which he attempted to get over—I caught hold of him, and he struck at me with this jemmy again—I closed with him, caught hold of his hands, and after a desperate struggle succeeded in getting the jemmy out of his hands—he then made a rush at me, drove his head between my legs and tried to throw me on my back—I then hit him with the jemmy on the head, and he said that he would give in, I had basted him—I asked him to come to the station, but he swore he would not go a foot—all this time he kept calling out for "Bill," his companion—I was then in the act of taking out my rattle, and I threatened to blow his brains out if he stirred—he said he would not stir and I sprang my rattle—the fire-engine keeper and <hi rend="italic">N</hi> 144, came up—I have been confined to my room a month to day, and was in bed three weeks of that time—I still suffer very much in my head—this other jimmy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found where the first struggle took place.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I live at Victoria Villas, Stoke Newington—on the morning of 11th April I was called to attend Conway—he had a very severe angular wound on the forehead, which might have been inflicted by one blow or two; it penetrated to the bone, through all the membranes and scalp, laying open the bone; he had another deep wound on the head, penetrating to the bone—he was covered with blood, and appeared in a very excited state—I have attended him ever since; he was in danger during the first two or three weeks, I consider—I found no external marks of violence on his shoulder—the wounds could have been inflicted by this jemmy; I measured them carefully, and found they adapted themselves to it; the nobbed end seems to be the end with which the wounds on the head were inflicted; his finger was also cut to the bone.</p>

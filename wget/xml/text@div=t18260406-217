            . I am a clothes salesman, and live in Holywell-street. On the evening of the 18th of March, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and offered a pair of stockings for sale, for 4s. - he said if I brought them he would bring some more - they were worth a great deal more; I asked where he got them - he said he gave 6s. 6d. for them. I left the shop, saying I would get change, and got an officer.</p>

            . I was sent for, and took three pairs of stockings from the prisoner's coat pocket. I found in his pocket a letter, with the direction of Mr. Graham's shop, No. 294, Holborn on it; he had said he lived in Gray's Inn-lane; I asked where he got these stockings, and he said he had robbed his employer of them; he saw that I had got his employer's address. I took him to Bow-street office - he confessed he had taken them from his master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he told you he had robbed his employer? A. Yes; I had not said any more to him than asking him where he got them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to my cousin's, to tell him of the arrival of my sister, who had sent a letter, stating that she was to be in town that evening; I met a sailor, who inquired the way to the Strand - he then said he had some silk hose to sell, which he had bought in France, and would sell them cheap, as he was in distress; I paid him 6s. 6d. a pair for them. I was induced to offer a pair for sale; I asked the man 4s. for them - he offered me half-a-crown, and said that was enough.</p>
               <p>JURY to Mr. GRAHAM. Q. Are not these French manufacture? A. No, I think not, but I will not swear it.</p>

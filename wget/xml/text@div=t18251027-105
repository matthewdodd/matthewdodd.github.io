In consequence of suspicion, I got a search-warrant, and went to his premises about half-past one o'clock on the 20th of September - we told him we had a warrant to search his premises for timber, which, we understood, he had stolen - he said we were perfectly welcome to search; we found the timber, which is here in the sheds below; he said he did not know how it came there; there were fifteen pieces, but not all in one place; I believe them to be mine, but cannot swear to more than six of them; some of them were standing up on their end in a corner, and a blanket hung over them; it was all new stuff, and worth more than 40 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any private mark on them? A. No, but I believe them to be mine by the peculiarity of the timber and its grain - it is Dantzic timber; I cannot say how many thousand pieces of the same may be in London - I have no doubt there are many.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not his yard and the yard of one Deacon join your's? A. I do not think so - both communicate with Mr. Gunter's; I do not know that Deacon has a yard; I was in the yard behind the prisoner's premises; I do not know whose it is; there is a yard joining to his, and communicating with Mr. Gunter's, but I do not know whose it is; the yard between the prisoner's and Mr. Gunter's communicate with Mr. Gunter's by a pair of gates; some part of my timber is placed in another person's yard; I have heard of a quarrel between Deacon, jun. and the prisoner; Deacon was the person who set me on watching.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was this a covered place or an enclosed shed? A. An enclosed shed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the yard where the wood was found communicate with the prisoner's premises? A. Yes, I compared it with the rest on Mr. Gunter's premises, and it corresponded exactly.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Fryer to make a search; I found Mr. Polley there; I desired him to show me his premises; he took me round, and then we went inside; he said he did not know whether he had anything or not, but I was welcome to see; in a corner behind some sash-frames I found some timber, covered with a blanket - in another corner I found some more covered with some old pieces - I brought them out, and showed them to Mr. Fryer, who identified them immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You made a search, and did not find them about the premises? A. Yes; he told me I was welcome to search, and they were not his property - he had some building at the back, and said he had bought three pieces of old stuff - I do not recollect seeing any more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many pieces were there in all? A. Fifteen or sixteen; three or four of the six pieces were behind the blanket, and some behind the old stuff; with the exception of one piece, which was tied up in a scaffold - they were all in a state of concealment - except the one in the scaffold.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH HALL re-examined. I saw the timber on Mr. Fryer's premises, about a month before, and some later; I mark every stick of timber that comes there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These are my premises where the timber was found, but I do not know how it came there; I had a serious quarrel with Mr. Deacon, and told him he must leave the premises if his sons did not leave off making holes in the wainscot, which they did in all parts of the house; there were men continually employed in all parts of the premises, who brought in timber at all times - there was none behind a blanket that I know of. I heard that a letter had been sent to Mr. Gunter, telling him that if he came there they thought he could find some timber. Mr. Deacon kept timber there himself, and other people have liberty to do so too - if fifty pieces had been put there I should not have known.</p>

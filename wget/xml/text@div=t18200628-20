On the 25th of May I made the house secure myself, and went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock, I was alarmed between one and two, hearing a confused noise on the stairs, I jumped out of bed and put my hand on some person - I could not see who it was in the dark - I asked him what business he had there, he said he had assaulted a person in the street, and had run away from the watchman; Benington came up directly, and took him, saying,</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 26th of May I was on duty between one and two o'clock in the morning, sitting by the side of my box, in White Lion-street, a watchman nearly opposite called to me, and said he heard a noise; I went over and saw a person going down the street, and heard a rumbling noise inside the prosecutor's door, which was ajar - I went in, and by the light of my lanthorn found two bundles in the passage. I immediately sprung my rattle, and gave the bundles to the watchman; seeing the prisoner run up stairs, I ran up after him, and just within the door of the first floor I found him, and took him to the watch-house - the other watchman followed with the bundle. I gave him in charge of Furzeman. I saw several articles found on him. He appeared sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Collyer, of the Plough and Harrow public-house, in Lambeth parish—on the morning of 7th May, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was awoke by the servant, Mary Ann Stone, coming to my door, and, from something she said, I went down into the Bar—as I was going down, I heard a sound as if the door was closing—I went to the door—it was not as I had left it the night Before, it was open—I did not notice whether there was any violence outside or not—I then went outside the door, and saw the prisoner (Upton) in custody—there was a Basket very near to him, on the pavement, which contained eight Bottles of Brandy—I knew the Brandy by the seal—it had been on a fiat behind the Bar the night Before—it Belongs to my employer, Mr. Collyer—I went outside, and looked at the window—it had been pulled down from the outside—it slides up and down—I went to Bed at half-past 11 the night Before—the window and door were safe at that time—I fastened the door with this Bolt inside the night Before—I should imagine the parties got in at the window—Both the prisoners were in my master's employment about twelve months ago.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Collyer—on this morning I was disturbed between 2 and 3 o'clock by the shutters going down—in con<lb></lb>sequence of that, I went and knocked at Humby's Bedroom door, and he and I went down together—on the way down, I heard the chain of the door moving, nothing else.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 23). On the morning of 7th May, about a quarter to 3, I was on duty near the Plough and Barrow public-house—I observed the prisoner Matthews close to the door of that house, outside—he went down Lower Kenniugton-lane into Duke's Head-court—I went to the door, and found it was closed—I heard somebody inside, and called another constable's attention to it—during that time, I saw Matthews come from Duke's Head-court, and go into Newington-crescent—I knew him—I am sure he was the man—I returned to the house, looked at the door again, and found it give when I put my hand to it—it was moved by some one inside, some one pressing it on the inside—when I saw Matthews come from Duke's Head-court into Newington-crescent I spoke to the other constable—Upton then came out from the house—he had a Basket with him, containing twelve Bottles of Brandy—it is here—as he came out of the house, the door caught his heel, and he fell outside, and Broke four of the Bottles—I took him into custody—he said, "I hope you haye <hi rend="italic">coached</hi> the one that brought me into it; that is Joe"—I took him to the station, and afterwards went to look for Matthews—I found him in the Star coffee-shop, in the London-road—that is about half a mile from there—I charged him with being concerned with Upton in a Burglary at the Plough and Harrow public-house—he said, "I know nothing at all about it; I have not seen Upton since the early part of the evening, when I left him to go home"—after-taking him to the station, I returned to the public-house and looked at the window—I found that the window is always kept down, and the shutters are pulled up from the outside—there is a flap outside, and this Bolt is inside, and a peg comes from the outside, and drops into the Bar—they must have pulled the shutters down, and got in over the window, and then closed the shutters again—there were marks as if some one had got over it—I found the peg in the middle of the Bar.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge at your house?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge her?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Because she acknowledged she had taken them, and carried me to a place where she had disposed of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that?</p>
               <p>Jackson. she took me to the house of Mr Bell in Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise to excuse her, if she would tell you where the goods were ?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, I did not: these I found the pair of blankets. Produced in court, deposed to by prosecutor's wife.</p>
               <p>Mary Bell. The prisoner came to me and told me she was a poor woman, whose husband was at sea, and had three small children, and she was obliged to sell her blankets; I bought two blankets like these of her, but I can't say these are the same.</p>

I bid her call in the morning; she did so; and I went with her almost to Mr. Alexander's, the Proctor; I saw her and Mr. Alexander go to Doctors Commons, and I went into the Bell Inn. In about half an hour's time she came and said she had done the business. I gave her some money to pay for the will, which I think was six or seven shillings.

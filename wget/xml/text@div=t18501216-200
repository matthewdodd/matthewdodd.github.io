I am foreman to Mr. George Ellis—the prisoner was in his service, to take care of his horse—my master had a bushel of tares in his granary—there was about half a bushel missing from them—I saw them safe the day before the policeman took the prisoner—I missed a nose-bag from the same stable—this is it(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is Mr. Ellis's—these tares were not for the horses—I give them out at times—the prisoner had no authority to take them; I had not given him any.</p>

I took the prisoner in Bury-stret, Edmonton, coming from Mr. Ellis's with this nose-bag on his shoulder, and these tares in it, going towards his own home—I stopped him, and asked him what he had got—he said his things—I found these tares, and told him he must go with me—he said he would not go with me, or any other b—y man, till he had been to his master's—in going to his master's he tried to spill the tares—when he</p>

The prisoner is an entire stranger; this plait was on the first-floor warehouse - I had seen it safe on the Saturday, about six o'clock in the evening; the warehouse was secured by shutters to the windows, and one door was bolted inside, and the other door was locked on the outside - I am not certain whether the key was not left in the lock; I went to the warehouse on Monday morning, and found this property had been taken away - it was worth about 200l.; I saw it that morning in Seager's house - he is an officer; I was certain it was the same plait.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any mark on it by which you could identify it? A. It had; I was not the last person there on Saturday - I left one or two persons there; I left about six o'clock - I never recollect a customer taking plait away in a coach; it is usually packed in boxes or trusses.</p>
               <p>HOWELL GODDARD. I am beadle of St. Ann and Agnes, which parish this warehouse is in. On Sunday evening, the 17th of March, I was going along Noble-street, towards the warehouse, and saw a hackney-coach coming towards me; I saw a man just ahead of the coach - I have not seen him since; another man was driving it; it was coming along at a very slow pace - I kept it in sight about three minutes; I cannot say who was driving it at that time, to be certain - the coach was beyond Mr. Nutting's house when I first saw it; I saw it come by the house - it did not stop; the man who was ahead turned his face to the wall at the corner of a passage, he looked at me, which made me take notice; the coach went down St. Ann's-lane, and the man crossed towards me, and turned up Maiden-lane - I did not see him again: the coach went to the bottom of St. Ann's-lane, returned back again, and came along Noble-street; I saw the number behind was plastered with mud - there were numbers on the side, but they were on very small round plates; I watched the coach into Falcon-square, and as it rained hard, I went in and put on my great coat, and went out into Falcon-street, and saw the same coach standing at the corner, close against Aldersgate-street; I am quite sure it was the same coach - the coachman was with it - I believe it to be the prisoner, but I do not speak with certainly - he had a drab great coat on; I went over to the watch-house in Little Britain for assistance - Seager came with me, and I found the coach was then gone; I desired Seager to go round through Falcon-square - I went down Aldersgate-street, and met the coach coming down St. Ann's-lane, at a quick pace; I said to the coachman, "What have you got here?" (the prisoner was the coachman then - nobody else appeared to have any charge of the coach;) he answered, there was a gentleman inside - I opened the door - there was nobody inside at all, but there were three large bags; I desired the prisoner to come down off the box - he said he was hired by a gentleman by the Post-office; I desired him to lead the horses to Little Britain, and I then gave him in charge - I found the bundles were straw plait; I left it at the watch-house while I went to Noble-street - I went in at the back door of Nutting's house, went to the front door, and found it on the spring lock; I went into the warehouse - the key was in the lock, inside the house; there was no violence on that door, but on going up stairs I found some large drawers broken open in the warehouse; I found this jemmy on the floor of the first-floor warehouse, and on examining the door which leads up to the second floor, on the stairs, I found it had been forced open - it was only fastened by a small bolt; I went up to the attic, and found the window open - I then went and got the key of an empty house, two doors off, and on the balustrade of that house, under a trap-door, there were footmarks, and the tiles were off the roof - that would give access to the window of Mr. Nutting's house; I went to the watch-house, searched the prisoner, and found on him a gimblet; on examining the bags in the coach, in one of them was found eight small skeleton-keys and one blank one, with was on it - and this large key was loose in the bottom of the bag, and that opens the door of the empty house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found the prisoner was a hackney-coachman? A. Yes; an umbrella was found in the coach - I heard so; I lost sight of the coach three times - I did not know any thing was amiss at first, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110022"></xptr>had suspicion, as the number was daubed; I did not see any body inside the coach - while I was absent any body might have escaped; I had not the least reason to suspect the robbery was contemplated till I saw the coach; I first went to Mr. Daw's and then to Mr. Nutting's, they being the only persons in the trade; I asked the prisoner how many times he had been up Noble-street - he said only once, that a gentleman called him off the stand at the Post-office, put an umbrella into the coach, and told him to follow him - he never claimed the plait; I cannot tell when the warehouse was broken open; he said the gimblet was to make holes in his harness, which might be the case; the bag the keys were in was at the bottom of the bag the plait was in - the horses' heads were towards the empty house; I did not see the coach stop at the prosecutor's door - the prisoner did not attempt to escape.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RIVERS. I am a patrol of Aldersgate ward. I was at the watch-house in Little Britain at nine o'clock, and saw Mr. Goddard bringing the hackney-coach along; he left it in my possession - on opening the door there were three bags of straw plait, which I took into the watch-house - the prisoner was sent into the watch-house first; under the coach seat was found this umbrella, wringing wet - Goddard left the prisoner in my care; he returned in three quarters of an hour, and Seager took possession of the property; I saw Mr. Nutting next day, and he claimed the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It had been raining? A. Yes, very hard.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the nightly watch. On Sunday evening, about a quarter before nine o'clock, Goddard came to the watch-house; I went with him into Little Britain, and Falcon-street, to look for a coach, and on coming into St. Ann's-lane I saw Goddard turning a backney-coach round; I went up and looked in at the window - there was nobody inside; I saw straw plait protruding from one of the bags - the prisoner gave no account how he came by it; I went with Goddard to search the premises - his evidence is correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he was hired by a gentleman at the Post-office? A.That was not in my presence.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WILLIAM GOLDER. I am porter to Henry Nutting. On going to the premises, on Monday, I found the plait taken away from where I had left it on Saturday night, and found the attic window open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How late were you there on Saturday night? A. Till half-past seven o'clock; I left nobody there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I stopped and got down directly he ordered me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WELLER. I am a waterman. On the 17th of April, about half-past eight o'clock, I saw a gentleman call the prisoner's coach off the rank at the Post-office - it was very wet; the gentleman said, "Follow me to Noble-street" - the prisoner followed the gentleman up Falcon-street; he had been about a quarter of an hour on the stand - I did not see him again till he was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the number of the coach? A. No; I did not see the gentleman get into the coach, nor the bundles put in; it is Mr. Seabrook's coach - it was dirty, having been out all that wet day; I did not attend before the Alderman - I told Seager of this that night.</p>

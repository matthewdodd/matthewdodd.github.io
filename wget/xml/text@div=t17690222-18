On the 20th of January, a little past seven at night, we were in the kitchen; the maid came down and said somebody wanted me; I went to the door; there I saw Mr. Cotton had hold of the prisoner. There was linen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220014"></xptr> lay strewed about the passage, and at the door: he asked me if they were mine. I looked at them, and they were part of the linen mentioned in the indictment. I have all again, except four napkins, which I could not find.</p>

            . I keep a public house within ten doors of the prosecutor. I was going out to get some quart pots, and in going by the prosecutor's passage there came three young men out, they were very near pushing me down. I saw something drop at the door; I suspected they were thieves, and pursued them. I took the prisoner, he was one of them; just as I took him, he pat his hand into the side pocket at his bosom, and dropt something down, which I found to be napkins: I ordered a young man that was coming by to take them up: I saw nothing else in his hand. There were linen dropt at the door, half out and half in.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had the prisoner got before you took him?</p>
               <p>Cotton. I took him within thirty yards of the prosecutor's door. I never lost sight of him. The prisoner was taken before Justice Welch, but he confessed nothing.</p>

On the 16th of November, between six and seven in the evening, I had been into Mr. Guest's, the pawnbroker's, Fleet-market, to fetch a watch out, that I left in May, before I joined the ship. I laid the duplicates upon the counter, and two one pound notes, they would not take one of the notes because it was a Windsor note. I took my notes and duplicate and put them in my pocketbook; I put my pocket-book in my jacket pocket and come out, and as I came opposite to Mr. Cutler's, in <placeName id="t18091206-48-crimeloc289">Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>Q. The prisoner struck you - A. If you call that striking, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you call it - A. Hitting of me. Another came on the other side of me, and snatched the pocket-book out of my pocket; it was taken away. There were two on my left side, and the prisoner was facing of me. I, at the moment, clapped my hand to my jacket pocket and missed my book. I seized the man that struck me, with both my hands; one of the other men took a stick out from under his coat, and struck me over the head; I holloed out, watch, as loud as I could. While I was calling out, watch, they struck me over the nose and over my cheek. In the mean time, a man that was in Mr. Cutler's shop came out, and took hold of the other side of the man that I had hold of.</p>
               <p>Q. You never let him go - A. No, I would not, without he cut my head off. We took him into Mr. Cutler's; in came two men, that called themselves officers; they searched him, they could not find any thing about him. He was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. You never got your notes again - A. No, he begged I would not be severe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What time of night was this - A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been spending the evening - A. I had been spending the evening at the White Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. A little peppermint, a glass or two; I suppose I was about half seas over.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the prisoner before - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of Fleet-market was it - A. On the other side, to where the Fleet prison is; it was on the foot path; next the houses; it was light enough to see his face when he hit me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not alarmed, were you - A. He did not frighten me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other people passing along the pavement at the time - A. There might be, I did not take notice; I should not have taken notice of him if they had not stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that there is a forty pound reward - A. I have heard it, I do not want it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found your property at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are swearing to a person that you saw for half a moment.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you certain that the man who struck you, you seized - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a blow or a shove - A. This way, (witness striking his breast.)</p>

            . I was in company with Fogg on the 16th of November, I suppose it was six o'clock, I do not know particularly. In crossing Fleet-market, I observed three or four fellows looking in at Mr. Guest's, the pawnbroker's, window; whoever they were, I suspected they were going to cut the window, or going to take something out of the shop; we went towards Holborn with an intent to watch them, and when we came near Mr. Guest's window, I saw no more of them, and coming towards the end of Fleet-market, near Fleet-street, I heard a woman say there was something the matter; we hastened to the place, where we saw a mob of people standing where the prisoner was taken to. I went in the shop of Mr. Cutler; the prosecutor was in a bustle; complained of being struck particularly on his nose. I understood him, at that time, that he had robbed him, that his hands were in his waistcoat pocket; but he was quite in a flurry and fright at that time; I was not certain whether he said that his hands were in his pocket, or that he struck him. I searched the prisoner and found nothing about him. In company with Fogg we took him to the Compter, and the prosecutor went with us; in coming back; I thought the man would be more collected; he told me the same then, as he has here now. I do not mean to say that I saw the prisoner at the pawnbroker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and silversmith, of 3, Piccadilly, and was formerly for ten years salesman to Messrs. Streeter, during five years of which time the prisoner was also salesman there—these are a couple of agreements made between the prisoner and myself produced and dated 21st and 25th August, 1876, respectively; one is an agreement employing his ser<lb></lb>vices for three years and the other as to a loan by which the prisoner engaged to repay to me and his mother 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each which had been advanced to him. (<hi rend="italic">The agreement engaging the prisoners services stipulated that he should receive a salary of</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum, payable monthly, and a commission of</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">per cent, on sales, to have use of rooms on upper floor, dec.</hi>) The prisoner entered into my service as my salesman in pursuance of that agreement and had my confidence—his commission for six months, from 1st October, 1876, to 31st March, 1877, amounted to 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is a matter of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to me of the advance—I take stock of my own goods every six months, and those on sale or return I check every six or eight weeks—I keep a small book of each man's stock—when I was last stock taking I missed a small ring worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the first thing I missed; I did not pay much attention to that—on 28th August I was taking my approbation stock, and after going, through it I missed one pair of diamond earrings, value 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another diamond ring, value 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made search the whole day for those things—I spoke to the prisoner towards the evening—I said "I cannot find those things, I am going to search for them again," and he took hold of my hand and said "I took those and other things besides, more than you think of"—I said "How is it that I don't miss more?"—he said "When you were calling over I passed other articles than those you asked for"—I was calling a certain ring and he would pass another ring in the place of it—I then let him go upstairs while I went through the same stock, which I did with my boy to see what really was missing—after that I told him I missed a great many more rings and he said "Yes," and he handed me seventeen pawn tickets—I then took a little time for consideration and decided that I must give him into custody, and I went to Vine Street and stated the case to the sergeant there—a detective returned with me and he was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I did not get a list from Streeter of their customers and send round my circulars to them—I did not carry them in my head after ten years, I exhibited a letter of Mr. Streeter's in my office at Piccadilly—I was desirous in February, 1876, that Butlin should join me—the solicitors I employed were Messrs. Matthews and Co., of Bedford Row—their clerk was Mr. Swaine—I knew that the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I lent, and the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. his mother lent was to pay a pawnbroker a sum that had been advanced on certain goods; I knew Matthews and Co. as Butlin's solicitors only—I do not know that they were bringing actions against pawnbrokers that they might have to give up the property—the money was to be paid over to pawnbrokers to relieve certain goods,. some might belong to Mr. Webb, so that the money went to redeem property as early as February 1876—Butlin's salary was paid to him on the first of every month—he was given into custody on the 28th August—he had been paid on the 1st August—the time had not arrived for me to go through with him, the commission account from 31st March, 1877, up to the time of my giving him into custody—I had back 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the commission from 31st March up to the time I gave him in custody amounts to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—a lady to whom you allude put a large amount of money into my business, which I was to invest to the best of my ability in jewellery—she was always satisfied with my judgment, and her own being perhaps as good as mine, she satisfied me—a much larger</p>

               <p>sum than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was received by me from that lady of quality, for the purpose of buying a set of earrings, which were afterwards sold to a noble Marquis for 825<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those earrings were bought between us in partnership for 400/.—this lady did not care to give the credit, and I gave her a certain fixed sum down, as her profit on them viz., 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I taking the whole responsibility of the thing on myself—I was giving what 1 considered a long credit—I did not represent that those earrings had been bought for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when in fact I bought them 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not cause an invoice to be made out as if those earrings had been purchased from a person of the name of Abrahams, he cannot write—I have had lists made out, but never made use of them beyond my own business—Abraham's name was put in the list because he was a dealer—the articles were never bought for him; some articles were had from him—I have no recollection of asking Mr. Butlin to write the name of Abrahams and he declining saying "The lady will know my handwriting;" and I did not say "I will get Lanthal the boy to do it"—he did not say "It must open the eyes of the boy a great deal"—there is no partnership between the lady of quality and myself—I have the agreement for the loan here—I cannot recollect what the ring on the 12th March was pawned for—I have seen the tickets relating not only to ray property, but that of Messrs. Blogg and Martin—I have heard since that they entrusted the three rings to Butlin—I could not identify as to whose property it was when before Mr. Newton—I did not look over the articles and swear that Messrs. Blogg and Martin's were mine; I believe 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the amount for which the property belonging to me was pawned—the pawn-tickets referring to the Hon. Mrs. B.'s property were for the sums of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—it did not come to my knowledge until after this affair that the Hon. Mrs. B.'s property was absolutely lent, not to be redeemed until the month of October next—I did not know that Butlin was actually in treaty for a loan to be made for him in October—I know Mr. Lynch by sight; he was not a gentleman who promised to make a loan in October—I never permitted Butlin to wear the jewellry—I have never seen him wear anything in my presence, neither pin nor studs—I did not know that the ring and pin had been pledged over and over again and redeemed—I do not remember what you refer to by a moss agate box of the Hon. Mrs. B.'s being entrusted to me to sell; yes, there was something sold for her; Butlin sold it, he was entitled to commission on everything he sold—I do not think the box sold for anything like 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whatever price I returned to her I gave her a cheque for and she was perfectly satisfied—I had no diamond brooch belonging to Mrs. H., of St. John's Wood—I did not enter into any arrangement to make it up in rings and charge her just the price of the settings—with Mrs. B. I have had such transactions—the prisoner was not entitled to commission on those rings—the cost I returned to Mrs. B. of making up the rings was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think it cost more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—for the first twelve months I had implicit confidence in Butlin, and he was trusted with property to the amount of several thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the police-court I identified things only as my own and not others—Butlin was a very good salesman and I was anxious to secure his services—he was well known to persons who buy jewellery—the advertisement stated that he joined mo, not as a partner, but as an assistant—I said nothing to a contrary effect in the agreement—I did not draw the indictment; I left that to other people—I did not suggest that expression being put in stating that Butlin was a beneficial owner—I had not access to</p>

               <p>any of Streeter's books but my own sale book; I had no opportunity—there was a slight balance in my favour on the commission account between Butlin and myself—respecting the 825<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the earrings I gave twelve months credit and stood the whole risk, and the lady had returned to her 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. capital and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. capital was in my hands for a few months only—I took the difference, she having declined to give credit at all—there is do truth in the suggestion that I have made up a list of invoices in the name of Abrahams with the intention of doing it fraudulently—I have a book containing an account with each of my wholesale dealers of goods on sale and return—I have one relating to the rings in this indictment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one ring in April is struck out as returned, which I have since indentified at the pawnbroker's, and also a set of diamond studs is struck out as being returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Further cross-examined.</hi> The pawnbroker produces the ring of the 12th May. (<hi rend="italic">The pawnbroker's assistant did so.</hi>) I do not know that that is the ring referred to as being struck out—the ring, No. 1,256, with a pen run through it, is returned from Webb and Co.; the same people who brought the action for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is entered in January, 1877—I swear that is one of the rings; the number is scratched on it, that is how I identify it—there are three single-stone diamond studs entered in this book as 1,648—I do not think you would find 1,648 on so small a thing; they came from Webb and Co.—I kept one commission book and the prisoner kept one—I have not taken possession of everything in the upper part of the premises, 3, Piccadilly—there is 543<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd brought forward which I am giving him com<lb></lb>mission on—the previous half-year which he is to have the benefit of, I have credited him with 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Further re-examined.</hi> Butlin has never complained of my neglecting to account to him for commission—this is the first time that anything of the kind has ever been imputed to me—I have not got Mr. Butlin's com<lb></lb>mission book, and I do not know where it is.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Butlin had previously pledged this set of studs with Mr. Smith—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced on them—the retail value would be about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it might be a little less—I believe this to be the same set of studs we received on the first occasion, the 19th December, 1876—I am accustomed to see jewellery—the set of studs was redeemed on the 21st December, and were pledged again on the 28th of December, and redeemed again on the 30th—I believe they were the same—Butlin has pledged other property at our place—I cannot recollect as to a pin—I believe this gold Albert chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), to be the same that has been pledged on several occisions, six or seven times—I believe on every occasion he detached it from his watch—I believe the studs were not taken from his shirt front—I remember a diamond ring being pledged for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was pledged on the first occasion, on the 24th March, 1877, but I had pre<lb></lb>viously seen what I believed to be the same ring as this—it was not offered in pledge then, although some remarks had been made about it—he was not wearing it; it is a lady's ring—about October or November, 1876, we had a diamond pin in the window we valued at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which Butlin wanted to buy and spoke of pledging the ring in consequence, but we sold it to another customer before he made up his mind—he would redeem these articles from time to time mostly by money—I think the first transaction with him was concerning the pin—I do not recollect seeing him before that—I did not have these in October, 1876, to my knowledge.</p>

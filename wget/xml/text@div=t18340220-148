               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your master's shop is in Surrey? A. Yes - this is the print and the shawl, to the best of my belief - we have sold many of these - the pattern has been on the town about four months, and other shops have sold them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you took him, he told you you would find his wife there, and gave you his address? A. Yes - I do not know that the woman was his wife - Duke-street is the third or fourth turning down Stamford-street.</p>

Thompson, Ospringe, Kent" - I went to the Bank, and as I could not write, I asked a gentleman there to put my name on one of them, which he did, - I delivered them to the clerk, he gave them back to me, and Mr. Beetson gave me the money - I was going back, and when I got to the East India House, I asked one of the porters what the address on the note the prisoner gave me was; a man tapped me on the shoulder, and he went with me to the East India Chophouse - I do not know who he was - when I got there, the prisoner was not there; and the man who went with me said, "Sit down, he will be here in a minute" - the prisoner came in about two minutes - I gave him the money, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200090"></xptr>counted it, said it was all right, and gave me half-a-crown- I am quite sure it was the prisoner.</p>

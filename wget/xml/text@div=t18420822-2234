Rentes for him—I did not purchase them myself—I have here the leaves from the books of the house—the entries are not in my handwriting—I had daily access to them—on the 16th of October, 1836, we bought five Inscriptions, of 1000 francs each, which were delivered to Lord Hertford on the 23rd of April, 1838—I did not myself deliver them to him, but a person of the same name as myself, who is not here—these papers were given by that person, and brought back to us—Lord Hertford was in Paris at the time—they are signed by the Marquis—I know they are his handwriting—in January, 1837, he bought three certificates, of 1000</p>

I was formerly a banker—I am one of the executors of the late Lord Hertford—I was present, and was one of the exe<lb></lb>cutors that took possession of the effects after Lord Hertford's death—I was present when certain inscriptions were found—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some produced by Mr. Englebatt</hi>)—I have every reason to believe that these were found among the late Marquis's effects, because I see here are my remarks in pencil on some of them—when they were found they were sent to Messrs. Coutts—I did not take them—they were put into a box, which was con<lb></lb>veyed by Mr. Englebatt—these incriptions are all that have been found belonging to the late Lord Hertford—here are 27,000 francs per annum, Three per Cents., and 8,000 francs per annum, Five per Cents.—they are annuities—the value of the Three per Cents, would be about 1080<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and the Five per Cents. 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum; but to state correctly, I must know the market price—the Five per Cents, are at three years' purchase, and the Three per Cents, about 27 years' purchase—these were all the certificates of French stock to bearer that were found belonging to Lord Hertford in his lordship's box.</p>

My dear—, I have just received your kind letter, by which I perceive that I can reckon on your friendship, which I cannot too much appreciate, and of which I am proud to make myself worthy. Here is the plan which I had formed—to send, by Brussels, two fine horses, with their coachman and their harness. I intend buying from you one of those Brussels carriages, the same as that in which I have seen you drive so often with all your family, a kind of covered <hi rend="italic">char-a-banc</hi>. As to my plate, far from selling it here, I am having a service made here, for which I expect to pay the duty; but I shall draw back here the duty on re-exportation, which will cover that which I shall have to pay abroad. As to the stamp, I had no idea of it, as new plate; and I am ignorant whether, by Calais, it would be the same thing. My first idea is, that from Calais to Nancy the distance is double that from Brussels to Nancy. If, nevertheless, the same formalities do not exist by the way of France, I will send plate by Calais. In any case, that will not prevent my passing through Brussels; that is to say, from Calais I shall go to you. That cannot in any case be before the month of June next. I shall not be ready before that time. I reckon on your kindness until then. If you can give me other information, have that kindness. Pray present my re<lb></lb>spectful duty to Madame, and dispose of him who will be all his life, with high consideration, your sincere and very devoted friend, <hi rend="smallCaps">SUISSE</hi>.—A mil<lb></lb>lion of thanks to M. Felice for the good opinion he has of me, and of the preference he gives me. I am sincerely grateful for it; but at my age, and with sufficient for me and mine, one must be more than mad to go into business, and spoil so fine an independence.

I am a native of France—I am twenty-four years of age—I lived with the late Marquis of Hertford between seven and eight years, from the age of sixteen—I always travelled with him on the continent—when in England I resided in apartments, which were provided by Suisse on the Marquis's account—the Marquis paid for them—I slept at Dorchester-house—I went from my apartments to Dorchester-house, and slept with the Marquis there—I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220047"></xptr>
               <p>very often in the habit of dining at Dorchester-house—I know the Count and Countess Zichy by name—I have seen them at Dorchester-house—when the Count and Countess Zichy dined at Dorchester-house, I dined at home, and then went in the evening—I have often dined with Mr. Croker at Dorchester-house—Suisse has sometimes come to my apart<lb></lb>ments to fetch me to Dorchester-house, and after stopping there the night, I went away in the morning—the Marquis bad an attack of the gout in 1840—bis health and constitution appeared to be very much affected after that illness—some time before his death he was affected with a spasm in his throat, which at times made it difficult to understand him—Suisse was in the habit of constantly attending on the Marquis—he appeared to pos<lb></lb>sess his confidence—the Marquis appeared to entertain a very great regard for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether Suisse was called up frequently during the night to attend on the Marquis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard him ring for him three or four times in the course of the night, and Suisse has come directly on the bell being rung—I cannot say whether the Marquis had such confi<lb></lb>dence in Suisse as scarcely to do anything without consulting him—Suisse paid the money in travelling—he has advanced sums of money to the Marquis out of his own funds—I received a private allowance from the Marquis—that was at times paid by Suisse—my expenditure was 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that was not besides the private allowance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you wanted 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were you in the habit of asking Suisse for it, and getting it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have sometimes asked from Suisse, and sometimes from the Marquis—I have got it from Suisse when I have asked—I have now an income of 15,000 francs a-year derived from the bounty of the Marquis—Suisse's attendance on the Marquis became more neces<lb></lb>sary as he advanced in years—I have heard Suisse, in the Marquis's pre<lb></lb>sence, speak of his kindness and bounty to him—he has said, that, thanks to the Marquis's kindness, he had become a very rich man—I remember being at Paris with the Marquis and Suisse in October, 1841—the Marquis had promised me, when in Italy, to buy me a house at Paris—no sum was mentioned as the price of the house—we were about to leave Paris for Lon<lb></lb>don at that time, and I said that unless the Marquis gave me the money he had promised for the purchase of this house I would not leave with him—there was no box on the table where the Marquis was sitting—the Mar<lb></lb>quis offered me some coupons at that time, which he took from a box on the table—I refused them, because I did not know the value of them—I received the money for the purchase of the house from the Marquis that same day—it was 211,000 francs—Suisse afterwards said something to me on the subject—I did not mention to the Marquis what Suisse had told me—I asked the Marquis what was the amount of coupons that he had given to Suisse—that was not in consequence of my conversation with Suisse; it was one or two days afterwards that I mentioned it to the Marquis in travelling—after having told him the use I had made of the money, the subject of the coupons came into my memory, and I then spoke about them, and asked of what value the coupons were which he had given to Suisse—(Suisse had told me the Marquis had given them to him)—he said above 100,000 francs, and that he had given them to Suisse—I returned to England with the Marquis, and continued to live with him until December, 1841.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to leave the Marquis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to see him earlier</p>

               <p>than usual one day, and seeing another woman, of the name of Henrietta, there, I would not live with him any longer—the Marquis came to my lodging once after, but did not come up stairs—he came to fetch me to go into the country, and I refused—that was two months before his death, in December—I saw the Marquis twice since January—I received 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him for a carriage that belonged to me—I received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in two cheques, from Suisse on the Marquis's account.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you leave England, after having come over in October? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the end of December—I then went to Paris—I re<lb></lb>mained there some days—I cannot recollect How many—I then came back to London at the end of January—I left London again, I think about July—I was in London from January to July this year—I left Lon<lb></lb>don towards the end of July—on leaving London I went to Paris—I cannot say to the precise time—it was in July—I remained in Paris until I came to England the last time—I asked the Marquis when in the carriage the value of the coupons which he had given to Suisse, and his answer was, "Above 100,000 francs, and I have given them to Suisse"—this conversation took place on leaving Paris—Miss Dubois, one of my friends, was in the carriage—Miss Dubois was not in Paris with me after my return in July last—nothing else was said on the subject of the coupons—I arrived in England last on Sunday—I came to England alone, with a servant—I was not examined at Paris in July last—I do not exactly know at what time it was—I had not said anything on the subject of the coupons before this conversation—we were some relays from Paris when this passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With whom did you communicate on this subject before yon came here to give your evidence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nobody—I was in England at the time of the last trial on the 6th of July—no one had spoken to me on this subject, nor as to my giving evidence, before that trial—I was not in attendance here at the last trial—I was attending as a witness in the neighbourhood—I received a paper to attend—I do not know from whom I received it—I was living in the Rue de Provence in Paris before I came to England this last time—I have never gone by any other name—I swear that positively.</p>

I left Paris with her and the Mar<lb></lb>quis of Hertford in that month—at that time I had known the Marquis seven years—I travelled during a year with the Marquis and Miss Borel, to London and to Italy—after we left Paris in the carriage I heard Miss Borel ask the Marquis what was the amount of the coupons which be had given to Suisse—the Marquis's answer was that it was above 100,000 francs, and that he had given them to Suisse—I had not myself had any conversation with Suisse about them—I had not the same acquaintance with Suisse as Miss Borel had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and reside in Piccadilly. I attended the Marquis of Hertford as his medical attendant—I had been in the habit of attending him altogether about twenty-three years—prior to that, it was only occasionally, when my father was living—I saw him constantly, from the early part of October, 1841, to the time of his death—I was in Court when Foote stated the nature of the Marquis's</p>

               <p>bodily infirmities—he has stated them slightly—the Marquis's ordinary state of constitutional health was a semi-paralytic state of certain organs—it was that which led to the trouble that Suisse and Foote had with him, but that was not the cause of the illness under which his lordship died—he did not die from the paralytic seizure—I know nothing of his visit to Rich<lb></lb>mond except having heard of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what period was he taken ill with that illness which led to his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not correctly the beginning of an illness—it was a relapse—he had had <hi rend="italic">bronchitis</hi> for many weeks, and he was beginning to rally on the 4th of February; indeed, so much so, that he began to con<lb></lb>sider of going abroad again—I was in the habit of making up things for him when he went abroad, which he told me to prepare for him about the 4th of February—I cannot exactly tell the day of his going to Richmond, but I remember so far, that he was then getting so far better that I asked him to begin to think of getting into the library, that we might get him out if there was any fine weather—I was at that time seeing him daily, and it was after that return, he had a relapse of the <hi rend="italic">bronchitis</hi> from which he never recovered—I think it was about the 18th of February that he was seized with the relapse—Suisse was taken ill about the 14th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary I think, but not so as to be confined for some few days—it was an attack of erysipelas of the neck and external part of the chest, terminating in abscesses, that confined him to his bed for a considerable period—he was confined to his bed at the time of the Marquis's death, and I should think about twelve days before, but I cannot speak positively at this moment, but I think it was twelve days within a day or two—I saw the Marquis almost constantly from October to the end of March.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So far as his mind was concerned, was he, in your judgment, capable of attending to his affairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I considered him sane, certainly—it never entered into my mind to doubt that he was competent to attend to his affairs—on the last trial I was examined as a witness for the prosecution.</p>

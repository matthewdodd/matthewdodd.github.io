                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 231.) At half past 12 o'clock at night, on 1st June, I was on duty at South Minims, near the premises of the Rev. Charles Thompson—Copper was with me, he has a key to Mr. Thompson's premises—we heard a noise, and Cooper opened the door with his key, went in, and called out, "Here they are"—Mr. Thompson leaves the key at the station that the police may go in, as it is rather a lonesome place—when Cooper called out, "Here they are," I ran into the garden at the back of the house—I saw Cooper running after the prisoner—I saw him knock him down with his truncheon—I ran and took him, I found on him this chisel, which corresponds with marks on a window which had been forced open—it had been entered by a ladder thirty rounds high—on going to the front of the house, I found the iron crating over the cellar window had been forced up, and the staples wrenched off, and there were marks inside as if some person had been going down the cellar stairs—these two lucifer matches were found in the cellar—I saw no person but the prisoner, he had no hat or cap on—I found this cap in the garden, and Cooper found this hat.</p>

               <p>I pursued, and he turned and struck at me with his hand—I followed him to the bottom of the garden, and just as he was getting through the rails, I, and over the hedge, I knocked him down with my truncheon—I found in the ground this augur—this chisel was found on the prisoner, and this knife about five yards from the house—this boot was found in the garden, and this other boot, which is the fellow to it, was found in another house which was broken open at Potters'-bar, about two miles and a half from where we were—the prisoner had got his own boots on—this cap the prisoner owned—there was a ladder up against the window—when I went round at 11 o'clock, the same ladder was on the ground against the garden gate—there was no ladder against the house then—the cellar grating was quite right at 11 o'clock—Mr. Thompson's house is close to the church, and there we some almshouses for old women, and no other dwellings near—it is about fourteen miles from London—I do not know the prisoner, but I had seen him and another in the village about half past 10 o'clock that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to the Key. Charles Thompson. On the evening of 1st June, I fastened the water closet window, and the whole house was fastened quite safe; the grating and all was safe—I was alarmed about half past 12 o'clock—the water closet window was up as high as it could be—there were no marks of any one going in there, but there were marks down the steps under the grating—there was nothing taken away—these lucifer matches were found in the cellar—they had not been there before, and they were not similar matches to what we use.</p>

            . I am a marshal's man. Mr. Tyrrell, jun. employed me to watch the prisoner - I attended by the house, Cadman called me - I saw the prisoner a short distance from the door, with a loaf in her apron, under her arm, and a basket in her hand - I asked if she had come from Mr. Tyrrell's? she asked</p>
               <p>"Why?" I said she might give me a civil answer: she said</p>
               <p>"Then I will go back." I went back with her - she went into the scullery, put the basket down, and said I had no business there: I said I must see what she had there. I found the loaf in her apron, and in the basket were sixteen candles; three pieces of soap, some starch, blue, pepper, ginger, and about a pound of fresh butter; a paper, containing a pound and a half or two pounds of dripping, two sausages, and some broken bread - I found a pocketbook,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070063"></xptr>on her person, with a bill of the articles, the total amount of them is 4 s. 2 d. I went into the larder next day, and found a blue handkerchief, containing some victuals, and some beef, which appeared to have been cut off with a knife.</p>

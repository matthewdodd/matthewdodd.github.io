On Saturday night, the 6th of May, my husband came home, be<lb></lb>tween ten and eleven o'clock, drunk—we had a few words respecting his rela<lb></lb>tions—I rather provoked him, and was quite as much in fault as he was—I went towards the door—he followed me into the yard, and hit me in the face with his hand or fist, I am not sure which—I believe I took a piece of wood off the paling, and attempted to throw it at him, and he struck me twice with it on the side of my head—it did not knock me down—I was down at the time—I was not knocked down, I fell—I think I must have kicked my foot against a stone—my head felt very painful, and bled a great deal—I thought</p>

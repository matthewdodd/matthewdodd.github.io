            . On Wednesday the 23d of June I was coming from Coventry in a post chaise, in company with Mr. Colberg; when we came very near the third mile stone, between <placeName id="t17730707-21-crimeloc123">Highgate</placeName>

I had concealed my watch; I told him I had none; then said he your pocket book! I told him I had never a one; then he demanded our rings; I gave him a mourning one; then he went round again to Mr. Colberg, and demanded his watch, and I believe he gave him more money; then he returned again to me, and said d - n you, I will search you; he opened the door of the chaise and saw a red trunk between my legs; he said he would have it; he took it out of the chaise with great violence, and then called to his companion, and they both went off with it.</p>

               <p>Dadley. More than a quarter of an hour in the whole, and during the whole of the time the prisoner continued by the side of the shaft horse, and not having any thing over his face, I was able to make a perfect observation of his person. I called at the first public house I came at, and gave an alarm of the robbery, and then made all the haste I could to Sir

There was found in his pocket a large key; he was asked what that was the key of; he said his lodgings; he was asked where his lodgings were; he said he had forgot. I spoke very positively to his person, and he said I was mistaken; he was asked then, if I was mistaken where he was; he said that he had been that evening, a quarter before eleven, at the Ship ale-house, in Bambridge-street, St. Giles's, in company with a person whose name was Clarke, a shoe-maker, with whom he had no great acquaintance, and did not know where he was to be found. I afterwards saw him again at Sir John's, on Wednesday, and I gave then the same account in substance I have given now, and he was then asked what defence he had to make.</p>

            . I was in company with the last witness on Wednesday evening the 23d of June. On our return from Coventry, in a chaise with four horses, we were accosted, on the road near the three mile stone, by two footpads that were on the cause-way; they booted, stop hollow; on which the post boys stopped their horses; two men immediately jumped off the cause-way, and one came to one side of the chaise, and the other to the other: one was a short thick fat man, with no disguise, but only his hat flapped before; the other was a lustier man, taller, and had something of a crape round his face; it was then pretty near eleven o'clock; there was no moon, but the hemisphere was pretty light; we could distinguish particularly. The prisoner very much represents the person who went to the shafts of the horse on the side where I was; he did not utter a word; the other came up to the chaise and demanded our money or our lives, and swore several violent oaths to the prisoner, and said what was the reason he did not come on the other side and plunder me. Mr. Dadley gave him some money; he said d - n you, these are all halfpence, give me your gold and silver; he clapped a pistol to Mr. Dadley's breast; I then, to prevent his doing any mischief, immediately gave him two guineas; he then demanded our watches and rings; we told him we had none; he then came to my side and demanded my money; I gave him a guinea, a sixpence, and a penny; he demanded my watch and rings; I told him I had none; he then swore, d - n you, we will not be trifled with, give me your watches; we said we had none; then Mr. Dadley gave him a gold ring; he asked if we had any more; we said no; he asked for our pocket books; I gave him a bill case, in which there was a receipt; he then went on the other side and opened the door, and he saw a little trunk; he snatched it out in a hurry, and said, d - n me, here is the booty; we said there was nothing of consequence in it, he might look at it; he then called the other; they took the trunk behind the chaise, and then bid us drive on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see which way they went?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070034"></xptr>Colberg. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You only speak to the resemblance, you cannot swear to him?</p>
               <p>Colberg. No; it is a very great resemblance. I went in the coach afterwards with Mr. Dadley and Sir John's men to Hornsey, and, on our return, Clark said there goes Plunket; I looked at him, and said he resembled the man that stood by the shaft horse. I forgot to mention, when we went to lay the information, I described the person to be a short thick man of a blackish complexion, and Sir John said it was Plunket; Sir John said, did he speak; I said no, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Hornsey, did you find the trunk?</p>
               <p>Colberg. Yes.</p>

            . I went with Dadley and Colberg to Hornsey; on coming back, a little on this side the turnpike, I saw Plunket, and said to Clarke there goes Plunket. One of the gentlemen looked out of the coach and said that was one of the men that robbed them. We got out of the coach and went after him, and told him there were two gentlemen in the coach wanted to speak to him; he came with us to the coach; I asked the gentlemen if they thought he was one of the men; they were both of opinion he was; they were sure he was; we put him into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was in the coach had you any conversation with him?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I asked him where he was going; he joked, and said upon the scamp, where do you think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing else to him?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation passed?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He said he kept out of the way of the bailiffs that week; he said he would sooner go with us any where than with the bailiffs; I asked him if he had any pops about him; he said yes, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. I wonder as he had these things about him you did not search him?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He could do nothing with them. When we came to Sir John's I searched him, and found a brace of pistols upon him and a key ( producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Nothing then, there was no justice there; the clerk ordered him to gaol; the gentlemen were in the office; I shewed the pistols to them.</p>

               <p>On Friday when I was taken I was brought to Sir John's; Sir John was not there, therefore Mr. Bond, his clerk, took upon him to examine me; I told him I could bring sufficient persons to prove where I was drinking on Wednesday night; he said do not think on proving where you was, these people have sworn to you, turn evidence; I think you are a man capable of getting your bread. When I was examined before the Justice, the Justice asked what I had to say; I said I had persons to prove where I was, and Sir John made a laugh at it, and said the people had sworn against me. When I was brought up on the Wednesday following, I was asked what I had to say; I told Sir John it did not signify saying there, he had made a laugh at it, I would appeal to a higher court, and now, my Lord, I have evidence to prove where I was drinking that night. They swore before Sir John it was half after ten, now they say it was eleven when they were robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did you say before Sir John it was half after ten when you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I am persuaded it was eleven or more.</p>

            . I am a victualler, at the Ship, in Bambridge-street, St. Giles's: I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at your house on Wednesday the 23d of June?</p>
               <p>Murphy. As near as I can recollect he came into my house last Wednesday fortnight: I am no scholar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came to your house?</p>
               <p>Murphy. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come?</p>
               <p>Murphy. Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay there?</p>
               <p>Murphy. He staid till better than half after ten: I generally shut up my shop by eleven or five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether he staid till you had shut your shop?</p>
               <p>Murphy. No, he did not stay so long.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain that he staid till more than half after ten?</p>
               <p>Murphy. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Murphy. I heard he was taken up on Friday that makes me remember the day, for the man that was drinking with him came of the Monday after, and said the man he was drinking with at my house was taken up. There were five of them in company that night:

               <p>Murphy. The three men were drinking, and the prisoner and Shaw came in together just as I was lighting the candles.</p>

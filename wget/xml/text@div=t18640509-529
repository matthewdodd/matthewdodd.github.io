                  </hi>. I am a militia-man, and live at Parson's-green, Fulham—on Monday morning, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> April, there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> going on in the lane near my house—two or three persons were setting on my father; the prisoner was one of them—I went and pulled the prisoner off, and got my father away—the prisoner followed us, and said that as I pulled him off my father he would have it out of me—he said to my father, "I will not touch you, but I will catch hold of your bson"—he made a bounce at me, and I put up my leg to stop him—I was then at my own door, and he ran in at me, but I got away then—he did not hit me then, but he had a long thing in his hand about a foot long—my mother hallooed out, "He has got something in his hand"—he gave the long thing to another person, and then he put his hand in his pocket, making a noise in his pocket—he ran in at me in the passage, caught hold of me, and I thought he was punching me, but he was stabbing me all the time—he gave me five on the head, one on the ear, one on the neck, and one on the left side—I felt blood coming, and hallooed out, "Father, I am stabbed"—I had eight stabs altogether; seven of them after I was down, and when I hallooed "Murder!" he gave me another, and chucked the knife away—I was ill from the stabs, and was in the hospital nine days—the doctor attends me now.</p>

               <p>my mother was outside my door, holding a candle about five yards off—it is a small street—I was in bed when account came that my father was in a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and I got up, and put my working clothes on—I put up my foot, and ticked at the prisoner before I was stabbed, but I did not kick him—he swore by the cross that he would have my life that night, and heaved a stone at me—I do not know what it was he took out of his pocket, but I think it was a poker, he afterwards took out a penknife; I saw him pull it out—my father was quite sober—I heard that the people were punching him, and went and pulled the prisoner off him—this was Saturday night; my father is a labourer, and had received his wages—my mother had gone to bed, and so had I—the prisoner said that he would have my life, about the same time that he passed the poker to the other man—I was frightened of course—I swear that my father did not attack the prisoner; he never touched him—the prisoner left me because I hallooed out that I was stabbed; he got up, and ran out into the street, and said, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed," but he was not; it was me that was stabbed—he stabbed me with a pocket-knife—I struggled with him to try to get away from him—I had not the knife in my hand—I tried to get it away from him, but it was no use—he chucked away the knife, and my mother picked it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Keefe, of Crown-street, Parson's-green, and am the mother of the last witness—on Sunday morning, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> April, between 12 and 1, I heard a noise in the road, and talking—I had not gone to bed—I took a candle out in my hand—my son and the prisoner met in the passage—Tracey went outside the door, and drew something out of his pocket which was very glazed, but what it was I could not see—I said, "Police! he will murder us all"—he then put his hand in his pocket, crossed to the door, and he and my boy met in the passage; the boy raised his leg to give him a kick, and said, "Father, father, I am <hi rend="italic">stuck"</hi>—the father then came, and the knife flew across my face; I picked it up—I saw it cross my face from Tracey's hand, and afterwards gave it to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Fulham—on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> April I was sent for to attend the prosecutor in Crown-street—I found four distinct incised wounds on his head, made by cutting, one on his right ear, one on his neck, and one on his left side—he was weak and exhausted from loss of blood—the wounds were in dangerous places, and might have proved dan<lb></lb>gerous; for instance, the wound in his side might have penetrated his chest—I only saw him that once, and recommended his being removed to the hospital—the wounds might be caused by this knife—I went to the station-house the same night and examined the prisoner—he was not drunk; he had a slight wound on his face, and one on his hand—I do not think they were caused by any instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the wounds in themselves dangerous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A punctured wound in the chest is always dangerous, because you cannot tell whether it has punctured the chest or not—I did not examine the wound in the side, because if it had nearly punctured the chest, I might have produced an injury by doing so—the wounds on the head went nearly to the bone, and were caused by a short instrument—there must have been a good deal of force used; the cartilage of the ear was divided in two. <hi rend="italic">The prisoner received a good character.</hi>—</p>

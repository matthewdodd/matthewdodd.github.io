                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBERTS</hi>. I am a registrar in the Seamen's Office, and live at 25, Chester Street, Kennington—on Saturday, 11th September, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was in the White Bear, Kennington Road, in the skittle<lb></lb>lley—I hung my coat on a peg—I washed my hands before leaving, and then went in and saw Billington with his hand in the pocket of my coat, which bung on a nail—I said. "You are picking my pocket," and struck him, but not to mark him"—he cried out "Oh! and Buras, who was there, struck me a violent blow on the nose—I put my coat to and escaped out at the door, and Burns gave me another blow in the same place—I then got outside, and they both came out and seized me and knocked me about, and I called out—I was smothered with blood—it was dart, and I could not see—I went to the bar, and the people there wiped the blood from my face, end then I missed my watch and chain, which I had handled a minute before I went in for my coat, and I believe I looked at the time—I also missed a pocket-book, a pipe, and some tobacco—not a thing was left in my pockets—the waiter came up to me when I cried out, and as soon as the prisoners saw him they escaped up the yard—I am sure these are the men—I had had no drink to hurt; no more than usual; three or four glasses—one man struck me in the place, but I do not know how many struck me outside—I only saw the prisoner in the place, bat there may have been another man—I went there between 6 and 7 o'clock, but only sat down and watched—they all seemed very respectable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where had you been to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only had a walk—I was watching these people play from 6 or 7 o'clock to between 11 and 12 o'clock—I do not know that I had more than three glasses of ale, and no spirits—I did play at skittles—there were a dozen persons in the skittle</p>

               <p>ground at one time or another, but <hi rend="italic">only</hi> these to when I went in for my coat—the others had gone when I returned from washing my hands—I looked at my watch after I had washed my hands—I passed nobody else.—Billington remained in the skittle-alley after I told him he was picking my pocket—I was blind, and cannot say whether he came up to mo again—the prisoners were the only two who I saw follow me out; if there were any others they must have been concealed—I did not see either of them touch my waistcoat—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket—it was dark, and I do not know which of them took my watch—Burns came into the skittte. ground a little before this happened—he was there when I went in for my coat—there arc two skittle-alleys, but I did not know of the other one—the prisoners were both where my coat was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the skittle-ground open to the road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They can go in from the road, or from the bar—I played at skittles for half an hour, and my coat was hanging up the whole time I was playing—I swear that nobody struck me but the two prisoners—they took the watch and chain outside—I put my coat on before I struck Billington, and then found that I had nothing in my pockets, but my watch was in my waistcoat—when I found I had lost everything, I struck Billington—I did not call the waiter then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LINGFOBD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In order to reach the skittle-alley, have you to go up a garden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there is a back door at the top of the garden, leading to the bar—I only saw the two prisoners about me after I was struck. <hi rend="italic">Billington.</hi> My coat was hanging by the side of yours, and when I put it on you came and laid hold of me, and said, "I accuse you of putting your hand in my pocket" I said if you think so, search me," and you tore the sleeve out of my coat, and struck me on the nose, and nearly knocked me senseless. I had my hat knocked off, and somebody, I believe it was Charles, the waiter, said, "Whose hat is this?" I said, "It is mine." He said, "Where is that gentleman's hat?—I said, "I don't know, I be<lb></lb>lieve I threw it somewhere." Anybody can go into this ground. It began to rain, and I went home to bed. I went into the City so see for employ<lb></lb>ment, and pasted the police-station two or three times, and the policeman took me in charge. You were washing yourself against the kitchen door, where there were half-a-dozen round you. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, that was after I had lost my watch, I was washing the blood off.</p>

                  </hi>, I am waiter at the White Bear—the skittle ground is about thirty yards from the road—on Saturday night, 11th September, between 4 and 8 o'clock, Mr. Roberts came in and played at skittles occasionally till 11.30—Burns came in about 10.45—I had never seen him before—about 11.30 or 11.40 I heard cries for help, and a dog barking, and I saw the prisoner and Billington engaged in a scuffle, and as I came out Burns ran down the path—after that I picked up a hat—Burns then came back, up the yard, and passed through the bar—he pushed his way through everybody, and Mr. Roberts happened to stand first—that was while Roberts was having the blood washed off his fuel—I gave bock the hat to Billington, and Billington picked up Mr. Roberts' hat, which was a sort of alpaca one—nobody was running away—I called the potman, and told him to stop that man (<hi rend="italic">Billington</hi>) as he had got Mr. Roberts' hat—he had his own hat then, he had pitched it behind, in the water-butt—I have known Billington three years—I thought he was going to steal the hat, because he had his own at the same time, and therefore he knew it was not his—Roberts appeared sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose there were several people in the skittle-ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know, I think not—I was called by Roberta' ones; but did not go into the skittle-ground, only to the door—it was dark, 11.30—this was in the pathway leading to the back premises—I saw no one with Roberts but Billington; but Burns was just leaving him—he went towards the back premises—I saw his face, he passed close to me, and ran away from me, from the back door towards the back premises—he came back after—that was when he scuffled up against Roberts, when I heard the cry, and saw Roberts and Billington and a man running away—that man's back was towards me—about the time that Roberts went into the public-house, to wash his face, Burns passed—I feed sure that Roberts was not the worse for drink; if he was, it was not perceptitle—I said before the Magistrate that if he was the worse for drink it was slight—he had beer during the six hours he was at our house; but there were several others to drink it—I did not serve him—I only judge from His manner, when he had the blow.</p>

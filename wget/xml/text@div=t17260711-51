             thus depos'd. About eight in the Evening, I came from my Lord Berkley's at Cranford, where I received 4 Guineas of his Steward. I came to my Inn the Rose at Holbourn-bridge, about one a Clock in the Morning, but the People being all gone to Bed, I thought of going to the 
Bolt and Tun in Fleet-street. But as I was walking along <placeName id="t17260711-51-crimeloc225">Shoe Lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17260711-51-crimeloc225" type="placeName" value="Shoe Lane"></interp>

And so she led me up Stairs into her Room, and we sat down upon the Bed together; I staid with her 2 or 3 Hours, and no body came near us, but the good Woman of the House, when she brought the Liquor we call'd for. I think I spent about 5 or 6 Shillings in Drams, which I paid for as they come in, the 4 Guineas were wrapt in a piece of Paper, I took them out with my other Money, and put them up again into my Fob, but I had not been long upon the Bed with her, before I mist'em. I told her of it, and she ran down into the Street, and I after her, and the Constable stopt her, and when she was searched, my Handkerchief and Pocket Book, the 4 Guineas, and the Paper that they were wrapt in, were all found upon her, and near her.</p>
               <p>The Constable thus depos'd. The Prisoner was running along the Street, and the Country Man after her as fast as he could, for he was very drunk, they rais'd a Mob between them. I stopt her, she let one Guinea fall, another I took out of her Hand, and 2 more out of her Mouth, and the Pocket Book and Handkerchief, were found upon hers.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence. When the Prosecutor met me, he was very drunk, and would needs follow me in Doors. He took out the 4 Guineas, thrust them down my Bosom one by one, and then he threw me upon the Bed, and as we were struggling together, his Pocket Book fell out of his Pocket as I suppose, for the Minute he was gone down Stairs I found it, and ran after him, to give it him again, and then he said I had pickt his Pocket. <rs id="t17260711-51-verdict226" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Turner, who is a soldier, and lives in Portman-mews. We occupy one bed-room—Mrs. Sharp is the landlady—she does notlive in the house—I take in washing—on the Tues<lb></lb>day before Christmas, I hung up in the front garret, which was empty, and belongs to the landlady, six shirts, a pair of pillow-cases, a pair of sheets, and a table-cloth; I locked the room, and took the key down stairs—I did not go to the room again till the Saturday, when I missed four shirts, a pair of pillow-cases, a linen sheet, and a table-cloth—the door was un<lb></lb>locked at the time—the prisoner had lodged with me in my room about three weeks, when this occurred—I missed them between one and two o'clock on Saturday—she slept there on Saturday night—and after she was gone to bed, in consequence of suspicions, I searched her pockets, and found a duplicate of the articles—I charged her with it—she said she had done it, and must abide by it—I went to the pawnbroker's on the Satur<lb></lb>day—they denied having the things—they said they were not there in pledge—I went on Monday morning, and they said they had not taken them in, to their knowledge—I then produced the duplicate, and found the things there—the prisoner bore a good character.</p>

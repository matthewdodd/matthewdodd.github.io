                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live at 230, High Street, Shadwell—on Monday, 8th August, about midnight, I was in Betts Street, St. George's—I was tipsy—when I came out of a public-house I saw Maloney, whom I asked the way to Charles Street—he took me up the street—he had hold of one arm and Sullivan the other—another person came behind me—I did not recognize him—he put his hands into my pocket and took three shillings—I called out "Thieves!"—they ran away—a policeman, standing at the corner, went after them, and brought them back towards me—Maloney and Sullivan are the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Sullivan. Q.</hi> How could you identify me if you were drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I saw you—I recognize you by your face—I saw you all together, in the street, before—I had spent 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Maloney.</hi> When at the station you told the inspector that you had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187008150008"></xptr>
               <p>but you could not say whether it was English or Belgian money, and he told you to say English.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 84). About midnight I saw the prisoners in Betts Street—they came, running through Cable Street, and the prosecutor ten or fifteen yards behind them—he came up and spoke to me, and I ran after them, caught Sullivan, and brought him back, and Sims said "That is the man"—Sullivan said "You have made a mistake"—I said "No, I have not."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Sullivan. Q.</hi> When I was coming down Cable Street you were going up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, no, you ran up Cannon Street, and I came behind and chased you through Cannon Street, and never lost sight of you—you dodged under a place where the. railway is being repaired, and when I came up to you, you accused me of making a mistake; but I said "No, I know you by the plaid scarf"—you were about five yards in front of me, and ceased running, to get through the crowd—I followed as quickly as I could—you walked then, because you thought you were safe when you had got through the crowd.</p>

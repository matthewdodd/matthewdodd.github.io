I am a constable, attached to the Post-office—I was present at this conversation—I afterwards went to 33, Dorchester-street, and saw the prisoner's wife—she took a cash-box from a drawer in the bed-room, and was about opening it with a key—I asked her to give me the key, opened it, and found there a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which I took to the Post-office and showed it to Mr. Gardiner.</p>

I said, "Very likely there will be a reward for this," and kept it. If I had stolen it, is it likely that I should have kept it? I did not steal it, or know it was stolen, nor did I receive it from anybody. I was in hopes I should get a reward by keeping it, but I never saw any advertisement</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Harle, of 23 Trafalgar-row, Walworth-road—the prisoner and his wife lodged in our house—they occupied the first floor, and I occupied the lower floor—there was no one else lodging in the house—on Monday evening, 23d May, I came home between 8 and 9 o'clock—the prisoner was at home; his wife was not—he went out shortly afterwards—she came home to the best of my recollection about 10 o'clock—her mother and father came with her, and a little girl, a younger sister—they came into my room and asked if I would allow them to sit down and rest awhile; and they stopped there until half-past 1 in the morning—the prisoner did not come home again until after they were gone—in the meantime, the prisoner's wife left my room, and went up-stairs to her own room and fetched down a few things, some trinkets and clothes, and asked my permission to let them stay there until the morning, as she was afraid they would be sold to the brokers—(I had been informed when I came home between 8 and 9, that there was a broker in the house)—she had to break open the room door in order to get in—the brokers were not there then, they went away soon after I returned, about 9 o'clock—I heard the prisoner lock the door a few minutes afterwards, and he came down stairs and went out—no other person that I know of, had been in the house after the brokers went, before I heard the door locked—when the prisoner's wife came down with the trinkets, she remained in my room until the prisoner came home; that must have been about a quarter to 2—it was shortly after the mother and father had left—I had no clock in the house—the prisoner had a key; he could not get the key in the door and I went and opened it—he apologised for leaning against the door, and I said "I beg your pardon Mr. Moore, perhaps I have given you the wrong key"—he thanked me and went tip stairs—he came down again, knocked at the door, and asked me to give him a light—I went to do so—he came partly into the room, and my husband said, "Walk in Mr. Moore," and with that he saw his wife sitting on the sofa—he said, "Oh, are you here?"—she did not make any answer but looked round, and she was crying—he said, "Well, this will be the last night you will be here, and to morrow the children are going away where they will be taken care of," or, "well done by"—those were two children by his former wife who were living with the; mthey were then up stairs in bed in the back room; one is about</p>

               <p>twelve, and the other eight or nine—he then rather took me to task about the children, and asked why I had taken the unwarrantable liberty of putting them out of the room, and said, "To morrow I will pay you your paltry rent that I owe you"—there was a fortnight's rent owing at that time—he he asked who broke open the door, his wife answered," I did; who had a better right than your wife?"—he said, "A wife you are in every sense of the word"—he then said to my husband, "As to talking to you, you are a perfect fool; I am a worldly man, and a man such as you I could twist round my little finger and think nothing of"—he then went up stairs and shortly after he returned again, knocked at the door and said, "Mr. and Mrs. Harle, if you harbour my wife in your room this night, I consider you will be both worse than her"—he went up stairs and came down again shortly after, and said, "Mrs. Moore, your place is up stain; there is your room to go to, it is not likely I am going to sleep under the same roof and you sleeping in another person's bed while I am sleeping under the same roof; do you hear Mrs. Moore"—she said, "Yes, I will come"—he said, "If you give the preference to go and sleep at your mother's, I will escort you round there"—he then went up stairs—she made no answer to him—she said to me, "I am afraid to go round to my mother's"—he did not hear that—she followed him up stairs almost directly—I heard nothing more of them during the night; everything was perfectly quiet; we listened to hear—it must have been very near 3 o'clock when she went up stairs, it was break of day—I heard nothing more until I was awoke by Mrs. Moore patting me on the cheek—I think it must have been past 7 o'clock; I was hardly awake at the time—she said, "Good morning, I am so cold"—I was in bed—she was dressed—she staid about two minutes; whether she went up stairs or into the yard I don't know; she went to have a wash—in three or five minutes she came down stairs again and asked my permission to go and get a comb or brush to do her hair—she went into the front-parlour, and hearing the prisoner coming down stairs she popped into the back-parlour again, holding the door in her hand—she was scarcely a second in the front-parlour—he came and knocked at my door, saying, "Mrs. Moore come out of that woman's room, do you hear"—she said, "Yes, I will come"—he said, "Mrs. Harle if you harbour her there, I shall consider you are worse than her; do you hear, Mrs. Moore?"—she said, "Yes, I am coming;" and she went out and went up-stairs again—I suppose hardly three minutes elapsed before I heard her say, "Ah, do if you dare, "attended with an hysterical scream—and she came running down into my room with her hand to her back, saying, "Oh! my back" as well as she could speak—I took hold of her by the shoulder, sat up in bed, and said, "Has he hit you, dear?"—she said, "He has either <hi rend="italic">sticked</hi> or <hi rend="italic">kicked</hi> me"—I could not be sure of the word; her breath was almost gone, as if a heavy blow had taken it away—she had scarcely breath enough to speak—I went to rub her back and felt something very hot against my hand, and I looked and found it was smeared with blood—I immediately got out of bed—I was very much frightened—I advised her to go out and give the alarm, and call police, murder! and sent my children for Mr. Drew—the deceased went out of the room toward the stairs—I said, "Pray don't go that way, go out into the street and give the alarm"—she then went out at the street door, I don't know which way she went, I was putting on my clothes—I heard the little boy up stairs clap his hands together, and say, "Oh father, father, what will become of you" or "us?"—I won't be certain which it was, but I heard the child crying Bitterly—I</p>

               <p>heard nothing said in answer to that—as I was coming from the back-parlour door a man came upon my mat, and said, "Where is Moore?"—I said, "Up stairs"—that was the witness Frost, but I did not know him then—he went up stairs and stopped there five or ten minutes—the prisoner and he then went away together to the Nelson public-house, and I saw nothing more of the prisoner until he was in custody—he did not return to the lodging—I never heard them quarrel, particularly whilst they were in our house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever hear them quarrel at all before this unhappy matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Saturday night I heard a scuffle when the sister was stopping with her to take care of her; that was all—this happened on Tuesday morning—generally speaking he behaved towards her like a kind husband—I never heard him complain that his wife had latterly fallen into habits of drinking—I never saw that she was in the habit of drinking or getting the worse for liquor—on the Monday after<lb></lb>noon, while he was away, I was in her room, and had one quartern of gin with her to drink her health; there was the deceased, her mother, another woman, and myself; the other person did not drink anything—I was not two hours in the room, I should not think it was above an hour, or hardly so much—we only had one quartern of gin among three of us, owing to its being her birthday the day previous; I paid for it—I was not out with her that day, nor ever in my life—I don't know whether she went out—I will be on my oath that she was not in a state that caused her husband to complain when he came home in the morning—as to that night I do not know, for I left her in the afternoon and never saw her again till about 10 at night, when she came with her mother and father—she was not at all the worse for liquor then—I did not hear the prisoner complain of it—he complained once that night, and once in the morning, of my harbouring her—I wanted to know what he meant by the observation, unless it was giving her shelter for the short time that she could not get into her room—he did not say, "Mrs. Harle, it is a shame for you to mislead my poor wife in this manner; she has got into habits which make my life miserable"—I never heard it—when he came down and begged of her to go up stairs, it was not in an affectionate and entreating manner, nor in a particularly arbitrary way; and when he offered to escort her to her mother's, it was not in a particularly affectionate manner—I have no prejudice or antipathy against the prisoner—I was not particularly annoyed at his saying that I harboured his wife—I did not observe that she was the worse for liquor during the whole of the Monday afternoon—I did not observe that she was any way the worse when she was with her mother—I never observed that she was the worse for liquor, either that day or the whole time she lodged with me—I never heard the prisoner say anything about any other irregularities that he challenged her with—he only knocked at my door once on this morning, before she said she would go up—what he said was "Mrs. Moore, walk out of this woman's room; you have no business in there"—he then said, "If Mrs. Harle harbours you in there, I shall consider she is worse than you;" and with that she opened the door directly and followed him up stairs—I remained in my bed till she came down again—I heard her say to him, "Ah, do if you dare;" and that was no sooner said than she was down in my room—I heard the words as she was running down the stairs—I had not heard her speak before that; she only said it once; it was said In a sort of fright, as if it was done momentarily, as she received the blow—the first thing the prisoner said</p>

               <p>when he came home that evening was "Who broke the door open?"—when he said she was a wife in every respect, it was said in a friendly sort of way, as if he meant of course she was his wife; that was how I took it—I did not think it meant that though she was his wife, she did not act like one towards him.</p>

CLEARK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that on the Saturday before you heard some sort of a scuffle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—about 2 o'clock in the morning, upstairs—it was nothing particular—I heard on the Sunday morning that the deceased's sister had come home to spend the Saturday night with her—I had not seen her, for I was very ill in bed all day Sunday—it was about 2 o'clock in the day on Monday, or it might have been between 12 and 1 when I was in the prisoner's room with Mrs. Moore and her mother, having the gin—a quartern was all that was had while I was there—that would be about a glass round for three persons—the prisoner did not come in while we were drinking it—I did not hear him make any observation on the Monday night or Tuesday morning when he came home, about our having been drinking gin in the room—while the deceased's mother and father were in my room there was some gin there, but the deceased did not partake of any, neither did I, but one glass with my husband, her father and mother—I think six-pennyworth was sent for; we drank it among us—the deceased had none—she was crying—the prisoner could not see when he came in that anybody had been drinking there—when my husband began to speak to him he said, "I don't want to speak to drunkards," meaning all of us, I suppose—he did not address it to any one in particular, for he looked on the table at the time—there was only a glass of water on the table—he said, "If you will allow me I will drink a glass of water"—I could see that he was the worse for liquor—I had had no dispute with the prisoner before this day, only once on going up stairs he made use of a nasty epithet—there was no animosity, not the slightest.</p>

I live at 13, Trafalgar-row, Walworth, ten doors from Mrs. Harle's, on the same side of the street—on Tuesday morning, 24th May, about half-past 7, I saw Mrs. Moore in the street, knocking at the door of Mr. Frost, who lives directly opposite me—I went over to her—she was in a stooping position and vomiting blood—I spoke to her, and took her to my own house—I sent for a doctor—before he came I undid a part of her dress and saw a wound on her back under the left shoulder—the doctor came and saw her at my house—I afterwards went with her to Guy's Hospital, undressed her, and left her there—I afterwards saw her there dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potato salesman in Farringdon-market—I know the prisoner Callan, he is a porter in the market—on 23d January, he was near my stand from about 7 in the morning till half-past 8—the other prisoner came along and spoke to him—I did not hear what was said—after he had spoken, Goude came and looked at some potatoes of mine—he asked me the price of them—I told him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the ton—he agreed to give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a ton, and asked me if I would allow Callan to carry them out, and he would pay for them—he said he was just going across the market to buy some apples, and he would come back and pay then—Callan was to carry them out of the market to a cart—Goude said he would pay before the cart went away—he then went across the market, and I never saw him again till he was in custody—Callan proceeded to load the cart—he took away fourteen sacks of potatoes, they weighed 21cwt and their value was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw Callan about three minutes after the last sack was taken away, and asked him who the other man was—he told me his name was Clark, and he lived at Pad<lb></lb>dington, and kept a large shop there—I said it was strange he did not come back and pay for them, and Callan said he was gone to Tooley-street to buy some apples, and would be back in half an hour's time—Callan then went away, and I saw nothing more of him—the sacks were brought back by a boy about 7 o'clock in the evening—I did not intend to have parted with my potatoes without the money—the reason I let them go was because Callan told me Goude'a name was Clark, and that he kept a large shop it Paddington—it was not in Goude's presence that he said that, it was as soon an Goude went away—nothing was said by Goude at all—he gave me no name or address.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Graham-terrace, Macclesfield-street, City-road, and am a carman in the employ of Mrs. Hills, of Fetter-lane—on 23d January I saw both the prisoners at a very few minutes after half-past 8—they came into my mistress's shop—they did not speak to me then—I did not hear them speak to my mistress—I was ordered by her to put the horse in the cart—Callan went and helped me, and asked me to make haste, as they were in a hurry—I then went to the corner of Stonecutter-street, Shoe-lane, which is some forty yards from Mr. Chapman's shop—Callan rode in the cart with me—he then left me, and in a very few minutes he came back with a sack of potatoes on his back—I saw Goude whilst he was loading—he did not speak to me—fourteen sacks were loaded into the cart—Goude was walking round the cart, and in the Vicinity, whilst the loading was going on—when the fourteen sacks were in the cart Callan said to him, "There are fourteen sacks, will that be enough?"—Goude said, "Yes," and he directed me to go to Lamb's Conduit-street—I did not know his name at all at that time—I went up King's-road towards Lamb's Conduit-street, and when I was going to turn to the right, Goude directed me to go to the left, to Red Lion-street—he was walking behind the cart the whole way—I went to Red Lion-street, and stopped at Mr. Lomas' shop—he is a greengrocer and potato dealer—Goude went and spoke to Mr. Lomas, and Mr. Lomas said the potatoes were not large enough—I had directions then to go to Clare-market—I went there—Goude rode with me—I stopped at a public—house, and he went away—while he was gone Callan and another man, who helped him carry the sacks in, came up, and Callan asked me where he was—I told him I did not know—he then asked me if I had got any money to stand beer—I told him I had not; I had only enough to buy my breakfast with—Goude same back while we were talking, and put the sample of potatoes that he had taken back, into the sack again—I then went from there to Skinner-street, Somers-town—Goude went away for about a quarter of an hour, and when he returned he said they were as far off as ever.</p>

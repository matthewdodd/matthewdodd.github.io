I am a niece of Mr. Hunter, of the Bell, Wel<lb></lb>lington-street—on 10th September, the prisoner came with a female for half a quartern of gin—I put it on the counter, and they both drank of it; it came to threepence—the prisoner gave me a bad shilling—I took a knife and cut the rim almost all off to disfigure it as much as I could, and put it down on the counter—the prisoner took it up and gave me another, which was also bad—I did nothing to that, but my cousin fetched a constable.</p>

My father keeps the Bell in Wellington-street—on 10th September, I came in and saw the prisoner there with a woman—my cousin gave me a bad shilling, saying that the prisoner had tried to pass it, having passed one previously—he said something, but I cannot remember what—I went for a constable and gave him in charge with this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

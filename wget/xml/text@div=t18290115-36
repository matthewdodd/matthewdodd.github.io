               <p>WILLIAM LANGDON. I live in Duke-street, Manchester-square. On the 19th of November I lent this saddle to the prisoner, as he said he wanted to ride a horse, for a day or two; I applied for it several times, but never could get it back again - the only answer I could get was, it was lent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the prisoner groom to Dunlock? A. Yes - I have not been able to find Dunlock since; Mr. Dunlock was in my shop three or four times - he had dealt with me for harness, and owes me about 43l.; the prisoner and a man brought a horse to the door at the time he borrowed the saddle - it was not borrowed on his master's account; I did not give it to him on condition that be was to pay 4l. if it were liked - I never said to any body that I told him the price of it was to be 4l., if it were liked; the price I asked for it was 3l. 15s. - I have seen

             CRIPPS. I am a saddler, and live in Great Windmill-street, Haymarket. I bought the saddle of the prisoner, about the 20th or 22d of November - I gave 1l. 18s. for it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS called -</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BEAZLEY. I was in the employ of Mr. Dunlock; I do not know what he was - he appeared to me like a gentleman, but he is gone I do not know where. The prisoner went to the prosecutor, and got the saddle, but whether he bought it or borrowed it I do not know; I had a horse at the door at the time - the prisoner and the prosecutor came out together; the saddle was put on the horse, and Mr. Langdon girted it on - three or four days after Mr. Langdon called, and asked me where the groom was; I said I believed he was gone round to my master - he then said, "Where is the saddle?" I said, "I know nothing about it - I believe the groom has lent it;" "Oh,(said he) I told him the price of the addle, but he did not say exactly he would have it then;" I am sure he said that, and he said the prisoner called two days after, and said he would have it; Mr. Langdon said, "It does not belong to me - it belongs to a gentleman I have got it to sell for, and the gentleman has altered his mind, and he must have it back."

            . My husband is a butcher, and lives at Windsor - I am a laundress. I was up stairs, and could not see Mr. Langdon, nor he me; I heard him say he told the prisoner the price of the saddle was 4l., but he did not say he would keep it then - he had called in two days, and said he would keep it, but since then the gentleman he had to sell it for had altered his mind, and he wished to have it back again - the conversation was carried on in a loud tone of voice, and the prosecutor seemed a little angry; I was only up twelve or thirteen stairs, and there is no door.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LANGDON. I deny all that entirely.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had you it to sell for a gentleman? A. No, it was my own; I went to ask for it, and he said it was lent - I was angry at not getting it back.</p>

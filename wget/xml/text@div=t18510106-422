On 6th Dec., Edward Giggs was one of my carmen—I had an order to send six loads of hay and some straw to Mr. Reddin—it is my practice to send a larger quantity than is ordered, if the loft will hold it—my foreman gave orders for sending some on Saturday morning, 7th Dec.—on Monday the 9th, I went to John Maskell's house—I found there a load of hay of precisely the same quality as some I had on my premises, and which was sent to Mr. Reddin's—it is our custom to send a delivery-note—I have a delivery-note relating to the three loads sent on Saturday; this is it.</p>

I was directed by the foreman to take some clover-hay to Mr. Reddin's on Saturday, 7th Dec.—there were three loads; I took one, Edward Giggs and James Houghton took the others—Edward Giggs had a load of cinquefoil, the other two had clover—I had the delivery-ticket—when we got to the Commercial-road, Edward Giggs said he was to take my load, and I was to take his; that he knew of a customer for my load—I took his cart, and he took mine—this was soon after seven in the morning—I took my load to Mr. Reddin's, delivered it to Green, and Houghton delivered his load at the same time—I altered the "2" to a "3" in the delivery-note, and gave Green the note to give to the other man—Edward Giggs said if he unloaded his load where he was going, he or one of us could get another load to make up Mr. Reddin's compliment, and if he did not unload where he was going, he would take it up to Mr. Reddin's—when I had delivered my load, we came back to Holland-street, and stopped at the public-house—when I came out of the public-house, and was standing at the door, I saw Edward Giggs' cart coming in a direction from Mr. Reddin's—he said the customer where he went did not have his load, and he took it to Mr. Reddin's, and delivered it there—that was half-past nine or more.</p>

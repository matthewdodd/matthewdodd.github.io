             served her, and Thomas Richardson was in the shop; they are here. They were all the persons who were serving in the shop. When the prisoner got to the door, I observed, she was walking in a singular manner. I suspected that she had something about her. George Banks went after her, and brought her back. And when Banks brought her back, she dropped a piece of print, containing twenty one yards, at the door.</p>

             shewed her some; she was twenty minutes at the counter. There were a great many pieces shewn to her; she bought two quantities, it came to four shillings. I was not aware that she had taken any thing, when she went out of the shop. I suspected her by her walk; I went after her and brought her back. She had got about a yard from the door; I told her to come back; that she had got something that did not belong to her. She dropped the piece of printed cotton on the sill of the door as I brought her back; it dropped from underneath her petticoats. It was only from her manner of walking, that I suspected her. I received no information from any one. There was nobody in the shop but Richardson, myself, and master, and another young man. He was at the other counter.</p>

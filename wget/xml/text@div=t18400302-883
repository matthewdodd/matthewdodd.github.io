                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bull, who keeps the Black Bull public-house, at Kingsland—the prisoner is horse-keeper to Mr. Spinks who occupies the yard of our house. On the 25th of February I accused him of having a glass in his possession belonging to me, which he denied—I said if he would give it up, I would freely forgive him—he still persisted that he had not, and I gave him into custody—these two glasses here produced were found in the prisoner's box—one of them I am certain is ours—it has our name on it—the other I could not swear to, but I have every reason to believe it is ours.</p>

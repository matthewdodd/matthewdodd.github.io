               <p>Mrs. Ferris. I have seen these letters before, they were taken out of the chest, I cannot read myself, they have been read to me, I believe they came from Plymouth or Torbay, I cannot say which, these were in my chest, the chest was not taken away, but it was broke open, and I lost a great number of duplicates which I have not light of since; That little tin box was my husband's first wife's play thing, when she was alive; and that piece of copper was her maiden name on it; these are my chairs, there are two bits out in the back of one of them, they are all fellows; I have no doubt of the table; my bed is patched in the inside with another sort of stuff; one blanket has got a hole in the middle, the other has not, the cotton counterpane is tore on each side, they are all mine.</p>

            How long had you lost the key of your room? - This was on Monday, and I lost it the Monday before but the door was forced open; the Monday before I went to Chelsea to seek after a man that owed me some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150206"></xptr>money, and the woman lost it that took care of the child while I was gone, the woman was neither of the prisoners.</p>

            's, one of the prisoners, who passes as my wife, although it is well known among our acquaintances we are not married; and also Ann Wilson is very intimate with Shepherd and mostly with her. On the 12th of last month I was ill and not able to leave the lodgings and go to work as usual; between eight and nine in the evening of that day, Wilson came into the room and took the candle to go into the yard and then went and brought a bed in, declaring this, that as her father would not furnish her she was resolved to get furniture for her room; and then as she was going down stairs I heard her say, God bless you mother; which I thought the meant her mother, then she came again into Shepherd's room bringing more things; on which I got out of bed and insisted on Shepherd's going to ask her mother if she was giving her the things; and the returned and said that she had been her mother, and that she said she had given her the things. I heard a noise below stairs, after this I started up and put on my great coat,

             wanted to go out of the room, I told her I would not have the door locked, nor let her go till I knew what was the matter; immediately her father came in, which I asked if them things where his that were brought there? he answered they were not his, and I was taken into custody and was scarce allowed time to put my clothes on. And then before the justices next day the prisoners declared that I knew nothing of the matter, and the prosecutor said that she believed me to be an honest harmless man and had nothing to lay to my charge, but for what reason I cannot tell I was committed; I also beg leave to say that I did not take the lodging nor pay the rent, I only generally live with Shepherd when I came to town, this is the real state of my case, which I humbly submit to your lordship, hoping no kind of selony will appear on my part.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. This afternoon that the place was broke open, my father and I had a few words, this Mrs. Shepherd asked me to go and have a pint of beer, I went with her to the public house, and I saw Mrs. Ferris there very much intoxicated with liquor, with one Mrs. Bowyer, she takes hold of me and says, O, what you have brought yourself to; O, says I, my father has turned me out of doors to work at the gun barrels; so after that she treated me with a glass of liquor and then she goes out to the Blue Anchor and there she began quarrelling, and I took

Mrs. Shepherd goes out to a chandler's shop and gets some liquor, and she gave me some, and her husband some, with that I turns out of the room and said I will be back again presently, with that I found by going that my mistress was in bed, and I went back to this room and Mrs. Ferril was on the stairs, and I saw the furniture then in the room, and this man was laying on that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150207"></xptr>woman's bed; with that Mrs. Ferril went out, I cannot say where the went; afterwards, the man Ferril was laying on the bed, and Mrs. Ferril called to me and said, give me a light; I went to her and I said, have you been buying any goods? yes, says the, I have been, because Mrs. Ferris wants to go to Portsmouth; after that I went up stairs and I heard a great alarm presently, and my father, that is there, Michael Brown, he comes up stairs, and Mr Parsh, that keeps the Windmill, was one of the two men that went into the room, and the watchman, and they took this man and woman, and me.</p>

When this woman came up the asked for a candle to go to the vault, and she returned with the candle; she was going down stairs afterwards, I was laying on an old bed, with no blanket over me nor no blanket under me; the came up stairs again, and this woman brought up a drop of gin for me, and they gave it to me as I was laying on the bed; says I, who is that brought this bed here, or who sent it here? Why my mother, says this young woman. Then by and by the chairs came up; I started up, and said, I would not put up with all this here, I must know the rights of it; says I to this woman; you go down stairs, and go to this girl's mother and know the rights of this affair. Accordingly she went down and told me it was all right: then they went down again and stopped and brought the stove; afterwards I heard a noise in the court, and I observed they put the candle out directly; I said, what is this? here is some mischief; Mr. Brown was the first man that entered the room; says I to Mr. Brown, are these your property that your daughter,

I went to his lodging in Brook-street, Ken<lb></lb>nington, to a back room on the first floor—I saw a female there, whom the prisoner told me was his wife—I found a box there, which was un<lb></lb>locked, and in it I found three duplicates, which had reference to some holland at Mr. Hawes, in Old-street—Mr. Bardon and Mr. Ludgate were with me—Mr. Ludgate said in the prisoner's presence, when I found the duplicates, "I think they belong to us."</p>

We are linen drapers, and live in Carthusian-street—the prisoner was in our employ—he left us at the latter end of July—on one of these pieces of linen there is no mark that I can positively swear to, but on this other piece here are marks by which I am positive it was ours—here is our cost mark, the selling mark, and the house we bought it of—I cannot swear that it was not sold, but I will venture to say that the sale is not in our book—I will most positively swear it was once ours, and was in the prisoner's care—he had the sole charge of these goods—on this pair of stays here is the cost mark, the selling mark, and the house we bought it of—I cannot say whether they were sold, and I am just in the same position with respect to these shoes.</p>

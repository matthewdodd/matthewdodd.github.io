            . On Tuesday, the 23rd of August, I was at the bottom of Fleet-market; it was a duskish evening; I was standing at the corner, by Mr. Waithman's door. The deceased was coming across from <placeName id="t18140914-51-crimeloc287">Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>Q. How did the prisoner drive it - A. He was driving it faster than he should, he owned, and I saw the deceased fall; I could not tell whether it was a fall, or whether it was the off horse that knocked her down; the horse on the off side was upon her when she was down. The driver immediately pulled up, and stopped the horses, with the horse upon the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse upon the woman - A. Yes; the horses feet were upon the woman. He stopped his chaise immediately; he seemed much hurt, and behaved exceeding well.</p>

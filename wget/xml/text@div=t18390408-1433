                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker at Greenwich. On Monday, the 8th of April, the prisoner pledged this gown and blanket with me—not both at the same time—I believe she pledged the blanket first, the gown next, and she came a third time for more money on the gown—she pledged them in her own name—I knew her very well—I believe a woman named Cook was with her when she pledged the gown.</p>

I received information last Monday, and found the prisoner at a house in Queen-street, Greenwich—I told her I took her on suspicion of stealing a gown and blanket—she said she knew nothing at all about it, it was the first she had heard of it—on our way to the station-house I told her I knew where the gown was—she said, "I know where it is too, but the other woman knew nothing at all about it, for I pawned it myself'—I said, "If you pawned them you must know where the duplicates are"—she said, "I have got them here, here they are"—they were pinned to her gown under her shawl—I took them from her, and produce them.</p>

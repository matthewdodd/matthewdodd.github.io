                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 6, Duncan Square, Hackney—on Sunday morning, 25th November, about one o'clock, I was in Gold<lb></lb>smith's Row, Hackney Road, going home—four or five persons, among whom were the prisoners, pushed up against me—I went on—they came after me, knocked me down, kicked me twice on the right jaw, and once on the right knee—they put a handkerchief in my mouth, and took away my tobacco box, a halfpenny, and a shilling—I got up, ran after them, and I took Sinsfield—they all ran away again, but he ran into a constable's arms, and I gave him in custody—Hollingsworth ran among a lot more who were standing by—this is my tobacco box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw Hollingsworth the same night; I had not known him before—I cannot say whether either of the prisoners kicked me, as there were so many round me.</p>

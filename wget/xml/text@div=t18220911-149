            . I went to the prisoner's lodging after my husband; and in her room I found the rest of this property. Before she left, I had enquired after the towels which were missing; she said she knew nothing about them - and she considered it an insult, for she had never been suspected, and therefore would leave the place. I found the towels and sheets very dirty; she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are wages due to her - A. Yes, she would leave immediately, and I was too busy to settle with her.</p>

I went on the 9th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110072"></xptr>August, with the search warrant with Mrs. Swinbourne, and found the property in Old-street Road - the prisoner sent for the key of the room, and went in with us.

I was fellow servant with the prisoner; my mistress complained of losing property; the prisoner's husband used to call for her of an evening - sometimes he stopped at the door, and sometimes came up stairs in the kitchen. I never saw him carry away any bundle - the bedding was up stairs. I saw him come one Sunday morning with a basket, but never saw him carry anything away.</p>
               <p>MRS. SWINBOURNE. The property is mine - the marks on some of them are cut out.</p>

He asked me if I wanted a job, as he had hooked a chain that morning, and got five or six fathoms of it into the boat. I got a stick and hooked it up. I aferwards told Smith about it, and we took it to the west end of the college and landed it on a wharf. I saw them next day and asked them if they had sold it; they said no, and asked me where they could get a cart and horse—I recommended them to a man named Murphy. Going along Bland said, "You might put the price on the chain for us." We went to the blacksmith, and asked 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; he said that it was half worn-out, and gave us a sovereign for it. Bland gave his name Charles Bland; we then had a pot of ale.</p>

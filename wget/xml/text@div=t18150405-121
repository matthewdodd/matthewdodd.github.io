            . I was at Shoreditch Church on this day. I watched the prisoner's notions a long time; I saw him attempt a number of gentleman's pockets; I see him put his hand into the prosecutor's right hand pocket, and pull his handkerchief out; I instantly seized him by the collar, and tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and told him he had lost his handkerchief; the prisoner dropped the handkerchief; I picked it up in the presence of the prosecutor. I searched the prisoner; I found three handkerchiefs in his possession; this is the handkerchief he took out of the prosecutor's pocket.</p>

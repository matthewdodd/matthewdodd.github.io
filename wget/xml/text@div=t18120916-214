            's; did you attend at the first public meeting of the commission - A. I did not. I did the second, at the time of the choice of assignees.</p>
               <p>Q. We have just learned that you, Mr. Hemmings, and Mr. Taylor, were chosen assignces - A. We were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any attempt made to your choice for assignees - A. A very strong attempt. There was a gentleman I never saw before in my life, I understood his name was Brooks. Mr. Brooks was started for one, and Mr. Crouch, the petitioning creditor, for the other. These were the two persons that were started against me and the others. Mr. Crouch, I believe, married the bankrupt's sister.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you were chosen assignees, did you and the other assignees go to the bankrupt's house the same evening - A. We did not. On the next morning, the 18th, we went to the bankrupt's house in Great Surry-street, Black Friars-Road; Mr. Hemmings met me there. We took possession of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took possession of the house, did you find the servant boy in possession of the business - A. We did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the maid-servant of the house - A. We did not. None of the servants of the bankrupt were left; they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the books - A. We did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to the bankrupt, John, for his books - A. I had no opportunity of seeing the bankrupt till the third examination.</p>
               <p>Q. The third examination was the 28th of February, eleven days after, did you then apply to him for his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160101"></xptr> books - A. When he appeared at Guildhall he appeared without his books. We asked him, where his books were. He said, they were in the neighbourhood; he himself had not the possession of them; that he had only possession of them a few days past. He had pawned them. He had five pounds lent upon them by a man of the name of Byerley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what time he had lodged them with Byerley - A. I do not recollect. I think he said he had got them that morning. He was ordered by the commissioner to fetch them. Mr. Mayhew (Mr. Price's partner) accompanied him. He came back with the books. The books are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, in consequence of any suspicion you entertained, had you, before that, gone to the house of Mr. Bond, in Fleet-lane - A. I do not think I saw him until the third meeting. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you would recollect - A. On the first private meeting, the 26th of February, Mr. Hemmings and I went to Bond's, in Fleet-lane. I am not satisfied as to the day. It was before the third meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for the purpose of making enquiries respecting Bond and his debt - A. It happened that me and my brother assignee went together to Bond's, in Fleet-lane, to make enquiry respecting the debt, and to enquire how it arose.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that occasion did you see a woman in the room whom you now know by the name of the Baroness Minkwitz - A. I did. At that time I did not know who she was. Nothing at that time past with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had seen her at Bond's did she come to you and make a discovery - A. About two days after, she came to me and made some communication. I was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, take into your hands the books of the bankrupt, and tell me whether you find certain names I am going to ask you about debitted for goods.

Yes; he gave me his address, Sloane-street; that she and her husband had removed from there; he did not know what had become of them; he believed they were gone out of the country. He was gone to take possession of an estate, or some property abroad. It was a very safe debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire who the Baroness Minkwitz was - A. He said, he had known her for a length of time, but did not know what had become of her. Her debt appears to have been the day before the commission. On the 10th of January appears her debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire who she was - A.

             was a wine and brandy merchant in Smithfield. He came to my shop for the goods. He is now in the Fleet. The account of Count Holmar is a true and correct account. The goods sold in November last. I delivered them to him myself. The bullion consisted of doubloons, some India pieces, and some coin. The bullion was sold at different times. Halliday became a bankrupt in the Fleet. The goods were sold to Halliday when he lived in Bell Savage-yard, in the city. The eleventh leaf is written by the boy. The baroness is written by my brother, James.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Powis. You have examined the books carefully - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions about certain goods that he had charged, which you thought he had not rightly charged - A. I have asked him questions upon all these accompts which I suspected. I pointed out two accounts to him, and particular; Halliday was one, the other Shehey. I pointed out the absurdity, to shew him, that he could have credited such a man as Halliday; he must know his real situation in life. I remonstrated with him how he could have trusted such a man as that. At that time he trusted him he had been recently liberated from the Rules of the Fleet. At the time the bankrupt credited him, Halliday had no means of living. Speaking to him one time upon that, he said, you are the only man who knows any thing respecting Halliday or Shehey; if you remain quiet you shall have nothing to complain of. I told him, it would be better for him to tell the truth. After that he said, he believed the account of Halliday and Shehey to be fabricated, but said he, it was all his, William and Nugent's doing: he was ill at the time. He then told me, if I would remain his friend, and would not oppose his certificate, that he should have at command, in a short time, five or six thousand pounds. I said, why, you have not done the trick to deep as that, and asked him to explain himself. He said, he had it in his power to marry a woman of that property.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the enquiry of Bond; you have examined the books - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any articles charged to these persons, which by these books you find to have come in afterwards - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. State the articles - A. It is in the account of James. The articles are two trunks booked to him in November last charged three pounds eight shillings. He said, he had them of Mr. Briant, Ludgate-hill. I pointed out to him the absurdity that he had not them in his possession until the 26th of that month. He said, it might be a mistake in the date. He was conscious the account of James was correct, although it was not his own making. He was ill a bed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you, sir, what is the deficiency upon the estate - A. The deficiency, admitting these debts to be just, amounts to between two and three thousand pounds, and if they are not just they amount to five.</p>

             was a stranger to me. Nugent first spoke to me. He set himself down. He said, how do you do: he had introduced a friend of his. He told me his name. He said, did I ever hear him mention his friend Folkard. I said, not as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160103"></xptr> I recollected: He then said, he came there. Some enemies of Mr. Folkard had struck a docket against him. I said, have they? He said, yes; we want to get over, on Monday, a trifle of business. I come to ask you, if Mr. Grick, and the man at your house, would come forward and do us a favour.</p>
               <p>COURT. He did not mention that you were to take part in it - A. Not at the time. I said, what is it? He said, next Monday they were to choose assignees, and they wanted to have their own friends chosen for assignees. Mr. Grick was then sitting in my room, by the fire side. Mr. Grick was in the room before Nugent and Folkard came. Nugent said, do you think the young man will go. That was Grick, to go and prove under the commission. I said, I did not know. Mr. Nugent then said, do you think the man of the house will do it; I said, I did not know; you had better ask him; you had better ask him yourself. Nugent then explained the business to Grick. Grick said he would do it if there was no harm in it. I went down and asked Mrs. Bond. Mr. Nugent said, he would have a dinner and a one-pound note. Mrs. Bond said, if it was to hail any body her husband should not go. The way it was to be done Mr. Folkard was to give bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the way Folkard or Nugent explained it - A. They both explained it was to be done that way. Mr. Folkard was to give bills to Grick and Bond.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these bills to be for - A. That Mr. Folkard owed Grick and Bond so much money, to go and prove them at Guildhall on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Nugent said, at that time, whether he had applied to some of his own friends - A. Yes; he said he had some of his own friends; he did not say how many; but he wanted five or six more.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to have - A. I was to have a one-pound note and a black set of ornaments, and I was to persuade Grick and Bond to do this, and get any body else I could persuade to go and swear a debt.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next day did you see Nugent again - A. Nugent went, and said, he would come the next day. That was Friday. On the Friday he came, and brought

               <p>Q. Did you ask him why this was - A. Yes. I said, first you make people say you are indebted to them, and now you want people that do not owe you any thing, to put down that they do. He said, they must balance the accounts.

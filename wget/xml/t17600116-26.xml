               <p>Q What did she say before she was at the justice's?</p>
               <p>Kemp. I never spoke to her going along.</p>
               <p>Q Did she, at the justice's, give any reason for her so doing?</p>
               <p>Kemp. No. She said he had been a very good husband to her, and that she had a thought of it about a month, or thereabouts, before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion of her, with respect to her understanding?</p>
               <p>Kemp. I did not know her, though she lived in my neighbourhood a great while. I have heard since, by the neighbours who knew her, that she has been out of her mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the justice ask her no questions?</p>
               <p>Kemp. Yes; he asked her what made her to do it, and she said the d - I made her to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion of her?</p>
               <p>Kemp. I did not take her to be clear in her senses. I do not know that I ever saw her before, or heard any thing of her, either good, bad, or indifferent. I knew her husband, who was a coachman, a very old man, and she appears to be very old.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she abscond after this unhappy affair?</p>
               <p>Kemp. No; she was at a neighbour's house.</p>

            . The prisoner's husband being ill for some time before the accident happened, I attended him, to look after him, for nine or ten days; indeed I attended them both, as much as in my power, for she seemed very stupid, sometimes talking of going to drown herself, and in a very strange way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the man came by his death?</p>
               <p>C. Whistler. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q Are there any other evidences for the prosecution?</p>
               <p>C. Whistler. No. Here are many neighbours to prove she was not in her proper mind, if need be to call them.</p>

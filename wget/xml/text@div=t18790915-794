               <p>Aldersgate Street—the prisoner came in on Saturday night, September 6th, and asked to look at some pipes—I showed him some, and while I turned to get some others he was gone, and I missed two pipes and a cigar-holder—I ran to the door, and saw him on the other side of the way turning a corner; he ran into a policeman's arms—he then rushed back to the shop, and brought back the pipes, and said "Here you are, Harry"—that is not my name—I never saw him before—he struggled with the policeman—the price of the pipes was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

I was on duty in Aldersgate Street, and saw the prisoner hurrying out of Mr. Lee's shop—just before he got to me he turned back, and I thought there was something wrong—as he got to the shop-door again Lee came out, and prisoner put his hands up with the pipes, and said "Here you are, Harry"—I took hold of him, and Lee gave him in charge—he put his hands behind and slipped his coat and struggled, and threw me on my back several times; I had to set assistance—he was so violent that all his clothes came off, and I had to take him into the shop to get him to put them on again before I could take him through the street.</p>

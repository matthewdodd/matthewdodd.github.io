On the 9th of June, about three o'clock in the afternoon, my master left the house, I remained there with two of his children. About eight o'clock in the afternoon, my master left the house, I remained there with two of his children. About eight o'clock in the evening the servant, Barker, came down by the coach, with my master's trunk, and slept in the house that night. We all went to bed about eleven o'clock. I saw the house fastened the left-hand parlour window was quite secure. At six o'clock next morning Broomham, the gardener, called me up. I found the shutters forced open, and the bolts were wrenched off. I had been washing the day before, and left the things for the mangle in the next parlour, a great many of them were gone. I lost a liquor-stand, which was locked up in the cellaret, and the rest of the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I left my house about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th of June-the house is my own, I occupy it. I had seen my boots about twelve or one o'clock in the left-hand parlour cupboard, where they are always kept. I returned two days after, and found the house had been robbed of 60l. or 70l. worth of property. I lost the articles stated in the indictment, which were worth above 6l. 10s. I received information, and went to Mr. Moser, the magistrate of Edmonton, about twelve or fourteen days after the robbery-the prisoner was there in custody. In consequence of what I heard, I looked at his feet, and found a pair of boots on him, which I knew to be mine; they were the same that were taken from my house - I examined them, and claimed them as mine. He said he had bought them, and had had them soled since. I sent for the man who made them; he said, in the prisoner's presence, that they were the boots he had made for me, and that they had never been soled.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CHATHAM. I had the prisoner in custody - He had the boots on when I took him. I took them off his feet, and produce them.</p>

            . I am a plough-boy, and work for Mr. Deboos. On the night that his house was robbed, I saw the Edmonton stage come in between eight and nine o'clock I saw the prisoner on the coach-top-two others got down with him; they stood at the corner, all three went across the bridge together. I heard one of the men say to the other that the thought that must be the house(pointing to Mr. Deboos's). The prisoner said, "Come along, you d-d fools!" He was dressed as he is now, except that he had a coloured handkerchief. I am sure he is the man I saw him at the magistrate's eight or ten days after, and knew him to be the same - I said so at the time. I told my father at the time, but did not tell the prosecutor; I was not in his employ then.</p>

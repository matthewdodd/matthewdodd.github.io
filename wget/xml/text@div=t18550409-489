                  </hi>. I know the prisoner. In April, 1851, I kept a linen<lb></lb>draper's shop, in Limehouse-causeway—the prisoner came and asked for a halfpenny-worth of pins, and a few days afterwards she came again for some frivolous thing—it rained, and I asked her to come into the parlour—she then told me that she was an independent person, the Countess de Clifford, and that she was to come into possession of 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in July—she asked me if I would lend her a shilling, as she was very badly off; I did so; and in a week or a fortnight I lent her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she said she would pay me when she received the 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards lent her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time, till it amounted to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some odd pence—I lent her all this money because she appeared so lady-like in her manners, and being a widow, like myself, I thought she would not impose upon me—the last time I saw her was on 21st July—she was to have received the 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 14th.—she said that she went up on the 14th, but it was not payable till the 21st, when she was to go and receive it—she came to me on the 21st, at half-past 1 o'clock, and said that the money was not payable for another fortnight; that she had been in Court all day, and was very much fatigued, and would I lend her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and of course I lent it to her—I gave her some refreshment, and she said she would return at 9 o'clock in the evening—I never saw her again until she was in custody at the Greenwich Court last Wednesday week—it was at the Vice-Chancellor's Court that she said she was to receive the money.</p>

I found in a box on the first floor front room of the house No. 3, Middleton-buildings, a policeman's cape, a truncheon, and a rattle—I noticed on the cape the name and number, and where the broad arrow is usually put the piece cut out—I found this armlet there, but this might belong to the prisoner.</p>

The prisoner was a police<lb></lb>man in the C division, and quitted it in February last—in January, while he belonged to the division, I missed my police cape—this is it—the number is cut out, but I know it by three straps which I sewed on it myself—I had the use of it, but it was under the charge of the receiver, John Wray, Esq.—inquiry was made when I lost my cape, and I could not learn what had be<lb></lb>come of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you last see it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I put it down in the station—the prisoner was a policeman about twelve months—I never had any quarrel with him, and I have no ill will to him—it must have been the latter end of January that I saw my cape last—they are sometimes taken by mistake when men are going out, and I supposed that was the case—the prisoner was not discharged for dishonesty—his beat was in Upper Brook-street—there is a shutter-box in that street—he never stated to me how he became possessed of the cape—he stated before the Magistrate that he found it in the shutter-box, but it was his duty to have reported at the station every thing he found—when I missed it the number was painted on the canvass. Thomas Witcher. I let the room at No. 3, Middleton-buildings, to the prisoner—it was in his occupation.</p>

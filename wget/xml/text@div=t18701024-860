                  </hi>. I am a ship's steward, and live at 9, Russell Terrace, Oakley Square—about 1.30 on the night of the 18th September, I was going home—I went out about 8.30—I left the lower sash of my window closed and the upper part was open about two inches—I closed the street door before I went out, and went up the area steps—when I came back I unlocked the street door and went into the passage, and lit a candle—I took the key of the room-door from under the mat, and unlocked the door and walked in—I went to the mantelpiece and placed my candle on it, and com<lb></lb>menced to undress myself—I turned round to my left and saw the prisoner standing there—I said "What do you want here, who are you?"—he said "want some money"—I said "That you shall very soon have"—I turned towards the window and found the lower sash was half up—I tapped at the window and called "Police!" and at the same time stamped with my foot for my brother, who was sleeping in the room below—the prisoner tried to get out of the window, and I pulled him away—a great tussel ensued—he pushed and pulled me about considerably, and tore my clothes to pieces, and hurt my shoulder—he got me down on the floor and got away from me—he was going towards the door when he was stopped by one of the lodgers until my brother arrived—my brother caught hold of him and asked him what he was doing there, and he turned round and referred to me, and said that I had brought him there—he said he had got two respectable witnesses outside, and he would get them if we would let him go—in a few minutes a policeman came and took him, and I went to the police-station—I had never seen the prisoner before—the window opens on to a small balcony in front of the house.</p>

I am the brother of the last witness, and live at 9, Russell Terrace, Oakley square—it is my house—about 1.30, I was awoke by hearing a noise, and my brother stamping, and singing out "Help, robbers, murder," and I don't know what—and he sung out for a young man named Walker, to go and help him—I went up and sung the prisoner—as soon as he saw me, he set on me and tore the shirt from by back, and wanted to get out—I said he should not go, and he turned round, looked at my brother and said "That man brought me in here for an improper purpose, and if you will allow me, there are two witnesses outside that will prove it."—I said "I have got quite, witnesses enough for you; this case shall be thoroughly investigated, and what witnesses you have got shall come after"—I kept him till the policeman came, and gave him in charge—the window was open at the bottom when I saw it—it was closed at 10.30 at the bottom part—it was open a little at the top to let the smoke out—anyone could get in through the window easily.</p>

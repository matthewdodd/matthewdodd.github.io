               <p>"Is any one coming up?" the voice came from my room door. I found the prisoner outside the door; I went into the room, and missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were all safe in the drawers at seven o'clock that morning. I lost a gown, a shawl, and a suit of clothes; they were worth 3 l. 10 s. I immediately came out of the room - the prisoner was then gone out. I ran out, looked up and down the lane, and saw her come out of the next house; she had nothing then - I said she had got my things, and laid hold of her - Gould, who lives in the next house, assisted me; she denied having my things, and said I did not see her take them.</p>

I saw the prisoner coming out of our house; I stood in the shop, by the window, and asked what she wanted; she would not answer, and was going to run when Kingston caught hold of her, and in a minute or two I found these clothes on our cellar stair - any person in the passage could put them there; they were not tied up. I gave them to Mrs. Kingston.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 30th of November, after my customers were gone out, I wanted something for my supper. I went out. Before I went out I laid this money on the bar counter; there were 18 shillings in silver. I left it on the bar counter about 12 o'clock at night, and five shillings in halfpence. About 12 o'clock I went to the cook shop to get something for my supper. I locked up the door, and took the key with me. On my return I asked the watchman to give me a light; the watchman saw me to my own door and gave me a light; I saw the money on the bar counter then. I then said to the watchman, if you know a nice girl, we will have a bit of fun to-night. The watchman went away, and left the prisoner in the house. In about three hours the watchman came by and saw the street door open. I then asked the watchman if he knew where the prisoner lived; he said, yes, and took me to the prisoner's room. He and I searched the prisoner's room, and under her pillow I found an old handkerchief with my silver in it. I then told the watchman my pieces of silver were in one three shilling Bank token, two eighteen penny tokens, and two of the shillings were marked.</p>

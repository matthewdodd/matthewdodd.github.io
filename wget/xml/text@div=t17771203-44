The prisoner had lived with me about a year and a half, and had left me about a year and a half; he served behind the compter; I was convinced from a view of it that somebody had done it that knew the way of my house, because they did not get out the same way they came in, but at a private door from the shop that went into a court just by; therefore I suspected the prisoner: I had parted with him for something amiss; I got a warrant from Sir

(They were produced in Court and deposed to by the Prosecutor.) From thence we went to Mills' the Clogmakers, where he last lived, in St. John's-street; the draughts were there produced; these papers and draughts were in my desk that night; he owned he took a square out of the sky light with a knife; he said another person was concerned with him, that was Mills, and that he had the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Whether any promises were made him? I said I would be as favourable as ever I could; that I would not hurt him if it was in my power to prevent it with justice to myself; I likewise told him he must take the course of the law.</p>

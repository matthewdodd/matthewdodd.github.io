                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Clough, a gardener, living at 4 Park Hurst Place, Chiswick—the prisoner is my niece—I do not know what she was doing before the 8th of August—some time at the end of August she came to my house and asked me to take her in—she told me that she was not well, and asked if I would be kind enough to allow her to stop—I said "Yes"—she had no means when she came to me, so far as I knew—she told me she had no means, but was proud for me to take her in—I had two boxes in my room—there was a pocket-book in one with twenty-two sovereigns in it; that box was locked—I kept the key—I and my hus<lb></lb>band went to work every day—we left the prisoner to take care of the house—I went out at 2.15 on Thursday, 8th October—I know the money was safe on Sunday morning, and nobody entered my house but the pri<lb></lb>soner—I counted the money over on the Sunday—I did not look at it at all between Sunday and Thursday—I had no suspicion; I trusted her—she told us the very day she left my place that she would be back be<lb></lb>tween 8 and 9 o'clock—I told her not to make it so late as 9 o'clock, because myself and my husband were not very well, and would not sit up so late—she told me she was going out—at 6.15 we came home—I expected her about 8 o'clock; she did not come—I missed my money</p>

               <p>about 9 o'clock—the box was unlocked—I had the key with me—I never left it out of my own possession—I did not give it even to my husband—she had no meddling whatever with my key.</p>

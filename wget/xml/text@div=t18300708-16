            . In 1827 I lived in Lower Queen-street, Islington. The prisoner came to lodge with me in March that year - he had one room on the first floor. and he slept and had his meals there; he continued to lodge there till he was apprehended - the officer (Lea) came to the house at the time Solomon was taken; they entered the room he occupied, and called me up - I saw lace and different things, which Lea and Davis took away in a coach; the prisoner was not taken at my house, and I cannot say on what day it was - his wife used to come there to see him, but did not live with him there; I knew him by the name of Jones at my house.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 23rd of April, 1827. I apprehended the prisoner in the New North-road, Islington, not in any house; I took him to Islington watch-house, and searched him, but found nothing relating to this robbery - I had not then received information of it; I took him before a Magistrate, and he was afterwards committed to prison; I went to Mrs. Oades' premises the following morning, about six o'clock, and inquired if she had a person named Solomon living there; she said No, there was a person named Jones - I was shown to the room on the first floor- I was accompanied by one Jackson, and sent for Davies; on opening the room door I found a vast quantity of property, lace, handkerchiefs, veils. Irish linen, tablecloths, and various articles, silk handkerchiefs, a watch, some hobbinet, and a quantity of caps; all the property was tied up in bundles, under the bedstead - there were three or four large bundles, and a great quantity of valencia waistcoat pieces; I took it all away - there was a large trunk full; all the articles were new, and might be worth 300l. or 400l. altogether; among it were the articles I now produce; also the following, which I delivered up to Mr. Copestake on the 28th of September, by direction of the Magistrate: (reads) "74 pieces of cotton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080022"></xptr>lace, 88 caps, 30 lace collars, 39 dozens of cap crowns, 312 children's lace caps, and 27 pieces of bobbinet;" the prisoner at that time had been committed here to take his trial at the May Session, but was not here, when the Sessions came on; I have still detained in my possession part of the articles I found - I am sure they are the same, and the other parcel is what I delivered to the prosecutors - when I went to the prisoner's lodging in Queen-street, there was a coach at the door; his wife and son were there - I knew them well, having been to the house before, and seen them passing as his son and wife; the son was going in at the street door, with a key, and I prevented him - this was about six o'clock in the morning; I did not open the door, but waited till Mrs. Oades got up; I did not look into the coach - it went away, and his wife and son also; Davies was present when I found the articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who showed you Jones' room? A. Mrs. Oades - she went up to the room door; I inquired which was the room - she said on the one pair of stairs; this was on the 24th of April; I found some cloth and a silver spoon in the room - there were no skeleton-keys or housebreaking implements.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAVIES. On the 24th of April, 1827, I went with Lea to Mrs. Oades' house - I found Lea down in her room, and accompanied him up to the first floor room; I saw him find the property - I have heard Lea's evidence; it is correct: I found a quantity of lace under the bed, which I gave to Lea - this is it: I found all the lace that was identified by the prosecutors - all the articles were new.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was considerably more than a man could carry? A.There was a coach full; we found no housebreaking implements.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON COPESTAKE. In January, 1827, I was in partnership with Mr. Groncock - we carried on business in Cheapside; here is a quantity of bobbin and sprig net, which have our tickets and marks on them, the same as they were in our warehouse; I do not recollect seeing any of the articles in the warehouse on the Saturday, but the articles produced are part of what were missing on Monday morning. the 8th of January; in September that year Lea delivered me the articles be has enumerated, by the Magistrate's direction - I put my name to this inventory on receiving them; they amounted to about 120l. - I calculate our loss at about 500l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When can you undertake to swear you saw any of the identical goods produced? A. I cannot fix any time myself - I had sold none of them; I can tell that by the numbers on the tickets, and the identical goods are so fresh in my recollection - we had not bought them long before, within a month; I will swear I saw them within a month of the robbery - I find, by referring to the invoice, that I received some of them on the 3rd of January, and will swear I saw those a fortnight before the robbery- I sold some of the lot, but can identify these as not being sold, by the numbers on them; I divided them into two lots when they came in, and sold one lot, but the other was stolen - they are entered in my books, which are not here, but I cannot be mistaken; this invoice amounts to 28l. 10s. - I sold about half of that amount; I will swear I sold 10l. worth; after we were robbed I marked off on this invoice what were sold, and ascertained that these were not sold, I have a memorandum here which I extracted from my books myself, and I know the goods again: here is one piece I had seen about the 3rd of January, and I might have seen it the day before the robbery, and here is another; the person I bought them of is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.This invoice is for net? A. Plain and figured net, a very small portion of which formed part of the property lost; here are some pieces which I saw about the 3rd of January.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before he was taken? A. Never; he certainly was never a customer of ours - the warehouse is on the first floor; the street door was fastened inside - the thieves had come in through a private door in the passage, which opens into a trunkmaker's shop, and which was robbed of portmanteaus at the same time; a large portion of this property is unopened, just as it was when in our warehouse, and as we purchased it, not as we should sell it; we never sold a piece of lace entire like this - it is our own make, and we never made any other piece of this pattern.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you a shop-boy? A. I do not keep a shop; we have a warehouseman - this is an uncommon pattern of lace; I do not think you would find it in the whole City - I am satisfied I made no other of that pattern; there is certainly no other piece of this pattern to be found with my mark on it.</p>

            . In 1827 I lived in Fore-street, Cripplegate, and was a commission traveller to the prosecutors. These two pieces of figured bobbinet are their property; I saw them in their warehouse on the 6th of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How many warehousemen are there? Two and a youth - here are two others which I can speak to, and one which I know there is not another of the pattern; I took these out on Saturday to show to several people, but did not sell them - I brought them back; here is another pattern which I recollect perfectly well, but we had two of this, and sold one; I now speak positively to both - I did not examine it before so minutely.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has that piece the private mark on it? A. Yes, in pencil; I cannot say whether that is the mark of the house - I never saw the prisoner on business, nor ever near the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear you saw it within a week of the 3rd of January? A.

We had, I should think, 3000l. or 4000l. worth of goods on the 3rd of January - when I saw this piece again I recollected it as not having been sold.</p>

            . I was an under-gaoler of Newgate in 1827, and between sixteen and seventeen years. The prisoner was in custody in May, 1827; I took him from Newgate to the Court of King's Bench, Westminster, on Ascension-day, by habeas - I brought him back to Newgate, and on the following day took him again to Westminster; his bail was rejected, - and just at the foot of Westminster-bridge a large mob came round; I was afraid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080023"></xptr>he would escape, and took him into a public-house, to get rid of the mob; we had a glass of brandy and water - he wanted to go into the yard for a certain purpose: I took him out, brought him back into the room, and took some brandy and water which I found there; and when I brought him out I did not know what I was about, I was so giddy - I found I could not walk; a coach was called, and we got into it: it drove I do not know where - we got into Petticoat-lane, and he got away from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I ask for your own sake - I have no doubt he got away without your knowing any thing about it? A. I knew nothing about his intention to escape.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can only say I had no concern in the robbery - I have dealt largely for many years, and had papers to prove I bought property to a great amount, but since I have left England part of my papers have been destroyed; and Mr. Isaacs has papers in his possession - whether he has delivered them up I cannot say; they were papers of different sales, to a large amount.</p>

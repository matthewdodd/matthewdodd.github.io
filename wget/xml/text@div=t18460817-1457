I passed me at the corner of Queen-street, going down towards the Poultry, on I the same side the Mansion-house is—I saw the two prisoners following close I behind his heels, and watched them—the prosecutor went down the Poultry—I he stopped and looked at a shop-window, the prisoners stopped also—the. I shop was 100 yards from the corner of Queen-street—I cannot say what I shop it was—the prosecutor stopped about a minute—he then went on, and stopped at the corner of Arthur-street, London-bridge—the prisoners then separated, and stood about five or six yards apart—the prosecutor then crossed over the road towards Gracechurch-street, and came back on the other side of the way—the prisoners followed just after—I saw the prosecutor stop at a stationer's shop two doors from Fenchurch-street, on the right hand side in going from London-bridge—I saw Shrimpton close up close behind the prosecutor, as close as he could stand, and Williams stood close behind Sbrimpton, a little on the right, but as close as he could stand—that is I what is called covering—I saw Shrimpton's hand pass towards Williams, and I saw Williams take something from Shrimpton and put it into the left breast of his coat, between his coat and waistcoat—I was standing first at a shop door opposite—I then went into the shop, and directly I got in I saw what was done—I ran over directly, and both the prisoners walked away together towards Fenchurch-street—Williams was branching off towards the left at the corner of Fenchurch-street, and Shrimpton was going straight on—I took bold of Williams, and Shrimpton turned round to look at him—I dragged Williams towards Shrimpton, and took them both back and put them into the stationer's shop—the prosecutor was still looking in at the window—I told him he had been robbed, and he came into the shop—he said he had lost a pocket-book—I put my hand under Williams's left breast and produced this pocket-book—the prosecutor said it was his—when I took Shrimpton he said He was a respectable man, and told me his name and address—when I got him to the station the inspector asked what he did in the City—he said he was going to Woolwich to receive some money of a Mr. Saunders—the inspec<lb></lb>tor asked where Mr. Saunders lived—he said he did not know—that he did not know what he was saying—on the Monday he was taken before the Magis<lb></lb>trate and remanded—he then told me he knew no Mr. Saunders, and was not going to receive any money, but was only going for a trip down the river—I had told him that I was going to Woolwich to make inquiries, and then he told me that—when I first saw the prisoners it was about seven or eight minutes past</p>

               <p>three o'clock—the clock struck three as I was going across St. Paul's Churchyard—I followed them for about ten minutes—I was on the same side of the way when they first passed me, and I crossed—I saw they were looking at the prosecutor's pockets—I did not know either of them before—they looked round, and I looked in a pastry-cook's shop—I did not hear them speak, but they were together a good deal—sometimes they separated, and then they joined again—I noticed their dress—I particularly noticed Shrimpton, because he had a lightish Tweed coat on—when we got to the police-station in Garlick-hill, Bow-lane, the charge was booked at half-past three—I should say the pocket-book was taken about twenty minutes past three as near as I can guess—after we had been before the Magistrates and the prisoners were committed, I received a communication from Henry Wild—I searched Shrimpton, and ten sovereigns and some silver was found on him—I ascertained from him where he lived, and I went there—I think it was No. 35, in the Curtain-road—there is a wheelwright's shop there of his and his brothers—I found there these forty-three keys—three duplicates, one for a watch pawned for Si. 10., one for a piece of linen for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two bed<lb></lb>gowns for 1.—I found two pocket-books and a savings-bank book—some of these keys are small and some large—some of them are tied up in a bunch.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

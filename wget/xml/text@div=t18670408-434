I am a widow, and keep the Cricketers' Arms beerahop, Sand Street, Woolwich—after nine p.m. on 16th February the prisoner came in with another man—one of them asked for a pint of stout, which I served—he paid for it with a half-crown—I could not say which of them it was—I gave him two shillings and three pennies in change—I put the half-crown in the till—there, was no other there—a man named Clegg was standing in the bar, and after the men had left he said something to me, in consequence of which I looked into the till, and found that the half-crown was bad—my son fetched the prisoner back, and told him he had given me a bad half-crown; the prisoner said if he had he would give me a good one for it, and wanted me to give him back the bad one—the other man came back four or five minutes afterwards—I gave both of them in custody, but the other was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

My mother showed me a half-crown, and I went after the prisoner—I found him about 400 yards from the house with another man—I touched him on the shoulder and said, "You must come back to the house you have just been to"—the other man walked quickly away—a woman came up and told him not to go—he went back, and I told him he had passed a bad half-crown—he said, "Well, I will give you a good one for it"—the other man came in, and they were both given in custody.</p>

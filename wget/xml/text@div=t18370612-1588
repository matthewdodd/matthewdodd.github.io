                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Harvey, at Ilford, and I live at Stone Hall, Barking. On the 1st of June, the three prisoner had been employed in threshing Mr. Harvey's wheat in his barn—in con<lb></lb>sequence of some information I had received, I went up to the men when they quitted the barn—after they had locked the barn door and left it, I told them they had got some potatoes, and they should not carry them away—there is a potato barn adjoining the wheat barn—there is a partition between them, but you can get over it—I unlocked the potatoe barn, and each of the prisoners took and shook the potatoes on the heap—one had them in his basket, another in his hat, and the other under his arm—there were a very few pounds—I found 1/2 of a cwt. removed from the potato barn into the wheat barn, and it was from the wheat barn they came when I stopped them—none of them had any business to remove them—they had been working near the spot where the potatoes were found.</p>

            . On the 20th of April I was absent about twenty minutes, when I returned it was between four and five o'clock. I met the prisoner coming down stairs; I catched hold of her and made an alarm, and seeing my door open I charged her with robbing of me; she said she had not; a person of the first floor came to my assistance, and then Mr. Green came; when she found she could not get away she went up into my room and dropped the things there; Mr. Green went into the room. The prisoner got in by a false key. She had four keys two of them opened the door.</p>

               <p>Brooks. I had; but I had no suspicion about what sort of a lodging she would help me to. We went both together from that public house to a lodging in <placeName id="t17700425-33-crimeloc213">Cross-lane</placeName>

            . Taylor desired I would give her some money to get some supper; I gave her a shilling to fetch some. She got some beef and bread; we eat it: we had some beer, and a glass of rasberry brandy; then I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them go to bed with you?</p>


               <p>Brooks. No; but after I was got in bed, Taylor asked me, if I had any objection to her lying with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say in answer to that?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I told her, I had no objection. She came to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Rynce?</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Brooks. We went to bed about nine o'clock. I know at that time I had my watch; I wound it up before I went to bed, and put it into my breeches pocket, and put them under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I had four guineas and eighteen pence in my handkerchief, in my breeches pocket, at the time I went to sleep, and awaked about one, and she was gone from me. I missed my watch directly, because I did not hear it go. Then I examined my pocket, and my money was gone, and a penny was put into my pocket. Then I sat up in the bed till it was light. Then I got up, and enquired about in the neighbourhood after these women. I did not know what they were till I enquired their character. I found they had been to a shop, and bought each of them a pair of silver buckles. I had no money left to advertise my watch; Mr. Welch advertised it. I never got it again. I took the two prisoners up the Tuesday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge Rynce?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Because they were in company together, and lived together. The justice asked them, where they bought the buckles? They contradicted themselves in all they said.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say about the watch?</p>
               <p>Brooks. When I took up Taylor, she said, one Polly had got it. Rynce said, she knew nothing of it.</p>

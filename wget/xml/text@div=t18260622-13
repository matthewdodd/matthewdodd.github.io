            . I live in Brownlow-street, and attended the prisoner as char-woman for three or four months. I usually went to her lodgings about eight o'clock in the morning. On Wednesday, the 7th of June, I went there at eight o'clock - she opened the door to me, looked at the clock, and said it was late - I made no answer, but proceeded to light the fire; she was then in her bed-room- she came to me - I said "What a violent pain I have in my head;" she said "That is bad;" there is a small room next to the bed-room where this child slept - I went there for a duster, and saw the child laying in bed asleep - it had a colour on its cheek, and appeared in good health; the prisoner's husband was dressing in his bed-room; I went out for some bread, and when I returned she was poking the fire; I was not gone many minuts - I noticed how dull the fire burnt, and asked her if I should put the kettle on - it was on a trivet then; she said it would boil time enough; I asked if I should fetch some butter - she said there was enough - but there was scarcely any; I left the house about twenty minutes to nine, and in about half an hour I heard that a murder had been committed. I had noticed for the last three weeks that she had been very low - I saw her at Marlborough-street about twelve o'clock that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Eight o'clock was your usual time to go there? A. Yes; I got there rather before, and yet she said I was late, and said there was plenty of butter when there was hardly enough for a slice of bread. No mother on earth could behave kinder to a child than she did to this; for three weeks previous to this she had sat moping about; she always appeared kind and humane. On this morning I had left a very good fire, but she had nearly put it out; she had made a sort of confident of me, but for the last three weeks had hardly spoken.</p>

Mr. Brown ran up stairs - I called out "What is the matter Brown?" he made no answer, but ran up - I followed and met him coming out of the middle room, tearing his hair, wringing his hands, and stamping; he turned round, followed me into the room, opened the door of the third room, where the child lay, and said "For God's sake look at my baby; Price, look at my baby;" it lay on the floor with its throat cut, smothered in blood; he was quite frantic; I was going out of the room but met the prisoner, as I got on the landing, coming up stairs; her left hand was covered with blood - she walked by me into the room, and said "Price!" but I do not know what else; she went into the sitting room, and said "Where is my child - what have I done?" she stood up, and by this time a dozen persons had got into the room; she spoke in a violent manner - as soon as her husband came into the room he said"Ann, what have you done? you have murdered my baby;" she made no answer, but kept saying "Where is the child - what have I done?" Brown laid hold of her round the neck - they both fell on the sofa - he kissed her- she appeared faint, and he was frantic - he got up and walked about stamping - two women held her, fearing she might commit self-destruction. I remained there till the officers came, which was about ten minutes past nine - she seemed in great grief, and frantic; they took her away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220011"></xptr>- I saw her at Marlborough-street about twelve o'clock, and shook hands with her - she seemed then much in her usual way; I saw a knife in her husband's hands, while she was in the front room - he took it from the sink - it was steeped in blood; the sink is within a yard of where the child lay; I have not observed any difference in her conduct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you attend to your business? A. Yes; there is a window between my shop and theirs; she must pass through the street to get to the shop; she made the discovery herself - her manner was wild and frantic - she had had the child there about eighteen months, and was extremely kind and tender to it; we have noticed her being remarkably kind to it.</p>

            . I live in Queen-street, Seven-dials, right opposite to the prisoner - I have known her nearly seven years; she is fifty-one years old, and her husband about twenty-eight; I visited them - they kept a coalshed. I have lately observed her dull and heavy, and particularly on the Tuesday before this happened. I saw the child several times on Tuesday - it was noticing my dog at the door, about three o'clock in the afternoon; it used to ride on it, and that pleased the prisoner, but on this occasion the child pulled her apron to attract her notice, and said, "Mammy," but she stood leaning on the door-post for a quarter of an hour, and did not notice the child, though it kept wishing her to look at the dog; her conduct to the child was very good indeed; I knew she was not its mother; she always let it go to see its mother whenever it was wanted. I never heard any dispute between her and her husband - they lived more happy after the child lived with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you hear of what happened? A. Mr. Brown came over and took me to his passage. I saw the prisoner in the shop all bloody, holding her hands up, and saying,"What have I done?" she did not notice me; I looked at her hands, and asked what she had done - she made no answer. I went up stairs with Brown, into the little room where the child slept, and found it out of bed, laying in the corner, on the floor, by the window, within arms length of the sink, which is in the other room; the child was warm, and the blood flowing; I was lost for a few minutes, and after recovering I helped the beadle to place the body on the table - its head was nearly cut off. I saw the prisoner again about twelve o'clock, before the Magistrate - she stood there agitated, and working her fingers about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she bear the character of a humane person? A. She did. I never saw her in a passion; she humoured this child more than I would mine - she has seemed lost lately.</p>

            . I am assistant overseer of St. Giles's; Queen-street is in that parish.

            . I am an officer. I was taking the prisoner to the office on the morning of the 7th of June, and knowing her I said "What, in the name of God, could passess you to do this?" - she said it was done in a moment, and she was very sorry for it, and did not know at the moment what she was doing; she then cried. I asked where the child was at the time - she said it was asleep in bed - that she laid hold of it, took the knife off the table and did it. She then complained very much of a person named Easley continually annoying her, and one Bentley encouraging her in doing so; I know she was tensed by these women coming opposite her house with a child. I have known her twelve months; she bore an excellent character.</p>

            . I live in Bolton-row, and have known the prisoner thirty years - she lived in my mother's service, and was in our house about a year and a half, in a deranged state; her countenance to-day is just the same as when she was in that state - it is not her usual appearance; she was under the care of her mother in our house, who lived forty years with us, and died in our service. - The prisoner left us, and went into Mrs. Cosard's service, but was sent back to us, in consequence of attempting to drown herself, and was placed under her mother's care - she was once out all night, and came home in a desponding state, and said she had been on London-bridge all night. When she was in this desponding state she would sit, pretending to be at work, but doing nothing, and would never speak - at other times she was quite communicative; she had nursed two of my brothers; they had been ill. My mother and her's were worn out with attending them; she came up, and asked if she could be of any service - that was the first symptom of her coming to herself.</p>
               <p>Mr. BARRY. Q. What are you? A. I give instructions in fencing. I think this circumstance took place in 1805. Mrs. Cosard wanted to have her again, but the late Dr. Baillie thought it not proper, from his opinion of her mind.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 57.) On the 29th of August 1 was on duty in Stamford-hill-road. About two o'clock in the morning, before daylight, I stopped the prisoner in the road, with a sack, containing a set of chaise harness—I asked where he got it—he said his master sent him to Covent-garden to fetch a horse and chaise, which was standing at livery there, and he had taken the harness to fetch it with—he continued in that story—but I suspected him, and took him to the station-house—he said he was under-salesman to his master—several countrymen passed going to market, and we got several of them to look at him, but none of them could recognise him—I took him to Covent-garden market, and carried the harness myself, and when I got there, almost into the market, he said, "The truth is the truth; if you will come round the comer I will confess the truth"—I went round the comer with him, and he said he stole it out of Reed's stable—the property there belongs to the prosecutor—he said the stable door was locked, and he got through the window—he tried to baffle me several times on the road.</p>

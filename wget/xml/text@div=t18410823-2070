                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Fenwick, who keeps the Bell public-house in Ratcliffe-highway. Barney Feeney intrusted me with a sovereign to deliver to his wife if she called—he came in after with the prisoner, and Barney inquired whether his wife had called—I said not—I took the sovereign out of the till, wrapped in paper, laid it on the counter, and said, "There is your sovereign"—I went to the other end of the counter to serve a customer, Barney called for something to treat the pri<lb></lb>soner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230074"></xptr>
               <p>and then said, "Now I will thank you for my sovereign"—I said I had given it him—he said, "If you have given me the sovereign, where is it?"—I said he had better search his pocket—I saw a piece of paper lying on the floor at Barney's feet—it was such a piece as I had wrapped the sovereign in—my husband came in, and got a policeman—the policeman said to the prisoner, "Do you know any thing of this sovereign?"—he said, "No"—he said, "Have you got a sovereign about you?"—he said, "No"—I noticed it was a new sovereign, but not of the present reign.</p>

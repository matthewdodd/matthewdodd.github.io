            . I am a porter at Billingsgate. On the 25th of January, I saw Pickett there - I had carried loads for him before. He gave me this liquorice root to go and sell it, and told me there were 28 lbs. of it. He went to Gracechurch-street with me, and waited outside while I went into a shop to sell it - they would not buy so small a quantity. I said I would go and sell it in Covent-garden-market, which he consented to - I took it to Mr. Grimley, The prisoner told me to ask 1 s. a pound, but to take 10 d. I left it at Mr. Grimley's, returned, and told Pickett it was stopped on suspicion of its being stolen; he said</p>
               <p>"Oh, never mind that!" I said,</p>
               <p>"Come up to Covent-garden-market, and you will get it." He said he was going home, and would call himself, and not trouble me to go with him. The next day I went to Brentford to find him, but he had absconded.</p>

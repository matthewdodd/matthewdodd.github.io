About half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 22d of December, I was alarmed by the watchman springing his rattle; I got up and opened the window; he desired me to come down immediately, saying, there were two men in the area. I went down stairs, the watchman still springing his rattle; the men were in the area when I went down, and remained so until the patrol came to the watchman's assistance. It is an area with steps-there is a door to it, and the gate was fast; it has wooden rails round it. The watchman was outside the rails, with a pistol in his hand, which he presented at the men, and swore that if they attempted to move, he would blow their brains out. After they were secured, and we had taken them to the watch-house, we examined the premises. In the road proceeding to the watch-house, the prisoner, Bailey, endeavoured to relieve himself of a centre-bit which was concealed under his coat, by droping it, but the watchman caught it before it fell to the ground. On our arrival at the watch-house both the prisoners were searched, and we found a phosphorous box on the prisoner Bailey, who wished to extricate himself from it, but his trowsers were too tight, and it would not pass at the knee. We returned to the premises and examined them. On searching the cellar, which was open into the area, we found a crow-bar, with a candle, and a short knife, sharpened at both edges. On examining the window we found the lower square of glass in the middle, above the division of the sash, was broken, and the latch which fastened the lower part of the sash down, had been pushed back, and the lower part of the sash thrown up as far as it would go, and a hole made in the shutter with the centre-bit. The piece of wood was not actually cut out, but it had been in the progress of being taken out. They could not have got at that part of the shutter without first breaking the pane of glass, and undoing the latch. The shutter is about two inches from the glass of the window; the pane that was broken was in the middle, but the second from the top, and the third from the bottom. The incision in the shutter was not opposite that pane which had been broken.</p>

            . I was last up in the house the night previous. It was about twelve o'clock when I went to bed. I fastened the kitchen window about five o'clock in the evening-my duty was in the kitchen-there is only one window in it; the shutter was fastened in the inside with a bar which latches, and the window fastens with a book which hitches. After I had fastened it I tried if it was fast, by pushing it up, and it would not go up. I did not remain in the kitchen all the evening, for I went to church; when I came home the window was in the same state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I did not examine the window when I came from church; the bar on the inside appeared just as it was when I went out.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. My way home from church was past that window, and if it had been thrown up I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>MR. BOOTE. The shutter was nearly close to the window, and the fastening on the inside of the shutter was as it had been left, but a pane of glass broken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where the mark of this machine was, was it opposite the pane of glass that was broken, or where the window was thrown up - A. Where the window was thrown up, at the lower part.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEEPER. I am a watchman. I was going my rounds about two o'clock on the night in question, and turning the corner of York-place I saw a man lottering about; I stepped back to the railing, the person then proceeded on about eleven houses, when he had got nearly halfway he made a motion as if to evacuate, and when I got very near him he gave me the meeting. I stopped about Mr. Boote's place for a short time, and heard a great noise in the area, I looked about and saw that Mr. Boote's garden gate was not as I had left it at one o'clock. I then went in at the gate, up to the area railing,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140013"></xptr>and looking over the railings I saw two men, one of whom was apparently very busy, doing something at the area window. I immediately drew out my pistol, cocked it, levelled it at them, and threatened to shoot the first person that attempted to move either up or down. In the mean time I sprang my rattle, and was at least twenty minutes springing it, with the pistol in my right hand. While I was springing my rattle the patrol came up, drew his cutlass, and held it over the prisoners, while I got over the area rails and secured them. When we had secured them, I and the patrol entered the kitchen - I cannot say who opened the door. From thence we proceeded to the watch-house, and when we got about half way, the patrol tapped me on the shoulder, and also tapped Bailey on the shoulder, finding something was there, and said,"That is a pistol, I suppose." When it was about his middle I caught it in falling-it was the centre-bit. I am quite sure it fell from him. When we came to the watchhouse, the watch-house-keeper searched him, and took a box of phosphorus out of his trowsers, it was half way down to the knee. I returned to the house, but did not try the centre-bit at the window. I found a crow bar. The premises were found as Mr. Boote has described them. The candle was picked up under the steps where the prisoners stood, and this knife, in a leather case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Spencer was standing at the back of Bailey, who was within four or five steps of the bottom - He appeared to be busy with his hands. I did not see him doing any thing with the centre-bit, but I believe he had it. He was four or five steps from the bottom of the ladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his hands would be some distance from the shutter - A. The window is about up to a man's middle from the area bottom.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. The place where he stood on the ladder would be most convenient for him to work with the bit on the shutter.</p>

             M'GEE. I am patrole of Kensington. I heard the rattle sprung, and went to the assistance of the watchman. I went up to the railing, looked down the area, and am sure the two prisoners at the bar were the men that were standing in the area. The account the watchman has given is correct.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. I went the next day, and tried the centre-bit to the window it fitted exactly, and one more turn would have taken the bit out. I have kept these things ever since.</p>
               <p>(MR. ADOLPHUS objected, that though there was a breaking in this case, there was not a sufficient entering to constitute a felony. The objection was left for the decision of the Twelve Judges.)</p>
               <p>BAILEY'S Defence. I was coming along York-place, saw two men come out of the gate, and said to Spencer,"Here are two men coming out, it does not look well." We then went down into the area, found the centre-bit and phosphorus-box, and before we could well bring them out the watchman came.</p>

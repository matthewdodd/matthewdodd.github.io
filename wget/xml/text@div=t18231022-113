On the 17th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I missed this stew-pan from my shop; it was safe three hours before. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I found it in Gee's-court. The prisoner was in the shop. I told her it had been stolen from me. She said she bought it of a particular friend, of whom she had bought things before: that she knew where she lived, and would fetch her in a few minutes. I said,</p>
               <p>"Fetch the thief, and I will prosecute her." She then said the person told her she had been working at a gentleman's house, who was not able to pay her, and gave her this to sell. She went to fetch the person as I thought. I took the pan to the office, then went into Barrett's-court, where I had seen her go, and met her coming out of No. 8, with two men. They all declared the thief was not there, and had not been there all night. She afterwards said the woman was called Blind Mary, being blind of one eye. I went to the officer, and told him to look for the man who lived in the prisoner's house, and about three o'clock that afternoon she came to me with the daughter of the woman she accused as the thief, and said she was come to beg I would not prosecute the thief or her; and both said, if the mother and her were convicted, one would have seven years and the other fourteen. I said I would prosecute unless she produced her, as I was certain she could if she liked, but if she did she might look for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time in the morning did you first go to the shop - A. About ten o'clock. The pan stood outside the door, exposed for sale, with my mark chalked inside it. She came voluntarily to me. Afterwards a man came to me, who calls himself her husband; she was taken next morning. She said at another time, that the woman she bought it of was drunk on the bed when she went up. I asked why she did not bring her down. She said she promised to follow. She brought a young woman to the office herself.</p>

            . I am a beadle. Hames gave the prisoner till evening to find the woman she bought the pot of. I was then desired to take her. I went three different times to the house, but could find neither her nor her husband. On Saturday she was brought to me.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the office to insist on the beadle's coming to take the daughter and another woman, who I heard was concerned. The daughter acknowledged to me the night before that she had received the money her mother got for the pan. I gave myself up at the office.</p>

             re-examined. My brother officer brought a girl to the office, and I believe by the prisoner's request. I have searched for the mother, but cannot find her. She took me to a house opposite, No. 8, in Barrett's-court, as the house she lived in.</p>

            . I am a cooper, and live in Gee's-court, opposite the prisoner's - she is married. On the evening in question, about seven o'clock, I stood at my door with Mawn, the broker - the prisoner came over to me with this stew-pan, and said,</p>
               <p>"What may I give for this, a woman has brought it;" I weighed it in my hand, and said if she gave 7 s. she could not hurt, taking it as old copper. I did not examine it. Her husband not being at home, she did not know the value. Blind Mary was at the door looking after her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You advised her to buy it as old copper - - A. Not as old copper; I considered it as old copper. It was dark; I have now a better sight of it. Mawn, the broker, lives in Henrietta-street - I will be bound to say it is not worth above 7 s. Blind Mary used to lead her husband about begging. I went after her, and found she lived at No. 8, Barrett's-court; I went there with the prisoner, but could not find her - she was not laying drunk on the bed. I was about with the prisoner three or four hours, to get a warrant to apprehend the woman. She did not abscond.</p>

            . The value of it as old copper, is 12 s. - it cost two guineas and a half, and will fetch 30 s. now at any market. I marked it at 28 s., as the lowest price; it is equal to new.</p>

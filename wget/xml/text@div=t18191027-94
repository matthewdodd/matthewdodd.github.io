            . I was going over Tower-hill last Saturday three weeks, and met the prisoner and another man; they pushed Monk about, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, go on!" He tried to get from them. His jacket flew open, the prisoner put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and took his pocket-book out. I went up and told him he had lost something, he missed his pocket-book. I told him I knew the man quite well by his lurking about Rosemary-lane. I went down Rosemary-lane with the prosecutor to look for him, but could not find him until the following Saturday, when I saw him in Rosemary-lane, and followed him into Bishopsgate-street; I there met Forrester, who took him. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you related to the prisoner - A. No; I only know him by seeing him lurking about. My mother never quarrelled with him. I do not know where he lived. I live in Priest-alley, Tower-hill; the robbery was in Postern-row.</p>

            . I was in Aldgate High-street; the woman came up, asked if I was an officer, and desired me to take charge of the prisoner for robbing a pensioner on Tower-hill. I said I knew the case, for I was looking after one of the men. I told her to keep back, for it was not safe to apprehend him there - he was in Petticoat-lane. I followed him to Bishopsgate, and told him I wanted him. The woman came into the public-house, and gave the same account she has now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it. The woman's mother and I quarrelled, and she said she would be revenged on me. I never saw the woman before in my life.</p>

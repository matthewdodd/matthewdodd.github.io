                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Kidd and Podger, and live at Shad well; we carry on business as millers. Legerton was in our employ as foreman, and he had the whole charge of the flour and the mill—it was his duty to see everything brought into the mill correctly, and delivered out, and to make entries of flour and offal sold—we had a servant at the mill named Day—at the latter end of July, Day made a communication to me—on 12th or 13th Aug. he made another communication to me—in consequence of that, I went to the house of Digby, about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening—I went into the shop; he was behind the counter; he is a pork butcher—I asked him if he had not been to Shad well mill on the preceding day—he said he was there—I asked him to show me his ticket for what be brought away—he looked about in a few places, and on the shelves in the shop, and said, "I cannot find it; it is gone to the wash in my coat pocket"—I asked him what he did bring away—he said so many bushels of sweepings—I asked him what he brought away the second load—he told me so many bushels of sweepings again—I asked him if he had brought away any flour—he said, "No"—I said, "Are you certain you brought away no flour"—he said, "Yes, I am certain: so help me God, I did not"—I then said, "It is no use for you to deny having brought away the flour; you can very well remember if you did bring it away"—he replied, "I did not bring away any yesterday; I brought away one sack about a fortnight ago"—I went into the back premises, and saw some flour on a form in a sack—I looked at it—of course I could not swear to flour, it was not in our sack—I asked him who he got that from—he said, "From Mr. Cooper"—I asked him if he would allow me to search the premises to see if I could find the sack—he consented, and I found an empty sack of ours in an outhouse, where he keeps his pig—I told him that that was the sack he brought away yesterday, for it was a new one—he still denied it, but after some considerable time he acknowledged it—before he did that, I told him it was no use to deny it, because Day saw the flour put into his cart—he then said, "Well, it is no use for me to deny it; I did bring away a sack of flour, for which I paid 41<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the price of a sack of flour was 41<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have the book here in which it was the duty of Legerton</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Kidd and Podger. It is my duty to be at the mill at Shadwell—I was there in July and August—I recollect, in July, Digby came to the mill with a horse and cart—he had three quarters of middlings, and a sack of flour—I was standing at the mill door, Legerton put part of the middlings into the cart, and he put in a sack of flour and Digby covered it over with another empty sack—I then saw him go away—I made a communication to my master—in consequence of that I afterwards watched, and Digby came again on 12th Aug., and I saw him take away thirty-four bushels of sweepings and a sack of flour in a new sack—I have seen the sack that was found in Digby's house—I could not swear it was the same sack that was taken from the mill, but I believe it was—Legerton put part of the sweepings in the cart on 12th Aug., I do not know who put in the rest—I saw the sack of flour put in—it was covered over; the sweepings were not—I saw Digby go away—he came again the same day, and bought some more sweepings.</p>

             sworn. - I occupy the premises in Goswell-street, for the keeping of horses; I had missed hay before this happened; in the dusk of the evening, of the 4th of March, I went to see if I could see any thing moving about the premises, after the gates were locked up, and, in the passage from the stairs, I met the prisoner, Marsh, with a truss of hay upon his shoulder, the other prisoner was in my service; I asked him where he was going with that, he said, to some alley in Bishopsgate-street, that he had borrowed it of a man in the stable; I found that he gates of the yard were open, there were some of my loading a waggon just by, and I sent for a constable; I took him back to the stables, and after a little time, I heard some rustling in the straw, I had a light in my hand; Verney then came out of the straw; I asked him what he was doing there, he said, he was watching for the people that stole the hay; I immediately secured him, it was about a quarter after seven.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What distance is this place from your house? - A. I should suppose, pretty near a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Still. I searched the stables the next day, and among the straw, where the prisoner came from, I found the lock of the gates.</p>
               <p>Mr. Willan. I had Marsh searched, and a picklock-key was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Verney's defence. Marsh came and asked me to lend him a truss of hay for a day or two; I let him have the truss; I saw the gates open, I thought the man was gone to the Bull-and-mouth to know what horses were coming there, and I laid down in the straw till he came back.</p>
               <p>Marsh's defence. I borrowed the truss of hay of this man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Marsh called a Mr. Clarke, to whom he had been coachman five years, and two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

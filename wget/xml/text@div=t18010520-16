            : In the month of March, we lost a great quantity of plank and veneers, and in the snow we traced a foot-step into a stone-mason's yard; and last Wednesday, in consequence of information, I went to Worship-street office to look at a board, and finding it to be my master's property, I went the next day to see the prisoner; I know it to be my master's by the form of it; it has been cut in a particular manner, I cut it myself; the prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DANIELS sworn. - I am a cabinetmaker: About two months ago, the prisoner brought me this board; I had the board in my possession, but had not an opportunity of taking the prisoner till last Wednesday; the prisoner offered it for sale at my door for eight shillings; I immediately measured the board, and found it contained seven feet of mahogany, worth half-a-crown a foot; I asked the prisoner some questions, where he lived, and how he came by the board; he told me he lived in a court in the Minories; I told him to leave the board with me, and I would enquire and endeavour to learn whether he had obtained it honestly; I stopped the board, and made enquiries, but could hear nothing of him; the prisoner did not apply for the money till after I had given information at Worship-street; he applied for the money when I was in the country, and I had not an opportunity of taking him till the 13th of the present month; he asked me if I was the person belonging to the shop, I told him, yes; I knew him again immediately, and called down one of my men; the prisoner then said, what you mean to keep me then; he then went to the door, looked up, and said, it looks like rain; I told him he had better stop, and see if we could do any thing with the board; he immediately went out of the house, and into a public-house at the corner of the street where I lived; I followed him up Old-street, and pointed him out to the officer; it was with some difficulty that the officer secured him; the officer is not here; I saw him in about two minutes after he was secured; I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MOORE sworn. - I am a headborough belonging to St. Luke's: On the 13th of this month I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at the bar; I found him at Mr. Daniels's house, in Old-street-road. (The board was produced and identified by Stocks).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is eleven weeks ago since I carried the board to Mr. Daniels; I bought it of a carpenter and cabinet-maker; I did not immediately want it; I kept it some little time, and then I carried it to that gentleman to dispose of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Watton, near Croydon—I keep two cows and a horse and cart. I milked my cow at six o'clock on Wednesday night, the 15th of May, in Watton Chase, and left her there—it is not fenced in—in the morning, when I went to milk her, she was gone—I saw her again, on the Wednesday following, at the Ram, in Smithfield, in care of the officer—the prisoner lived about four miles from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City-policeman. I was in Smithfield market on Friday, the 17th of May, at seven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner about eight o'clock with a cow—I asked him if it was for sale—he said he had not the selling of it—I asked who had—he said it belonged to a kinsman of his, and that he was gone to Piccadilly with two more—I left him a short time, and then saw him offer the cow for sale—I said, "You are offering it for sale before your kinsman comes back"—he said, "Yes, I was to offer it for sale, if he did not come back soon"—I afterwards saw him sell it, and said, "Now you have sold the cow"—he said, "Yes, I suppose you think I have stolen it"—I said "Yes, and you must go with me to the station-house unless you can find somebody you know"—he said he knew a hundred people in the market—I went round with him, and found only one person who knew him—he was much such another man as himself—he could give me no satisfaction—I took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, and took the cow to the Ram—it was shown to the prosecutor afterwards, and he claimed it.</p>

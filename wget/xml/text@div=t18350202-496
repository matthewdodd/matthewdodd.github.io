                  </hi>. I am a cutler, and live in Wych-street, Strand. The male prisoner has been in my employ nearly three years—he went on er<lb></lb>rands, and cleaned the windows—Watson used to come once a week for our washing—on the 29th of December I lost some ivory-handled knives and forks—I did not miss these, but others—these were found at Mrs. Teevan's, a broker's—the male prisoner had access to them—Watson lives in Yates-court, Carey-street—none of the property in this indictment was found at her house.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a broker's shop, in Drury-lane. On the 31st of December these white-handled knives and forks were brought to me by Watson—I had known her before, by buying furniture of her—I did not know where she lived—she said she had these knives and forks to dispose of, would I buy them—I asked who they belonged to—she said they were</p>

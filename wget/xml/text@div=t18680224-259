                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). From information I received I had been watching the prisoners since the latter part of January—Wylie was in the employment of Messrs. Millington &amp; Co., wholesale stationers, Budge Row, Cannon Street—on 18th February I saw Poole in Bishopgate Street—I said "I am a detective officer and wish to speak to you; I have been watching you and a man named Wylie some time"—he said, "Wylie, I don't know anybody of that name"—I said, "He is in the employment of Messrs. Millington &amp; Hutton"—he said, "I don't know anyone of that name at all"—I said "You have been disposing of a large quantity of stationery to a party in the Hackney Road, account books and other things"—he said, "I make those books and sell them"—I said, "But there are other things, there are a large quantity of envelopes and note-paper"—he said, "I deal in those, I am a waste paper dealer, and have been so the last two or three years"—I said, "The goods I speak of are not waste paper, they are all new goods, and the goods of Messrs. Millington &amp; Hutton; from whom did you get these goods?"—he said, "From a man who has been to my house two or three times during the week"—he said he did not know what the man's name was, and I took him to the station—I then went down to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's and saw Wylie—he made a statement to me, and I took him to the station—I then asked Poole if Wylie was the man from whom he had the goods—he hesitated for a minute or two, and then said "Yes"—I said, "He has made a statement in effect to this: the first time he did anything with you was before Christmas with respect to some outsides; that you asked him to get you some other goods and he did so; and that from that time up to the present you have been bothering him to take these goods and give them to you"—I pointed to the goods that are there and said, "These are the goods of which I speak"—he said, "Yes, I had those from him, I sold them and gave him the money"—Wylie said, "You only gave me a few shillings at a time"—that was all that took place.</p>

I am a stationer, at 174, Hackney Road—I know Poole—on 18th January he called on me and represented himself as a vellum binder—he offered me two foolscap books, a dozen ciphering books, and two reams of note paper—I purchased them of him for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he came again a few days after, and brought some envelopes—I bought them of him for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1000—I made inquiries, and communicated with the police, and under their direction I had two or three more transactions with the prisoner—I handed the goods to the officer Hancock—I never saw Wylie in any of these transactions, only Poole.</p>

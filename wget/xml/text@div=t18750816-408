                  </hi>. I am a merchant, carrying on business at Billiter Street, City—in 1874 I transacted business with J. C. Gostling &amp; Co., Limited, and was indebted to them in the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 24th November I accepted a bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., due on 9th February, 1874—I also accepted a draft for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. marked C, dated 23rd February, 1874, due on 26th April, 1874, and a draft of the company for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., marked B, on 21st August, 1874, due 24th November—on 29th September, 1874, I paid to the company a cheque for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in settlement of the balance of the account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Metcalfe. I had done business with the defendant for some three years, I think, before the company was formed—he was the" only responsible person that I knew connected with the business; he was the only person whose signature I would accept as final—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was not given directly as an advance on goods—the company, as I understood, was in need of money—Mr. Gostling came to me, and having done business with him for so many years I made this advance in relief of the company; I understood that from the prisoner—the state of the accounts I can only explain in this way, we had made certain advances to Gostling &amp; Co. against goods, and there the matter ended, and we should be entitled to hold those goods, and when the returns came I gave him a cheque for the balance, if the goods covered a balance—there were balances continually accruing from time to time—I made the advance to him because I had done business with him so long, and I was anxious to help him—I advanced them as a loan, always bearing in mind that I had the possible surplus returns to come—I took the risk of that—that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was afterwards honoured—the advance was increased to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. determined on 27th February, 1874; it was then increased to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there were renewals from time to time—the final bill was dishonoured; I have that in my pocket—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was also, as I understood, advanced to the company for the company's funds—I was doing a current business with them, and of course the monies I advanced would come from their account to get them settled—we made advances on shipments, and they have been completed during the last month; the returns have been determined since the pro<lb></lb>secution has been going on—at the time I was at the Mansion House they were not returned; some of them at least—those transactions were not to a very large amount; a few hundreds—it is a very great point that a new firm should be known abroad, and until it is known the business can't be pushed at all—it was pushed for the purpose of establishing it abroad—this being comparatively a young company, in my judgment there was a necessity for pressing it rather beyond what would ordinarily be done by an older company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I knew nothing about how Mr. Gostling stood with the company—all I knew was that he was the representative of the company, and whatever statement he made I took it as the company's <hi rend="italic">ipse did it.</hi>

                  </hi>.

               <p>surmise that it had been to both banks—I have no doubt that the London and County Bank were the bankers of the company—I have often seen my cheques from the company crossed by the London and County Bank, and I presume they bank with John Brown &amp; Co. as well—the cheque came to me from my bankers—I can't say whether it went to the London and County Bank first and was refused, and then went to John Brown—I have exchanged ac<lb></lb>ceptances for the company, I think, since, November, 1873, about the time of their commencement—I lent him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash on interest—the 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was payment for goods I had bought and paid cash for—subsequently Mr. Goatling, the managing director, and the only man I knew in the concern, applied to me for a further loan—I told him I could not do it—he pressed me, and proposed that I should give him my acceptance and he would give me the company's acceptance in return—I told him I would do so if he gave me security, and he gave me a fully paid-up scrip of the company—it was not paid; it was renewed continually up to the present time or until the disruption of the company—I hold it against them now—I endorsed the bill away, and the company were sued upon it afterwards and paid it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw Mr. Gostling in all my transactions—the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan was made in November, 1873—that was a cash loan—it was arranged in this way, he said that he had formed a company, he had got other directors to join him and he was rather short of his portion of capital, they had to make up 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and if I would lend him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would oblige him, and as I had been doing business with him since 1871, and I was anxious to assist him—he gave me as security the fully paid-up scrip of the company, which was in his own name—I still hold the scrip, and the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not paid—I consider the company liable to me for the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they have not been sued upon that—I consider both the company and Mr. Gostling aw. liable—I considered it a personal loan and a loan to the company as well, because I think he gave me a sale note for 500 casks of cement, or a letter to that effect at any rate—I have not lost it; I have got it somewhere—I lent him the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a sale note or a letter to that effect, it was not posi<lb></lb>tively a sale note, it was not stamped.</p>

C. Gostling and William Gostling be allowed to draw upon the company in anticipation of profits during the current six months at the rate of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month each, and five per cent, to be charged on the respective accounts—the minute book represents that the prisoner was present—on the 24th of February there was a resolution that</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "14th September; I beg to place in your hands my resignation as managing director of J. C. Gostling &amp; Co., which please communicate to the shareholders.") The resolution was carried on that date and he ceased to be managing director or director—he did not act—he was present at the meeting—I was aware of his subsequent appointment as manager of the cement works at Northfleet—he wrote this letter to Mr. Miller on 11th September "I will accept the offer made by the shareholders to execute works as hitherto on the same terras offered to and accepted by Mr. William Gostling"—that appointment did not in any way involve any financial dealings on his part—the prisoner's letter was answered by this letter marked I from Mr. Miller. (<hi rend="italic">Read-</hi>: "I am in receipt of yours of yesterday's date the contents of which I will submit to my directors; it will however be needful to define exactly what your duties are in the future to be, so as to prevent any misunderstanding; one of the stipulations that we make is that you cease to have anything to do with the management of the City office but leave that entirely in the hands of your brother and myself; that being so, your duties would be solely confined to the works at Northfleet; also that you hand over to the company the lease of the office in Gracechurch Street.

I have not got the letter that was enclosed, I don't know that I made any inquiry where the prisoner was getting the funds to pay things, or why he went to Brown's—the complaint is not that the bills were taken to. Brown's, but that the money was left there—we had no account open with Brown &amp; Co.—I presume if we had got the money we should have had no ground of complaint—I do not know of my own knowledge that large sums have been paid by him from Brown &amp; Co. to our company; I do not know it from the books, I have nothing whatever to do with the books, and never examined them—Mabbs was taken to the police-court on the part of the prosecution and gave evidence; I can't say whether I was present—Pollock. succeeded him as cashier; I do not think he was examined on the part of the pro<lb></lb>secution—I suppose the funds the prisoner paid came from the capital, 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was paid up by the shareholders—I can't say how long it was before Mr. Peel's was paid up, the books show—the bill I have spoken of was not for the purpose of paying Mr. George Peel's shares, it was for the payment of Mr. Alfred Peel's own shares—Mr. Bargate gave a bill for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a portion of his shares—I have heard that was refused by the London and County Bank; I made no inquiry; I know it now—I can't say of my own actual knowledge that was taken to Brown &amp; Co. to be dis<lb></lb>counted, I have heard that it was—my own actual knowledge, does not extend to much, because I was paying no attention it—it was discounted somewhere—that was in June or July, 1874:—the 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not all paid up at once, but in a very short period—I can't say from memory what period, the books will show—I know that the company was occasionally short of money, I can't say continually; it was short of money, and for good reasons—applications were made to me continually for money, and I sent up very large sums—I did not direct the prisoner and his brother to get money wherever they could, to protect the interests of the company—I suppose the bills were to be met partly by the payments for their own shares, which had not been fully paid up—the prisoner was to realise his assets, but they never were realised; it was his business to collect the assets, and they were to form the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the shares that were allotted him—the assets were supposed to be good when the company was formed, and as they were realised. they were to go in pay<lb></lb>ment of the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of shares that were allotted him; if the assets turned out bad he would have to pay for his shares; that is not in writing, but it was understood, and was recognised by him—his original 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of shares have not been paid up to this date"; his brother's have been paid up—something like 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd of the prisoner's shares has not been paid—I can't say whether that corresponds with the liquidation account—I can't say whether he paid off 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the liquida<lb></lb>tion account, I corresponded with him—I am sorry to say I have not kept a great number of the letters—the prisoner paid something on his shares undoubtedly, I can't say what amount—I can't form an opinion of the pre<lb></lb>sent value of the property, I have not estimated it; I suppose at a rough guess it is worth some 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the present moment—my interest is represented by 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a mortgage of 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides; that has been</p>

Gostling, and thirty shares (1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.), in the name of William Gostling—the shares deposited with Mr. Tickell must form part of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because there was no transfer to Mr. Tickell; they form part of the shares that he still holds, part of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they have not been transferred—I may have known as early as the 12th November, 1873, that the company was very short of money, and may have directed the prisoner on no account to let the bills be returned—I did not give him directions how the money was to be raised; I assumed that money would be coming in for payment of his shares—I have no recollection of any letters passing then—I was up in town in November, and no doubt I should have verbal communication; shares were being taken up by Mr. Peel and others; I was only making efforts to raise money by the issue of the shares; I offered shares to my friends—I am not aware that there was any difficulty with Mr. Peel; he paid for his shares as they were allotted him, according to an arrangement made—I believe there is a letter of mine in Court, to the effect, that I suggested to the prisoner to have recourse to all kinds of expedients in order to meet the acceptances and the weekly payments—I did not recommend him to raise money in any way it could be raised, or by discounting the bills of the company—of course he would have to discount the bills of the company—he would do that with the London and County Bank—I gave him no directions if they refused—I did not tell him not to discount with John Brown &amp; Co.—a gentleman from Brown's was examined at the police-court, I don't know whether he is here; Mr. Peel is not here, or Mr. Bargate, or any other director or shareholder that I am aware of, except the prisoner's brother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This letter is the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read, from the prisoner to the manager of the London and County Bank, 12th March.</hi> "Dear Sir,—Please note that in future our acceptances will be signed by one director, only instead of two as formerly, and we beg you will pay drafts so signed—J. C. Gostling, William Gostling, pro. John C. Gostling &amp; Co. Limited, John C. Gostling." I was not aware of the existence of that letter until April this year—he never told me that he had written such a letter, nor had I ever authorised his writing it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of the present shareholders up to March 1875—I think there are two names that are not shareholders, Charlton, and Theobalds name occur twice, there is only one Theoabld a shareholder now; Mr. Peel holds 50 shares, the shares are 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Peels, one holding 70 and the other 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they are friends of mine, Mr. Prothero Smith holds 100; he is not a friend of mine, Mr. Maddox holds 170, he is a friend; Mr. Bargate forty, and Mr. Rawlinson 120, they are my friends; Mr. Abrahams holds eight—I know him slightly all the shares are paid up—the 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I advanced was I presume expended for the benefit of the company; the prisoner would have to deal with that</p>

               <p>as well as with the other funds; that sum was advanced shortly before the formation of the company, and was taken over by the company at its for<lb></lb>mation—it was repaid I think in January last, out of the funds of the com<lb></lb>pany—I never gave the prisoner any authority directly to get bills dis<lb></lb>counted by Brown &amp; Co.—the directors had no control over any account of Brown &amp; Co.—I never saw it—I believe there is no entry in any of the books relating to it—if the prisoner had been able to pay up his shares that would not have entirely sufficed for the purposes of the Company; it would have prevented the difficulties that appear to have arisen at the time the money was needed—since this accusation has been made an accountant on the prisoner's behalf has had complete access to all the books and every document belonging to the Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Lambeth branch of of the London and County Bank—J. C. Gostling &amp; Co., Limited, have an account there—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two paying in slips from the Company to their account—on the slip dated 17th August, 1874, there is a bill of 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Taylor; that with other bills was paid in for dis<lb></lb>count—the whole of the bills were returned to the company for the signa<lb></lb>ture of Mr. Miller the chairman; they were returned by the cashier, but were submitted to me—they were brought back with Mr. Miller's signature on 21st August, with the exception of the 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill, and discounted—I don't know what became of that bill—if it had had Mr. Miller's signature I should not have refused to discount it, but it was never brought back to me—I remember receiving this letter of 12th March; that was acted upon by me up to the date of the resolution of 10th July.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not the company's account with me—here is the pass-book—the first entry here is on 1st November, 1873, the amount then paid in was 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 12th Nov. there was about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hand, and on 13th 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out; at the end of the month there was 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in—on 12th December 1,687<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at the end, 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 5th January, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on the 15th, 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at the end, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 13th February it was overdrawn. 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I see on the next day they paid in 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cover, that; that might probably have been paid in the same night, and not passed to the credit—on 4th December, 1873, the account was overdrawn 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I see 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in on the 5th—on 25th March it was overdrawn 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 2nd April, 544<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but nest day bills were passed to the credit of the account, and in all probability they were in the house at the time, pending in<lb></lb>quiries; bills are frequently left a day or two before in order that inquiry may be made as to the responsibility of the acceptors, and we should not pass them until that was ascertained—the amount of those bills was 926<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 21st April the account was overdrawn about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 13th May the balance was about even—the account was frequently "overdrawn—I should think about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the largest amount'—there is no absolute limit—I should not allow an account to be overdrawn except under special circumstances—we had bills in all probability in the house at the time—I cannot tell how often bills of the company were refused to be discounted; it did not happen frequently—I remember the bill of Mr. Peel's, but I cannot <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you the date—we never returned the company acceptances that I am aware of; we have refused to discount drafts upon them—I beg to distinguish' between drafts and acceptances, their own acceptances were never returned I believe; they were never offered—I cannot tell you whether cheques of Brown &amp;</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It would be impossible for us to name the drawer of cheques paid in—the person who paid them in would of course be able to prove it—during the existence of the company, we have refused very few bills, perhaps half a dozen—we certainly prefer trade bills—Mr. Peel's bill was refused because it appeared on the face of it to be an accommodation bill—the bill was held by us and paid at maturity—when a cheque is paid in by a customer to his account, we always stamp it, and we stamp a bill that is brought for discount—this cheque of Collins for 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was never passed through our bank, nor this bill of Tickells for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or this cheque for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—about 92,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has gone through our hands on behalf of the company during its existence.</p>

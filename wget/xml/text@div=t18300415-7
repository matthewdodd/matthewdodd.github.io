On the 25th of February, a little after ten o'clock at night, I was sitting in my parlour - my mother was there asleep; I thought I heard something - I turned my head to look, and saw the prisoner standing by my side in the parlour, putting his hand into his trousers pocket; I asked what he wanted - he said to purchase a comb; I told him we did not sell them, and that he did not want one - I said he was a thief, and collared him; he seemed rather confused at first, but afterwards struck me to get away - I held him fast; he dragged me along to the shop door, and into the street, and struck me again in the street - I called Stop thief! the Police-constable came up, took him, and found this watch on him, which hung on the mantle-piece; I saw it two minutes before he came in - it is worth 5l.; my father had had it seventeen years - I do not know what he gave for it; a gentlemen valued it at 5l. - as I sat in my parlour I fancied I heard a noise; I had not been in the parlour three minutes, and had come out of the shop - I hasped the shop door when I left it; I am quite certain it was shut and hasped - the parlour door was open.</p>

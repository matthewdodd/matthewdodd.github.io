            . I am the son of John Frederick Shusler, and live at Chelsea. I am eleven years old. On the 1st of November, at ten o'clock in the morning, I and my father were crossing <placeName id="t18251208-18-crimeloc86">Hyde-park</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18251208-18-crimeloc86" type="placeName" value="Hyde-park"></interp>

I ran after them and got it from them - my father was only two or three yards from me - they both ran one way. I then went and told my father - he pursued and caught one and the officer the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROACH. Where was this? A. Near Grosvenor-gate - it happened on the footpath; we were about half-way from the barracks - there were three boys together - Brown asked what I had in my basket - both the prisoners struck me; they did not resist my getting the parcel back - they had ran away with it towards Kensingtoh-gardens, about the length of this Court. I did not call out nor tell my father till I had got it back.</p>
               <p>JOHN FREDERICK SHUSLER. I was with my son and gave him a bundle, containing these things; I stopped to speak to a gentleman and told him to go towards Cumberland-gate; I did not see the prisoners stop him, but after our talk was over I went on, and he told me he had been robbed of his parcel - he pointed out the prisoners and another boy, who were walking towards the powder-mills, and when they saw me pursuing they all three ran; I overtook Brown, and asked how he came to insult my boy - he said it was the other boys. Brown was then going to run, but I took him to Grosvenor-gate to inform the park-keeper; an officer brought up Dunbeven, and I gave them in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw nothing of the transaction? A. No, my son said he had been insulted and robbed of his parcel. He is a very quiet mild boy - my being near, I supposed, gave him courage to pursue them; I probably should not have given them in charge but the officer said I ought to do so for the sake of justice.</p>

            . I am a smith. I was coming through Hyde-park, and saw the two prisoners and another, go up to this boy - they both struck him and knocked him down; I saw his father and a gentleman a few yards from him - they grabbed their hands into the basket, and took the bundle out, and ran away; he got up, went after them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080012"></xptr>and got the bundle from them - then went and told his father, who ran and caught Brown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were too far off to hear what passed? A. Yes; I did not run after them - there was no quarrelling between the boys.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty in the Park, and found the father holding Brown - Dunbeven and others were standing by, and from what Shusler said I laid hold of Dunbeven, and considered it my duty to take them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not the father's wish not to prosecute them? A. He wished to take them to the park-keeper - I did not persuade him not to do so - some gentleman said if he did justice he would give them in charge, and that I was ready to take them.</p>
               <p>BROWN'S Defence. I was going to bathe with two boys - this little boy was picking up the mushrooms, the other boy said "Give us a mushroom;" and he said he would give him a slap in the face, and then gave him a kick, and offered to fight either of us; he ran to call his father and we were stopped - the officer persuaded him to take us to the office.</p>
               <p>DUNBEVEN made the same defence.</p>
               <p>SHUSLER, JUN. I was not gathering mushrooms, nor did they ask me for any - I did not say I would slap his face.</p>

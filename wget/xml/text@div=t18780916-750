I am a dairyman, of 107, Gloucester Road, Kensington—on 16th August I served the prisoner with some milk—he gave me a good shilling, and I gave him the change—shortly afterwards Vincent, who is employed in the shop, called to me, and I saw James in the shop.

Vincent handed me a florin in James's presence; I put it in the till and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I afterwards found the florin was bad, and looked out and saw James following Jones; they were about three yards apart—I went to Mr. Lord's shop, 12, Gloucester Road, and saw a bad florin in his possession—I marked the florin Vincent gave me and gave it to the inspector; this is it; I bent it.</p>

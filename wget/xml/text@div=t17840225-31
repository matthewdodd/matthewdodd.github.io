               <p>I belong to Mr. Staples's Office; I know this, that the boy came in, and nominates as this, that he had been robbed of his hat; he came in to the Rotation about half after seven this day fortnight at night.</p>
               <p>Did any body come in with him? - There was a lusty gentleman came in with him, and had hold of the prisoner Burn; says he, I am not a going to let you go, do not you think it; the boy went up and had a hearing, and when he came down, I spoke to one of the runners, says I, Charles, I know Bandy, that is Johnson.</p>
               <p>How came you to know any thing of him? - Because he nominated in this, that Johnson was one of them.</p>
               <p>What account did the prosecutor give of this? - He never said a word to me.</p>
               <p>Then how did you know what the charge was? - By the hearing it read in the Rotation.</p>
               <p>Who did you hear it from? - From Butler, in the outer box; I never went night him, he never said any thing at all to me.</p>
               <p>Why are you so afraid that he should be supposed to have said any thing to you, when you was not asked it? - The meaning was as this, this Burn says, says he, I shall be admitted an evidence, says he, it is a boy in a black coat.</p>
               <p>What account did the boy Butler give of the robbery when he first came in? - Only what I heard in the box, I heard him say as this here, that it was Burne, Tozo, and Johnson; and that Burne was the person that took and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he give an account what they did to him? - I did not see the affair.</p>
               <p>I am not asking you that, you know I am not; I am asking you whether Butler gave an account of what they had done to him? - No further than nominating that it was them three that stopped him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him how he was to conduct this prosecution? - I never mentioned a word to him.</p>
               <p>Who pays the expence of this prosecution? - Not me.</p>
               <p>Do not you know who does? - We agreed to pay it between us, me, and Mathews, and Dorman.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250093"></xptr>How much are you to receive, if, upon your evidence, these three boys are convicted? - I do not suppose I have paid above three shillings in all.</p>
               <p>Sir, do you mean that as an answer to my question; are you deaf? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how dare you answer in that manner; I ask you, what are you to receive, if, upon your evidence, these three boys are convicted? - I do not desire one farthing, I do not know how much I am entitled to.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I work at my business, I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Have you never taken up any body for a highway robbery, or a footpad robbery? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>And do not you know what you are entitled to upon the conviction of the prisoners? - Indeed, rightly, I do not.</p>
               <p>Rightly! Sir; upon your oath do not you know? - I have heard it is forty pounds, but not that I want it.</p>
               <p>Then three forties is one hundred and twenty pounds, if these three boys are convicted.</p>

               <p>You was not? - No, I was not; Burne said there were Johnson, and he, and Tozo, in company together in Lemon-street; that they stopped the boy with a candlestick, and said, you bloody dog, your life or your money.</p>

               <p>And how much are you to receive if these boys are convicted? - I do not do it for that, I am bound.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, Sir, did not you carry the indictment to him with the money? - He said two shillings, says I to the boy have you two shillings, he said, no, he had not got a farthing; then Mr. Johnson said, you pay it, and it will be returned to you again.</p>

               <p>I belong to Mr. Staples's Office, when the little boy came in, I did not take much notice of him, seeing a lusty man had hold of his arm, and he desired me to take charge of the middle prisoner, because he could not stay.</p>
               <p>What did the prosecutor say in your hearing? - I cannot recollect; we go through a little place that is dark, and I thought I heard him say here is something dropped, or a candlestick dropped; I had then the boy in charge, it was this candlestick, he gave it to a man that draws beer at our house, and he gave it to me; I did not see it picked up.</p>
               <p>What did Butler accuse the boys of? - Of robbing him, he said they had stopped him, and put the candlestick up to his head, and said your life or your money; then he told me that two of them ran under a gateway, and one ran over the way, and he said he thought it was best to pursue where there where two, and then he should have the chance of catching one.</p>
               <p>Where was Platt then, was he by? - He might be in the tap-room for what I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250094"></xptr>Did the boy tell you the names of the boys that had stopped him? - Not to my knowledge he never told me, I knew it from Burne; after Burne was committed for further examination, he begged me to go up to the justice and get him admitted an evidence; Mr. Staples said, he did not think he could do it, because the prosecutor swore so positively to him; after he had had a hearing he told me their names.</p>
               <p>Where is this lusty gentleman? - He went away directly.</p>
               <p>Where does Burne live? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where does Johnson live? - I do not know, I heard that Tozo was to be found in a public house in Salt-petre Bank, I went there at night to look for him, but I did not find him, I do not know where any of them live.</p>
               <p>Who advised the boy to prosecute them? - I do not know that any body advised him, I have not.</p>
               <p>Who paid for this prosecution? - I do not know, I have not paid any thing, nor I shall pay nothing at all to any body.</p>
               <p>Have you agreed to pay any part of the expence? - No.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true that Matthews, and Platt, and you, agreed to pay the expence between you? - I never told them I would pay any thing, when the bill was preferred I was not there.</p>

               <p>I was running along very fast, with that candlestick from my aunt's to my mother's, and some man stopped me, I do not know him from Adam, he carried me to a Justice, I know the prosecutor, I have played with him many times, and know his father and mother to be very poor, and I know he does this for the money; his father and mother were obliged to pawn their things to find the indictment, these runners told him he would have the money for us, and they would maintain him; I know nothing of these other two boys; my mother keeps a chandler's shop in Bell-yard, Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>Court. Who brought this indictment to Mr. Johnson? - Matthews, he paid me for the indictment.</p>
               <p>Matthews. I paid Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>Bowen. I am very clear from my memory that this man absolutely paid me the money, and seemed very eager to have the indictment, and there was not a syllable mentioned by Mr. Johnson, I am well convinced, of its being allowed him again, not a jota at the time.</p>
               <p>Matthews. I will prove my innocence in this; the instructions were brought I believe by Mr. Platt to Mr. Staples's office, and were given to Mr. Johnson to draw up the bill of indictment, when I went in, I asked if it was ready, and he went, and struck the thing that they cut it with, says I, I will give you a bit of lead: Mr. Johnson received the money, and asked the boy for the money, and the boy said, I have none.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowen. Is that true? - I never heard any such conversation save as to the lad.</p>

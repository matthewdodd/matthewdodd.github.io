                  </hi>. I have a distillery in Sun-street, Bishops<lb></lb>gate. On the morning of the 9th of September, when I went to the distillery, the tiles had been removed from the western gutter, and an ascending I found a great portion of the leaden gutter had been removed—it has taken about 4cwt. to repair the mischief done—I have seen the lead now produced, and compared it with the lead which remains in the gutter—it corresponds with it exactly—I know this to be the lead I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Chuck and Co., of Norton Falgate, lead-merchants. On Monday morning, the 9th of September, about ten o'clock, the prisoner Branch came to our warehouse with another man, who brought a piece of lead in a basket—I opened it, and asked who it belonged to-Branch said it did not belong to him, but to the other</p>

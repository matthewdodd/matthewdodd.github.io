I am the prisoner's wife—on the night of 19th November we went to sleep at my daughter's house—about a quarter to seven in the morning he got up—we were on very good terms indeed—he asked me if I was awake, I said, "Yes"—he said, "Shall I get up and light the fire, as I know you would like to have a cup of tea before you go away?"—he directly put his knees over me into my stomach, and got his knuckles between my nightdress and throat, and garrotted me—I could not speak or move—I did not see anything in his hand, but I felt the knife go in at the side of my neck—as soon as I felt the knife I gave him a sudden push, and got him off me—I then gave a bit of a scream, and said, "Oh! <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>, you have cut my throat"—I got out of bed as well as I could, the blood streaming down upon me, and jumped on to my son's bed—my husband got out of bed, and began dressing himself, and he said, "I have not done it to my liking now; I am only sorry to think that I laid too long; I am only sorry I have not cut your b—head off"—I was so exhausted I don't know what followed—while he was doing this I put my hand up, and he cut my finger and my ear—my finger was bad for a fortnight—this is a shoemaker's knife, which he bought of my son for a penny—we had had no quarrel that night; he was on as good terms as he had ever been in his life, in fact better than we had been for many years past—we have been married twenty-seven years, and I have borne him a large family.</p>

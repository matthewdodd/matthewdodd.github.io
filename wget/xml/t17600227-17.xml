               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Wills. I was a little in liquor. Our conversation was immodest, and we went into the house of

               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Wills. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed together?</p>
               <p>Wills. No, upon a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your watch about you at that time?</p>
               <p>Wills. I had. I looked at it when it was past ten o'clock. I neither stop'd nor staid, nor spoke to any body till I met with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any liquor at this house?</p>
               <p>Wills. Only a pint of beer. She came out at the door along with me, where we parted. It could not be a minute before I missed my watch, and I returned directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again?</p>
               <p>Wills. I took the prisoner up on the Thursday following; the watch was found, and is now in the officer's hands. I carried her before justice Bury, but she denied it; the justice committed her, and advised me to take a warrant against Mrs. More, whose house we were in. I did, and soon found where my watch was, by one Mrs. Kenady. The watch was pawn'd to one Mr. Ellise, a pawnbroker, and the officer went there and brought it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Wills. His name is Readbourn.</p>
               <p>Readbourn. (He produces the watch.) This has been in my custody ever since the prisoner was taken up.</p>

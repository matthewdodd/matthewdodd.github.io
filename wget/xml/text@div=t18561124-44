                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Brown, a draper, in Whitechapel. On Monday night, 10th Nov., Cannell, and two other women came into the shop, and they asked for, cloth for a mantle—I showed them some grey, and some black—Cannell said she should like a darker grey, because her brother-in-law was dead; and after showing a great many pieces she had a yard and a half cut off, and took me to the other side of the shop to look at some buttons—she detained me there; and while I was there the other two women went to the other side, and returned again—when I had finished, the Other two women had gone out, and Cannell paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off the parcel, and she left, saying she would call for the parcel at 10 o'clock the next morning—she did not call the next morning—the other two women had left the shop two or three minutes before Cannell—they had come in together—about an hour after Cannell left, I missed about twenty yards of black cloth—not a piece which I had been showing them, but it was on the counter at the same time—at tea time on Tuesday, the following day, a piece of grey cloth was missed—I believe this cloth produced is my master's—I believe these different pieces to be the whole of the piece of black, and this to be the grey—there is no piece here so small as to be the piece I sold—these are worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I live at No. 2 1/2, Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel, where Mrs. Cannell lives, and keeps a beer shop; she takes in lodgers. On Monday night, 10th Nov., I was in Thrawl-street, Spital-fields, about 8 o'clock—I had nothing with me—I had been to Mr. Clarke, in Thrawl-street, to tell Mr. Cannell that he was wanted—I went there again in twenty minutes, or half an hour afterwards—I had a bundle with me the second time—I do not know what was in it—Mrs. Cannell gave it to me to take to Mr. Clarke, in Thrawl-street; as I was going along the policeman stopped me—I went back to Mrs. Cannel's with a policeman—Mrs. Cannell was at home when I got back, and the two boys, Lott and Aspen, were at home, upstairs—they were lodgers there, and slept in the first floor back room—they slept in the same room—I do not know whether they slept in the same bed—when I got back one policeman was in the house, and one went back with me—the policeman asked Mrs. Cannell if she had sent the bundle out; she said, "No," at first—I told her she gave me the bundle to take to Mr. Clarke, in Thrawl-street, and she said, Yes, she did—she said that two young women brought it, and she gave me the bundle to take out—the policeman took me up stairs—we all went up stairs together—the policeman went into the room where the two boys were—I was not in the room when any cloth was found—I was in the room when the policeman said he had found two pieces of cloth—he brought the two pieces out of the front room into the back room where we all were.</p>

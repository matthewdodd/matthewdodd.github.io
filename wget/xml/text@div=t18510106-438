                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. Boulter, a butcher, of Brixton. On the night of 20th Dec., at a quarter or twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I was standing at a shop-window in Newington Causeway, and found myself closely pressed against the shop-window by three men, so that I could not make my way through them; the prisoner is one of them, I am sure—he was as close to me as he possibly could be—I should not know the other two—I asked them to allow me to pass—I missed the weight of my purse from my pocket; they let me pass, and the prisoner ran off—I felt my pocket and missed my purse, which I had had three minutes before—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I followed the prisoner, and saw him caught; I did not lose sight of him—he was taken to the station, and while there, Ball brought my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Devonshire-street, St. Saviour's. On the night of 20th Dec., I saw Burton at a shop-window in Newington Causeway, and three men, the prisoner was one of them, they were pushing against her—she spoke to them, but I could not distinguish what the words were—I was not at the window—the prisoner unfastened her cloak, and took something out of her pocket—he and the others ran away as fast as they could—I am sure he is the person, I did not lose sight of him; I saw him caught.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-street, Edgeware-road, and am a linen-draper. On the afternoon of the 15th of April, Mr. Simpson, who lives oppo<lb></lb>site, pointed out the prisoner Green going down the street—I went and brought her back, charged her with taking some calico—she said she knew nothing about any calico—I told my young man to take care she did not run away—I went round different streets to look for another woman—I met Turner with another woman, followed them some distance, at last went up to Turner, took hold of her cloak, and said, "You have been to my shop," and I saw my calico under her cloak under her arm—I brought her back, and gave her in charge—she said, "Let me go, my child is dead, and I want to bury it"—she slipped from me and ran across the road, leaving her cloak and shawl in my hand—I caught her again—I took her full three quarters of a mile from my shop—the other woman ran away.</p>

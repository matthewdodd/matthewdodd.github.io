               <p>JOHN VENNING. The prisoner was a mate of mine, on board a vessel. On the 24th of April I went to his lodging, James-street, New-Cut, to go to receive our money, we went to the Bull, public-house, Leadenhall-street, about one o'clock; where I received 3l. 5s. I shewed it to him, and put it into my right hand waistcoat pocket - we went to a variety of places - he said he had no money, and I must stand treat - and, in the Minories, I lent him 2s. 6d.; and about three o'clock, he told me to say nothing about it. We then went to the <placeName id="t18270531-169-crimeloc888">Flying-horse, public-house, Wilson-street</placeName>

My money was all right there - I had two sovereigns and a half; I laid down and went to sleep for half an hour - and he came hustling me about, and lifting me up - I was then on the floor - I was not drunk, but fresh; my money was then gone - this was about four o'clock. I accused him of it, he denied it - he was searched, and one sovereign, and 17s. 6d. found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you dined? A. Yes; in the Minories. I dropped some money which he picked up, and gave the landlady for me - nobody else was in the room - he told me he was quite stumped - and had not a halfpenny.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was fetched - the prisoner was rather intoxicated. I found a sovereign, 17s. 6d. and 101/2d. on him. The prosecutor said if he would give him 1l. it should be made up. I do not know whether I asked him if he had any money about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he had given 1l. out of 1l. 17s. 6d. he would have let him go? A. That was mentioned.</p>

            . I keep the Flying-horse, public-house- these men came in about half-past three o'clock, both nearly drunk; the prisoner was the most sober - the prosecutor laid on the floor and was very drunk - Clarks picked him up two or three times, and picked up 2s. 6d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310080"></xptr>and gave me to keep for him - he got better, and missed his money; we sent for an officer. Clarke had changed a sovereign at the bar about four o'clock - the prosecutor was asleep then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not what he calls "hustling," picking him up? A. Yes; there was nothing to prevent the prisoner going out - he offered to let him go if he would give up 1l.; the prisoner refused.</p>

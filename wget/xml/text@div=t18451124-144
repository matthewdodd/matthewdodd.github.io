                  </hi>. I am a farmer and cow-keeper. I live at Turnham-green—the prisoner was in my service eight or ten years as a thresher—on the 24th of Nov., in consequence of suspicion, I watched him, and saw him locking a barn-door—he was leaving work—I went up to him—he dropped the key—I looked for it and went in—I observed his coat lying near the barndoor with a bulk about it—I then went to the road-side and waited at the gate—the prisoner came up to the gate with his coat hanging upon his arm—I called him, and challenged him with having wheat of mine in his possession—he denied it more than once—I asked to see his coat—he made some objection—I took hold of the coat, and found the wheat in a bag wrapped up in the coat—I should say there was about half a peck—he said it was given to him by a person who came up the road—I compared it with the wheat in my barn, and I could not tell any difference in it—it appeared to be of the same sort—swear that the two correspond exactly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness—my husband is a carman on the Great Northern Railway—we have six children—Thomas was born in October, 1858, in Flood's house, where we were then lodging—up to 1875 he always slept there and had his meals with us—in 1871 I was introduced to James Pitchford by Mrs. Bogus, he was her brother, and a navvie—I recollect his marrying Eliza Jefferson—I was at the house when they returned from church with Mrs. Rowell—I have seen Pitchford to-day—I first heard of my son's marriage to the prisoner about eleven or twelve weeks afterwards, some time in August, Mrs. Christy told me of it first—I afterwards went with my husband to Flood's house, and my husband asked him how he could be so false as to get the boy married unknown to us—I cannot tell what answer he made there was such excitement—Mrs. Pitch<lb></lb>ford came downstairs and said they were married, we might do our worst, could not undo it—my husband told the boy to get his things, and we look him home—the prisoner said she believed her first husband to be dead did she had letters to prove it, that was after the marriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When she and Pitchford were married they lived about en minutes' walk from us—I believe they used to quarrel, I only heard hem quarrel once, that was not long after their marriage—my son knew ford years back by sight—I don't think I ever saw him at Flood's—I used frequently to see him after his marriage, I can't say up to what time—I remember his selling up their home a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> months after they were Married—after that they came together again for about six weeks, after the any was born, that is four years ago last November—then they parted main—I did not see him after that till very lately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Mrs. Pichford took the things away the second time, while was gone to his work, and he never came back to her—I don't know hether they were things that she and her mother had bought.</p>

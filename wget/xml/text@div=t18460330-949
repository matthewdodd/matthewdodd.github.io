                  </hi>. I am carman to John Hemmins, a corn-merchant, in Elizabeth-street, Pimlico. On the 17th of March I went to Burton-street to my tea at ten minutes past seven o'clock—I might have been at tea nearly an hour—when I returned I fed my master's horses—I saw the coach-house door had been opened—I had left it locked—I did not take any notice of that—it then drew near nine o'clock, and I took a light to go to nail up a board to prevent the ducks getting out in the morning—I found the ducks in their usual place in the coach-house, dead—I had seen them alive when they went to roost at their usual time, about half-past six, before I went to tea—when I went at nine with the light they did not make a noise—I went to look and found two men lying on the ducks, and the ducks were dead—I said,. "Now then, get up, what do you do lying here? I won't have you here"—I held the light over them for a minute or two, but they did not make any move—I had suspicion—I came out, looked the door, aud locked them in—I went to the top of the mews to see for a policeman—in the mean time I heard the men rush against the door—they broke the lock, but could not force the door sufficiently to get out—one of them escaped through a hole cut in the door to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the office of the Submarine Telegraph Company, in Threadneedle-street, and live in Chatham-place, Locks'-fields—about half-past 9 on the night of 21st December, I had three, cases of turkeys in the room of the telegraph office—I left them for a few minutes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070013"></xptr>
               <p>to get' a cab—when I came back I found one of the cases open—I put my hand in the case; I was told it was open—I found something deficient—I ran into the back room where I found the prisoner with a parcel under his arm, which I believed to be the turkey, rolled up in paper and tied up—I said, "How dare you to open the case?"—he said he had not touched it—he went into the back room, which we term the wheel room, and laid down the parcel that he had under his arm—I begged of him to give me up the turkeys, and told him I would give him in charge if he did not—he said he had not touched them, but he went and laid the parcel down on the shelf while I was speaking to him—one other turkey was afterwards produced—two turkeys were produced before the magistrate—they had been in the cases—there were no other turkeys there—each of the turkeys found was tied up in a duster—these dusters belong to the prisoner—I know that because they were dusters used in the office, and he was employed as a cleaner there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do not all the porters and the boys in the building use the same sort of dusters as these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge; I do not use them—I have never seen any of the boys use them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the messengers at the Telegraph office—I remember last witness going out and coming in and finding a case had been opened—I saw the prisoner there while he was away, with a hammer in his hand lifting up the lid of the box—I spoke to him—I did not know whose case it was—I did not see him take anything out—I supposed the box to belong to the Company, and that he was doing something with it in his employment there—it was a hammer he used to use.</p>

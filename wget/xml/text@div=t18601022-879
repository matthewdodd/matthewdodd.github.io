                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Cumberland-street, Roman-road, Bamsbury—I was in Newgate-street on 2d October, about half-past 10 o'clock at night with a friend—the prisoners spoke to us first and we all, four went into a public-house and had some gin—I was sober when I left—I had a watch in my fob—we all four went into Ivy-lane—I was with Anderson and my friend walked with Brown—I felt something against my trousers—I thought it was Anderson's hand, and I instantly missed my watch—I said to my friend, "I have missed my watch and Brown has got it"—I said that because I saw Anderson hand something to Brown, which I supposed to be the watch—I told my friend to catch hold of her, and I called a policeman—we kept the two women till the policeman came—Be took them; he showed me my watch, this is it—when I got it the ring was off; it appeared to have been twisted off the guard by force.</p>

About a quarter before 11 o'clock that night, I was in Paternoster-row—I heard a noise in Ivy-lane, I went towards it, and saw the prosecutor struggling with Anderson; he told me she had stolen his watch—I said, "Is there another woman?"—he said, "Yes," and pointed the way she was gone—I told him to hold Anderson, and I ran after Brown—I stopped her as she was at the corner going into Paternoster-row—I asked her what she had done with the watch—she said she knew nothing about it—about that time the prosecutor and Anderson came up, and I saw Anderson reach out her hand under Brown's shawl—Brown reached her hand towards Anderson's—I caught Brown's hand and the watch was in it—she struggled very violently but I took it out of her I hand—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Canal-bridge, Old Kent-road, and am a cheesemonger; the prisoner was my shopman from the 21st of June, and continued so about five weeks. On Monday, the 28th of July, I desired twelve shillings and six half-crowns to be marked in my presence, which was done—they were put into the till between three and four o'clock that afternoon—I went to the till about ten that night, and took all the money out—I do not know what the total amount in the till was—there were six half-crowns there then, but two of them were not marked—two of the marked half-crowns were gone, and there were but three marked shillings left—I did not speak to the prisoner about it till the Wednesday, when I called a policeman in, and accused the prisoner of robbing me—he denied it, and was searched—he had a box at my house, which was locked—it was unlocked in my presence—in it were found ten sovereigns, and, I think,</p>

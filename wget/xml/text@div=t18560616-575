                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Edmonds and Remnant, bookbinders, Lovell's-court, Paternoster-row. The prisoner was in our service about eight or nine years, about seven years as porter, and the last two years as carman—we have stables in the Oxford Arms-passage, Warwick-lace—in consequence of some communication from Mr. Ford, I went to the loft over those stables about 2 o'clock on the 9th May—the prisoner was not there—I there found eleven books in a rabbit hutch—I have the list of them here, they were valuable books—among them were two volumes of "Knapp's Chemistry," bound by us for Mr. Bailliere, of Regent-street—that is rather an expensive book—the value of the whole eleven books I should imagine to be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the cost of the binding would only be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—nine of them were bound by us—all the books bound by us ought to have been delivered to the respective publishers—it was the prisoner's duty to have done so—after finding the books I got the assistance of a policeman—I went with him into Mr. Ford's house, opposite the stable—after remaining there some time the prisoner came to the stable, and I saw him come out again with two books in his hand—this was about 3 o'clock—the policeman followed him, and took him into custody in my presence—the books he had in his hand were these two volumes of "Knapp's Chemistry," which I had seen previously in the loft—another book, "The Words of Jesus," was taken from his pocket—that was published in 1855—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185606160024"></xptr>
               <p>I do not know when that was bound—the prisoner lives in Gray's Inn-road—I went with the policeman to his lodging, and saw about 100 volumes there, worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I could not say how many of those volumes were bound by us, I should think about half; some of them recently—it would have been the prisoner's duty to deliver the books bound by us, to the respec<lb></lb>tive publishers—I cannot state how he might have got the others which were not bound by us.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> None of these books are yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we bind them for the publishers, and send them to the publishers—it was the prisoners duty to take them to the publishers as soon as they were bound; that is, assuming they were delivered to him to take—because these were bound by us, I assume that they were delivered to him, and that he did not deliver them to the publishers—the course of business is for the publishers to deliver to us so many books, and we bind and return them—we have to return the same number that we receive—I cannot give you any idea how many of these we had to bind, because they are constantly coming—we bind all this set—we bind them in fifties, and have done so over a series of years—we had no property in the hundred volumes found at the prisoner's lodging—they may have been his own for aught I know; the policeman said it was necessary to take them, and he did so—I do not see anything in these books to show they had not been returned to the publishers—if I had found them in the publishers' shop instead of the loft, of course I should have thought they had been returned—it is possible that the prisoner might have purchased them, but not very probable, I think—there is no mark by which I know them—I do not know that the prisoner was very fond of reading, and that he was a teacher in a Sunday school; I know nothing of the man, except that he has been nine years in my service, and acquitted himself properly during that time—I do not think it could be ascertained by inquiry among the publishers and comparing the delivery invoices with the number received, whether any number had fallen short—I tried it in one or two instances, and could not find it out, and it would have taken me a very considerable time to have arrived at it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

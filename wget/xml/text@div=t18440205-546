                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Waller, of Goswell-street. On the 13th of Jan. the prisoner offered this hay-cloth in pledge, with the name of "Hill, farmer," stamped on it—we questioned him particularly—he said he was in the employ of Mr. Hill, he had been to market with a load of hay, that he met with an accident, broke his cart, and could not get home without pledging this to defray the expenses to repair it—he brought a second person to con<lb></lb>firm his statement, and we advanced him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—while standing at the door on the following Thursday the name of Hill on a cart struck me—I stopped Mr. Hill, and he claimed the cloth—next morning the prisoner passed the door, and I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I stopped and asked if the owner had been to own the cloth—I pawned it for safety.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Pritoner's Defence.</hi> I found it in the road coming from Barnet on the Thursday; my shoulder was put out, I could not carry it, and sent it on to Islington-gate by Wilson's omnibus, for the owner to have it if he came for it; I left it there till Saturday; I met a man, who was a stranger to me; he said if he was me he would pawn it, and said I must tell them I had met with an accident with the cart, or they would not take it in.</p>

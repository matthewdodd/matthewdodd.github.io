                  </hi>. I am one of the sorters in the General Post-office, On 7th May, I was in the Foreign Department on the first floor; there is an office higher up in which newspapers are sorted, and there is a shoot which communicates from that office to the one in which I am employed—in con<lb></lb>sequence of instructions I had received, I paid particular attention to that shoot on the day in question—I noticed three newspapers come down—I took possession of them, and put my initials on them; one was a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—they were in the state they are now, with the addresses appa<lb></lb>rently torn off—I handed them to Mr. Clare, the inspector—I know the prisoner—he was employed in the upper room—I cannot positively say whether I had seen him that day—these newspapers had no business in our office.</p>

               <p>Post-office. On 7th May, the prisoner was employed in the newspaper office, the upper office; he was a newspaper sorter and letter carrier—it was his duty to sort newspapers that were intended to go by that night's mail; this occurred about 35 minutes past 5 o'clock—these three newspapers were given into my possession by Smith, they had no addresses upon them, one is a newspaper called <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's,</hi> of 4th May; one is the <hi rend="italic">Bath Express,</hi> of 3rd May; and the third is the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> of 3rd May—I sent for the prisoner into a private room, and asked him if he had thrown any newspapers down the foreign shoot—he said he had not—I asked him again if he was sure, and he said, "Yes"—I then said I had reason to believe that he had, and I showed him this copy of the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> and asked him if he had seen that paper before—he looked at it and said he had not—I said I had reason to believe that he had sent these papers down the foreign shoot, that I should call in a constable, and must give him in charge, and have him searched—he became very much alarmed, and said, "I did tear the papers"—I asked him what could induce him to have done such a thing—he said he could not tell, more than he was afraid of missending them, and that he had lately missent a large number of newspapers, for which he had been heavily fined—Peak, the officer, then came in, I desired him to search the prisoner—he did so in my presence, and took from his pockets these covers, and pieces of other newspapers—some of the addresses on these papers are plainly writ<lb></lb>ten—I have compared the pieces with the three newspapers in question, and they fit—here is one, "Mrs. Rugeley, St. James's-house school, Isle of Wight;" another is, "Mrs. Alexander, Axford, near Marlborough, Wilts;" the third address is quite illegible, it is so bad that we cannot read it; there appears to have been a postage stamp on it—by throwing the papers down the shoot, the prisoner would get them out of his way, and prevent their being forwarded by the poet, otherwise they would have gone by that night's mail—it was his duty to have sent them to the road at which he was—what we call a road is a frame of boxes at which the papers are sorted—he had the Blandford-road—the paper addressed "Isle of Wight," would come into that road—if the others had come into his possession he should have put them on one side for the messenger to take to the general sorters to be re-sorted—it was quite out of course to throw them down the foreign shoot.</p>

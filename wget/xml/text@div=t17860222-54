On Sunday last my wife and me went to take a walk after dinner; we went out between two and three, my wife came home first, I did not return till she sent for me, it was about seven, and when I came home, I found her in great confusion, the house was robbed, and the girl gone away; I enquired where she came from, and I heard she came from Liverpool; I accordingly enquired at the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, and describing her, I heard she was gone off by the Chester coach, which went off that evening about seven; they said I might overtake her at Mims; I took postchaise with Mr. Lowe, and at St. Alban's we overtook the coach, and on the roof of the coach we found the prisoner; I then desired her to come down; she had told the coachman she had a bundle, and she acknowledged that to be her's; we then went into the Bull, and when we came in, Mr. Lowe said, you have some of your master's property about you; she made no reply, but put her hands into her pocket s, and took out these things, of which this is an account; I kept the things separate till I returned, and I took the account of them myself; they were tied up first in the purses, and these two boxes, containing the things in the indictment; I cannot swear to the money, but there is a three-and-fourpence-halfpenny piece which I know, and here is a remarkable mourning ring written within-side, that I have no doubt of being my wife's, I have the fellow of it at home; there is another ring likewise, which has my name in it, J. S. In general, the things in the indictment were all found upon her, except a guinea which she paid to the coach.</p>
               <p>What did she say for herself? - She said nothing for herself; on coming home, I asked her if any body was concerned with her, and if she would let me know who was concerned with her, I would be easy with her, and she said no; when she came back, I brought her back in the chaise, she took out her own things, and left the remainder, which Mrs. Shetley will speak to. This is the bundle which was taken from her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am a tailor, at 36, Warwick Lane, Deptford—on the night of 27th November I was on Tower Hill, the worse for drink—the prisoner came up and asked me to treat her with something to drink—she said that in English, and I understood it—I said "No"—she told me to come with her, and she looked at a ring that I had on my finger—she took the ring off my finger, and also a scarf from my neck—she ran away then—I ran after her, but I could not catch her—I called "Police!" and the police caught hold of her—I did not lose sight of her—I gave her in charge—this is my scarf and ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On the night of 26th November I was on duty in Royal Mint Street—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor together—all at once I heard a cry of "Police!"—I ran to the top of Tower Hill, and saw the prosecutor having hold of the prisoner—I got within one or two yards of them, and the prisoner got away—I ran after her, and brought her back to the prosecutor—I asked her if she had anything, and she said "No"—I asked the prosecutor what he had lost—he said a gold ring off his finger and a scarf off his neck—he understood what I said—I found the ring in the prisoner's left hand, and while I was taking it out of her hand she threw the scarf down on the ground—she took it out of her pocket. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not run away, neither did I have the scarf in ray pocket.</p>

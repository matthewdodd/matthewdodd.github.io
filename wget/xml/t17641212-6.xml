            . I had been to the prosecutor's to bespeak goods; the prisoner followed me, and said he had some spoons of his own, and wanted me to buy them. I ordered him to come about 8 at night with them, and when he left me, I went back and told his master of it, and he came by appointment to Mr. Myer's, my master, and when the prisoner and I had bargained, I went over to my Master's, pretending to fetch the money, and brought the prosecutor to him; he sold them to me as his own property.</p>

               <p>Q.Should you know either of them again? - A. Yes, the man with the dark hair (Jackson) is the man that took the Bank-notes from me, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean by that, that you certainly believe him to be the man? - A. Yes; the other man I rather suspect to be the person, but I cannot say, there were three five pound notes, eight two pound notes, and I think seven ones; I have the half-guinea that he offered me, it is a counterfiet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the shop altogether? - A. About ten minutes.</p>

I took the deceased to the hospital and was present when Mr. Bushby took his deposition at the hospital—the prisoner had the opportunity of cross-examining him. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Henry Yates was here read</hi>:—" I met the prisoner in a public-house and he asked me to go to the theatre with him, and I said 'Very well, I will go to the Britannia with you. We went there and sat down for some time, and Fred Andrews went and fetched some beer and bread and meat, and we used prisoner's knife to eat the bread and meat with. I did not use the knife. Lee and Andrews, who were with us, went down, and the prisoner and I stopped up there, and after a time the prisoner Kelly and I went down into the bar and had some beer. We went up again, and on the stairs we met Andrews, and he bid us good nigh. I stood on some steps looking at the performance, and he (prisoner) stood below and kept on saying, 'Why don't you come down here?. I said, 'I am all right here; I 'll come down in a minute. In a little time I went down, and he said, "You are a pretty sort of fellow to stop up there I said, "You need not be so fast. I hardly know what passed, not two or three words, and he said, 'I shall stick a chiv into you,' and I said 'If you did I should hit you.' and I knew no more than that I get it in my leg, and I know no more than that I was carried downstairs. He stuck the knife into my leg twice. It is the knife that is now shown me. They took me to the police-station and then to the hospital here. I did not hit him before he hit me. I had had a drop, but I knew what I was doing till I was struck. He had been drinking a great deal in the afternoon. I gave him no reason that I know of for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. It is not true that when I get a drop of drink I say to him I 'll punch you.' and I have not done so. I may have been surly when he asked me to come down off the steps, but I did not hit him in the nose or in the neck. I did not give him the least provocation that I know of. I have often been told by him that he does not want my company. I did not strike him in the nose and neck. He was not using the knife to eat the bread and meat; that had all been eaten half an hour before.</p>

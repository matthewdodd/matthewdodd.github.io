                  </hi>. I am in partnership with James Cobbett, a floor-cloth and carpet-manufacturer at Greenwich. On the 20th of No<lb></lb>vember I was returning in my cart from Blackheath, and within three or four doors from my house, I saw a boy with this carpet on his shoulders—I suspected it was wrong from the pattern being reversed—in coming to my shop a boy touched his hat, and asked if I wanted an errand-boy—, but I would not be diverted from the carpet—I saw the boy who had it, give it to the prisoner about twenty yards off—I called to a person to take care of my horse and cart, and when I went round the way they went, I could see neither the carpet nor the prisoner, nor the boys—but in a to<lb></lb>bacconist's shop I saw the prisoner—I wished to secure the boys—I saw them running towards Greenwich,—I thought I should lose the prisoner—I came back and he was gone from the shop—a witness came up and gave me information—this is the carpet—the prisoner had put it down it a tailor's shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I was looking out of my master's window—I saw a man come up with some carpet and place it at the door—the prisoner answers the description of the man, but I had such a slight glance of him that I cannot swear to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Deptford-bridge. At half-past eleven o'clock, I was opposite the prosecutor's shop, and saw two boys—one first came out with this carpet on his shoulder—the other came out and met the prosecutor—he put his hand to his hat and said, "Do you want a shop-boy?"—I saw the boy that took the carpet give it to the prisoner who was waiting as if for the boys, and then I saw him with it.</p>

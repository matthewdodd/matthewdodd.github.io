                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, in Devonshire-buildings, Great Dover-road—my shop is part of the dwelling-house. On the 20th of February, about ten minutes past nine, o'clock, I went into the parlour behind the shop, and in less than two minutes I heard a smash of glass at the shop window—I immediately ran to the door, and found the handle tied by a cord to the scraper—I had been there ten minutes before, the cord was not there then—I pulled the door violently, strained the cord, and got out—I had seen a person run from the window towards the Borough—when I got out I saw a person running, about a dozen yards off—I pursued him, and never lost sight of him till the policeman</p>

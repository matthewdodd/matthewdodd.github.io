                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury—this is my appointment as arbitrator between the School Board and the defendant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is a counterpart of the other—it is my appointment by Hay ward—this is the declaration I made. (<hi rend="italic">To hear and determine fairly</hi>)—I appointed July 16th for the arbitration, and the parties appeared before me at the Surveyors' Institute, Great George Street—Counsel appeared on both sides—I took notes for the purpose of forming my opinion of the value of the premises and the amount the School Board were to pay Hay ward for the premises—Hay ward was in the room—I heard Counsel state the principal facts which he meant to prove—he claimed 1,062<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the value of the lease; loss by compulsory sale, 1067.4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is 10 percent; trade loss, 1,805<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and for forced sale of effects, 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; total 3,065<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Hay ward was then called and sworn by me; these are my notes of his evidence (<hi rend="italic">The notes were put in and read</hi>)—he was recalled on the 23rd, when I took these notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not put down everything that passed—Hay<lb></lb>ward said that he had an income of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; that he kept a memoran<lb></lb>dum book and ledger—he produced on cross-examination, a ledger, two day books, and some vouchers—he was asked if he kept a banking-account—he said "Not now; I kept one formerly" and that he had had no pass-book since 10th October, 1873—he had the ledger before him, and was asked if the transactions took place on those dates, and he said "Yes"—he was asked if the entries were correct; he said "Yes"—he was next to me and the book was between us, so that I could see—I remember his attention being called to the entry "Topp's Trustees," and he was asked whether he had any dealings with them between 1869 and 1878, and he said that deal<lb></lb>ings took place on those dates—I cannot recollect his particular words, but his general statement was that the accounts as appeared in the ledger were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240147"></xptr>
               <p>correct—he said that tie date 1870, on page 340, bad been altered to 1878—he was further pressed as to whether the payments had been made in that year, and he said that they were—it was suggested to him that there had been an alteration in the date, and he said on the first day that he had not altered it—his attention was called to folio 442, "Hubbard," and the entry 1876—he gave a similar answer that he had not altered the date; he also said that he had not made any alteration in the dates for the purposes of this inquiry—at the request of the School Board I adjourned the arbitration till the 23rd, a week afterwards, when Hayward was again in the box; his attention was again called to Topp's trustees, and he again said that the entries were correct—his attention was then called to the entries in the pass-book, and that under date of June 6th, 1870, there was an entry of "Topp 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and that the pass-book showed a cheque paid on June 6th, and the ledger showed some date or other with an equivalent amount; there had been an alteration—I think he said that it might be the same cheque—he was challenged with another cheque for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 11th July, and gave a similar answer—he said "The dates were altered; I will not swear that I have not altered them"—his attention was called to 749, Damon's case, where 1876 was altered—he said "The date may have been altered; I can-not swear"—he was challenged whether the cheque of July 12th, 1871, was not for the same amount as that appearing in the ledger on July 11th, 1876, and he admitted it—he was taken through each of these entries of six different cheques, and I believe the question was put to him about them all—his attention was called to there being no pages in the ledger from 585 to 600; his reply was that he did not remove them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have acted as arbitrator in many cases—my experience of arranging values has been very great—it is usual in a claim of this kind for a witness to estimate the matter before the claim is sent in, and for an accountant to estimate the loss by forced sale and removal. (<hi rend="italic">The schedule of claim was here put in, which was for</hi> 3,065<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">solicitors' and accoun<lb></lb>tants' charges to be added.</hi>) I think I have known Mr. Kempster before; 1 believe he is a respectable solicitor—following the schedule of claim comes the inability to agree to the amount—Mr. Young acts for the Board in this matter—he would negotiate before the breaking off of the treaty—the first time I saw the parties was July 16th—I believe Mr. Kempster came to the first meeting—I do not know whether he was represented by Mr. Chaplin, who held Mr. Nasmith's brief—I do not think it was a different man on the first occasion to the second—Mr. Nasmith was there on the second occasion, but I think not on the first; there was only one Counsel on the first occasion—I am not quite clear whether the ledger and pass-book were brought into the room by Hayward or by the accountant, Mr. Jackson—it was my duty to sift the claim and the figures—I have very likely often awarded compensation to a man who had no books at all—the value of the evidence is for me, whether oral or written; I use my independent judgment—I can say that page 240, Topp's trustees, was put before me on the second occasion certainly, and I have very little doubt about the first, but I have no note of it—it was clear that there was an alteration—Hayward did not at once say when his attention was called to the 8, that it was an alteration—he said that he could not explain it—he did not say that the act of writ<lb></lb>ing the alteration was not his act—he said that he did not alter, but he said afterwards that he would not swear anything—the banker's pass-book was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240148"></xptr>
               <p>produced at the same time in Damon's case—the alteration is a palpable one, and there are six accounts, I think, which correspond in their six dates to the banker's pass book—the defendant said that he could not account for the alteration, and that he would not swear that each entry under the date of 1870 were not the real entries—Mrs. Hay ward was examined on the first occasion as to the trade profits—Mr. Kennedy, an accountant, was called and swore "I hare had no information personally from Hayward"—Kennedy is Jackson's master, and was, I presume, employed by Hayward—Mr. Vulliamy, the surveyor, was examined as to the claim, which was for 1,168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the lease, and 10 per cent. added—I allowed 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the 10 percent.—the lease was produced, and it having 12 1/2 years to run, it was the basis of the calculation—Mr. Vulliamy valued out the amount, and then said 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the receipts—I did not disagree in that—he deducted ground-rent 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and multiplied it, and brought out 1,062<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is how it was done—I not only had Mr. Vulliamy's reckoning of the supposed value, but the evidence of Hayward himself with regard to the letting, and I took the two together—the profit rental of Mr. Vullamy's calculation was, I think, one of 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the basis of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was this: I took the rental at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, from which I deducted 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Hayward said that some things were put down and some not—Mr. Nasmith withdrew the claim for trade losses after the cross-examination after the second day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi>. This is my award (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this pass-book was produced on the first occasion—I cannot say what Hayward said about it except that no further account was kept—on the second occasion his attention was drawn to the entries of payments to Damon and to Topp, and to the altera<lb></lb>tion of the dates—at the end of the cross-examination on the second day Mr. Nasmith said that he was satisfied the books had been altered—he said "After this I cannot ask you to look at these books, and I withdraw so much of the claim as refers to the trade"—Mr. Young was examined before me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surveyor to the School Board for London—all the claims come to me before they are gone into by the Board, and 1 report on them and advise the committee what to do—when I advise a settlement they adopt it; if I am not satisfied they act on my report or refer it to a Jury or to arbitration—I remember Mr. Hayward's claim coming before me; it was a lump sum of 3,065<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw Mr. Vulliamy (Mr. Hayward's surveyor) about it, after which I put Mr. James, who is in the accountant's office, in communication with Mr. Hayward, and instructed him to examine the books and make out as far as he could a trade account—I ultimately received a report from him, after which I advised that the Board should contest the claim—it was referred to arbitration, and I was present at the meeting at the Surveyors' Institute on 16th July and heard the opening statement of the claimant's Counsel, who claimed 1,805<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the net profit for the three years prior to 1878—Hayward was sworn, and the ledger, day book, memorandum book, and vouchers were produced—the pass-book was eventually produced, and Hayward then said that it had nothing to do with this claim, it was too far back—his attention was drawn on the second occasion to the entries of cheques to Damon and Topp, first in the ledger and then in the pass-book, and he was asked if they were the same transac<lb></lb>tions—he said that he supposed so—his attention was called on the first day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240149"></xptr>
               <p>to the lodger, and he was asked if the books were correct—he said that they were—his attention was called first to the entry "Topp's Trustees," and at tint he said that the date was accurate—he was asked whether he had any dealings with Topp's trustees between 1869 and 1878, and he said that he had had none, but that he had in 1878—with regard to the 1876, I cannot say whether it was as to Topp's trustees or Damon, bat he said that there had been an alteration; he had made an error at the time, and had corrected it at the time—I am speaking of the first hearing—he at first said that it was accurate, but he was under cross-examination for nearly an hour, and at the end he did not speak so positively as at the beginning—he was asked whether he had done business with Damon in 1876; he said "Yes," but I do not remember his being asked whether he had made payments to them—on the second occasion his attention was again called to the page in the ledger with "Topp's Trustees," and he was asked whether he made the alteration himself—I cannot say his exact answer, but he was afterwards pressed if he would swear that he had not altered them, and he said that he would not—the entries in the banker's book were then shown him, and he was asked whether they did not show a payment in respect to the very sums in the ledger—he did not appear inclined to answer at first, but afterwards he said he presumed they referred to the same transactions, and in like manner with regard to Damon—his Counsel said that he was satisfied there were alterations, and abandoned the claim after looking at the book with a magnifying glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. James met Mr. Kennedy, who would give me a statement upon which I should act—that was with regard to the trade claim entirely—Mr. James told me very soon after he had seen the books that he had noticed the alterations, and was going minutely through the books—I presume Mr. Kennedy had handed them to him—that was not before any notice to treat was given; it was before any arbitrator was appointed, and I told Mr. Vulliamy it was a very fishy case, but I could not come to any agreement with him—I did not refer to Mr. Kennedy with reference to the trade claims; it is not the custom—I did not communicate with Hay ward; when they appoint an agent it is not right to communicate with the principal—Mr. Vulliamy was appointed agent on September 19, 1878—I told him that it would have to go to a Jury or arbitration—Mr. Kempster, the solicitor, did not give evidence on the books; it was Mr. Jackson—Mr. Kempster was exonerated at the meeting from all blame because he had acted on instructions, but I do not know who from—the alterations were palpable upon the face of them—Mr. Nasmith said that still there was a trade, but he could not persist in that part of the claim because the books. had been altered—I did not hear Hay ward thereupon say "You need not take my word for anything, the books have been out of my hands; but I will call before you the farmers with whom I have done business"—I recollect Mr. Gardner saying "How do you prove you have a profit income of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year?" and Hayward said "There are lots that I never put into my books at all. I will give you every farmer's address. I don't ask you to take my word, I will give you their addresses," but he did not say that he would call them—the Arbitrator said "I understand the claim for compensa<lb></lb>tion for loss of business is given up."

                  <hi rend="italic">here read parls of Mr. Nasmith's speech from the short-hand writer's transcript, to which the witness assented.</hi>) Mr. Nasmith was there on the first occasion and opened the case,</p>

               <p>and Mr. Chaplin continued it—Mr. Vulliamy, a surveyor of good reputation, valued the claim at 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., hut it was cut down by the Arbitrator to 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including 10 per cent for forced sale—it very frequently happens that claims made on the School Board are cut down in that proportion, hut this was rather a large one—it is the business of the School Board officers to test every fact put before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi>. We settle 90 per cent of the cases after investigation—Mr. Kennedy was called in the first place, but he knew nothing about it, and then his clerk was put into the box—he vouched his clerk Jackson.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi>. I am a cashier in the employ of the School Board—I re<lb></lb>ceived instructions from Mr. Young to examine Hay ward's books—I went to his house and asked him for his books, and saw him and Mr. Jackson; he produced the ledger, day-book, and some vouchers—he did not produce the pass-book to my recollection—he opened the books and proceeded to explain them to me—I said that I could not examine them then, and wanted to take them home—he said "I don't like parting with the books"—I arranged with Jackson that the books should be sent to me, and went home—they were not sent, but I sent for them and got them—I made a note of 15 pages, between page 585 and 600, on which there were altera<lb></lb>tions; those pages were there then, and there were 50 pages altogether upon which dates were altered—I had the books about three weeks—he did not give me the pass-book with the other books—I returned them to Hay ward at Trigon Road; the pages were all there then, but on 23rd July pages 585 to 600 were missing—I have notes of alterations on those pages.</p>

That the false pretences were too remote, inasmuch as the evidence showed that the false pretences alleged were made by the prisoner in the course of his examination as a witness before an Arbitrator appointed to determine between the parties the amount of compensation, and that as such representations could not have the effect of obtaining either money or an award, except after the silting and investigation of an independent mind in the person of the Arbitrator, the prisoner could not he said to be attempting to obtain money thereby. That if after the Arbitrator's investigation any representations were found to be false, they would be dealt with by him in his ultimate award. That all that had been made out was at the most an attempt to affect the mini of the Arbitrator by false representations with the view of increasing the amount of an award which might be set aside or never be proceeded with, and that therefore an attempt to obtain money by false pretences had not been made out, and that an attempt to obtain by false pretences an award, the outcome of which might be money, was too remote to support the al<lb></lb>legation in the first count</hi> (See Reg. v.

These things were taken in August—they were safe when I and the men went to dinner, and gone when I came back—there was a man discharged—on the 3rd of Oct. I passed the prisoner's shop, in Duke street, Smithfield, and saw some of these things in the window—I went with my master and the policeman to the prisoner's house—we went into the shop I point out in the window the articles which I claimed—the prisoner cam in soon after with his wife—his son said they were some of his own making—the prisoner was not there then—he came in afterwards, and slid they were his making—the wife was very angry with me, and threatened to lock me up—the prisoner said it was very proper he should know who my master was; he would make him remember it; if he got off for less than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he might think himself lucky; and he had a good mind to lock me up, he would enter an action against me for perjury—we went out of the shop—we went hack, and I said it would be best to mark these things—the prisoner said no, he would not have his property marked, he would mark it himself" the policeman objected to take the things—he said it was more than he dared to do, unless the prisoner was charged—I went back to the prisoner, and the things were taken by the prisoner—he would not allow the policeman to take them—he said he would take his own property—one of them has been altered—this is it—it is called a body—I had seen it at the prisoner's abort an hour and a half before it was at the Mansion-house, and it was in a on ferent state then—there were two rings on the bottom of the body, which were my work—when I was in the shop I noticed a brass tap—it was not produced with the other things—by direction of the Lord Mayor, a person went an</p>

On the morning of the 6th of May, I got up about ten minutes before six o'clock, and found the bar-door open. I had locked it up myself the night before, about a quarter before two o'clock, when I went to bed, and took the key up with me - I was the last person that was up. I found the tobacco-drawer on the floor, and about three-quarters of a pound of tobacco gone, which was nearly all that was in it. I missed a clock, worth 4l., and twelve two-penny loaves; about one pound of cheese, and some cakes; I also missed about half a gallon of bitters, worth 10s. 6d. out of the cellar, a gallon of gin, two gallons of anniseed cordial, worth 1l. and eleven bottles of cyder, worth 9s. I have seen some of the cakes since in the possession of Bly - I saw them the same day. The tap-room door, which leads into the wash-house, had a hole cut in it, and the bolt pushed back-the wash-house shutter was broken down; the hole appears to be cut with a chissel. I found the cellar door had been entered, and a small axe, which I left laying in the wash-house, was found in the tap-room. I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a millwright; I lodge with Mrs. Timson. I got up about half-past five o'clock in the morning-when I came down, I found the street door fast but the bar-door was open, and the tobacco-drawer on the floor; I gave the alarm, and went down to Westminster to stop the things, if they should be pledged. As I was returning, I met Westcoat. We went to a boat which was about a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Timson's house-it was about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon; it laid on the beach, the tide was making up to it; the two prisoners were there, and abused Westcoat very much. We both went to the boat, but found nothing in it - We afterwards went and searched it with Bly and Gillmore. We saw the prisoners in the act of pushing that same boat off. I went with them to it, and found the cakes in the boat, with some bread and butter; the prisoners were taken, and the officer took a screw-driver from House; I saw him find it on him - I afterwards tried it to the hole that was cut in the door, the marks corresponded in size, and in my judgment, the hole was cut with it. When they were taken House threw his hat off, and I saw a great deal of tobacco fall out of it-there might not be quite half a pound of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN CASTLES. I am a brewer's-servant. On the 6th of May I was going to work; it was light - I had to pass Timson's house in my way. Before I got there, between her house and the water-side, I met three men going as from Mrs. Timson's. When they saw me they stopped, and leaned over the garden pailings. After I had passed them about fifteen yards, they all started off as hard as they could run-the two prisoners are two of them. I knew them very well before that-it was about eighty yards from Mrs. Timson's - They ran towards the wharf; the other man who was with them, had a large bundle under his arm, tied up in an apron, it might have been bottles-his name is Wright. I went further towards Timson's house, and within about twenty yards in the same foot-path that they came along, I saw something spilt for some distance; I also saw the neck of a bottle.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I had a warrant against the two prisoners and a man of the name of Wright, whom I cannot find. I went to the boat about a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the two prisoners just by the boat; the tide was just coming up to it. I secured the prisoners, and as we were going close to the passage of a public-house, the prisoner, House, knocked his hat off himself-in the crown of his hat I found some tobacco covered with a piece of paper to keep it from his head. I found a screw-driver in his jacket pocket. I then searched the boat, and found some cakes and some bread, butter, and cheese. We compared the screw-driver with the marks of the hole in the door - They exactly fitted. There are no marks on the door but what fit the chissel. There are some marks under the hinge which also exactly fit, as if they had attempted to wrench the door off.</p>

               <p>JAMES BLY. I am an officer. The last witness has spoken correctly.</p>

               <p>MRS. TIMSON. I will swear to the cakes, they are my own making - I have two which were left in the house exactly like them-the bread and cheese I believe to be part of the same that I lost; the tobacco seems like the same sort that I sell. Some of them had got in at the cellar-window, which had a great many cobwebs in it.</p>
               <p>JOHN CASTLES. The prisoner, House, had a great many cobwebs on his clothes.</p>

               <p>RADFORD'S Defence. I was with him. We met Castles, and stopped to make water; two men searched the boat; I asked them what they were doing, and House abused them.</p>

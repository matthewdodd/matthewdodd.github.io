                  </hi>. I am a detective officer, of the City of London. I was called to the Bank; and saw the prisoner there—in consequence of a communication that was made to me, I asked the prisoner where he got the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from—he said a man had given it to him in the street—I said, "Where in the street?"—he said, "In Ludgate Hill"—I asked him what he was to have for getting it cashed—he said, "A pound"—I asked him where he was to meet the man again—he said, "In St. Paul's Churchyard"—I asked him to write his own name and address on a piece of paper, which he did, "William Wilcox, 76, Hatton Garden, clerk," that was correct—I was not in uniform, but I had told him that I was an officer—I took him to the station—I there asked him if he had any more notes about him—he said, no, he had no more notes, but he had some loose cash—I told him that he must put it out on the desk—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a handful of gold, and laid it on the desk—I asked where he got it from—he said, the same person that had given him the note to get cashed had given him the gold—I asked what he was going to do with the gold—he hesi<lb></lb>tated, and made no reply—I counted it, and found twenty sovereigns—I then asked him if he had been to Messrs. Coutts that day—he said, "I have, I may as well tell you the whole truth about it; the man that gave me the note to get cashed, gave me a cheque for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I took to Messrs. Coutts, and got cashed for a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 50 sovereigns"—I asked what had become of the remaining part of the gold—he said that he had put his hand into his pocket, and given it to the person that gave him the cheque—I said, "How much did you give him?" he said, "I don't know; I put my hand into my pocket, and gave it to him indiscriminately."</p>

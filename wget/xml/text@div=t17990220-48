             sworn. - I am one of the people belonging to Bow-street: On the 21st of last month the prisoner was brought to Bow-street, I was sent for to the office; I searched him, and found several things upon him that does not at all belong to this business, but in particular I found this key, (producing a small key); upon finding that key, Mr. Addington asked him where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. What Mr. Addington asked, and the answer he made, was taken down in writing, was it not? - A. I do not know; he refused to tell Mr. Addington where he lived; I said to Mr. Addington, I knew where he lived, and I went to a house in Oxford-road where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know the room he lodged in? - A. From the enquiries I made.</p>
               <p>Q. But you must not tell us what that enquiry was? - A. I went into the garret, and found in a box which this key opened, this tooth-pick case, this pistol-bag with bullets, a bullet-mould, and this lancet-case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys Q. This was on the 21st of January? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.This is the key with which you opened the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many thousand bureaus and boxes do you suppose that key would open? - A. I believe it is an uncommon good key of the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. How many thousands of bureaus and boxes would that open? - A. I do not think it a common key at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood the prisoner lodged in that house - how lately did you know him to lodge there last? - A. Before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him to have lodged there within these three months? - A. No, nor I do not know that I ever did see him there, but I have had very good information.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know, that you are not to give evidence here of the information of other people? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that this man is indicted for an offence, for which his life must answer, if he is convicted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been told in this Court, that what you are informed is not to be given in evidence, and you have attended here for thirty years? - A. You have told me so to-night.</p>

               <p>Q.And mean to say, upon your oath, that you never heard in this Court, that what you have been informed is not evidence? - A. I have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that that man lodged in that house of your own knowledge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how dared you to give evidence of such information? - A.How was I to have known it was his room, if I had not had information.</p>

               <p>Q.For what is this man indicted? - A. For a highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a reward upon conviction for a high-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200050"></xptr>robbery, of forty pounds, aye or no? - A. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. And you, knowing there is a reward of forty pounds, offer to give evidence of information? - A. How was I to get up stairs into the room, without telling how I came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard the Judge upon that Bench say, that you are not to give evidence of information? - A. I may have heard so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear then that he lodged there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not know, that if that man is convicted, you are entitled to forty pounds, or a share of forty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that key?(The key which was produced by Macmanus). - A. I am particularly conversant with this branch; I am certain my next door neighbour would produce a hundred such in a quarter of an hour; the price of this is 3s. 6d. lock and key, it is a very common key.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at that other key - will both those keys open the same lock? - A. They will not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you been in Court? - A. No, my Lord, I am only just come into Court, I am a total stranger to both parties; I did not even know what was going on when I came into Court.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not subpoenaed? - A. No, I came in merely to gratify my curiosity; I have in my time made a great many little locks myself, and have had occasion to go to the White-lion, in Foster-lane, where they keep an assortment of all kind of keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the key produced by the witness a common key? - A. It is the commonest of all but one, and they only differ in size.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Shadwell. I was talking to the prisoner on the pavement outside the public-house, when Collins came out and said, "You have got a bundle that does not belong to you?"—I said, "Have you, Magin, got a bundle?"—he said, "No; it is my own property"—Collins said it was not—I helped Collins while he took the bundle from under the prisoner's jacket—"Now," I said, "we have missed a great many things lately; if it is the servant's property, come in and clear your own character"—I walked in, and said, "Sarah, is this your property?"—she said, "It is, and I give him in charge"—he said it was a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, but at the station-house he said he had bought a flannel jacket that afternoon for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and he had lost it, and that he took this in retaliation for his loss—I have known him some time, and he bore a good character—if he was discharged, I would give him employment.</p>

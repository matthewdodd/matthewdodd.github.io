They were in the garret, in the room that I used to sleep in; they where locked up in my box; I did not lodge there at that time, but my box remained there; Mr. Hall knew my box was there; I had left it there before, when I went out to service.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of leaving your box in the lodgings - A. Yes; I never lost any thing before; Mr. Hall made no objection to my box being there. He knew that I left my box.</p>

            . Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner - A. Yes; on Thursday the 8th of this month, at No 19, Well street, Mile End New Town, at Mr. Hall's; I searched him, he had nothing upon him but a watch. On the Friday the prisoner told me that he had hid the property.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation had you with him that led to that - A. I heard a word drop, that the prisoner acknowledged that he had done the robbery; I went to him and ask'd him what he had done with the twelve pounds; he said part of it was hid, and if I went to Mr. Hall's garden, at the bottom of that garden, close against the privy door, the left side going in, he had burried it there, just by the passage; I went there immediately along with Miller, my fellow officer. I dug up about six or seven inches in the ground, and there turned up the box exactly in the place he discribed; the tin box was tied round with string; I opened the box, I found it contained three one pound notes, one guinea and four shillings in silver; the prisoner said he gave two pounds fifteen shillings for the watch, out of that money; I told him that together with the money found made seven pounds. I asked him how he counted for the other five pounds odd; he said he had spent it. I told him I must keep the watch, as it was bought with that money, which I did. When he was asked for his defence before the magistrate he said he had robbed the young man. I produce the box with the money in it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in his house on the 29th of September, in the evening - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any part of his house broken that evening - A. Yes, the shop window. On my passing the window in the street, between six and seven o'clock, I perceived the window was cut, but not out; from the appearance of the putty; an instrument had been put into it, about the size of the top of a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time it was so open as to pull any thing through - A. No; it induced me to tell my brother of it. And afterwards I went to an officer, who, with me, patroled the street for half an hour to watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body come to the window after that - A. I saw three boys come to the window, they passed backward and forward three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner and say whether he was one of the <rs id="t18101031-57-deflabel356" type="occupation">boy</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18101031-57-defend682 t18101031-57-deflabel356"></join>s - A. It was so dark I could not tell whether he was one; at that time I could not distinguish his features by the day-light that was left; one of the boys was the same size as the prisoner, whether he was I cannot say. In passing backwards and forward, I saw one of them, in appearance, as if he had struck the glass, and then walked on a little way, I suppose they thought some one was near them. They walked on a little way and returned to the window; three or four times after they had done that. I know no more until I saw the prisoner in the hands of the officer; I saw the boys run from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they running away from the window at the time that you saw the prisoner in the officer's custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You came up to the officer that had hold of the prisoner - A. Yes. The piece of handkerchiefs that were tied in the window when I came up to it, had been drawn partly through the window, hanging only by the string; the window had been broken, and the piece of handkerchief had very nearly been got out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that piece of handkerchiefs - A. Three pound; the piece contained seven handkerchiefs, we gave sixty-five shillings for it; we had it three weeks or a month in the shop. The string was cut and afterwards the handkerchiefs, and the lad was taken in our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is the lad that the officer took at the window - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you applied to by the last witness to watch Thomas Newberry's house - A. Yes; I went to watch a quarter past six; I saw the prisoner near the shop, in company with two others.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner, had the daylight out of doors sufficiently gone for you not to be able to distinguish the features of a man - A. It was dark out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you watch the prisoner and two others - A. Yes; I perceived them walk up to the window, backwards and forwards, two or three times, after that as I was coming down again, I observed two together, one of them had got hold of something. I laid hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310052"></xptr>him, he had got this piece of handkerchief drawn out of the window, about as much as that. When I first came up and saw the window, I observed, that they had broken it, and the next time I came up they had broke it bigger.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any other person have broke that window to get these goods through, but those three boys - A. There might be somebody else, but I did not see any body else, I was watching for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that you laid hold of, that had the handkerchief in his hand - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. It was partly through the window and partly in the shop - A. Yes. I searched the prisoner, he had no instrument about him, the other two ran away; I examined the window, the putty had been removed and the glass torn out; I took the prisoner into the house; Mr. Newberry brought the handkerchiefs in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newberry. This was one of the pieces of handkerchiefs that we had on sale at my brother's shop.</p>

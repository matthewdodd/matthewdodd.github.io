            . I am near nine years old. My father lives at Bancroft's-place.

               <p>Q. Did any body say any thing to you about some cakes - A. Yes, that lady (pointing to the prisoner) - I did not know her before; she asked if that was Bancroft's-place? I said Yes. She then asked if there was a cake-shop near? I said Yes. She asked if that was my brother? I said Yes. She took the child out of my lap, gave me 1 s., and told me to go and get three pennyworth of cakes. I went to Mile End-road for them, and then returned - Benjamin was then missing; I was gone about a quarter of an hour. I went across the field to look for him. I looked about, and asked the people if they had seen him - I could find neither him nor the lady. The lady had a bundle in her hand; I do not know what it contained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Does your father go out much in the day - A. No. The lady had a white straw bonnet and a white gown on, and no veil. I did not look particularly at her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say where you were to find her when you returned - A. She said she would walk about the field. I left my brothers with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the first person of your family that you told of this - A. My mother - she was out when I went home. I saw her in about half an hour, and told her.</p>
               <p>Q. You told her you saw so little of the lady that you should not know her again - A. No; I said she was dressed in a white gown and a straw bonnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your mother threaten to beat you for trusting your brother with a lady, whom you said you should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150048"></xptr>not know again - A. No, it was for losing my brother. I saw the lady again in about a week, at Lambeth-street. The prisoner was the lady who took my brother. She was dressed at the office as she is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Benjamin his best clothes on - A. No, he was dirty; he had a hat on.</p>
               <p>MR. ARABIN. Q. When you saw her at Lambeth-street did you say she was the woman - A. Yes, she took him in her lap.</p>

            . I keep a green-grocer's shop, and live at Gould's-hill, Shadwell. On Saturday, the 28th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came with a child to my shop to buy some fruit - I am sure she is the lady. I particularly noticed both her and the child; to the best of my belief this is the same child - (looks at it) - I was cleaning my shop-door, which was wet, and I asked her to wait while I wiped it up. She appeared agitated, and trembled very much. She said she was very much fatigued, and had lost her way, that she wanted a coach, and did not mind what she paid for it - she had the child in her arms. I asked her what part she wanted to go to? she said to Old-street. I said she was a long way from there; I was busy, and pointed out the nearest coach-stand - she sat down in the shop about ten minutes. I looked at her particularly, seeing that the child was much worse dressed than herself; its hat came off as it was too little for it - it was a new hat and was much better than the rest of its clothes; it was a light coloured hat - she went towards the stand. I suspected something, and communicated my suspicions to a lady. The prisoner said she thought she was near the Tower. I told her she was at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from Bancroft's-field - A. I should think about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes walk, I did not see her get into the coach. I am certain she is the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did your suspicions draw your attention particularly towards her and the child - A. It did, my Lord.</p>

            , I live in New-square, Minories. On the Monday preceeding the 28th of August, the prisoner took an apartment at my house. On Saturday she dined early, went out about half-past two o'clock, and said she should not return till night, probably.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe her having a hat - A. I did not observe it, but a day or two before, she said she supposed I wondered what she took out a bundle for, and said it was a little hat she was going to give to a poor woman for a child. I had not noticed the bundle until she spoke of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterward see her on the Saturday - A. She came for her things about seven o'clock in the evening, and discharged her lodgings; she took it by the week, as she said she had business to do, and might not stop a week. I did not see her afterward.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She conducted herself very respectably - A. Very much so indeed. She took her things away in a coach, whether any one else was in the coach I do not know.</p>

            . I was constable of the night at Mile End, Old Town. I am a married man, and have seven children - my son Samuel is nine years of age; I have an infant named Benjamin; on the 28th of August he was a few days more than fourteen months of age - he was at the breast. Three of my sons, who are seven, five, and three years of age, went out with Samuel. I went out about eleven o'clock in the morning, returned about four in the afternoon, and found the child was gone, I made a diligent search, and traced the prisoner across the fields as well as I could. Owing to a letter which I had received, I followed the prisoner to Birmingham, and arrived there on the Thursday morning following - Martin had gone before me; I found the prisoner in his custody; my child was in the same apartment. Martin held it up, and asked me if it was mine? I would not answer him though I knew it, thinking it would hold its hands out to me - it was mine - I claimed it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was said - A. He gave me the child, pointed to the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the lady who stole it." I looked at her, and said, I believed she was, from the description I had given me - her sister-in-law was there. One of them said,</p>
               <p>"How do you know it to be your child?" I pointed to a mole on the right arm - they said I might have discovered that since I came; I do not know whether it was she or her sister. After I had pointed out two or three marks, I described one on the leg; the same answer was made. I said I had brought them something to assure them it was mine, and produced a printed bill with a description of the child. The prisoner then put her hands together, made some confession, and said she had been deceived or taken in, and that the child had been put into her arms.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it in good health - A. I did not find it well when I arrived at Birmingham. We always call him Benjamin. It has not been christened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife and you differ about its name - A. No.</p>

I went to Birmingham<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150049"></xptr>on Tuesday night, and arrived there on Wednesday morning, the 1st of September, at ten o'clock; I found the prisoner at a house there - I had seen her on Wednesday and the day before. I saw her nursing and kissing the child on Wednesday - it was then dressed very meanly indeed. On Thursday morning I went into the shop, and inquired for Captain Reading - he was not within. I sent my name up, and the prisoner was called down into the back parlour. I told her that I was an officer, and in search of her for stealing a child; she was greatly agitated, and said,</p>
               <p>"If that is the case, the child was given to me as mine." I said,</p>
               <p>"That is not the case, you have no child." Her sister-in-law said,</p>
               <p>"What does this mean? explain it, my dear." After a little time she said, the Captain had frequently wished her to have a child, that she went to London for the purpose of adopting some poor person's child, that she was walking about for that purpose, and observed some children playing; she said she went up to one of them to ask if they would have some cakes, when the little boy got up, and eagerly said,</p>
               <p>"I will fetch them, Ma'm," and pushed the child into her arms, and that she walked about the fields, waiting the return of the little boy, but as he did not come back, she thought Providence had placed the child in her arms to take care of it - she said she went away with a view to inform the parents, as soon as she could learn where they were. A lady there delivered me the clothes, which I understood the boy had on when he was taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found it first on Wednesday - A. I saw it at the door in an exposed situation. On Thursday she gave me this account. The child was much better dressed than when it was taken.</p>

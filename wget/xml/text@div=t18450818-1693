                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined. Q.</hi> Were you at home on the Monday afternoon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at home all day—the prisoner came home about a quarter past three o'clock in the afternoon—I said, "You have got home in good time?"—he said, "Yes, you know where I am going to snpper?"—I said, "Yes, I do"—that was all I said to him—he remained at home till ten minutes before five o'clock, by Haggerstone church—I looked at the clock for him—he left my house ten minutes before five, to go to this supper—I can take my oath he was in the house all that time—he usually comes home about eight in the evening, but I expected him home, as he was going to this supper, and I opened the door to him—it was that cir-cumstance that made me know the hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIMON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What made you look at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It had not long gone three when he came—he generally came to dinner at twelve—he said he should be home about three that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came he to tell you this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me he was to go to this supper at five o'clock—I was not questioned about these matters in any Court, before I came here, only by the solicitor—the pri<lb></lb>soner's wife did not tell me it would be very important to speak to the time between three and five, but when I knew I was to be called, I was obliged to be very particular about the time—when the prisoner went out he said, "I shall be at home a little after three," and when he came, I saw it was a little after three, and when he went out, it wanted a few minutes to five—my little boy who is about twelve years old, was at home, and saw the prisoner, but he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nineteen years old—I live with my father and mother in Bethnal-green-road. I have been acquainted with the pri<lb></lb>soner about two years—I remember seeing him on Monday, the 7th of July—I remember that it was on Monday, because I was going to take my work home, which I take home once a week—I saw him just by the Nag's Head, about ten minutes to five o'clock—I walked with him as far as the Jew's school, where he was going to dinner—he was dressed more than usual—I saw he went into the Jew's school, and my attention was called at that time to the hour—I knew what o'clock it was, because I looked at the church clock, which is right at the bottom of the school, and it was twenty minutes past five—I had walked with him about half a mile.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">MYERS</hi>. I am master of the school for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. The prisoner was educated in that school, but not during my mastership—I was there on the 7th of July—there was no dinner nor supper, it was an anniversary meeting of the school—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there—I cannot say when he got there, but the doors are open at five, and he was there between five and seven o'clock—my impression is that he was there about half-past five, but I cannot swear to the time—he</p>

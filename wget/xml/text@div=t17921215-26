I observed the footman's pockets being turned out as we were going to the watch-house, and he said he had lost half a guinea out of that pocket, says he, they made several attempts at my watch. I had hold of one, and Stevens had hold of the other; they told us we should let loose, or we should not be watchmen there long. We kept our hold and took them to the watch-house, and gave the charge of them, and delivered them over to the constable of the night. The footman was nothing but blood, all his face, very much cut about his forehead. The lining of the pocket was turned completely out. These are the same men we lodged in the watch-house. I attended before the magistrate next morning, and there the prosecutor mentioned his waistcoat being turned inside out, and said, that he had lost half a guinea. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150054"></xptr>took hold of these men from the prosecutor. I took Robertson, and Stevens Campbell.

               <p>Q. When did you see your half guinea before? - I had a guinea, but I owed Timms, at the Black Horse public house, half a guinea, and he gave me change, which was about half an hour before I was attacked; I put it in my right hand pocket, and recollect nothing more about it till I perceived the half guinea was gone.

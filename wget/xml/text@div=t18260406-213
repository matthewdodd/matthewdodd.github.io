On the night of the 24th of February, I was at the King's-head public-house, in Edgware-road - I spent two shillings, and changed half a crown, which I did not mention before the Magistrates - I took out my money when I came out - I had six half-crowns, one crown, and some other silver - I felt it in my pocket when I came into High-street, Mary-le-bone - I had come away with Robins, my employer - after leaving him I went into the Rising Sun public-house, and staid there about three-quarters of an hour - I was rather in liquor, and I drank some more there - I changed half-a-crown and paid for six-penny worth of gin and water - I saw some soldiers there, and gave them part of it - I arose up to go out, and asked the prisoner, who looked like a watchman, if he would drink; he came in and drank out of the glass - there was "7 D." on his coat - I think I remained there about twenty minutes, but he did not stay - when I came out I met him in the street - I dropped two half-crowns in the street, which I picked up and put into my waistcoat pocket - I recollect the prisoner then put his hand into my right hand waistcoat pocket, and then attempted to take my watch - I called out, and then missed my money, which was one crown piece, four half-crowns, and some silver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he endeavoured to take your watch, how did he do that? A. He got the watch out, but the string was drawn through the button-hole, and he could not get it - he had unbuttoned the waistband of my breeches to get it, but the ribbon would not draw - I gave an alarm - Williamson and two watchmen came up and the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, when I charged him with stealing my watch, but not my money, because I was rather tipsy, and did not recollect it - the watch-house keeper said, "You are drunk, come to-morrow morning at ten o'clock" - I went at eight o'clock, and saw the deputy watch-house keeper - I asked if there was not a watch there of mine - the prisoner had not taken the watch from me - I described the money by some marks of whitening on it before I saw it; Mr. Howard took out the crown, two half-crowns, two shillings, and nine-pence half-penny, and I saw the marks on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS Q. What was the sign of the first public-house you went to? A. The King's Head; I got drunk at the Sun; I was capable of walking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060087"></xptr>home; the watch-house keeper pointed out the watch upon my own person - the prisoner had his coat taken off, and he was dismissed for being drunk - the watch-house-keeper took the watch, and kept it the whole night for protection; he let the prisoner go about his business, and he came the next morning.</p>

            . I am waiter at the public-house in High-street. I was out with beer in Paddington-street, and heard the cry of Watch! I went to the place, and found the prisoner holding the prosecutor up against some iron-railing - the prosecutor was crying Watch! and the prisoner was taking the watch out of his pocket - but it was fastened round his button, and he could not get it. The prosecutor was dead drunk, and I assisted in taking them to the watch-house - the prisoner was searched, and one crown, two half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, and some half-pence, were taken from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A waiter; I did not say at the watch-house that the prisoner had taken the watch; I said he took it out of his pocket, but could not get it, because it was fastened round the brace button - the constable did not say to me, "Then the man must have two watches, for there is one upon his person now" - there were two watchmen in the street; the prisoner was drunk - the prosecutor gave him in charge, and he walked with the other watchman to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he speak when he gave him in charge? A. Yes; he ordered the other watchman to take him down to the watch-house, and said he had been robbing him of his watch.</p>

            . I am constable of Mary-le-bone. I was on duty on the 24th of February, and about half-past nine o'clock; the prisoner, who is a parish watchmen, was brought to the watch-house; the prosecutor said "I give this watchman in charge for robbing me of my watch;""Robbed you of your watch! has he, (said I), where?" he appeared to be tipsy, and said it was in Paddington-street; I said "Let us see if he has robbed you;" I lifted up his waistcoat, and said "You give charge of the prisoner for robbing you of your watch, and here is your watch - what time might it be?" he said it was half-past eleven, and the prosecutor said it was half-past twelve o'clock. I said to the prisoner "You are drunk;" he said"I am not;" the watch-house-keeper said "You are - pull off that coat, and go along about your business" - I searched, and found on him, one crown, two half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, and some copper - I saw the prosecutor next morning, when he said he had lost his money, and described it by the whitening on it - the prisoner was ordered to come down about ten o'clock, and he came at half-past eight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Williamson come into the watch-house that night? A. Yes; he said nothing about the money being taken - he said, next morning, that he saw the prisoner had got the prosecutor against the iron-rails, with his small-clothes undone, and had got the watch out, but could not get it away, because it was fastened - he did not charge the prisoner with taking the watch that night - he heard what was going forward, and came with this story next morning: I took the silver from the prisoner; he had an opportunity of seeing what I took from him; the prosecutor, or the waiter, might have seen it - I took it out, and counted it on the table, and there was whitening on it; the prosecutor described it as having whitening on it in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you refuse to take the charge upon finding the watch? A. Yes; as soon as I saw it on the prosecutor - Williamson did not say why he came in.</p>

            . I keep the Rising Sun public-house. At nine o'clock on this night I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together - the prosecutor took him into the parlour; I saw the prosecutor with a half-crown - I saw no other money - I saw him go away, and immediately heard a cry in the street - I went out and desired them both to come in again; I said "What have you to allege against the man?" he gave no answer, but still insisted upon knowing his number; he ordered a glass of gin and water, and gave me half-a-crown, which I changed - I then desired the prisoner to go, as the man had nothing to allege against him, which he did - the prosecutor stopped about twenty minutes, and then went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He could not make any charge against the man? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night in question I arrived at my post about twenty minutes before seven o'clock. I walked round my beat, and met the prosecutor at the corner of Beaumont-street and Devonshire-street, accusing a gentleman's servant of throwing water on him from a window - I inquired what house it was, and he pointed to an uninhabited one - I mentioned that to him, and he got quite pacified, and asked me to have something to drink - we went into the Devonshire Arms, and I had a small glass of rum - he took out his watch, and put it down to pay for the liquor; I said it was very strange he should call me in to have liquor and not have money to pay for it - I told him to put his watch into his pocket, and search his pocket, to see if he had got no money - he turned out his pockets, and in his right hand waistcoat pocket he had three half-crowns - he changed one, and I left him there about half-past eight or nine o'clock - I met him again in Devonshire-street, and he urged me to go to the Sun, and drink with him; I said go to the house, and I may call; when I got to the door he met me, and urged me to go in; I drank about two table-spoonsful - he met me again afterwards, and urged me to have more - I said I would not, but he urged me, and said he had some rum and water with some soldiers - I consented to have some, and that was all.</p>

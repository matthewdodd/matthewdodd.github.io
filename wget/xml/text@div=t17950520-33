I was as sober as I am now. There were three girls at the end of the court, and they dragged me up by main force; I was walking along to my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the name of the court? - Dean's court; I was coming out of Smock-alley, and going along Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Who were the girls that dragged you into the court? - These two, and another; there were three of them. It was not quite day light.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the lamps lighted? - Yes. They dragged me while they got to the top of the court; and I said, I will not have any thing to do with you; I would rather give you sixpence or a shilling, than have any thing to do with you. I pulls a shilling out of my waistcoat pocket, and my watch, to see what o'clock it was, and one of them immediately snatched my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before you was dragged up the court, or after? - After.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you dragged up by force? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they carry you into any house? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the court a thoroughfare? - No, it was no thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you try to get away? - Yes, I did, but I could not. One snatched the shilling, and the other the watch. The biggest snatched the shilling,(Thompson,) and the least my watch,(Smith.)</p>
               <p>Q.Where was this shilling at the time? - In my hand. I told them, I would give them that, to have nothing to do with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the reason that you put the shilling in your hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this watch? - I had it just in my hand, out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do when these things were snatched away? - They gave me a push, to push me down, but I did not fall; I catched my arm against a door post.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after they took your watch? - After.</p>
               <p>Q. When they made their snatch of the shilling and watch, was it done in a moment, or did you make any resistance? - It was done in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q.There was no pulling for it? - No.</p>

            They were suddenly jerked out of your hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they hold of your person at the time they took your money and watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. But they laid hold of you when they dragged you up the court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did they get this money from you after they dragged you up the court? - Directly.</p>
               <p>Q.Had they loosed hold of you? - Yes, when I got the things out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they loosed hold of you? - Not five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, for five minutes, they had not their hands on you before they took your money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after they had taken your watch and money? - They told me I might think myself well off that I did not get a black eye or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them? - I don't know, they were gone before I could look after them. I went out of the court, and could not find any thing of them, and I could not be easy, and I went in again directly, and I went up the court to the top. On my return I met three men and I durst not look at them; I thought I might get the worst of it, so I made the best way out of the court again, and I went into the court again, and I got hold of the girl that got my shilling and she flew into a place, and I got after her, and got hold of her, and brought her to the light. I thought it had been her that had got my watch. When I brought her to the light, I said, let me look at your face, and see whether it is you that has got my watch, or you that has got my shilling; and I said, O it is you that has got my shilling. Where is the person that has got my watch? Says she, I don't know; what I have got I mean to keep. I says, if you will but tell me where the girl is that has got the watch, I don't care. Says she, I don't know nothing of her. So I let her go, and came out of the court, and I went home to my lodging. I lodge in Cockhill, Bishopsgate. I got up the next morning, and there was a young man that lodges in the same room, that advised me what to do; and we went after the girls, and got them the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them the next day? - Not till night; I was in company with the officers. I had often seen them before; they were in the court in custody of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that they were the same girls? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you was robbed, were you near a lamp? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When the officers took them, were the girls searched? - Yes, the biggest, Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on her? - No. The other girl was not searched. The watch they had found, and Mr. Bare and I went to a place, and there we got it.</p>
               <p>Q. The money has never been found, I suppose? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your watch? - I see it the Friday night that we took the girls up, about half after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know your watch again? - Yes, I can tell the number, 39267, maker's name, Richards.</p>
               <p>Jury. In what position were you pushed up the court? - One got hold of my collar, on one side, and another on the other, and a third behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the girls before? - - I live close by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you visited them at their apartment, or only known them by sight? - Seeing them walking about.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever spoke to them, or had any intimacy with them? - Never in my life.</p>

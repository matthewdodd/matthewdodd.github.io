                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at 35, Francis Street, Westminster—on the night of 17th November, about 11 o'clock, I was in the Bath Arms, at the corner of Bath Street, London Road—I was sober, but I had had a drop of beer—I went out with George Bowley—when I had gone about 100 yards I heard somebody coming up behind me—the prisoner held up my arms while another man took my money out of my pocket, 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. all I had got there, and a knife—about twenty minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner at the Dog and Star, with the other man—I asked him to give me back the halfpence that he had taken out of my pocket, the other man handed him something, and the prisoner said "I will give you some half<lb></lb>pence," and I received a blow on my cheek from something ten or eleven inches long, that he had up his sleeve—I don't remember any more afterwards, only he gave me a kick in the ribs—he came to me again after that in Mansfield Street, and said "Now are you going home after that," and he turned me round all of a sudden over his legs—I then went home—I did not know till next morning that my jaw was broken—I have been in the infirmary in consequence of the injuries.</p>

I am a surgeon, in Kennington Road—I was called in to see the prosecutor on Wednesday, 19th November—his face was very much discoloured and swollen, and he had fracture of the lower jaw; that might have been caused by a blow given with great power, by a life-pre-server or a short stick.</p>

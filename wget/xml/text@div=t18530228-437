On the night of Tuesday, 1st Feb., I went to bed at 20 minutes past 11 o'clock—I was the last person up—previous to going to bed I saw that the house was all secure—I got up the next morning at a quarter before 8 o'clock—on going to the street door I saw it was open, and the key of the door, which had been left in the lock the night before, was on the end of the counter, and a piece of candle which the thieves had left behind—I looked at the shelves, and discovered the whole of the cloth had been taken—the shop was very nearly cleared out—what was there the night before was put down 150 yards of cloth, but there was more than 250 yards, worth more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went up stairs, and found the sitting room door open, and a window open over the door—I am quite sure that the shop door was fastened and locked the night before—beside the ends of cloth, some silk plush had been taken out of the window, and a waistcoat that was in the window, made up—two pieces of waistcoating were taken, and a figured velvet waistcoat—they had all been safe the night before—I had repeatedly seen the prisoners pass, and I know the features of them all—the piece of candle did not belong to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 25, King-street, Rotherhithe. Mr. Dobbins keeps the house, my father and I are living in the house—I left home on that night about half past 7 o'clock—I did not go home again because my father would beat me, because I had hit little Dobbins—I played about the streets, and after that I went to sleep on Mr. Searle's step—it was a very foggy night—after I had been asleep some time, I awoke, and heard people coming from the play—there were torches in the road—I went to sleep again, and the biggest prisoner with the white coat (<hi rend="italic">John Hughes</hi>) kicked me—I call him <hi rend="italic">Doodleham</hi>—he said, "Get out of the way, what are you doing here?"—I said, "I am only sleeping here, <hi rend="italic">Doodleham</hi>"—I knew him before by that name—he goes by that name—George Hughes and William Hughes were there—I call them both <hi rend="italic">Doodlehams</hi>, and the other prisoner <hi rend="italic">Nappy</hi>—they were all together—John Hughes told me to stand on one side, and I stood on one side, against the grocer's shop—there was a donkey-cart there, and John Hughes went to the cart and took a lantern out—the cart was on the kerb, at Mr. Searle's door—when John Hughes had got the lantern from the cart, he took it up against the spout—he struck one lucifer against the spout, that did not light—he struck another, and that did not light—the third one did light, and he lit the candle in the lantern-—he then told <hi rend="italic">Nappy</hi> to go and</p>

On the 19th of May, I got leave to come out. I went into several public-houses and got very tipsey. I had twelve pounds with me. I changed a ten-pound note at a linen-draper's shop; I bought some linen; they gave me seven one-pound notes, and I had two more besides. I then went into the White Horse public-house; when I was there I fell asleep. I had nothing to drink for near three hours. When I awoke I called for a bottle of wine I had been sick, and dirted the room. I called for a bottle of wine to treat the company, to make apology. We had five bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these people that you treated your acquaintances - A. No, I never saw the men or the house before.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner. Can you recollect whether he was there - A. I am sure he was in company with me at that public-house. He did not sit so near me as some others did. I took my money out to pay for the wine. I do not know how much I paid. I know I changed two one-pound notes at that public-house. A man that sat at the side of me I felt him meddling at my pocket. I got up, and came out. I was very tipsey then. There were two or three men at the door that had been drinking with me. The went out a little before. There were three or four of them. They took me into a dark passage. I cannot say the prisoner was one of them that took me to that dark passage. It was a dark night, and a dark passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what the men did - A. I know they did not hurt me. They took my money from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive them take your money from you - A. No. A gentleman or lady gave me my pocket-book; there were no notes in it. I called out murder when they took me down there, and I called out for the watch, and when some persons came to my assistance the men were gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live at St. Albans—I was in London on the evening of 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> December, about 8 o'clock—I met the pri<lb></lb>soners and another person in the Haymarket—they asked me to go to their apartments, 23, Foley-street, I think, to take some supper—I went with them to the house, and bought some supper on the road—I asked Reeves who the other one was; and he said it was a friend of his, whom he had known some years—then he asked me to take off my coat—I did so, and Hines hung it up behind the door—they asked me to take off my boots, but I declined—the third man, Mr. Hines's friend, asked me to take a pinch of snuff out of a box; and then he asked me to put my hand and feel a tumour which he had in the side of his left cheek—then he said, "Smell this," and put a white handkerchief to my nose; and I do not recollect any<lb></lb>thing</p>

               <p>after that—when I became conscious, I was in the same place—they were all three there, but the third man rushed out of the room—I said, "I am robbed, Mr. Hines, of my watch, and my two chains"—my trousers were unbuttoned, and I said, "My money is all taken from my pocket"—I said, "Where is my coat that was behind the door? that is gone too"—Reeves said, "I have not got it; but we will go round to the public-houses, and see if we can find the man"—I said, "Stop, I shall go down stairs first;" and I went to the street-door—there was a cab in front of the house, and I asked the cabman to go for a policeman—I had left the two prisoners up stairs—I kept hold of the street-door, for I thought if I left it I should not be able to find the house again—I have not seen any of my things since, nor the third man—this chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) which the policeman found in the room, is the one that was unscrewed off my watch.</p>

               <p>and Reeves had one—he stood at the door and took his glass—he said, "It's not much use going to that house, as it is a bad house, a low house"—it was in the evening that I met him there at the door; not in the day—I had plenty of money at the time—I paid for the glass of ale that Reeves had, as well as for the one I had; and at another house he asked me to go to his room, in London-street, and I paid for some more on that very night—that was the first time I ever saw him—I never saw him before that in my life—I only saw him once before the 17th—I showed him my pin—I had a gold bracelet in my possession the first time I saw him; not on the 17th—I suppose I had had it about a month—I never showed that to <hi rend="italic">Reeves</hi>—I told him I had it—I told him that I had been so reduced in cir<lb></lb>cumstances, that I had been obliged to pledge the only valuable thing I had, namely, a bracelet, and that I had been robbed so—that was on the Sunday; the day after I met him at the George—the first time I met him was a Saturday, and I went to his house that night—the 17th was the next time I met him—I did meet him on the Sunday; be took me to his house on the Saturday night, and I stopped there till the Sunday—my wife and child were at that time quite Out of their minds about where I was—Reeves begged me to stay—he said, "Now, do stay, it is so cold"—I said, "My wife will be uneasy about me"—he said, "Oh! do stay"—I said, "Who is that person with you?" and be said, "Oh! that is Hines"—Hines was with him them—I did not know the way back to my lodging—I lived at Mrs. Scovens', a greengrocer's, near Drury-lane—I used to be steward to Captain Taylor, and I used to go down to see him at the Haymarket—the St. George's barracks are in Castle-street, at the bottom of St. Martin's-lane—Reeves took me to London-street, which is quite a different direction—it was very dark, and he begged me to stop—he said, "I will make you some nice strong tea if you will stop"—it was about 7 o'clock in the evening when I met him; it was dark—I stayed about five or ten minutes at the public-house before I went with him, and then we stayed on the road and had two half-pints of beer—I told the Magistrate I had known Reeves once before; they never asked me whether I stayed at his house or not—they only asked if I knew the prisoner, and I said, "Once before"—I showed Reeves the duplicate for the bracelet, and be wrote a letter for me on the Sunday morning, just before I left his house—I told him that I had pawned the bracelet; that I had been robbed of my pin and money at that house, and had been so reduced through it, I had been obliged to pawn several articles—it was in consequence of the robbery and loss of money that I pawned the bracelet—I pawned it about three weeks before I saw Reeves, and I had the ticket in my possession—I pledged it before I was robbed—I pledged it because I was going to take a house in London, but then I was robbed, and I said I had to pledge more things because I had been robbed—I did not carry all the money about with me that my sister gave me; only about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—the robbery caused me to pledge other things—I had the bracelet nearly six weeks—I did not buy it—I and my wife picked it up together—I went to several shops and wanted to pledge it, and when I went down to see Captain Taylor, I told him where I had picked it up, and he said I had done quite right to pledge it instead of selling it—I also found the ring—I did not tell Reeves that I had pledged the bracelet for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I pledged it first for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then I went to the shop, and they said I could have some more if I wanted it, and they let me have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more; then my wife and I went again, and I said, "I want 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more," and they gave it me; but I never told Reeves—I told Hines—I never</p>

Mr. Nellum—he told me he was acquainted with parsons and doctors—he did not tell me he was a tutor—he told me he could write to the parsons and borrow money of them, because he had paid come of them money when he went to church—I have heard, since the 17th, that Reeves was a gentleman, and tutor in a gentleman's family—I heard of it at the police-court—I saw a doctor there, who stated to the Magistrate that he was a tutor in his brother's family; but I went to his lodgings, and to five different houses where he bad lodged, and the landladies all said he had left—I never mentioned before to day about the request being made that I should take my boots off, because they never asked me about it—Reeves did not tell me that the other man was his son; but in the house he called him his son, to the landlady and her daughter—I never knew, till the 17th, that he had a son—he did not tell me he had one the first time I met him—I did not say anything to the Magistrate about Reeves saying that the third man was his son—I did not say anything about the person asking me to smell his handkerchief—on the Sunday morning, when I was at Reeves's house, he sent out and got fourpenny-worth of meat, and stewed it for dinner—on the last occasion, he said he had no "money; and I bought some celery, meat, and potatoes, going home to his lodgings—I never said to the Magistrate that he said he had no money, because they never asked me.</p>

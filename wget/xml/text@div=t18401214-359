                  </hi>. I am clerk to John Crowley and Co., Nos. 30 and 31, Wharf-road, City-road—they are canal carriers. The prisoners were in their employ—Manning has been so for about twenty years—I went on Saturday last to the shop of Joseph Mainon, in Brick-lane, and saw some iron there—it was old iron in the state in which I saw it then—it was what had come up by our barges, and had been on our wharf for some time—there were some iron plates amongst it, and a fly-wheel—I could identify the greater part of it—there was about 1 1/2cwt.—I had seen it on the wharf not more than a week before—I sent for the prisoners, and gave them into custody—this iron railway chain was amongst the iron I found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector and collector of Newgate-market—on 18th April, last Heath, Mr. Baker's man, called my attention to some beef in the market, on Mr. Baker's premises—it was four quarters of a cow, the</p>

               <p>head, tongue, heart, and liver—when I first saw them they were in the hamper marked "J. Cox," and there was a label on the hamper directed to Baker and Son, Newgate-market, from Mr. Cox;" and there was "High-Bridge Station" on it—I took this label off the hamper—the meat was packed with a cloth—that is the usual way in which all meat is sent up to market for sale—in my opinion, it was the carcase of a cow that had died from calving; the meat was in a very inflamed condition—it had evidently died, from the appearance of it; not been fairly killed, in my opinion—it was totally unfit for human food—the heart had the appearance of the heart of an animal that had died, not been killed; it was full of blood—that would not have been the case if the animal had been killed—the fat was red, and the whole of the carcase was quite unfit for human food—I seized it—I have been a butcher all my life—I believe I am perfectly qualified to form an opinion upon the matter—I gave into Mr. Baker's counting-house a condemnation note, in the usual way, and I also had the meat further examined by Mr. Newman, and by Mr. Davidson, the inspector at Leadenhall-market—I took it to the Guildhall Justice-room, and it was condemned by Mr. Alderman Finnis; he examined it, and ordered it to be destroyed.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it may be good to all appearance to the person slaughtering it in the country, and in process of packing would be entirely spoilt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the hot weather—when meat is sent to Newgate-market it is sent for the purpose of sale as human food—the Bakers are meat-salesmen—they do not profess to receive dog's meat—I do not know it to be the practice, when animals die or casualties occur to them, that the salesman sells the meat to persons of that description—I know it is not the practice—I never heard of such a thing in my life; it certainly is not the practice—I never saw it done, only in the way in which I state—the salesmen, if they get meat that is spoilt, send it to the boilers—I did not detect any disease in this animal, it was in an inflammatory state—I did not detect any diseased liver about this carcase—it weighed a little over 300 lbs.; there are eight pounds to a stone—that would be the proper weight for an animal of that size.</p>

Baker and Son, of Newgate-market—he said, "Is there going to be any bother about that? I have had two bothers already about it"—I said, "Do you mean going to Highbridge and paying the railway charges?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—I said, "I have heard that you did not consign the carcase of the cow on your own account, and if you choose to give me an explanation concerning it you can: you are not obliged to do so"—he then stated that a man of the name of Boddy, a butcher, living at Biddenham had come to him, and after some conversation had asked him to Buy the cow, and had asked him thirty shillings for it, that he bid him twenty-five shillings and he had the cow—he said there was some arrangement between him and Boddy, that he (Cox) was to send the cow to market, and that whatever the cow made, he (Cox) should have a profit—he likewise stated that he himself had taken the hamper containing the cow to Highbridge station, and had got the porter at the railway to sign the forwarding ticket, and the porter did sign it for him.</p>

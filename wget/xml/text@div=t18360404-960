                  </hi>. I keep the Hunter's Arms. Compton-street, St. Pancras. On the 16th of March I was in the bar—the prisoner came from the tap-room through the passage—I saw he had the pots in question in a black apron tied round him—my wife said, "There is a man going out of the door with some pots"—he went to the door, and was rather impeded by a chain, but he got out—I followed, and about a yard from the door I collared him—he had two quarts, and two pint pots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not the man at the bar lay hold of my shoulder and say, "This way?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he opened the door to let you out—you told me Gibbs had been fighting—I did not lend you any pots out the day before—I might have let you have one with beer in it when you lived in the court, but not at this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Gibbs wanted to take the pots, and I ran out to the bar with them—I took them up, and went down the court, which is not the way to my house—I took two with me first, and then these two pints were outside the door—the bar was full of people, and then Gibbs was coming after me.</p>

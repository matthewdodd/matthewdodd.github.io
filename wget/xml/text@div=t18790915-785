                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, at 46, Old Montague Street, Whitecliapel—I was walking down Christian Street on 17th August at 1 a.m.—there was a crowd there looking at a fire, and I was struck on the hat by McManus—I said, "Don't tackle me, I've got nothing about me"—Smith then tripped me up and struck me on the hip, and Sheen held me by the throat—I was thrown down and Ayris held me down by the throat—Gregory was kneeling on me and called out, "Back him," and Smith kicked me on the hip, McManus holding my legs—my trousers pocket in torn out, it contained five keys—a tobacco pouch, pipe and handkerchief, were taken from my coat pocket, and two sixpences from my waistcoat—my watch was in a fob-pocket in my. trousers and I kept my hand on it, and held Smith with the other hand—I called "Police," and "Murder,' till the police came—the others ran away—about 7 p.m. on the Sunday a number of men were shown to me at Leman Street Police Station—I made a mistake first, but afterwards picked out McManus—I had only seen his side face before, but on getting in front of him I picked him out, and I afterwards picked out Sheen—I did not know McManus before, but have no doubt about him—I do not know who took the money out of my pocket—I picked out Gregory on the following Saturday at the Commercial Street Police Station.</p>

At 10.30 on the Sunday night I was in Clarke Street, Stepney, with Inspector Wildey—I saw McManus, and told him I should take him in custody on suspicion of being concerned with others in robbing the prosecutor at a fire in Christian Street oh Saturday night—he said "I was at Wandsworth at 11 o'clock, and slept all night in 'Jack's Hole' (John's Place) with my wife"—on getting to Commercial Road he became very violent, and struggled and kicked, and with the assistance of Inspector Wildey and other constables I got him to the Leman Street station, where he was placed among seven or eight other men and the prosecutor was sent for—he pointed out another man first, but after looking again he identified McManus, and he was also identified by another man who is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 60, Brandon Street, Walworth—McManus has lodged with us since 28th December last—on the Saturday night previous to his being taken in custody he was at our house, between twenty minutes and a quarter to one—my mother, Mrs. Egan, was there, and Joseph Crabb and Charles Tomkins and his wife—he was standing at the doorspeaking to my mother—I was across the road—I came in at four minutes past one, and he was taking off his boots, and he went into our back room and slept there—I was not there when he came home—Charles Tomkins and his wife live opposite, and Tomkins called to him across the road and offered him a pot of drink, but he'did not go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlady of 60, Brandon Street, and have known McManus as Henry Wiggins since 28th December, from which time lie has lived at my house—on the Saturday night before he was taken in custody he came home from 12.15 to 12.30—while I was standing at the corner of Sarah Ann Street, looking at the reflection of the fire, a neighbour called out "Hairy, will you drink?" and he said "No" and I saw McManus standing at the door—I went to him and said, "Isn't it a dreadful fire, Harry?" and he said "Yes, I' have been looking at it all the way home"—we stood talking a few minutes and he said 'Here you, are missus," and be gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and two sixpences for</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at Rother hithe. On Wednesday night, 26th Oct., about a quarter or twenty minutes after 8 o'clock, I was bringing two barges into the Commercial Dock, a ballast lighter was coming in before me—the dock gateman was assisting in hauling it in, and the people belonging to the lighter as well—when a barge is coming behind one that is being hauled out, it is usual for the gateman to give a rope, or for the barges astern to lay hold of the head most barge with their boat hooks to be towed out along with them—the barge I was in was, I should say, about twelve feet from the ballast lighter—that would enable me to lay hold with a boat hook—I did so—the prisoner was on board the ballast lighter—the captain of the lighter told me to let go—I told him my holding on made no difference to him as the gateman was pulling the lighter into the dock—the prisoner then called out, "Let go there will you?"—I made him no answer, but still kept hold—he then walked aft from the forward part of the lighter, and told me to let go—I unhooked my boat hook and laid it on the lighter, and I said to him, "It makes no difference to you about my holding on; the gateman is hauling you in the dock, ain't he?"—he replied, "Never mind, let go?—I was standing in the barge's head sheets—while this was taking place the lighter was going ahead—the prisoner took a short staff that he had in his hand, and knocked the hook of my boat hook over board, I was holding the other end in my hand—while I was talking to the prisoner, the lighter was going out of my reach—I immediately jumped up to the barge's head to lay hold of the lighter again, and the prisoner took up the hook and said, "I will knock your by eye out"—I turned myself round in the barge's sheets when the <hi rend="italic">hitcher</hi> struck me in the right ear—the handle of it was about eight feet long—I was about fourteen feet off at the time I was struck—it must have been thrown at me, it could not have reached me without—I had on this southwester at the time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and here is the hole right through—it went right through that into my neck—I bled a great deal, and I told the prisoner he had cut my head open—he said, That is the way to settle you"—my barge was brought to, and I was taken out and taken home—I was under medical treatment for a month—I had done nothing more to the prisoner than I have stated, hooking on to his lighter to pull my barge in—that would not have delayed his progress in the least, it is the usual custom in the docks.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it dark at the time this happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; quite dark—in the first instance I hooked on to the lighter's washboard, I could not see exactly whether it was the gunwale or washboard, as it was dark—I was not within above ten or twelve feet of it—my hook was fifteen feet long, I was hanging on the whole length of it—the prisoner did not knock the pole of the boat hook out of my hand, he knocked the hook part off, and it fell overboard, I held the other end in</p>

               <p>my hand—when the lighter was going out of my reach I jumped up on the barge's head sheets, and took up the pole in my hand to hook on to the lighter again—I hooked on to the lighter again, I could not see very well as it was very dark—I will undertake to say that I did not hit the prisoner with it; if I had hit anything with the staff I should have felt it—I hooked it gently—I was in a little bit of a hurry in doing it, because the lighter was going away from me; but we can tell within a few inches where the staff will lay hold, when we have it in our hand—I am satisfied that I did not touch the prisoner with it—I could not see his boat hook come at me, because when I saw him take it up I turned my back to it, so that my back might receive the blow—I did not see him throw it—at the time I was struck I had let go—I am sure that the prisoner's lighter was being assisted out of the dock, the people belonging to the dock were doing it; William Sells was one—it is a mystery where the hook is with which the injury was done, I should say it was about eight feet long; I saw it as he held it up in his hand—he stood rather higher than me, a trifle higher, about eighteen inches I should think—the lighter was close to the quay, the gateman had hold of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gate constable at the Commercial Dock. On 26th Oct., about 8 o'clock in the evening, I was standing close to the ballast lighter—the prisoner was on board the lighter—the prosecutor was in the barge—I was assisting in hauling the lighter into the dock—the prisoner is not the captain of the lighter, he is a working man—I did not see the injury inflicted—my attention was first called by hearing the prosecutor groaning—I asked him what was the matter—the prisoner was on board the lighter; he might not have heard me—the prosecutor made a complaint to me—I saw a wound on his neck, under his right ear—it was such a wound as a boat hook would make—it went through his southwester—in consequence of information I received, I went on board the lighter, where the prisoner was, and took him into custody—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—he made no complaint to me of having been struck by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who was assisting the lighter into the dock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was lending assistance, and other men were hauling it—I could not say exactly who they were—I was the only person belonging to the dock assisting—it is the practice when the dock hauls a lighter in, for other lighters to hook on, but not when the people of the lighter haul it themselves—I was lending assistance to haul the lighter in.</p>

I had a lighter to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> in at this time—I stepped out of my lighter into Thorndyke's, to get to other lighters that I had, and then back again—he had hold of the ballast lighter with his staff—about a minute after I had returned to my own craft, I heard Thorndyke halloo out, "I am struck; he has run it into me"—a second or two after I heard the prisoner say, "That is how all such fellows as you ought to be served; I wish it had cut your b—y eye out."</p>
               <p>

I am a surgeon, and reside in Paradise-row, Rotherhithe I was called to attend the prosecutor on 26th Oct.—I found a wound in his neck, which had evidently been inflicted by a blunt instrument it was about three quarters of an inch long, and three quarters of an inch deep—it was then bleeding—I sewed it up—it was a gaping wound, which required a suture—it was just beneath the ear—it did not involve life, but there were inflammatory symptoms for a fortnight; there was the possibility of erysipelas—an instrument of the kind produced might inflict such a wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent to Messrs. Moses, Son, &amp; Davis, manufacturers, of 107, Cheapside—the prisoner was a cutter in our employ<lb></lb>ment—I received information, and on 3rd November I watched the prisoner at his board—as the men were about to leave I called them all into the office—I had previously missed a piece of cloth that had been on the front counter in the warehouse—when I called the men into the office I said "There is something wrong," and the prisoner pulled this piece of cloth from under his cloak and said "This is all I have got about me, for God's take say nothing about it, look over it this time"—I said "There is some-thing else about you," and I turned to go to the door—he took this piece of cloth from underneath the waistband of his trowsers, and threw it under the board—the cloth was warm when it was taken from under the board, and it was not there before he came into the room—I sent for a constable—the two pieces of cloth are the property of Messrs. Moses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service—on the evening of 3rd November I was working at the next board to the prisoner—about 6.15 the man at work facing me called my attention to the prisoner, and I saw him place something in the waistband of his trowsers—I went into the office and told Mr. McEliver—he called us all to come into the office—the prisoner hung back, and seemed as if he did not care to go in—I would not go in till I saw him go in before me, because I knew what he had—he showed this piece of cloth to Mr. McEliver, and I said he had got something larger than that; but he denied it—I saw him pull this piece of cloth out of the waistband of his trowsers, and throw it under the board in the office—I picked it up, and put it in Mr. Me Sliver's hands—it was quite warm—he had been cutting stuff like that during the afternoon.</p>

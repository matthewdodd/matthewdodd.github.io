Yes; but there were gas lights - he ran towards the foot-path, and I caught him very close to the van - I stooped to pick up the parcel, and he got away - I cannot say - I did not lose sight of him before he was re-taken.</p>

            . I am a watchman - on the 31st of January I saw something taken from the back of the van - Seagrot took the basket, and I pursued the man, who was running - perhaps four or five hundred yards from the van.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not very dark? A. No; it was lighted with gas - there was another man who ran to try to stop him, but he ran by the side of a cart and got from him. I kept within ten to twelve yards of him.</p>

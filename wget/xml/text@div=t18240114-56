On the 7th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was alarmed by a ring at the bell, which I answered, and saw a boy at the door; he asked for some street. Clewley stepped forward at the same moment, and asked if I had anybody in the parlour - I went into the parlour, and found the prisoner at one corner, behind the blind; I asked what he wanted; he gave no answer; I asked him again; he said he did it from distress, and hoped I would let him go. The window sash was down before, and the blinds down; but the sash not fastened. I found it wide open; I had come in about five o'clock; it was shut then, and had not been opened afterwards. I rang the bell for my wife - Clewley was called in, and we secured the prisoner. I never saw him before. Nothing had been removed.</p>

            . I live in service in this neigbourhood. I saw a man in Weymouth-street, about seven o'clock in the evening; he was asking a boy which was Harley-street; the boy told him; but he did not go in that direction. I watched, and saw him go to Mr. Cathrow's house - the boy went up to the door and rang. I stepped on, and hid myself behind a weather board, to watch; the boy lingered about the steps. The door was opened and closed again. I came forward, and saw the prisoner standing inside, in front of the window, which was wide open - I had not seen him get in; I could not from behind the board. I desired the boy to ring. I was called in, and found him in the parlour - he was secured. Nobody could have gone in at the door.</p>

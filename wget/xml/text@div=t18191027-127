I went to a customer at the top of the street, and as I returned I saw the prisoner take the bundle out of the basket and run away with it - I was about a stone's throw from him. He ran from me, I pursued him directly; he turned into John-street - I called Stop thief! another person also pursued. I saw him drop the bundle in Chapel-street, he was then about thirty yards from me - Osborn secured him; I picked the bundle up. I am sure he is the boy.</p>

            .

I was very near them. The prisoner threw the bundle out of his apron, I pursued him across Tottenham-court-road, calling Stop thief! I never lost sight of him until he was stopped by two young men.

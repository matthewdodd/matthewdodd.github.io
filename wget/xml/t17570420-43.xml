            . On the 10th of Dec. Mr. Knight being very ill, his wife sent to me to come and attend the business of the house while she went out to Grosvenor-square for all the day. About 8 at night came in a neighbour, and called for a pint of beer. I set a silver pint mug on the bar, for the boy to fill it.</p>

               <p>Q. What boy?</p>

               <p>Jennings. He that drew beer in the house, I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175704200060"></xptr> to him, I am going down into the cellar, be sure take care.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose silver mug was it?</p>

               <p>Jennings. It was Mr. Knight's mug.</p>

               <p>Q. How old is the boy?</p>

               <p>Jennings. He is about 13 years of age. The boy took it away from the bar, as if he was going to fill it, but instead of that he gave it to his mother, and drew the beer in a pewter pint.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the name of that boy?</p>

            , the prisoner at the bar. Some time after that the mug was missing.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know he gave it to his mother?</p>

               <p>Jennings. She was in the tap room at the time, and was gone before that was missed. I went there the next morning, but we could hear nothing of it. Some time after that, a little boy, that is here to give evidence, was taken up in the Borough for stealing other things, and he said he could give an account of this mug. We took him before the sitting alderman, and he told us the boy at the bar took it, and gave it to the other person, his mother, and she went away with it. Then we took the two prisoners up, but they both denied it.</p>

               <p>Trotter. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What will be the consequence, supposing you should swear that which is not truth?</p>

               <p>Trotter. If I don't tell the truth I must go to the devil.</p>

               <p>Court. Be sure that you tell nothing but what is truth.</p>

               <p>Trotter. I was in the prosecutor's house at the time. Mr. Knight was in bed.</p>

               <p>Q. What house?</p>

               <p>Trotter. It was at the Horns in Thames-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you a servant there?</p>

               <p>Trotter. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you there?</p>

               <p>Trotter. I was just come from Mr. White, my master, and was waiting for my mother coming from work to me. Mrs. Knight was gone to the other end of the town, and Mr. Jennings was in the house; he went down into the cellar. The boy that is at the bar went to take the silver mug from the bar; he took and rinsed it in the water-tub, and then he gave it to his mother (the woman at the bar).</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see this?</p>

               <p>Trotter. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the house was his mother?</p>

               <p>Trotter. She was in the middle box on the right hand side. She called me to her, and bid me say nothing of it; and said, she would give me something the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>

               <p>Trotter. This was in December last.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be here to give evidence?</p>

               <p>Trotter. I was taken up on the other side the water, about a metal watch, and then I discovered this.</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you discovered this?</p>

               <p>Trotter. It is about a month or six weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the woman take the mug away?</p>

               <p>Trotter. I saw her go out of the house with it, as soon as Mr. Jennings came up and went into the other room. She called him, and paid him for a pint of beer she had had; then she had the mug under her apron, and went out directly.</p>

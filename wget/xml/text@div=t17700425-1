On the 6th of April, between eleven and twelve at night, I was fool enough to go with the woman at the bar into a dirty alley, to have to do with her, and at the time she picked my pocket of my watch; I had just put it in my coat-pocket for safety. When I had done, she said she wanted to go to the necessary, and ran out of the dark alley. Before I put up my breeches I missed my watch. I ran up the alley, but could not find her high nor low. I searched the place, but had no candle. On the Sunday night I found her about the same place; I took hold of her, and said she had stole my watch. I took her to the watch-house, and the next morning before the justice, and swore she stole it. On the same day the man at the bar came with another man to the house where I had directed my watch to be brought, if found; I advertised it as lost. I let him know if he came with it on the Tuesday morning, he should have the reward I had offered. He came with it. I had got a warrant and took him up; the justice made me pay the money, for taking it out of pawn, one guinea and six-pence. (The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Jos. Jenkinson. I am servant to Mr. Murthwate, a pawnbroker in Great Poultney-street. On the 7th of April the man at the bar pledged a watch with me; it was like this, but I cannot swear to it. He took it out again on the 9th.</p>

               <p>I had been to Knightsbridge; coming home about a quarter after eleven, I had occasion to go up this alley to ease myself; there I found this watch, and went and pledged it for a guinea, and on the Monday I saw it advertised, two guineas reward. I took it out and carried it to him, and he detained me. I never saw this woman by me with my eyes before.</p>

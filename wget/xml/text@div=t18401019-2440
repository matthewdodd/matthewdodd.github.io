                  </hi>. I am curate of St. Paul's, Shadwell. On Saturday afternoon, the 19th of September, about three o'clock, I was going along High-street, Shadwell, and near the end of Angel Gardens, I missed my silk handkerchief from my coat pocket—my attention was called to it, and I returned with a boy, but not at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father in King William-court, Cable-street. On Saturday, the 19th of September, I saw the prosecutor in High-street, and the prisoner Carney there—I did not see Ayling—I saw Carney go behind the prosecutor, put his hand in his right hand cost pocket, and take the handkerchief out—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it into his jacket, and ran down Angel Gardens—Ayling was along with him when he took it—he was behind Carney, and they ran away together—I told the prosecutor, and he went back—I went with a policeman to look for them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my mark—it was read over to me before I signed it—I saw Carney take the handkerchief—I mean the tall one—(<hi rend="italic">pointing to Ayling</hi>)—I saw the tall one take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket and run away down Angel Gardens—the short one ran after him—I never saw the prisoners before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Williams. On the 12th of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and wished to be fitted with a pair of side-laced boots—I fitted her with a pair at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she told me she would give me a half-sovereign to pay for them—after I fitted them on, she told me she had another use for the half-sovereign, and if I would go with her to Mrs. Dinsdale, who had four sovereigns of hers in her hands, she would draw the money—I went there—the landlady said she had nothing of the kind—while I was talking in her, the prisoner got off—I lost sight of her—I came back to the shop—I told my master, and then saw the prisoner going down Fleet-street I went to her and said "Come, pay me for the boots"—she called me ill names that I cannot make use of, for being such a fool as to put a pair of boots on her feet and let her walk off—I called the policeman, and gave her in charge—she had an old pair of shoes on when she came for the boots, which she told me to throw into the street, but I had them laid aside, and gave them to the policeman—I did not intend to part with the property without the money.</p>

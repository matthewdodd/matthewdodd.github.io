On the 17th of June, it rained, and the prisoner stood there to shelter herself - I had taken in the clothes, and desired her to move on, as the door was small; I then went to the next window, and heard my young mistress call out, "Father, she has taken the shawl;" I jumped down off the steps, and took her with this shawl under her arm - I fell down, and she fell at the same time, she had got round to the other door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Had not this woman cheapened the shawl? A. No, nor any thing; I had no words with her, I only told her to move on, because the door was so small - I did not strike her; there is a mark on the shawl.</p>

            . I was out that day, and stood up in consequence of the rain opposite to Mr. Isaacs - I saw the prisoner, who appeared rather the worse for liquor; she ran to Mr. Isaacs, and this witness objected to her coming - I saw her handling a shawl, and could see she was in the act of bargaining for it - when the rain abated, I heard an altercation between her and the man, and I went over; I saw him strike her repeatedly, and (whether over the threshold, or what I can't say, but) she stumbled, and caught the shawl with one of her hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean she never had the shawl in her possession? A. No, she never had - she did not walk away till she was pushed - she had got three hundred yards from the door before she was taken - the shawl was never carried from the prosecutor's house.</p>

            .

               <p>COURT. Q. Was any body standing at the second door of the shop? A. I believe not; I did not see her carry anything to the second door, the shawl was left at the first door, as far as I saw, but I had my eyes on my own goods- I would not swear that she left it at the first door - she did not run, she was too much in liquor - I happened to mention what I saw to a neighbour who knew the prisoner, and I was subpoened.</p>

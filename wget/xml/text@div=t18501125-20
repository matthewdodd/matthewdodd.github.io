                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, B</hi> 1). On the evening of 12th Nov., I was near Eccleston-terrace, South Pimlico. I saw a female leave</p>

               <p>a house about half-past eight o'clock with something under her shawl—I stopped her, and asked what she had got—she said she could not tell, but her sister gave it her at that house—I went to the house, and inquired for Mr. Pearse; he was not at home, but I saw the prisoner, who said to the other woman, "You fool! why did you tell him where you came from?"—I took the woman to the station—she was set at liberty—I found two pounds and three-quarters of mutton in the bundle, and some other things—the prisoner said she bought the meat in Knightsbridge, but she could not tell the shop—it was produced before the Magistrate.</p>

I am in the service of a butcher, in Rochester-row—he serves Mr. Pearse—I was before the Magistrate—I saw a piece of mutton there which I knew—I cut it myself—the prisoner had that mut<lb></lb>ton on the 12th Nov., and on the morning of the 13th she came three times, the first time at half-past six o'clock, then between seven and eight, and then again—she wanted to see my mistress, and she saw her the third time—I did not hear what she said to her—she had ordered this mutton, and it was sent with some more meat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live at No. 2, Eccleston-terrace. The prisoner was my cook, and had been about a fortnight—on the night of 12th Nov., on returning home, I heard a person was taken to the station—I went, and she was liberated—I had some con<lb></lb>versation with the prisoner—she stated that the meat had been bought at Knightsbridge, and the soap, and candles, and other things also—there was some cooked meat there—I said I should not take any notice of that if I found that the uncooked meat was not charged in my butcher's bill—I found it had been charged to me—the prisoner brought another piece of meat, and said it was not mine.</p>

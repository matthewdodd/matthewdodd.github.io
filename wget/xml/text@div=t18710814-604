I keep the Sweedish Flag public-house, Princes Street, St. George's in the East—about 9 o'clock on the morning of 24th July, the prisoner drove up in a cab to my door—I had boarded him before—he said "Have you heard the ship has arrived"—I said "No, she has not been reported"—he said "I have brought my clothes up, here they are, pay the cabman"—I paid the cabman 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had his clothes sent up into a store room kept expressly for men's things—he asked who my tailor was—I said it was immaterial to me, but that Mr. Craig was as good as anybody—about twenty minutes after, Mr. Craig came in, and they recog<lb></lb>nized each other—he went with Craig; afterwards he came back with a bundle of clothes amounting to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Craig showed me the bill—the prisoner had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me five different times, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I paid for the cab, made 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the Wednesday he went down to get paid off, but he did not come back to my house—I lent him the money on the understanding that I had the entire stock of his sea clothing, and when I examined the bag it contained nothing but rubbish—this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the same state as when it was left with me.</p>

               <p>Court. Do not fancy that you come here to entertain me or any body else, you ought rather to be ashamed of yourself; tell your story decently, Sir. - That I know well, I said, says I, I must go down to the necessary says I, and take care of them two bundles which I leave among you.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you leave the two bundles with? - Them two women.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you leave the two bundles with the women that had robbed you of the money? - Yes, they kept me in the necessary for half an hour, for they fastened me in till I was quite saint, at last I heard somebody open the door gently, the people below began to beat and abuse me, and cut a terrible place in my head, it was not well for three weeks; I cannot tell who it was that used me so, I was in such confusion, thinking I had been so weak to go up to these women, I was quite raving mad as it were.</p>
               <p>Court. You was glad to get away? - They drove me out; I never recovered my things again; in about an hour, or an hour and a half afterwar ds I took up the women; a young man picked me up, and came up to me and said, I can tell you where your bundles are and the people, I went to his master who is a Brewer, he said you shall not want for money, here is half a crown; we went to the justices, and in half an hour they brought in three out of these four.</p>

               <p>Then having been robbed of your money, you thought the safest place you could leave your property in, was with the people that had robbed you? - I thought to get the money if I left the things.</p>

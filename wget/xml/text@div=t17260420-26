And While they were standing there (for they would not go in,) the Deceas'd (who was in the Kitchen) came out to the Door, and desired the Prisoner to pay him the Guinea that he ow'd him. The Prisoner call'd him a Bear-Garden Fellow; and said that he ow'd him nothing. Then there was Swearing and Calling Names on both sides, and they all hussled together. Mr. Bourn closed, the Deceas'd. and as the same time the Prisoner stab'd the Decease'd over Mr. Bourn's Shoulder, and then flourish'd his Sword, and cry'd, Stand off. The Decease'd had no Sword at that time, nor did I see him strike the Prisoner at all; Mr. Bourn help'd him into our House, and there he died presently. - I was indeed a little suddled, but I remember very well all that pass'd.

             thus depos'd. The Deceas'd was sitting by the Kitchen Fire when the Prisoner came to the Door. Mrs. Hains (who is Mrs. Cook's Sister) heard his Tongue, and said, there's Mr. Chandler at the Door. The Deceas'd got up and said the owes me a Guinea, I'll go and ask him for it. Pray don't (says Mrs. Cook) - Dear Dick take another opportunity: He answered there's no Time like the present, and so went out. I heard somebody cry, Stand off: I went out and saw the Deceas'd looking at his last Breast; he turn'd pale and died in 4 or 5 Minutes. - The Drawer was very drunk.

             thus depos'd. When the Prisoner came to the Door, the Deceas'd was sitting by the Fire with a Knife in his Hand, but I am not sure whether he laid it down or not, When he ran to the Door. - I heard the Prisoner say, Stand off. - you're a Bear-Garden Fellow, I don't understand Boxing. The Deceas'd call'd him Scoundrel, and ill Words pass'd on both sides. Mrs Cook thus depos'd. - The Deceas'd run our great Passion with a knife in his Hand, and flung the Door so hard after him that he split it: I heard him say to the Prisoner, Sir, You owe me a Guinea. You're a Rascal D - ye, and a Scoundrel and a Black Guard. and so it three parts of your Regiment. The Prisoner said several times, Stand off. I am no Bear-Garden Fighter, though you are. - The Drawer was so drunk that he could not give an Answer. - This Evidence was asked if she did not swear before the Coroner, that the Deceas'd had no Knife when he run out. - She answer'd she was then very much frighted, and might not think of it.

             the Maid depos'd. I was not at the Door at all. - Mrs Bourn came in with the Deceas'd, and perceiving his own Finger to be bloody. See, says he, what I have got by saving his Life. My Mistress said to him, What do ye do here? why don't ye go after your Friend Chandler? He call'd her Bitch and offer'd to Strike her: - What, says she will ye strike a Women with Child? - Mr. Welch the Surgeon thus depos'd. The Wound was Mortal, it penetrated to the Cavity of the Breast near the left Pap, and went strait downward, and not at all obliquely. The Wound was all of a Breadth; and therefore I think it could not be given over another Mans Shoulder: For in Such a Case the Wound would have been wider at the Orifice than it was inwards. Hasting and Mead depos'd that they took the Prisoner the same Night in Long Acre betwixt 12 and 1. That he made no Resistance and that when they brought him to the Deceas'd, he said he was sorry for it. The Prisoner then made his Defence. Mr. Bourn thus depos'd. The Deceas'd demanded a Guinea. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172604200003"></xptr> Prisoner answer'd, I owe you none. Then, says the Deceas'd, I'll have is out of your Bones; and with that he struck at the Prisoner over my Shoulder, and kickt up my Heels; in the Fall I broke the Skin off my Finger. Then, and not before, I saw the Prisoner with his Sword drawn: He retreated in a Posture of Defence, and said to the Deceas'd, Keep off. Bear-Garden! The Deceas'd follow'd him 5 or 6 Yards. The Prisoner still bade him keep off, and drew back as he spoke; but the Deceas'd continued to push forward, though I saw nothing in his Hand, and whether he ran upon the Prisoner's Sword or not, I can't tell. Several Witnesses depos'd to the same Effect. <rs id="t17260420-26-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

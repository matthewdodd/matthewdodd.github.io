I suspected something was wrong. I looked up and down the stable. He went up to give the horses hay, and I examined the stable; and before one of the horses, I saw some straw heaped up; I saw what it was, it was a truss of hay, covered with some straw. I told my master, and went down to the stable again; he was not there, nor at the publick-house; I told my master; he desired me to go down a second time; he was not there. About eleven, I found him in the publick-house; I told him his master wanted him; he refused to come with me. My master sent another servant, and he came. My master asked him for the key of the stable; he said it was at the publick-house; I went there, and they said it was not there. I came down again, and could not make them hear me; upon his hearing me say that the key was not there, he gave the key to my master; and my master gave me the key; and he went down to the stable with me; there we found

               <p>What is Davis? - I cannot say. I did not know him before I saw him sometimes thereabouts. I had seen him in the stables with Battie before. Then Davis said, there was this Martin there, and a boy; we went down again, and the door was bolted. I was obliged to go to get a ladder, and break the window; and we found this Martin and the boy there. The boy's name is

            . We found the boy in a manger, and Martin was standing still. We carried them up to the house. The truss of hay was gone. I have no knowledge of Davis particularly, further than seeing him at the stable, and at the publick-house with Battie.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. How long have you lived with Mr. Whitehead? - I cannot remember the time rightly; about four or five months since I came about his house first.</p>
               <p>You said you knew Davis by sight? - Yes. I had seen him about a fortnight or three weeks. I have met with him at the publick-house, and spoke to the man. I wished him no ill.</p>
               <p>I believe, to your knowledge, before this time, Davis had slept in these stables some nights? - I knew he had slept there: Battie had slept there too.</p>
               <p>You had not acquainted Mr. Whitehead of that? - No.</p>
               <p>I suppose that was not altogether correct? - No; but as he was a poor honest man.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Battie there would be no harm if he would let Davis sleep there? - I never did. He never asked my advice concerning it.</p>
               <p>Was not Davis in the stable at the time you knocked at the door, when Battie said he was afraid it was his master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Davis in the stable the first time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your master's stock of hay was low? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not it customary for coachmen and gentlemen's servants to borrow hay of each other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon this truss of hay came in you do not know? - No.</p>
               <p>- WHITEHEAD sworn.</p>
               <p>My house is in Soho square; my stables behind Falconberg-court. The prisoner, Battie, was my groom; he had the care of my horses. The last witness had the care of my pointers and spaniels. On Saturday, evening, the 10th of January, Battie was brought to me between eleven and twelve; he appeared to me to be a little in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140116"></xptr>liquor; I asked him for the key of the stable.</p>
               <p>Court. Battie being then a little in liquor, I think we cannot hear any thing but facts; we cannot make evidence of what he said; the objection to the confession of a man in liquor, being stronger than one obtained by promises and threats, and for the same reason, that it may not be true? - In consequence of what he said, I went to the stable; he gave the key, having first said he left it at the publick-house. The last witness is mistaken; he told me there was Davis in the stable, who had the key with him in the stable. After my man had been sent to the publick-house, I went with the watchman, and one or two more; we called out in a feigned voice, Jem, open the door; after which the door was gently opened on the inside; we found Davis there, and brought him to my house; when I got him home, I asked him what business he had there; he then said, there were two others in the stable; that one of them was his own son, and begged I would not alarm or hurt the boy, or words to that effect. I got another watchman; and when we got to the stable the second time, we found the door fast, as we imagined in the inside; we called up our next neighbour to borrow a ladder; the watchman, and the other servant broke a pane, and got into the stable; there we found Martin, and young Davis; they were taken to the watch-house; the prisoner, Davis, to all appearance, was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of any promises or threats, to induce him to tell you why he came into the stable? - I did not to any one.</p>
               <p>Did Davis say any thing why he came to that stable? - He made excuses for having come there to assist my men to attend the horses. He made no confession; he denied it. I never suspected Battie of dishonesty before he was found out. I never looked for the hay. I always give my servant a caution never to suffer any person to come into the stables.</p>

            ? - I know Murdock; I remember his coming to the stable to feed the dogs: he could not; get in, at first. I was in the stable; and Charles said, I think that is my master coming. Charles was there, and my father: Martin was not there; he was at the alehouse. Charles said to me, get under the manger. Murdock saw me, when we opened the door.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of a truss of hay that was in the stable when he came to feed the dogs? - There was some hay in the hay-loft; but there was none under the straw, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Then that was the day before you was taken up, that the hay was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know of any of the Saturday evening? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of any corn? - Yes; my father used to carry some out in a bag.</p>
               <p>Do you know where he carried it to? - To Hedge-lane, to a man that keeps a cart; his name is Davis.</p>
               <p>When did he take any corn out? - He took it out (I forget what night it was, now) when Charles sold the truss of hay. My father was there, but Martin was in the publick-house. My father said, stay in the publick-house, do not come in, because my master will turn you away.</p>
               <p>Who took the money? - Charles took the money.</p>
               <p>What was done with the money afterwards? - I do not know; we went in, and had some beer together.</p>
               <p>Did he give any part of the money to any body else? - He gave no money to any body else; he gave my father some beer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say you are fourteen? - I believe I am fourteen.</p>
               <p>When did you first believe that; have you never said that you was only nine or ten years of age? - No, Sir; I have not said that this great while.</p>
               <p>Did not you say so last Saturday? - I told Mr. Whitehead I was fourteen.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, to some other person, that you was only nine or ten? - I did not say that; I am sure I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know a gentleman of the name of Thornton? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>At the Three Tuns, in Oxford-street? - Yes, Sir; his name is Taylor.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Whitfield? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Taylor told you that you had stole a pair of shoes of his? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. If you want to discredit this boy's testimony, you must prove it generally.</p>
               <p>Has not Mr. Taylor, of the Three Tuns, charged you with stealing a pair of shoes? - He said I had done it, but I never did.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Whitfield, did not he say you had stolen a piece of iron of his, and a fowl? - He did say that I stole a fowl in his stable; but I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect a little boy, with an ass, who accused you of stealing his ass, too? - I asked him to come along with me, and I would shew him some buildings: he came after me; and when I saw the workman belonging to the fields, I ran away.</p>
               <p>Was it the brickman, then, that said you stole the ass? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately has this been? - A good while ago.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I knew Davis eight or nine years; he always followed the occupation of a rat-catcher; I never heard any thing against him. His son came to my house last Wednesday evening. I was going to bed. He told me he was destitute of a lodging, and begged me to let him abide at my house till the morning; I told him he might sit by the fire. In the morning, I gave him some breakfast, and dinner; he staid the whole day. He said his father was in trouble; I asked him what for; he said on suspicion of stealing some hay and corn out of a gentleman's stables in Soho Square, and that he was taken up too. He said, the gentleman took me to his house, and locked me up in a room, and told me I should be hanged, if I did not tell concerning what became of the day and his corn; says he, I did not know what became of it, but they told me it was sold to a <rs id="t17890114-82-viclabel442" type="occupation">coachman</rs>, in St. Giles's, one Mr. Pierrepont. I was afraid of keeping him in my place, so I sent him to my brother; and a gentleman took him to Mr. Whitehead. I remember the boy when he was in his mother's arms; I do not look upon him to be more than ten or eleven, though he told me, when he was going to the magistrate, the gentleman told him to say he was fourteen.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you knew him? - Ten or eleven years.</p>
               <p>Did you know him above eight years? - Yes; he was a little child in petticoats. I first knew him on Saffron-hill; I remember him about eight years.</p>
               <p>He was two or three when you first knew him? - He might be.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when you first knew him? - It was since the time of the riots<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140119"></xptr>in L; it might be two or three years since.</p>
               <p>How many years is it since the riots? - About eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>Jury to M'Millan. What way is the hay brought down to the horses in general? - It is put down from the loft to the rack.</p>
               <p>Not put down in trusses? - No.</p>
               <p>Whether, when you looked about the stable, you found the boy concealed? - No, I did not.</p>

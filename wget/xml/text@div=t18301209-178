On Monday, the 29th of November, at three o'clock, I saw the prisoner near my shop, with a basket in her hand- I asked her what she had taken from my stall, as I had received information; I took her by the arm - she said,"For God's sake take it, and say nothing at all about it;" I took the basket from her, and found a piece of pork and a piece of cheese; the officer came and took her - I know the cheese to be mine, by the cut and quality; I had it on a board outside the window - I had seen it about five minutes before; I believe the pork to be mine, but cannot swear to it - I lost a piece like it, which was safe about ten minutes before.</p>

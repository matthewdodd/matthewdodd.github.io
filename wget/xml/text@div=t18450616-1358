                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, in Birchin-lane. About the 22nd of May, Mr. William Henry Dickinson called on me, to ask me to take charge of a bill for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which had been dis<lb></lb>honoured, and to take the money if the person called—the prisoner afterwards called, aboat six o'clock, and asked if I had a bill of 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he did not say whose bill—he had some notes in his hand, and said, "I will pay the money"—I went to a little drawer, where I had put the bill, and got it out—the prisoner was preparing the notes, I thought—he said, "26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. how much?"—I said, "26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when he snatched the bill out of my hand—I, by a bit of good fortune, seized the hand which had the bill, and called my neighbour, who detained the prisoner till the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant. I left this bill with Mr. Percival—it was brought to me some time after the drawing for discount, by a person of the name of Levins, to whom I gave 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I left it with Mr. Percival, as I had no clerk, and, having given notice to the drawer and acceptor, I thought they might call on me when no one was in the way—I knew it would he safe with Mr. Percival.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who is Mr. Levins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe principally an agent for discounting bills—I made inquiry about this bill—the prisoner defied me to say that I made inquiry of him; but I went to the house, knocked at the door, and a person came and said whom did I want—I said, "James Scott"—he said his name was Scott—The prisoner offered me the money for the bill in the Lord Mayor's Court—I am a wine-merchant, and, live at No. 65, Old Broad-street—I have no warehouse there—my name is not on the door—what little wines I have are in the Docks—I showed wine warrants to the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not know that that was all I have—I trust I hold the respectable station of a tradesman in London—the amount of my stock is perhaps about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I have been known in the City for twenty years—I know no more of Mr. Levins than as agent for the discounting of bills—I have certainly known him these two years—I have not been the medium through which he has discounted—I do not know whether I have done any for him—I think I have—I have perhaps discounted 400 or 500 in a year on agency, not what are called accommo<lb></lb>dation bills—I had nothing to do with the meeting of this bill—I did not put my name on it—I did not pass it—Levins lives in Amelia-street, Walworth—I saw him yesterday, and asked him to be here—I did not serve him with a subpœna—it was four o'clock in the afternoon when I saw him.</p>

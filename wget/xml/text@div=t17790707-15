               <p>I did not observe at first what it was because it was covered with a coarse cloth; I followed him to Bloomsbury-market; there he took the cloth off it and I discovered it was lead. He took it up again and carried it along. I said to him, How came you by that lead? he said I had no right to ask him for it was his own lead. I said I could find a better owner for it than he was, and took him into custody. When he was in custody, Mr. Watkins, Mr. Nash's foreman came and claimed the lead as belonging to Mr. Nash. It was a whole piece of lead. I took the dimensions, and found it answered in point of measure; then I desired it might be more certified as to its being the lead coming off that house; I took it up to the house and compared it with the nail-holes where it was fastened, and it exactly corresponded with those holes.</p>

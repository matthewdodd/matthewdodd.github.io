My Lord, I can only say that I was robbed, and I can swear to my goods, which I had from the man in whose house I was robbed; and they owned all before the Justice of the Peace. The buckles were in my shoes, the ring upon my finger, the cap was on my head, and my apron was on.</p>

               <p>Pris. Hutchinson. It is a night-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house was this done in?</p>
               <p>Sands. In a little room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there to drink?</p>
               <p>Sands. It was late, and I could not get in at home, and I wanted to pass a little time away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you went there?</p>
               <p>Sands. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you disordered in liquor then?</p>
               <p>Sands. I was not as I should be; and these good women came in, and made a property of me. I had these things when I went in, and when I walked I had not them; but who took them I don't know. When they came to sell the buckles and the ring, they quarrelled about sharing the money, and so the thing was discovered; and they said before the Justice, that Peg took the apron, and that Jane sold the buckles.</p>

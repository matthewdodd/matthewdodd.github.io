                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and reside at 10, Finsbury-circus, in the parish of St. Stephen, Coleman-street. My house was entered on the night of 23rd Sept, or the morning of the 24th—it was closed between half-post eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I came down in the morning, about a quarter to seven, and found great confusion—my servants were up—I found the house had been entered by the back area window, and nearly all the plate in daily use was gone from the butler's pantry, a silver teapot, spoons, forks, ladles, and things of that kind, worth altogether about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this butter-knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of the property that was lost on that occasion—my initials are on it—none of my servants are here.</p>

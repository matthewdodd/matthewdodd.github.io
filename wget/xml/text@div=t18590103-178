                  </hi>. I keep the Hampshire Hog public-house, at Ham<lb></lb>mersmith. On 27th November, the prisoner was in my bar between 9 and 10 o'clock at night, with two or three others—the prisoner called for a quartern of gin, and tendered in payment a half-crown—I put it in a drawer where I had no other half-crowns—the gin came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him change—they drank the gin, and went out immediately—I then went to the till—I looked at the half-crown—there were two shillings there, but no other half-crown—I had not put any other half-crown in—I found it was bad, and put it away in a desk. On 11th December, the prisoner came again, with another lad—when he came in, my sister called my attention to the prisoner, and I watched to see what he did—he called for half a quartern of gin—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered a shilling—he put it down, and my sister gave it to me—I put it in my teeth, and found it was bad—I told the prisoner it was bad, and he said he did not know it; he took it at the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness. On 20th November, the prisoner was in our house with a young lad, whom I had not seen before—they called for half-a-quartern of gin—the prisoner paid me a shilling—I put it in my teeth, and found it was bad—I returned it to him, and the other gave me a good shilling. On 11th December, the prisoner came with a short young man—the prisoner called for half-a-quartern of gin—he gave me in payment a shilling—I noticed that it was bad, and told him so—I gave it to my sister—the prisoner offered me another shilling, which was good.</p>

I did not hear that; they returned with the first load, and called as they came back with the second load; about half an hour after I see a black sack in my premises, unknown to me.</p>

I watered their horses and gave them hay; when they came out again they gave me a penny for my trouble, which is my wages; Horton and Thomas Mann set off with the waggon; and William Mann after a few steps, returned to me and called me by my name, and asked me if I would ask my master if he would take a sack or a couple of sacks? I asked my master, and he said, no, by no means, he would have nothing to do with it. They returned from Enfield Downs, and coming back again they asked me what my master said(this was when they returned with the empty waggon) I told him he said, no; he said, he was very glad of it, he had got a better customer, or something of that. They watered their horses, and they went away again; and they afterwards returned; but in the mean time there was a post chaise came up, or a couple, and I was feeding their horses; I let off to take their horses into the stable down the yard, while I was gone they had pretty well done, and

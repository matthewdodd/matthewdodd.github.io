Not to my recollection; I might have done so - there was eleven yards, or eleven yards and a half done of it on the Thursday when he was taken - it certainly was necessary that he should have quills wound to do this work with, but he should not have taken them to wind at home - there is a person at my house who does that - he could not have had to wait more than one minute in the morning to have his quills wound - when we give out silk to work we weigh it, and we weigh the work when done, to see if it corresponds in weight, but I could not have ascertained that, when the twenty-five yards were brought in; not till the whole cane was done.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the twenty-five yards of silk was done, would not the weight of that make up the weight you gave? A. No, because part of the cane would be still in the loom; we could not ascertain the weight till all was finished.</p>

            . I live in Fort-street. I work for the prosecutor - on the morning in question I went down stairs, and saw the foreman weigh out eight bobbins, and put them into a basket up stairs, where he always keeps them - there were three more there - the prisoner took them up, and he went out soon after - I then went into the room, and saw but seven bobbins in the basket; the prisoner returned, and went to work - when he went home at night there were still but seven bobbins there, and the next morning I saw the foreman weighing some white shute.</p>

             (police-constable H 27.) I took the prisoner, and found these four bobbins of silk between his shirt and his skin, under his arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you take him? A. In Spicer-street, Spitalfields - I believe his master sent him out on an errand; I asked him if he knew the prosecutor, he said yes; his master then came up, and asked if he had any of his property, he said he had not; I felt his pockets, there was nothing there - I then found these bobbins, he cried, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>MR. WALKER. I did not send him out before the regular course of work was concluded, I told him to go when he had done his work - he did not tell me he intended to work till dark - I only sent him to one place - he paid 2s. 6d. a week for his loom standing in my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On that Thursday he asked me if I would complete him twenty-five yards of work to go into the country, and to go down and take the silk to finish it, I said I had enough, he said I had better take some more, and he gave it to me - at seven o'clock he asked me to go to two places, and one was for some work to go home at the same time with mine; and as I would not disappoint him of the order, I put the four bobbins into my bosom to wind the quills at home.</p>

            . I am uncle of the prisoner, I keep a shop on Peter's-hill, Doctor's-commons. The prisoner has been an honest, hard working lad - I am a silk weaver; it is usual for masters to weigh silk when they give it out, and when it comes back, if it don't correspond, they stop the wages for it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALKER re-examined. Q. Was it your practice with this man to weigh the silk when it was given out, and when it was brought in manufactured? A. Yes, we keep a regular debtor and creditor account in the book - I should at the end of the work have discovered that this was deficient - this work was silk and cotton.</p>

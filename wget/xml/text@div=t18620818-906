I am a carpenter living near Plaistow Marsh—on the night of 22d July, about 11 o'clock, I went, in company with a son of the prosecutor, to the premises, to look around and see if all was right—there is a gateway by the side of the house at the back—I saw a man standing there—I saw him move his elbow, as though giving a signal, which raised my suspicion that something was wrong—I went for a policeman, leaving the prosecutor's son on the premises—I met a policeman just outside, and he went with me to the back part of the premises—I got on the fence there and saw several men about—the policeman got over the paling at the bottom—I stayed by the premises—the policeman had a struggle with a man down below, not on the premises—I went and met three dock constables, and they came back with me.</p>

               <p>others ran away—the prisoner called out, "You b—cowards, knife the b—," after we had been struggling some time a man came back across the marsh and struck the prisoner on the head with something—it was dark—the prisoner was a-top and I was underneath—when I looked for the man he was gone—Sumner had in the meantime gone for assistance—after I recovered myself I got the prisoner at the bottom, and struck him with my staff on the head—I never let him go—Sumner then came up with assistance, and the prisoner was secured—we found five more rolls of cloth, fourteen coats, twelve fancy shirts, and one waistcoat piece, lying in the marsh—I showed the whole of that to Mr. Lecocq next day—I afterwards examined the pre<lb></lb>mises—I found that the first floor window had been broken and raised up, and a hole cut through the shutter of the back window, and the window raised up so that persons could get in—I found the dog with his throat cut, and dead—the shop was in confusion—the son showed me the shelf where the things had been taken from—the house is in the parish of West Ham.</p>

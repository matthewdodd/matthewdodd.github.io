                  </hi>. I am a pork butcher, and live at No. 6, Queen-street, Pimlico. On Sunday evening, the 9th of June, about half-past nine or a quarter to ten o'clock, I was opposite my shop, and saw the prisoner and another go against Mr. Hartley's door, which is next to mine, and is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square—Bryant knocked at Mr. Hartley's door twice, and put his ear down to listen both times—I thought they were friends of Mr. Hartley, and did not take any particular notice of them at the time—I then saw Bryant lay hold of the handle, and put his other hand down, as if trying the door, to see if it would open—that occupied about two minutes—they all three then walked away together—in about two minutes the two pri<lb></lb>soners came back—Bryant took hold of the handle of the door, and opened it, he put Johnson in, and followed in himself, and shut the door after him—I said something to a person I was talking to, and went over with him, and knocked at Mr. Hartley's door—I told him to stand at the private door, and I would stand at the shop door—I knocked twice, the last time very loud—receiving no answer, I went to the private door, and knocked there—the lodgers came down—I spoke to them—they knocked at the parlour door, and said Mr. Hartley was not at home—I then stood between Hartley's shop door and my own, and had not been there two minutes before I saw the prisoners coming along my passage—they had climbed the wall between Mr. Hartley's passage and mine—I asked what business they had in that shop—Bryant said he had been to make water—I told him a grocer's shop was a <hi rend="italic">devilish rum</hi> place, he had been there for some other purpose—he said, "Me, me, Sir, me?"—I said, "You"—I called another man, and told him to lay hold of that boy—I went to lay hold of Bryant—he ran away—I ran after him and brought him back, called a policeman, and gave him into custody—I afterwards came back with the police to Mr. Hartley's premises, and there saw a towel, a plate, and fork, lying on the ground—there are some rabbit-hutches in that part of the yard where they had got over, and they were broken down fresh, and two bricks on the wall had been partially removed—the top of the wall is protected by a piece of wood going across—I am sure the two persons I saw come out of my passage are the two persons that had entered the prosecutor's</p>

On Sunday afternoon, about two o'clock, I went out—I fastened the parlour window and the door leading into the pas<lb></lb>sage—I went out at the shop door, locked it after me and took the key with me—I returned a little after ten at night, put my key in the door, but found it had been unlocked, still I could not enter, it having been bolted at the top—I found my passage full of people who told me what had happened—I went into the yard and found the parlour window thrown open to the top—I saw a plate, towel, and fork in the yard—I had left them on a sideboard close to the window, inside—I found a box of safety lights on the counter—they were not mine—there was no crow-bar in the premises belonging to me.</p>

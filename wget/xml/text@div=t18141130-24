               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch with a watch ribbon, key, and two silver tea spoons from your chambers - A. I did on the 10th of October, in the morning; I perceived the loss about eleven o'clock in the the morning; about ten o'clock in the morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300014"></xptr>opened my street door, it being a fine morning: I left both outer door and inner door open; I left my watch on the breakfast table, and two silver teaspoons; my chambers consist of a front and back room on the same floor, the kitchen is below. I retired for something less than a minute to the back room; I remained in the back room but a short time; I perceived by the sun that came into the passage, the shadow of two persons that lottered in the chamber, or at the door; I came to see what they wanted, and found the two prisoners in the passage, within the chamber; that is, I found Leary, and the other I will not positively swear to the face of the other; I found two persons, of which Leary, the younger, is one of them; I detained Leary; the other made off. I asked Leary what business he had there; he gave me an answer, that he wanted Mrs. Jones, or some such person, whose name is printed on the top of my chamber. The precipitation which one had ran off, I thought it was not right; I looked on the table; the watch, and tea-spoons were gone; I immediately called after Leary, who was making after his companion, he was going towards the gateway, the gateway into Middle Temple-lane, where his companion was waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, you were less than a minute in your back room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible that any other person should come and take these, unless they were companions of this party - A. Impossible; the room was very small. I was gone scarcely half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us that two or three boys were waiting in Middle Temple-lane; can you be certain that the other prisoner was one of these boys waiting - A. I cannot positively swear to his face; his height and appearance exactly answers to the description of the boy. He was taking before the sitting magistrate at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Leary searched in your presence - A. Not in my presence; nothing was found upon him whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your watch and tea-spoons since - A. I have found part of the property; he was detained five days; I was not able to get sufficient evidence of the property, and the property not being found, Leary was discharged. About a fortnight afterwards he was taken up upon some other occasion; his youth and humane interposition got him a place in the philanthropic reform, where I heard he made a confession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any person in your hearing, tell him it would be better for him to disclose who were his accomplices - A. The confession was voluntary on his part, I heard no promise of favour, or threat of punishment. I heard by accident that he was in this society; I called; he confessed that he, and one Harry, in company with two boys, called Jack Hill and Mackey, had been that morning on a party of plunder; that he and Harry had entered the chambers, my chambers; that he had waited in the passage while Harry went and took the property. He charged the lad Harry, that Harry told him in going out, that he had taken a thimble, meaning a watch; Leary explained it as a cant word, meaning a watch, and after he had been discharged on my account, he had received one pound seven shillings and sixpence of one Kelly as part of the plunder, as part of the produce of the watch and spoons; he mentioned the spoons, and having been disposed of to Kelly for one shilling each.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where this Kelly lived - A. He keeps a public-house in Rose-street, near St. Martin's-lane, and on the evening of the day, on which he had been discharged, he, Kelly, had shewn him this same watch which he had not before seen, and said, this is the watch I bought of Harry for five guineas; Leary gave me a description of the watch, which was a peculiar watch which answered to my watch; it was a very peculiar watch indeed, he described my watch accurately; he stated moreover, that the chain had been concealed by Mackey, by one of the four, under the floor of a certain coffee shop in the Seven Dials, a steal chain covered with ribbon my watch had; he had concealed it through a hole in the floor, and that this Harry was in the habit of wearing the ribbon and the key of my watch. I was anxious to ascertain the truth of this story, and to bring the receiver to Justice. I asked him if he could lead me where it was likely to find the other parties, and assist me to find out this Kelly; for that purpose I took him out of this society by the leave of this society; he was in the reform part of the institution; he went with me to Bow-street; we went to the coffee shop, where we found the ribbon as described; we found the chain exactly where he had described it to me; he was with us at the time; it was under the floor as he had described. We next proceeded after Harry; he took us to his place of residence, he was not there; he took us to his mother. This Harry was recognised by Leary, and at last we found the person that he called Harry by the mother in Clerkenwell prison; Harry is the boy now charged in the name of

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Tuesday, the 7th of March, I saw the prisoner go into a pewterer's shop with a bag under his arm, about eleven o'clock; I went in after him - he turned round and came out again; I asked a little girl if he worked for them - she said No - I pursued and brought him back - I then took out these pieces of pipe and asked where he got them - he said from a drain he was cleaning somewhere near at hand - I found he had been at work at Mr. Sweetman's - I fitted this pipe to the place and it matched exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked for Thomas Higgins, the bricklayer - he told me to take these things to the shop, and he would call for the money - he is now in prison, but they have made the affair up I suppose.</p>

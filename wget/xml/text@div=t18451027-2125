                  </hi>. I live in Regent-street, and am a hair-dresser, About two o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of Oct., I was coming home—I met the prisoner—she induced me to see her home, and I went to sleep.—I awoke about eight in the morning—my watch was in my pocket then—the prisoner asked me to have a glass of gin; and I saw her put something stealthily into it—I took it, and felt very ill—I laid down till about twelve—she took me to Tothill-street, and said she would see me home—I then had another glass of gin, and she persuaded me to go and lie down—I laid down from two till half-past four—I then found my watch was gone—I had put it into my coat pocket—when I awoke I accused the prisoner of it—she said I never had a watch—I called a policeman—she told him I never had a watch, but said, in going to the station, that if he would let her go she would tell him where the watch was gone; that she had sent it to Williams', in Tothill-street.</p>

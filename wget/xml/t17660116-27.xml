I had given her warning to quit my service the 30th of this month, but she ran away on the 10th. From that time I suspected she had done something very bad, because she had left a quarter's wages in my hands. I sat up that night till 2 o'clock, expecting she would return; she did not. The next morning I looked over my things. I missed four silver spoons, a small silver candlestick, two pair of sheets, some napkins, a table cloth, a crape gown of my mother's, and five or six of my shirts, almost new. I had been particular with regard to my shirts, in taking an account of them but a little before. Upon this, I went to Sir

               <p>I had no intention of a defraud. My master required me to lay out my money for the support of his family, and I was unwilling to let him know my circumstances; and through this way I have involved myself, by changing one thing for another, carrying one thing to the pawnbroker's to fetch another out that was wanted. My wages was seven guineas a year. I desired my master to lend me six guineas to get them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160026"></xptr> again, and I would serve him a year for it, and told him that a quarter's wages should lie in his hands for security till the whole was made up. My master was so kind as to advance this money for me at three different payments. I had first two guineas, and about a month after that I had two guineas more, and some time in November I had another guinea, and the last was 15 s. and I released the things that I had in pledge. After that I told my master, if he would do as other masters had done, to let me have a guinea every Saturday night, then I could go on.</p>

On the morning of the 29th of March I came down stairs early- I am the first person who is down in the morning, and always light the tap-room fire, as I have to provide early breakfast - I found the tap-room window open at twenty minutes before four o'clock - it was quite dark at that time - I could not by the light of day discern the features of a man - the tap-room window was wide open - it is eight or ten feet high from the ground, or it may be more - I then went into the bar, to the till - the till was left with about twenty farthings in it; and at a quarter past eleven o'clock the night before, when I went to bed, I saw 15s. or 16s. in copper money in it - Ann King was up last - the house was all fastened up at that time - the door the windows were closed - the prisoner had lived with me as servant, about a year and a quarter ago, in the same house - after leaving the bar, I found the back door open - it was unbolted - it was bolted at a quarter after eleven o'clock at night - the house appeared to have been entered at the tap-room window - I went to the Crown, St. Dunstan's-passage, in two or three hours, after hearing that the prisoner was there, and found him there - I looked through the door - I saw him sitting in the tap-room, drinking rum and milk - he was searched in my presence, and a watch found on him which has been claimed by my bar-maid, Ann King, and on the tap-room table, there was between 6s. and 7s. in copper, and some farthings.</p>
               <p>ANN KING. I am <rs id="t18340410-1-viclabel5" type="occupation">bar-maid</rs>

I was up last on the 28th of March - I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock - I went round and saw the doors fast, and the window was shut down - I did not examine to see if it was fast - I was at the till last - there was about 15s. or 16s. in copper, and a great many farthings among it - I had a metal watch which I left on the bar mantel-pieces - I do not know what it was worth - the window which was found open was shut overnight, as usual - I have since seen my watch in possession of Charlton, the officer - (looking at it) - I know this to be mine.</p>

               <persName id="t18340410-1-person111">MR. PAYNE</persName>
            . Q. How do you know it? A. I am quite sure of it; I have had it in my possession a long time; the maker's name is Wicks - I saw it that night after the doors were fast - I left it on the mantelpiece; and I saw it there - I myself did not fasten the back door, but I held the lad a light, and saw him fasten it - the tap-room window is about ten feet from the ground - it opens into a court.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bottom of it ten feet from the ground? A. Yes, where it slips down - the prisoner lived with Mr. Howard, since I have been there, for four or five months - I never saw anything wrong in him - I have not opened the watch since the officer had it - I knew the maker's name, before the officer produced it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Billingsgate ward - I apprehended the prisoner about nine o'clock in the morning of the 29th of March, at the Crown public-house, sitting before the tap-room fire - a parcel of coppers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100004"></xptr>were before him in this dirty cloth, which laid on the table - here is 6s. 9 1/2d. in copper - I found the watch, which I have produced, in his right hand trowsers' pocket, and twenty-four farthings in the same pocket; and he gave me 4s. 6d. in silver from one of his pockets - he did not account for the possession of the property - he would not own to the coppers; and when I said I wanted the watch as well, he said he had not got it; but I searched and found it on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he knew nothing about the half-pence? A. Not the half-pence on the table - there was no other person in the room when I went in - he was sitting at the table before the fire - it was about nine o'clock in the morning - he had some rum and milk in a glass - the Crown is very near the prosecutor's - it is only a short street, and a few yards to the left from it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a public-house is the Crown? A. I never heard anything about it - they do a good deal of business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday morning, the 29th of March, I was at Billingsgate Market - I put down my basket, and went to the water-closet which is for the public at the back of Mr. Howard's house, and on opening the door, I saw a watch and bundle lying on the seat - I stopped a quarter of an hour, thinking somebody had gone away in a hurry and forgot it - as nobody came, I took the watch up and put it in my fob-pocket - I looked at the bundle, and found it contained money - I saw it was halfpence - I took it in my hand, after waiting a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, as nobody came - I came down the passage, passed Mr. Howard's house, and took the bundle in my hand - I would not go to work any more that morning, thinking I might lose the watch, or get it broken - I went to the Crown to wait till the busy time of the market was over, thinking I might then hear who had lost anything. I called for some coffee - they had none, and I called for ale - I sat down and blew the fire by desire of the young woman, and then had some milk and rum - I sat there until eight o'clock - a milkman came - I told him if he would find milk, I would find rum - he said it was too soon to drink, and he left me; and it appears he went down to Mr. Howard, and told him I was drinking there, and offering to treat everybody who came in - in about half an hour Charlton and Howard came in and took me, with the watch in my pocket, and the halfpence on the table - he asked if the half-pence belonged to me - I said "No" - he took 4s. 6d. and a knife from me, and some farthings - they took me to the Mansion-house - Howard said it was a gold watch - the Lord Mayor examined it, and found it to be a metal one - I never heard anything about his being robbed, or I should have taken it to him.</p>
               <p>ANN KING re-examined. I do not think the prisoner ever saw the watch while he lived there - I had it at that time, and was in the habit of using it but very seldom - I brought it down on Good Friday to wind it up - I had not used it for a long time before.</p>
               <p>MR. HOWARD. He lived with me the last time about three months, and before that he lived with me about six months - I think his conduct was good the first time - there is a public privy at the Anchor, near me, for the benefit of the market - the Anchor was my house about twelve months ago - the prisoner has no father - his mother has been supporting him; not he supporting her - I am quite sure it was dark when I came down - I always come down at that time and light the gas - I am certain it was not light - I went to the door, and it was dark - it was not light enough to see the features of a man, I should say; but I did not take particular notice, being flurried - I am sure it was exactly twenty minutes to four o'clock - I can swear to that - I looked at the clock in the bar.(Robert Norman, the prisoner's uncle, gave him a good character.)</p>

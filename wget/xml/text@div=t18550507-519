On 30th April, about 1 o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoners together in Lombard-street, and watched them upwards of half an hour—they were following gentlemen up and down Lombard-street—on two occasions Green felt the pockets of gentlemen who were passing—they went behind a gentleman who was at Spielman's, the bullion merchant's window—Green pulled open the gentleman's pocket with the two fore fingers of his right hand, and they both looked into it—from there I followed them to Walbrook, then to Charlotte-row, where Green took three handkerchiefs out, examined them, and handed them to Murray, who also examined them, and returned them to Green, who put them into his trowsers pocket, and went up the Poultry—I followed them, and saw them follow the prosecutor in Cheapside—Green put his hand into his; pocket, and took out this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Murray was by his side—(I was on the same side of the street)—Green put it into his trowsers pocket, turned round, and walked quickly away, accompanied by Murray, in the opposite direction to which they were walking when they picked the pocket—they had turned round to follow the prosecutor—I followed them to St. Paul's Churchyard, obtained assistance, and took them into custody—the prosecutor went on—I pointed him out to a policeman, who made a mistake in the person—I took the prisoners to the station, searched them, and found on Green these four handkerchiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> that afternoon, and the gentleman is here now—he is the parson whose pocket I saw picked.</p>

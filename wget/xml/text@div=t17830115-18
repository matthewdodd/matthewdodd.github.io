               <p>Court. Did he go without his shoe? - I gave him an old slipper of mine, and he was to call again: at the end of the compter, where he stood to try on the breeches, there was a pile of goods, and some mourning, and other goods; about an hour and a half after he was gone, I went to take the suit of mourning home, and I found that the waistcoat and breeches had been drawn out: I said to my man, while this man has been amusing you to look for his shoe, he has stole this waistcoat and breeches; I sent him round to the pawnbrokers, and in the Minories; the same evening, we found the waistcoat and breeches were pawned by two men for 14 s. I gave the 14 s. and took them away as my property; I told the pawnbroker to send for me if the two men came again. On the 4th of this month, on Saturday in the evening, he sent me word the two men were in the shop that pawned the waistcoat and breeches, I went, and saw they were the same men that were in my shop when they were lost: I am sure of that now.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoners seem to have any knowledge of each other while they were in the shop? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did they go out together? - No, Wells went out first.</p>
               <p>Did you charge them with it when you saw them at the pawnbrokers? - I charged the peace officer with them, and took them up, they did not say any thing: the waistcoat and breeches are in court; they have been in possession of the gentleman they were made for; he is not here, but I know they are the same, because they were all dirty, for the prisoner Foy shifted them into his pocket with his shoe.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you know them by? - I know them because they are muddy.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Wells. Do not be too sure Sir, mind you are upon your oath. - I think it was the other prisoner, but I am not quite sure; he stood behind and it was rather dark; I think it was him, he stood behind in the dark; the shade of one man, makes the other not so plain to be seen at candle light.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Should you know the things again if you saw them? - I took particular notice of the breeches when I delivered them, by a round spot of dirt; and the lining of the waistcoat is dirted, as having dropped, (looks at them,) here is a round spot; they are the same; I know the breeches more particularly than the waistcoat; I did not take such particular notice of the waistcoat: the same evening Mr. Ubley came and redeemed them: Foy said he had just bought them.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. You expected to be here as a witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And therefore put no mark on the things? Yes, there was the mark of mud.</p>
               <p>You never saw any mud on breeches before? - Yes, but this is a particular round spot.</p>
               <p>You are often a witness in courts of justice? - Not often.</p>
               <p>Once in a sessions; you will know better then for the future. - I never wish to know what will effect the lives of men, more than the truth.</p>
               <p>You did not know these men before? - No.</p>
               <p>How long were they in the shop? - Not ten minutes; their were other people in the shop; if you have ever been in a pawnbroker's shop, there are little closets like.</p>
               <p>No I never was. - Every man has his box, or it will hold two, I believe it would hold three.</p>
               <p>It will not hold two in front, I suppose? One man in front, and a little side view behind.</p>
               <p>Now, this business was not long with him? - Not a great while.</p>
               <p>You looked at them, and saw they were new; how much were they worth? - I do not know how much they were worth.</p>
               <p>Yes, you must? - I knew they were worth 14 s. I asked them their names, and where they lived.</p>
               <p>Then the only opportunity you had of seeing these men, was in this little snug<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150031"></xptr> box, and one behind the other? - I had no other opportunity.</p>
               <p>Court to Ubley. Do you know the persons of both the prisoners? - I know they are the same men that were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Wells, to make you take particular notice of him? He stood near the door, I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>Are you positive as to his person? are you positive they are the same two men? - I found these two men at the pawnbroker's, these are the same men that I saw there; I am sure Wells is the same man.</p>
               <p>Court to Rookes. Do you know the person of Wells, in particular? - Yes, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Your attention was taken up with Foy? I had attention on both, as I was dealing with both.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wells's Council. Do you take notice so much of every man that comes to your shop, so as to swear to him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What, do you mean to tell the jury that you take such particular notice of every man that comes into your shop? - I know the prisoners by their features.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing remarkable in that man's features? - I know them to be the same persons that were in the shop.</p>
               <p>How long had you conversation with them now? - They might be in the shop two minutes.</p>
               <p>And never saw the men before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>And these two men never spoke to each other? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor took the least notice? - No.</p>
               <p>Who has told you to be positive now? No one has told me to be positive, I need not that caution.</p>
               <p>There was nothing to fix your attention? Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Had he his hat on or what? - Both their hats on.</p>
               <p>Hats taken off? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light? - Yes, Sir, it was daylight.</p>

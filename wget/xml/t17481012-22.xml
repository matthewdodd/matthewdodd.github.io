               <p>Q. Have you lost any thing?</p>
               <p>Millward. I have lost a great many things at different times; but in particular, I lost seven pair of shoes, seven pair of soles, and half a guinea, which was taken off a cup, which stood upon a beaureau in my kitchen. The last of the things I lost was on the Sunday before Bartholomew day.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner with any of these things?</p>
               <p>Millward. Only by the confession of a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Millward . On the 11th of Sept. and carried him before a justice, and he owned he had half a guinea from the boy, and that it was a bad one, for it was but a nine shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner work'd for you?</p>
               <p>Millward. About four years, or three years and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any thing upon the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Millward. I have lost a great many things; but I never found any thing upon him.</p>
               <p>Pris. Did you ever hear any thing of a dishonest character of me, while I work'd with you?</p>
               <p>Millward. No; I never heard any thing of dishonesty in you, only keeping loose women company.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his stealing any shoes ?</p>
               <p>Deaton. Yes; seven pair of shoes, and about six or eight pair of soles.</p>
               <p>Q. What you stole them, and gave them to him?</p>
               <p>Deaton. Yes. I took them before my master came down, and gave them to him, and he went and sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were the soles taken?</p>
               <p>Deaton. He had five pair the Sunday before Bartholomew day; and he always advised me when I took any money, not to take less than sixpence, for if I took a penny or two pence, they would miss it the sooner.</p>
               <p>Harp Michael. The prisoner said he had taken half a guinea out of a cup, and had disposed of it for sixpence.</p>

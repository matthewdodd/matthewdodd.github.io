                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Royal Oak, Wapping-lane—about December, 1847, or the beginning of 1848, the prisoner was living six or seven doors off me—I knew him for a very short time—he used to come in and out of my place when he was at home—at one time he came to me, said he had got a ship, and asked me if I could cash his notes—I said I had no objection—he produced these two notes—this is his writing on the back of this one—I have had them in my possession ever since [<hi rend="italic">These being read were seamens' advanced notes, one for</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable three days after the sailing of the ship</hi>, Caroline Augusta. <hi rend="italic">from Gravesend, to Thomas Burns; and the other for</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable to James Britton</hi>]—I saw the prisoner write this at my counter—I advanced him 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "This appears a very ugly advance;" and he said, "It is all right, Thomas Burns is going to be chief mate"—Burns was not there—the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was payable to him—it is a common thing for sailors to get advances on these notes—about five minutes afterwards I was going out to Limehouse, and was passing the prisoner's door—Heand his wife were in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I never saw any more of them till now—I cannot say whether there was any man with them—the notes have never been paid, although I presented them duly at the American Consul's—I named the matter to the police, in consequence of which the prisoner was taken—he said he was very sorry, he did not wish to cheat me, his uncle and he were coming down to pay me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On the night of 2nd March, I apprehended the prisoner at No. 2. Juniper-row, Shadwell—Mr. Carr was with me, and gave him into custody—he said, "I give this man into custody for receiving 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from me on two forged orders"—the prisoner said he was very sorry, for he had never had a day's luck ever since he received the money, and he intended, when he got money, to repay him—I produce this letter, which Mr. Carr gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outfitter—in 1847, I was ship's husband to <hi rend="italic">the Caroline Augusta of Salem</hi>, bound to Penang—the captain sent all the crew to my place to take their advances, and I paid the whole crew—the prisoner was not one of them to my knowledge—I do not know whether Thomas Bird was one of the crew—no advance notes were made out for the ship—they are sometimes made out for American ships, but were not in this instance—the advance I paid was two months—I know that no advance notes were made out, because I had an order from the captain to pay all the men, and I did so—it was not in writing—they were paid at my place in ready money—there were twelve men—I know the <hi rend="italic">Caroline Augusta.</hi> and had frequently been on board of her while—she was preparing for that voyage—I think the complement of men was twelve, and I think I paid twelve—I know something of ships—American ships do not carry quite so many men as English ships—the men had signed articles at the American Consul's—the ship was 600 tons burden, but American ships carry about half the number of hands that other vessels do—they pay more wages.</p>

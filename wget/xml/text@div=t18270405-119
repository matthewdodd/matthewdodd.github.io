            . I live in Myddleton-ter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050063"></xptr>race, Pentonville. On the evening of the 8th of March I was passing Amwell-terrace - I saw a horse and cart there - the prisoner and another man were moving some stones; and while I spoke to the prisoner, the other man got away - I did not lose sight of the prisoner. I did not see them put the stones into the cart - but when I got up there were six or seven in it; he said he was employed by an Irishman round the corner, to take them into the field. I said it was very strange to do such work at that time of night, and I had him taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he allude to the other man who was with him? No; I cannot say I saw more than one stone removed; he did not attempt to go off. I did not go for an officer - I crossed the road and sent a person for one. I did not go above thirty yards, when I returned I found the prisoner still there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and went to the terrace; I saw the cart, and a number of stones in it. I asked the prisoner what he was doing with it - he said an Irishman had employed him to carry the stones across the field - it was then about half-past eight o'clock - the name of Inskip was on the cart, and he claimed it at Hatton-garden the next day - he was not detained - he said he had not employed the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Arnold's defence. I have had a slight acquaintance with this young man for some time; one day about three weeks before this robbery occurred, I happened to be going along St. Martin's-lane, I met him, we fell into conversation, and we had two pints of beer together; he told me, he was very glad to see me as he had got something very good in his head, and he would be very glad to see me any day, at that public-house, at his dinner hour, as he was in a hurry then; in the course of two days I called at that public-house; I found him there: he took me then almost to the shop in the Strand and appointed to meet me there about nine o'clock at night, at the time he was shutting up the shop; I went to a court near there at the time appointed to wait, and after he had shut up the shop, we joined company together, and went to a public-house and drank together; then him and me went to his home and fetched two bags, as he said, he had every thing convenient, and he was sure there was no danger; we went back to the house in the Strand, and he by the assistance of a key, went into the house, and being dark, he pulled me in, as I was to stand in the passage while he opened the shop door; there being a padlock and another lock to the shop-door; when he had proceeded so far as to open the padlock, I heard very distinctly some one or other coming down stairs, and I saw a kind of a light upon the stair-case; we both came away and went and drank together; before we parted, he said, he had left the padlock on a ledge in the passage; he hoped it would not be found out; with that, he said, call and see me soon, then I shall be able to let you know what my master says; accordingly, I called in the course of a few days at the same public-house, where I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100062"></xptr>again; he told me, that things went on very well, there was no particular noise made to him as the young ladies were very ignorant and very careless, that he did not suppose they had the least suspicion about it; they were afraid of letting their father know, for fear of getting anger for being so careless in leaving the padlock off (as he imagined they thought that they had left the padlock off) if I would call again in a day or two he would try again; I did call again the next night at shutting up the shop time; we went after the shop was shut and drank together, and then we went and got the bags from his apartment, and he put the key in the door, and there appeared over the door a light, like unto a lighted candle; he pulled out the key, and we ran away and went and drank together; and I said to him, certainly those people have some suspicion, and I am very sorry I ever came to you to do any thing in it; I advised him to let it alone; I parted with him, and did not see him till the Thursday before this affair happened; I certainly called at the house to see him as usual, he told me, there was nothing particular that happened, and there was a better opportunity than ever for the lodgers in the house had gone away, and there was not a soul in the house, and one of his master's was gone out of town; by his persuasions, he advised me to meet him again at night; on the Friday night previous to this robbery, I met him at the usual time when the shop was shutting up, which was the third time, and when he had shut up the shop we went and drank together; he said, he thought it was too soon; I went home with him to his room, and we had some supper there, and we sat there till past ten o'clock; he got his bags and we both came to this house; he opened the outer-door, and the shop door; he desired me to stand where he placed me with the bag open, and receive the things from him; when the bags were pretty well full, he said, there was some money in the till, and he would be d - d but he would have that; he opened the till, and said, there was no money in there but a bad shilling, which he threw away; we went away, and took the goods to his room, he gave me one of these bags and he took the other, and we looked over the goods, there were twenty pair of boots, and fourteen or fifteen pair of shoes, I think; I staid in his room all night as he recommended me, and then he said, he should go in the morning to work as usual, left there should be any suspicion, notwithstanding, he thought it would be unsafe to leave the things in his apartment; he recommended me to take a part away and he would take another part to a friend's to sell them for him, he told me to take them where they were safe or to sell them.</p>

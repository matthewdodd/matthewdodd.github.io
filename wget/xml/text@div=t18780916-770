               <p>three prisoners were given into their charge—we searched the room, and picked up 33 counterfeit shillings, some finished and some unfinished, and two "gets"—some of the coins were quite hot—there was a small fire—I saw Thick open this rag and find 17 counterfeit shillings; some were more finished than others, which had pieces of metal on their edges—26 coins were of 1873 and 24 of 1843—under the stoke-hole I found these two pieces of metal, which fit into this ladle which I found on the floor—I found these pincers on the table of the room we first entered, and these three small files, and on a dresser this spoon with some plaster-of-Paris on it, and this copper wire on the floor—I saw Mary Ann Crawley throw on to the floor of the closet, near the back door, this piece of flannel with sand in it—I searched a cupboard in the front room, and found a quantity of plaster<lb></lb>of-Paris—in the dresser in the back kitchen I found this bottle of liquid—I found this shell containing plaster-of-Paris—I searched the room immediately above, but only found a piece of whitening—those are the only rooms in the house—I took Frederick Callard to the station—before leaving the house I told the prisoners they must consider themselves in custody for having counterfeit coin in their possession, also a mould for making them—Frederick Callard said, "Very well, I will go quietly with you"—M. A. Crawley said, "They belong to <hi rend="italic">Old Bill</hi>, and you know as much about them as I do "—she was violent, and put herself in a threatening attitude towards Thick, and said she would do for him before she left—we took them to the station Frederick Callard said at the station, "The less said the better," or words to that effect—the charge was read over to them—I produce a shilling of 1873 which I received from Talbot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Berners-street, Oxford-street. On the 29th of November, about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for an ounce of salts, and tendered a bad shilling—I told her she must know it was bad—I sent for a policeman, he searched her and found nothing, he said he would take her to the station-house if I pleased, but there would be no case against her, and she went away—I took the shilling, and gave it to the policeman to cut in two in her presence—he called the next day, and had it again—it had been in a little scale-box on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in High Holborn. About half-past four o'clock, on the 30th of November, the prisoner came into my shop for half a yard of brown holland—she offered me half-a-crown—I looked as it, and sounded it, and saw it was bad—I asked if she had any other money, she said she had not—I sent for a policeman—I gave it to the servant, but it did not go out of my sight—the moment I sounded it the servant called out "That is a bad one"—the servant did not go up stairs and come down and say it was a bad one, she did not go out of the room.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulcher's. On the 5th of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was in Cow-cross-street, and saw Fulker with a horse-collar on his arm, and some horse-rugs at his back - I asked what they were; he said two old horse-rugs: I said, "There is something else;" he said, "Yes, there is a basket, that has some wine in it, which I have brought from <placeName id="t18290115-143-crimeloc750">St. Bartholomew's Hospital</placeName>

I assisted in conveying Fulker to the watch-house; I found two bottles of port in his pocket - I asked where he brought them from; he said from St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and they were given to him by the groom, Boreham, and that the horse-furniture was old things, which he was going to take to the stables in Southampton-mews, to the coachman- he did not know any other name for him than John.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot tell whether Mr. Stepheason had not directed him to take them to Queen-square? A.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and lire at 85, Tavistock Crescent, Westbourne Park—Annie Jane Fanny Maclean was my niece; she was the daughter Of Colonel and Mrs. Maclean, and was 33 years of age is August last—Colonel Maclean has been dead some years—Miss Maclean was living with her mother in London, once at 40, Eastbourne Terrace, and latterly in Craven Road—they lived together in London ever since she was born, up to March last—I was in the habit of visiting them, sometimes once a week, sometimes twice a week, constantly—Miss Maclean had a spinal deformity, she could not walk very well, there was something the matter with her hip, and in consequence of the deformity she walked always lame; sometimes she walked with a stick, not latterly, she made use of her umbrella generally speaking instead of a stick—she was very short, I can't say what height she was—she did not leave London with her mother, her mother left London in March, she had taken a house at Broadway, about 12 miles from Worcester, called the Shrubbery, and I went down with her, Miss Maclean stayed with a friend in London—Mrs. Maclean died on 1st April, suddenly, at Broadway, I was with her at the time—she died at the house of a Mr. Allcock, where she had taken apartments until the Shrubbery was ready—her daughter was not with when she was taken ill—she was in London, but she was telegraphed for and came down, and was with her when she died—Mrs. Maclean also left a son, Norman Maclean, he is a doctor—Mrs. Maclean left a will—the son and daughter came into some property, £3,000 between them; after the mother's death Miss Maclean came to my house and lived with me for about a month at my house in London, until 3rd of May—I know the prisoner Paine, I only knew him since Mrs. Maclean's death, when he came to my house—he was known to Mrs. and Miss Maclean before that, but I did not know him—I did not how whether he was married or single—he came to my house to see Miss Maclean, much to my surprise; he called perhaps once a week, sometimes, he might perhaps have called twice in the week, I can't Say exactly how often he called—I was present when he first came to the house, but I left the room immediately—he did not at any time tell me the object of his visits—I did not learn from him what his business was I did not know where he was living—on 8th May I and my niece went down to Broadway, to the Shrubbery—I stayed there a fortnight with her—I did not see while I was there—he did not come to the Shrubbery at all—I returned to London alone-about a month afterwards my niece came to London to stay with me for a short time—Paine came soon after—two or three days after she came up she had occasion to go down into the country for some days to find some deeds and papers of administration, or something, and then she returned to me</p>

               <p>in three or four days, I can't say exactly; her brother was with me at that time—during the two or three days before she went into the country Paine called to see her, and after her return he also called—she was only with me two or three days then—after that she went back to the Shrub<lb></lb>bery with her brother—at that time I did not know her position with regard to Paine, not until the evening before she left my house—she did not tell me, but she did tell my servant—I heard her say it—her brother had been staying with me, and went down with her to the Shrubbery—her brother left for America at the end of August—Miss Maclean came up to town then, and I saw her—she came to my house for about an hour—she went to live at 11 Alexandra Street, Westbourne Park, 10 or 11 days—Paine was with her then—she afterwards went back to the Shrubbery—I did not see her again till I was called to her at the coffee-house at 128, Seymour Place—that was on a Sunday evening just a fortnight before she died—I was fetched by Mr. Fitzpatrick—I went with him to a bedroom at the first-floor back—my niece was in bed—when I had last seen her before she was in good health—in regard to drink she took what other people did, she drank moderately—one night, when she had been out the whole day with Paine, she came back a little the worse for drink—that was in May—when I went to the coffee-house Mrs. Powell and a nurse named Mrs. Wright were there—my niece was very ill indeed—she did not seem to have the free use of her hands—I spoke to her and she spoke to me—at times she was very collected, but at others she would wander—I stayed with her all night till about 7 o'clock the next morning—Mr. Fitzpatrick remained about half an hour—Mr. Waller was sent for—I believe he is a surgeon—he was sent for at about 1 o'clock, I believe, by Mrs. Powell—he saw her and examined her—he remained about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—Mrs. Powell's servant was there, also Mrs. Postlethwaite—I noticed the state of Miss Maclean's night-dress, it was stained with something down the front—it looked dark, as if it was brandy—I saw two tumblers with spirits in them beside her bed—one looked dark like brandy, and the other was lighter, like whisky—I did not smell it—I saw one bottle on the mantelpiece—I examined her feet and hands—she complained of great pain and cold, and would not let any one touch them—her hands were as if they were para<lb></lb>lysed—she could not put them to her face—she said "Look at my mouth"—I looked at her mouth—her hands seem convulsed—her mouth was very red and almost raw—she did not get out of bed at all in the night—she did not appear to be able to get out—she did not seem as if she could hold anything in her hand very well, she tried, but could not do so—she had nothing to eat or drink while I was there—she asked for a glass of beer, but just put her lips to it—I left at 7—I had not seen anything of the prisoner before I left—I returned there, I think, about 12 or 1 o'clock—I went back alone—I went to the house, but did not see her—I went to my soli<lb></lb>citor, Mr. Taylor, of Field Court, Gray's Inn, to fetch him to see Miss Maclean—she said said she wished to see him particularly—he met me at the coffee-house between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw Dr. Thomas there—I went into the room with Mr. Taylor—my niece then appeared a little better—I stayed about half an hour on that occasion—Paine came in whilst I was there—I said to him, "Do you call yourself a man to ill-treat a little orphan deformity as she is, and rob her of her money?"—I said, "You are beneath a man to bring her into a coffee-house to</p>

               <p>die. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I only wish I was her brother; I would thrash you till you hadn't a piece of flesh to stand on"—he said, "You get out of this. This is my place, and I pay for it"—"You pay for it!"I said; "not with your own money, you don't"—he said, "That's my wife"—"Your wife!"I said; "You had better take care what you say; you've a wife living. Instead of robbing her and bringing her to disgrace, you ought to have been a protector to her at your age"—I implored my niece to think of what she was 'doing, and what anguish it would have caused to her mother if she had' been alive—she said that she would not come with me, and that she, did not want to be interfered with by me, but she seemed to be quite under his influence—I said, "Annie, if I can be of no further use to you I will gay good-bye, sometime, perhaps, you may want me when it will be too late"—I left then—on the previous day she had been very anxious to come with me, but after she had seen Paine she seemed afraid to speak—it was about 5 when I left—that was the last time I saw her alive—I heard of her death afterwards and saw her body—I attended the inquest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What I have said is true—I was examined before the Coroner once, and I was called up a second time a fortnight afterwards to contradict a statement—I did not say then a single word of what I have said now; I was not asked to do so—I said that he ordered me out of the room, but that is the only portion of the long story I have told to-day that I told the Coroner—my niece was not able to assist herself in any way—she appeared very much attenuated—I have not said that she was next door to a skeleton—I said that her poor hands and arms had got very much thinner, and her face also—she looked as if she had not had sufficient food, I think—she looked half-starved, and in a very different condition to when I saw her last—she was generally very thin—as my niece, I had entertained a deep affection for her—I made no inquiry about her between then and the time of her death, because I did not wish to be insulted, and my affection for her yielded to that—Mr. Fitzpatrick vent to the police the first night I was there, leaving me in a cab—he went on my account—he is here, I believe—I learned from him that they would not interfere—I sat with her all night, and left at 7 a.m.—before I left I sent for some gin, as she wanted something to drink—she was allowed weak spirits—there were two tumblers there, but castor oil had been put in and she would not take it—I call it brandy from the colour—I did not try to make her take it, but the nurse tried in my presence—I do not know whether it was neat brandy—I saw the nurse put it to her lips but she refused to take it, she said there was castor oil in it—the whisky had castor oil in it too—the nurse also tried her with the whisky and she would not take that either because of the castor oil—I did not mention that before because I was not allowed to speak—I did not tell the jury about sending out for gin, because I was not asked the question—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the gin—she was craving for something to drink—I did not smell the castor oil, but it looked like it, you could see it swimming at the top, and it looked like brandy at the bottom of the tumbler, and the same with the other, the whisky at the bottom and the oil at the top—Mrs. Knowles is the friend she remained with when her mother went to Broadway, she is not here, she lives at Kilburn—the deceased drank wine, beer, and brandy and water, but I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had not noticed that her habits were in temperate before her mother took the shrubby—after her mother's death, when she had been out with Mr. paine the whole day, she came home in the evening and I noticed that she had had a little too much—when I sent for the gin it was because she expressed a desire for it, she was very thirty—I gave her some mixed with water, she had very little of it.</p>

I am not residing at 275, fulham Road—I was educated at wellington college, and left about 1867, when my sister, the deceased, was living with my mother at Eastbourne Terrace—I studied at st. mary's Hospital—I have since lived at various places—my father, Lieutenant-colonel Maclean, died in 1854, and my mother's myself, and my sister formed the family—on 30th August last I went to America, and I returned for the vacation—paine visited my mother's house, but I never saw him there—when I came house I saw him twice—he professed to be a commission agent—I did not know much about him, but my mother objected to his coming to the house because his character was not good—I communed practice for myself and I left my mother's home—after 1876 I lived at several place—in 1879 I had chamber in Barnard's inn—I was then married—my mother died on 1st April—I was there about nine hours before she died—after that on sister went to live with her aunt—she was very amiable and apparently happy, considering the deformity she had—she had the same average abilities as most young ladies possess—about a month after my sister in death I went to my solicitor to get a settlement prepared for my sister in consequence of what some one said—I got it prepared, and afterward handed it to my sister; she said she would not sign it at Broadway it consult my co-executor, Mr. Clark—I afterwards saw it at Broadway in her possession still unexecuted, and so far as I know it never was executed—it was only a draught—in may my wife and I went to the shrubbery,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Smith, who keeps a lodging-house, 1, Alexander Street, Westbourne Park—on Saturday night, 30th August last, I was sent for to a neighbour's house, where I saw the prisoner and the deceased—they were introduced to me as Mr. and Mrs. Paine—Paine wished to take my rooms—he said he had come up on business, and also to see some doctors—he took the dining-room and the second-floor front bedroom—the next Sunday, the 31st, he and the deceased came in a cab between 1.30 and 2 o'clock—Paine assisted the deceased out, she being a cripple—he did not carry her; he merely gave her the assistance which a gentleman would give to a lady—they went into the dining-room together, and I went there very shortly after—the deceased was half sitting, half lying, in a large arm-chair, fast asleep—her face was very much flushed—I asked Paine how it was she was so face asleep, and he told me that she was prostrate with grief at her brother's having just left for America—I did not then see any bottle in the room—they had dinner soon after—I thing there was a bottle of brandy on the sideboard during some portion of that day—in the evening I has some conversation with Paine about the condition of the deceased—he began it, and the substance of it was that she was pregnant, and not in a good state of health—he made allusion to her being deformed, and told me that she was gone just half her time—I said I thought she ought to have the best advice—they remained at my house about ten days, till Sept. 10—during all that time she was principally in the bedroom; very seldom in the dining-room; but they went out daily—during their stay I conversed with the prisoner frequently about the lady's supposed pregnancy—I asked her in his presence why they did not have a doctor—he continually put it off, saying that he was going to, or that she was not well enough, or not willing that day—he asked me what I thought about the coming event—I said I could not tell—I asked him if he had had good medical advice, and he said that he had, and that cripples had the best of times—he said that Dr. Norman Maclean, her brother, who was a doctor, was very uneasy at the state she was in with her deformity—one day I saw some baby linen lying on a chair—I can't say who brought it—I said to Paine, "You have been buying the baby linen, I see"—he replied, "Yes, I have had to buy it; she's such a funny little thing; she wouldn't trouble about it"—I was only aware after they left of the number of bottles they had; I believe I said at the inquest seven bottles of brandy—every morning the servant used to bring one bottle down, and it was only after they had left that I found out what number had been used—there were seven bottles of brandy, one bottle of whisky, one bottle of gin, one of sherry, two of ginger wine, and eleven of claret—in the bedroom we found three or fount flair bottles, such as you see sold at railway stations, empty—I waited on Mr. Paine on the day he came, as my servant had gone for a holiday, but I did not see more if him when he dined in the house—they both dines in the dining-room when they had dinner at home, but she principally reside in the bedroom—they left on 10th September—Paine</p>

               <p>asked me if I could find a servant for her, and I suggested that she should have a proper nurse with her—he said he was going back to the Shrubbery—the servant was very seldom able to get into the bedroom till late in the afternoon—up to that time the door was locked, I believe—the lady ate comparatively nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not say whether she was in the family-way; she being deformed—it was not patent—my servant is not here, she could answer no questions that I can't answer—she went up to empty the slops, and I went up afterwards to make the bed; I or my servant opened the outer door, whichever was the handiest—I cannot say how the bottles got into the house, I suppose Paine brought them, but the claret he wished me to get in for him, it cost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bottle—I do not know how the seven bottles of brandy were brought in—I was surprised when I saw them empty—Miss Maclean never went out alone, always with the prisoner—I never saw her drunk, but I saw Paine drunk several times; he seldom came home at night without being drunk—I saw very little or the deceased, I daresay there were three days out of the ten that I did not see her; she was seldom out late in the evening or downstairs—I saw her return with him late once or twice, and she then appeared sober, he seemed very attentive to her—I noticed to harshness on his part, but the contrary—they had no dinner parties, there was only one proper dinner, the others were little bits—on that occasion there was a pair of soles, a leg of lamb, and a pudding; Paine told me before that he had invited two ladies, and any servant said two ladies came—there were some callers, one gentleman called one morning, and two ladies came—there were some callers, one gentleman dined there—I never saw any time of potted meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Sometimes Paine brought in the little they had, haddock or bloater; I spoke to him daily about the smallness of deceased's appre<lb></lb>tite, and he said that she would not eat, and had not eaten since she had been in the family-way; my servant's name is Ellen Parry, she ill with ulcerated throat—when Paine came home drunk he was alone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at Worcester—on the 16th September last the prisoner called upon me, introducing himself to me as being of the Shrubbery, Broadway; he first said he wanted me to transact a little matter of business of a private nature; that he had formed a con<lb></lb>nection with a young lady at Broadway, who was reputed to be his wife, but that he really was not married to her, and that she wished to make over to him all her property, and he wished to do the same with regard to his; he then handed to me a document which he said had been sent by some solicitors in London, saying that he thought that was not the kind of document they both required; he asked me to peruse it, I did so, and I told him that it was merely a settlement of property belonging to a Miss Maclean, and that the effect of it would be to vest whatever property Miss Maclean had in the hands of trustees; it was a marriage settlement; I told him that the mouse simple plan to adopt, and the least expensive one, would be for each party to make a short will in favour of the other; to this he assented, and I took down the instructions; he did not say where Miss Maclean was then staying; he wanted to know when the wills would be ready for signature; I said they would be very simple documents, and could be ready by 11 o'clock the following day; and that time was fixed for Paine and Miss Maclean to come to my office—he said she believed herself to be in the family-way and was in a great fright—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090110"></xptr>
               <p>next morning Paine came with a lady, who he introduced to me as Miss Maclean—I explained to her the instructions I had received, and the conversation which had taken place on the previous day, and that I had prepared wills in conformity with those instructions—she said "That is exactly what I wished"—I then read over her will to her and his will to him, both being present—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she approved of her will, and afterwards executed it, and he executed his, I and my clerk attesting—these are the wills—they are the same, except that in his will there is a policy on his life, and in hers there is none—at Paine's request she paid me my charge, and I then returned to him the draft marriages settlement which he had given me the previous day—at that time Miss Maclean was, so far as I could judge, in perfect health, and quite robust; in perfect possession of her faculties—they left together—on 21st September I received a letter from Mr. Paine, dated the 20th—the signature appears the same as that affixed to the affixed to the will. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir,—Miss Maclean wishes you to prepare a simple deed of gift of the leave of the house, 40, Eastbourne Terrace, to me." Signed L. J. Paines.) Wanting further particulars, I wrote this letter to Mr. Paine and seen it to him by pose to Broadway. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated September 22, asking the prisoner to supply him with document for the preparation of the assignment: a letter from Paine in reply, dated the 24th, was also put in, enclosing the deeds.</hi>) I then prepared the draft deed, got it engrossed, and wrote to Paine that it was ready for execution—it was an absolute assignment of the house in East-bourn Terrace—on 4th October the deceased and Paine called at the office together—I read it over to her and she executed it—Paine asked me to keep it for the present, and he would let me know what to do with it—on 12th October I received a letter from Paine, dated the 11th and saying "We are in receipt of the lease, &amp;c., of Eastbourne Terrace"—I had explained to him that in order to complete the title he ought to be is possession of the original lease of the ground on which the house was built, and I sent it to the Shrubbery by post, and never saw either Paines or Miss Maclean after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Miss Maclean twice; on the first occasion when she made her will, for about half an hour, and on the second occasion for 20 minutes to half an hour—I noticed that she limped into the room lamely, but I saw no deformity—she did not appear to be all acting under compulsion—she seemed a perfectly free agent—there was not a word, look, to sign from Paine as if he was influencing her—he was exceedingly polite to her in every way, taking her shawl and her gloves, and so on—to the best of my judgment she was not drunk, or I should not have allowed her to sign the document—this is the deed she signed.</p>

               <p>the lady to my office, and that she should make the proposal—I told him that I was leaving Worcester that morning, and if he brought her it must be soon—he called again with Miss Maclean, about 11 o'clock—I filled up a proposal form for the amount stated, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Paine and Miss Maclean gave me the information jointly, and Miss Maclean signed it; he gave me as references himself and her brother, Dr. Maclean, who was in America, and he could not send the forms to him—one of the questions was whether she was sober and temperate—he said that she was strictly sober and temperate, and she said the same herself—when he brought her in she seemed excited and flurried a great deal, and he told me she was very much put about and excited by the death of her mother, and her brother's going abroad, and he asked me to give her a little brandy—I gave her about a table-spoonful with cold water in it—he said that she was excited by dressing rather hurriedly to come to my office, having been in bed on the first occasion—he asked me whether it was the custom of the Gresham office to pay immediately after proof of death, or whether we took three months—I told him three months—on the first occasion that he came he said the lady thought she was pregnant, but that he himself did not think so—I made an appointment with our insurance doctor, Dr. Everett, to examine her—on the following day I sent up the proposal to the chief office, and made my own report on the case, and the insurance was declined—they appeared to be on very affect<lb></lb>tionate terms—he appeared very kind to her, too much so before a stranger; he called her "diaries" and "darling."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons carrying on my profession at Worcester—on 18th September last the prisoner and Miss Maclean called on me—they were strangers to me—Paine said, "Mr. Everett, I have come to you at Mr. Watkins's request to examine this lady, who has made a proposal to the Gresham; I am her friend"—I then proceeded to put to her the usual questions, and received her answers—I examined her—I elicited from her partly the facts of the case, and other facts I arrived at from my own personal observation—I examined the lungs, and as far as I could find they were sound—I examined the heart—with the exception of its being a little feeble, it appeared to me to be sound, but I found that she was very deformed in the pelvis, so much so that if she became pregnant, and went to the full time, in all probability parturition would be attended with fatal, or at any rate most serious results, and in consequence of that condition alone I recommended the office not to take the life, and it was not accepted—she stated, and Paine also stated, that her habits were temperate—I believe the terms she used were that she partook moderately of wine—that was suggested to her by Paine—my impression was that there was no such enlargement of the liver as to be very notable in a person so much deformed, and there was nothing whatever about her appearance to lead me to anticipate any speedy termination to her life.</p>

               <p>my hand under her clothes, at her back and round the pelvis—I believe it was on the right side—the indication of the deformity was the promi<lb></lb>nence of the spine backwards, and the elevation of the hips on the right side—my attention was not drawn to the liver by any considerable swelling, and when I asked if she had any liver trouble, she said, "No. I have not"—I know a disease called cirrhosis—that is an advanced state of liver disease—I never heard the name of rottenness applied to it—practi<lb></lb>cally, that is the nature of it—it is substantially an extraneous growth, the healthy tissue of the liver has become destroyed by the presence of a new deposit—it is brought on rather quickly—I did not examine the kidneys.</p>

                  </hi>. My father lives at Broadway—he is a gardener—before 11th September last year I had been a domestic servant in London—I left my service at that time and went back to my father—he was not exactly working for Mr. Paine; he had been laying the garden, getting it ready for the time Mrs. Maclean was to come there—in consequence of something my father told me, I went to the Shrubbery to seek a situation there; it was on Saturday, 13th September, I went first about 10 o'clock in the morning—the Shrubbery is at the bottom of the village—there is a house adjoining it, it is what is called a semi-detached house—I saw Mr. Paine first, he asked me into the kitchen, and called Mrs. Paine down<lb></lb>stairs to me—I had seen her before in Broadway, but not to know any<lb></lb>thing about her—the result was that I was engaged as servant, and I went in about two hours afterwards to stay for good—there was no other servant—Mr. and Mrs. Paine and myself were the occupants of the house—I remained there until we left for London on 3rd November—Mr.</p>

               <p>and Mrs. Paine slept on the first floor, I slept in a room over theirs—I supposed that they were married—they had their meals very irregularly—I prepared the breakfast—Mr. Paine used to come down to breakfast, Mrs. Paine stayed upstairs, she has been down two or three times, that is all—she was very uncertain as to getting up; she was scarcely ever dressed; she used partly to dress herself and stay in her bedroom very much; she laid in bed a great deal—dinner was anytime—I saw so little of her at first that I scarcely knew whether she was well or ill—I did not go into her bedroom during the day—Paine tidied the room the first week, emptied the basins and so on—I only went into her bedroom on the Thursday, the day Mrs. Biddle called from Blockely—I went in after dinner; Miss Maclean was not in bed then, she came down to dinner—I don't know whether she had anything to drink the first week, it had been ordered in, but it was taken upstairs into the bedroom, an I never saw it afterwards; it was liquor, different sorts, I could not say what; it was spirits, in bottles—I am speaking of the first week—I could not say how many bottle their were, I don't remember—as they were brought in I put them on the kitchen table, and Paine took them upstairs into the bedroom—when bottle were empty, sometimes paine has brought them out and put them on the landing window and I took them away, and sometimes he brought them down himself—on the first Monday I was there, the 15th, Mr. and Mrs. Paine went to Worcester and returned on Wednesday evening about 7 o'clock—when they went Paine locked up every room in the house except my bedroom and the kitchen, and took the keys with him—on the first Sunday week after I was there Mrs. Paine made a statement to me—we had a fowl for dinner that day, and I asked Paine if I might take Miss Maclean's dinner up—I always called her Mrs. Paine—he said "No I will take it up when I have had my own," and when he had had his own he took some up with some sherry in a glass, and when I cleared dinner away I noticed that he brought Miss Maclean's dinner down untouched—I said "How is it that Mrs. Paine cannot eat her dinner? what can I get for her? What does she want?" and he said "Oh! drink, of course, as per usual"—he then I said was to clean myself and go out, and I then asked him if I might go up and make her bed first?—he said "No; you go out; I will attend to that"—I said it was not a right thing for a gentleman like him to be emptying basins and making beds—however, he said he would do it—on the same day, after I had cleaned myself to go out he came into the kitchen and asked me if I had heard any one say that they were not married—I said "No sir"—he said "Well, to prove we are, wait a moment and I will fetch a certificate"—he went upstairs and came back with a piece of paper in his hand—there was on it "Lewis Paine and Annie Mclean, married the 24th day of March"—he said "If any one should say we are not, you can say we are"—I went out about 4 o'clock and stayed out till about 9 o'clock—he said he was going to lock up all the doors and go to bed, and I was to take the back kitchen door key so that I could let myself in—when I came back I went to Miss Maclean's room—she was in bed—Paine was not there—she was caring—she was undressed in bed—she seemed very much distressed—I had some conversation with her—she asked me to get her a glass of milk—I got her the milk and she drank it—I did not notice her mouth—Paine came in after a little time—he said to Miss Maclean, "Well, how are you now,</p>

               <p>dearie?—they spoke affectionately to each other—I made he bed and left for the night—I went into the room next morning, Monday, the 22nd—she was in bed—at my request she came down and had breakfast with Paine—I cannot remember whether she took any breakfast—she went upstairs afterwards—during the day Paine said to me that he wished that poor little devil could get about better—I asked him what was the matter with her—he said, "Don't you know she's pregnant?"I said "No, sir"—he said, "You look surprised;" and added, "Oh yes, she is; she is five or six months gone"—I then left the kitchen—the next morning she came down to breakfast, but I do not remember whether she ever did afterwards—I was more in the room after that—they were affectionate in appearance and in talk—Paine seemed to have influence ever her sometimes—I have seen Paine give her spirits—she has asked for food, and Paine has got up and given her liquors, spirits—he has given her at different times whisky, and gin, and brandy—he used to give it her in the glass belonging to the water bottle, from half to three parts full of nest spirits—Miss Maclean said she could not take it—she would say, "Oh, Lewis, I cannot take it"—because it burnt her mouth—I have taken the glass out of his hand and put it on the table, and Paine has left the room—on other occasions he has said, "Do as I tell you; take it; it will do you good"—she would take it then—she has shown me her mouth—it was very much inflamed and raw, and under her tongue were some little blisters which she called ulcers—they were white in colour—Paine has given her spirits more than once while we were at the Shrubbery—I have seen him do it two or three times—there were spirits in the room, in the wardrope, on the first shelf above the well—she could get to them by means of a chair; she could move across the room—there were bottles and glasses near the bed—a great deal of liquor came to the place—it was mostly spirit, but there was also sherry—the bottle were usually taken up to the bedroom—a jar of sherry was kept in the cellar, and a jar of gin in a little cupboard under the kitchen dresser and there was a jar of whisky in the housekeeper's room—I once carried down 16 empty bottles in one lot—they had had spirits in them; that was when I had been there between three or four weeks—I have also taken them down one or two at a time—Paine himself drank a great deal—the first three or four weeks I was there he was scarcely was sober—afterwards he was less frequently intoxicated—Miss Maclean said she was found of oysters—I have heard Her ask Paine for oysters, and he has passed it off to something else—has asked Paine for various kinds of food, and he would leave the room, or talk of something else—he used to give her spirits, and say that that was her polite way of asking for them—sometimes she took them with water—sometimes she has taken them willingly, and sometimes against her will—she appeared to be entirely under his influence when she took the spirits—he had, great influence over her—I remember Paine going to Worcester on one occasion—he took Miss Maclean with him—it was about a fortnight after the first visit—Paine told me he took a box of plate with him—I had not seen the plate in the house before—they went on a Tuesday and came back on the following Monday—Miss Maclean was quite intoxicated when she came back—Paine lifted her out of the conveyance, and stood her on the gravel—he then came into the house and left her—he was a great deal the worse for liquor—when I went out Miss Maclean staggered back<lb></lb>Wards,</p>

               <p>and fell on to the ground—I ultimately carried her into the dining-room, and Pain took here upstairs—after that she kept her room, but was not always in bed—about a week after that Paine woke me up one night, and asked me to fetch the doctor—Miss Maclean was ill—I fetched Dr. Beadles, of Broadway—I then saw Miss Maclean; she appeared to Have been drinking—Paine gave her spirits after this, but I cannot Remember whether more then once—on the 13th of October we all went To a "bull-roast" at Stratford-on-Avon—Paine got into trouble there, and was locked up—he had drawn a revolver and presented it at some<lb></lb>body—he was bailed out—I frequently told Paine that Miss Maclean ought not to have so much drink—he said that it was her money, and if she liked to spend it so foolishly she could—Pain went away to London on Thursday, the 16th of October—Mrs. Porter and I attended to Miss Maclean in the meantime—I was always in the house—Miss Maclean did Not ask me for much drink during that time—she had very little indeed, and That was very weak—it was so weak it was so weak that she said it was enough to makes Her sick—she got better till the Sunday, when she began to fret a good deal—Pain came back the Wednesday following—I told him she had been much better while he was away, and that she had had less to drink and more to eat—he talked of taking her to London for medical advice—he said when she got to London she could have as much as she liked and be d——d to her—he was sober when he said that—he told me that she had been craving for something to drink—we started for London on Monday, the 3rd of September—Dr. Beadles had come a second time Before then—on the morning we left, Miss Maclean took a bath, and had Some coffee and an egg for breakfast—she seemed low in spirits; she had Something the matter with her feet, and could not walk—I don't know What it was; it was nothing to be seen; she had to be helped—Paine took With him a half-pint bottle of brandy from the Swan at Broadway—we reached Paddington about four o'clock that afternoon—Miss Maclean was helped out of the carriage into a cab—amongst other stations the train stopped at Oxford—a glass of some spirit was got, of which I and Miss Maclean partook—after leaving Paddington we called at a public-house in Pread Street—Pain fetched Miss Maclean some spirits from the puplice-house—we then drove to 128, Seymour Place, Marylebone—Paine fetched the landlord of the coffee-house out—the landlord carried Miss Maclean upstairs into ta room—Miss Maclean did not seem to me to be The worse for liquor—she was quite sensible, and was talking tome all The way—Paine did not stay many minutes—Miss Maclean did not want To go to bed, and sat in an arm-chair by the fire—Paine came back about Eight o'clock in the evening—he had nothing with that I can remem<lb></lb>ber—he took his hat and lay down on the bed—he was the Worse for liquor, but not entirely drunk—he said to Miss Maclean that He was awfully "dickey," and without Miss Maclean saying anything at all to him, he called her a drunken little b——and a d——little devil—he said, "Do you think I am going to stay here to-night? Not if I know it"—he got off the bed and and was coming found the table to go towards Miss Maclean—he got past me when I got up out of the chair and said, "For God's sake, Mr. Pain, do hold your tongue."—he pushed me on One said and said, "Oh Lewis, do give you too many"—I left the room</p>

               <p>Then, and went down to the front door—a few minutes afterwards Paine Came down—he something under his coat—I was speaking to Mr. Powell, and I asked Paine not to go away—he said he was not going to Sleep there if he knowed it—after he had gone I went back to Miss Maclean, and gave her a bath—Mrs. Powell came in, and Miss Maclean asked her for something to drink—she said she wanted a little drop of gin-and-water, which she took—she had nothing more that night—I slept on the floor—Paine came the next morning a little after 8—He did not stay long, but went out and came back about 10 o'clock—he asked me to go out with him, in the presence of Miss Maclean—When we got out he said it was to buy me a jacket—he gave me a sovereign—he selected a jacket, for which I gave 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him back the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we were not away more than an hour and a half, as long as ever it was and then we went back—he bought some bread and cheese, which we had at a public-house, with a glass of ale each—when we got back Miss Maclean had a little drop of weak rum-and-water—about 3 o'clock in the afternoon Paine, who had gone away, came back—he washed and shaved, and then went out to the Museum Tavern—he returned about 6 o'clock—Miss Maclean had another little drop of rum-and-water then—Paine had brought it in in the morning, about half a pint—that evening he called me out of the room, and said he had taken lodgings and wished me to leave—I said I could not leave Miss Maclean there by herself—he said, "I am going out now, and I insist upon your leaving—I am going out before you, and I will get somebody to look after her"—he said I was to come to 31, Nutford Place—I did go there, and we stayed there as man and wife—he gave me ring, a common one—he afterwards exchange it for another, about a fortnight after—he Gave me a gold one—the next morning I went back to Mrs. Powell's—She did not tax me with having stayed at Nutford Place—she asked me Where I had been, and I said that that was no business of hers—we had Words, and I ultimately left the house—I never went back again or saw Miss Maclean again—that was on the 5th of November—after I left I stayed at Nutfored Place till the following Wednesday—after that I went to Broadway with Paine—we went first to Evesham, and stayed, when we returned to London—we came back to the Sussex Hotel, and stayed there till the Wednesday following, when we went to Brighton and stayed there a week—that was after Miss Maclean had died—I came up to give my evidence at the Coroner's inquest, after which we went back to Brighton again, to Titchfield Terrace—at these various places I and Paine passed as man and wife—I was informed of Miss Maclean's death on the morning following—we were then staying at the Sussex Hotel—Paine told me very little about Miss Maclean—I asked Him how she was, and he used to tell me—that was all that I knew—he did not say anything about her death that I remember—two days after Miss Maclean's death he said, "Fanny, if you will only trust me, and believe what I say, you shall be Mrs. Pain.

               <p>stay and consider—I have been in Lloyd's company this morning, he is very great friend of mine—he is a plumber and house decorator and such as that—I am quite sure I saw nothing of my statement last night, nor do I know where it was—I did not ask about it—I never mentioned it I am sure—I did not believe that Paine was cruelly ill-treating Miss Maclean—I could see that he was giving her improper quantities of liquor, and I thought it was doing her harm—I did not know whether he had a motives or not. (<hi rend="italic">Parts of the witness's statement to the Treasury were here read by Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, in which the witness had stated that the deceased com<lb></lb>plained to her that Paine had been bullying her because she did not pi up and attend to her duties, and of his pouring liquor down her throat.</hi>)—there were other occasions when she told me that he was behaving very cruelly to her, but I do not know whether he was or not—I did see him cramming liquors down her throat, but I did not know whether he was doing it wilfully or not—I did not know but what they were married—I always behaved with perfect kindness to her, there never was a word of unkindness passed between her and me during the whole time I was with her—I always had great respect for her; she did not treat me as if I was a servant, she treated me as a friend always—on 3rd November, the day they arrived at the coffee-house, I remained there—I will be on my oath that Mrs. Powell never asked me who the lady was or whether she was Paine's wife—I say that because she says I told her they were married in a county church in Worcester, but I never did, for I never knew where they were married—I did not say "She is Mrs. Paine, she was married to Mr. Paine at the church near our village"—I cannot remember whether Mrs. Powell said so at the inquest—I told you that I did not say so before you asked me, because I had a copy of Mrs. Powell's statement brought to me by a detective, I do not know his name—I have not been talking to him outside to-day, I have never seen him—he brought it into the prison—that was after I made the statement to the Treasury—he brought me several state<lb></lb>ments, I do not know his reason—I just opened them and took a look at them—I did not tell Mrs. Powell that the deceased had been drinking—I was pulling off her stockings—I was not using great violence in doing so, I was doing it quite gently—Mrs. Powell did not say that I ought to pull them off gently, nor did I say that she was a nasty dirty beast, that was the furthest from my thoughts—I read the whole of that in Mrs. Powell's statement—Mrs. Powell never once complained to me of my not taking her up sufficient food—what I am saying is perfectly true—Mrs. Powell has sworn to a lie, and it is wicked in her, and God will reward her for it—I learned that God would reward a person for telling a lie after I made the false statements, that learned me a lesson; indeed it has—I am 19 years old.</p>

Lloyd this morning to my knowledge, nor was I with him alone—I have seen him down in the waiting-room—I will not swear that I was net walking with him this morning—I have spoken to him this morning—we came across from the public-house together—I do not know if we were alone—I will not swear I have not been talking about this case—he has not been advising me what to say—that is the truth—I have spoken to him—he simply asked where I stayed last night—I went to St. Paul's last evening, and left him in a public-house with my sister and another friend—my father may have talked about my evidence, but I will not swear whether it was in the presence of Lloyd—we were walking through the streets, and not all together—we were in separate parties, and all of us, including Lloyd, were discussing this case—when I made an answer yesterday I did not hear Lloyd, who was standing in the Court, call out "No" to something I said—I heard him say he was not a witness—I said in my evidence that Miss Maclean treated me as a friend rather than a servant—I believed her at the time to be married to the prisoner—I have heard that Mrs. Powell says I was found in bed with the prisoner at the Shrubbery—that was at the time when Miss Maclean was treating me as a friend—I said before the Coroner that Paine and I supplied the deceased's victuals—I have given her food—some days she seemed better and some days worse—it is a fact that she was worse after going to Stratford—I do not remember saying that that was in consequence of Paine being locked up—I do not remember saying "the deceased took a great deal of drink, and would have it"—I know no more than what Paine said—I said "It was chiefly gin she took; it was kept in the bedroom"—when I said, "She would have spirits," I can only say what Paine told me—I have heard her ask for a little spirits—I said that she would have spirits because Paine told me to say so—I knew that I was swearing to a falsehood—if I did tell Mrs. Porter that the deceased would have spirits it was in the deceased's presence; I said it to Miss Maclean—I do not know whether I said that it was refuted by me and Paine—I said by the order of Mr. Samson, "Mr. Paine showed the greatest kindness to the deceased;" he did sometimes appear to treat her kindly but not always—I meant to convey what was false for the sake of him, knowing it to be false—I do not remember saying, "She never drank neat spirits;" it is not true; she did drink neat spirits—she was not constantly craving for spirits, both in the absence of Mr. Paine and in his presence—what I mean to say is that she has been forced to take neat spirits in my presence—Paine has poured them out and insisted and said, "Will you do as I tell you and take those"—he has forced it down her throat—before the Coroner I said, "I never saw him give her raw spirits," that was a lie, and I knew it to be a lie when I told it—I was forced to tell it—now I have been telling you all the truth from conscientious motives—everything I have said to-day is true, I have not</p>

               <p>told a falsehood intentionally—there is nothing I wish to correct in it—it was about a fortnight after I first entered the prison that my statement was taken—I changed my evidence before the Coroner because I wished to speak the truth—I did not believe it would enable me to escape—I only wished to tell the truth—I saw Lloyd in the gaol several times before I made the statement—I believe it was Lloyd who recommended me to write to the Treasury, but it may have been my sister—I did not see Lloyd alone, as a warder was present, and she heard every word that was said—she was close enough to hear—it was not in a cell—we were not whispering together to my knowledge—I will not swear I did not whisper—Lloyd told me what I was to do was to speak the truth; he did not sty 1 was to lay it all on Paine—we talked the matter over together—I do not know whether his advice was to communicate with the Treasury, and throw the load off my shoulders and put it all on Paine—I do not remember when asked, "Was there much drinking going on?"saying, "Yes; but Paine did all he could to prevent it. She would have drink, but her chief liquor was gin. She sent out for it in bottles," Or "She could not be prevented"—I will not swear I did not say she was a "dirty little devil"—do not press it as I will not swear whether I did or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Shortly before we went to London on November 3rd Miss Maclean was not able to wash and dress herself—I had to do all for her—there was no one to send out for gin or other liquor except me—I was in the habit of giving Miss Maclean a bath—her habits were very offend five—I have known Lloyd since May—he is a friend of my sister's—he lives at 5, Angel Bow, near Primrose Hill, with Mrs. Lloyd and one child, and is a builder and decorator—I have been in the habit of going there with my sister—my father was in the Coroner's Court when the Jury found a verdict against me, and he was much distressed—he had come up from the country—Mr. Sampson, a solicitor, appeared for Paine and myself in that Court—my father spoke to me about this matter before I was arrested—I was taken to Newgate, and at that time I had no one to represent me, but afterwards I was told that Mr. Brookes, a barrister, was acting for me—I wrote the following letters: "Newgate, December 20, 1879. Sir,—I am fully prepared to make my statement, and it is my desire to confess the whole truth of what I know from the first day I entered Miss Maclean's and Mr. Paine's service to the day I left him." "Dec. 31, 1879. Sir,—Will you kindly call on me any day at your earliest convenience, as I have something more to say to you"—and I afterwards made a further statement—a gentleman came down and took it—I had no idea that I was to be called as a witness—I did not know that I was about to be acquitted until the case was opened—when I left the Court last night I was with my father, my sister, and three others—Mrs. Ems and her niece, Minnie Wrightson, and Mrs. Bill—they came from Broadway—I do not remember whether I went into two public-houses—Lloyd came in, but he went out directly with my father—my father and mother stayed at a lodging-house—I met Lloyd this morning with my sister as I came across to the Court with my father from the public-house opposite straight into Court—if I walked with him it was only across the road, but I don't remember it—I have told the truth—10 the best of my knowledge I have. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's evidence before the Corover was here read.</hi>) Parts of that are not true—I don't know if that is the revolver he pointed at me—Miss Maclean once said, when Paine had been</p>

Most of the spirits came from Baylis, a grocer, of Broadway—the others came from Mr. Watkins, at Worcester—the largest quantity I have ordered is two bottles, but Paine fetched some—Paine first took liberties with me after the Stratford-on-Avon business; I mean when he was locked up—that happened in the bedroom over the kitchen—there was no intimacy between us in the Shrubbery—that is a spare bedroom—Miss Maclean was in bed in her own room just opposite—it was between 3 and 4 a.m.—Miss Maclean had asked me to sleep there while Mr. Paine was in London, because my bedroom was not fit to sleep in—he slept in Norman's room, the opposite room, over the dining-room—he did not sleep with Miss Maclean after he returned, he said she was so dirty—there are three rooms on that floor—he went to London on 16th October and returned a week alter—I did not know that he was coming into my room—he got into my bed—he remained scarcely five minutes—that was the first liberty—the next was between then and when we came to London—I had been staying up part of the night with Miss Maclean, and was lying down on the bed in my clothes when he came in—it was the same room and about the same time of night, and it also happened there again—I did not know for certain that we were going to London till the Friday, and we came up on the Monday—Paine said on the Friday that he wanted to come London to bring Miss Maclean for medical advice, and that he had business to do—no intimacy occurred between me and Paine till after we came to London.</p>

               <p>practising at Worcester—Paine called on me on 16th September last; that was the first time I had seen him—he asked me to call on his wife at the Exchange public-house, Worcester, where they were staying, to ascertain if she was pregnant, and on the following morning I went and examined her in bed—I found that she was not pregnant—she was much out of health generally—she was suffering from a flatulent disten<lb></lb>tion of the abdomen—she had tenderness over the stomach and liver and pain in the back—her complexion was muddy and her tongue was foul—I afterwards saw Paine in another room—he told me that she had been intemperate, that she had taken stimulants freely, and he asked me to impress upon her that she was injuring her constitution, and I did so—I went back and spoke to her—I saw her again next day, the 18th; I think bus and Paine were together; I did not examine her again—very little passed on that occasion—I found her exactly in the same condition—I afterwards received a letter from Paine—I have not got it—this is my reply, dated the 19th September; I sent it by post, I think to the Shrub<lb></lb>bery. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir,—I have carefully examined the water which I received this evening, and am quite sure that it is natural and healthy. I believe your wife 's kidneys are free from disease. From the examina<lb></lb>tion I made the other day I am also certain that pregnancy does not exist. To relieve the pain in the back I suggest that she leaves as all stimulants for a time, keep to the bed or sofa, take a little cooling and slight aperients medicine. I would also recommend her to have, for a night or two, a warm hip bath. I think this will relieve her pain, and very likely bring on the monthly courses. After the bath you may apply a bulla-Donna plaister. You have not sent me your New York Insurance paper, which I am desirous of seeing before' filling up the medical report. I enclose a prescription; please to have it made up at a good druggist's.") Paine had said that he was insured in the New York Company, and that he wished to increase his insurance, but that it would be necessary for him to be re-examined—I had examined him for that purpose—after the examination I made of the lady I formed the opinion that she had indulged too freely in stimulants—I believe the liver was congested—I did not detect any enlargement of it—in her condition it would certainly not be a proper thing for her to take raw spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should not recommend raw spirits to anybody—if a person is addicted to drink, it is most difficult to restrain them—I have found it so in my practice—I don't know that it is more so with females—the lady was deformed—I don't think that would interfere with any certain conclusion—I did not observe any blue spot on her side—I did not notice any eczema on her hands—my impression is that her skin was clear and clean—eczema might be the result of long habits of drinking—it is so with some people; it is not invariable—I thought her symptoms showed that her liver was congested, as her other organs were—there was total loss of appetite—she did not appear at all emaciated or badly fed; rather otherwise, I think—her tongue was white and coated, not at all blistered—by taking spirits and abstaining from food she might have her tongue ulcerated—Paine said in his letter that there was no improvement in her symptoms—when I cautioned her as to the danger of continuing spirits she said very little—she said, "Very well," that was all—she did not give me the least reason to think that, being addicted to intemperate habits, anybody induced her to continue them—she did not deny that she was so</p>

I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, residing at Broadway—I knew the deceased and also her mother—about 20th or 21st September I was called to the Shrubbery to see Miss Maclean—I can't fix the exact date—the girl Matthews fetched me about 2 o'clock in the morning; I got up at once and went to the Shrubbery, where I saw Miss Maclean in bed—I had no conversation with Paine before I saw her—she was in a very excited state—I thought that perhaps it was due to stimulants—I did not notice anything else in her condition—I prescribed for her—I had conversation with Paine about her, and he was in the room—he said he thought she had taken stimulants—I can't recollect his exact words—I told him that stimulants should be avoided—I saw her again, next day I think; she was then better; I think I also saw her the next day, she was then convalescent—about a month later, I think about 21st October, I was fetched by the girl Matthews about 7 o'clock in the evening—when I got to the Shrubbery I found the deceased in bed, in a state of great excitement; she complained of pain in the abdomen, and also of being occasionally faint—I then also supposed it was due to stimulants—I prescribed for her—Paine was not there on that occasion—I saw her again the next evening but one, the 23rd; I did not see Paine then—she was still under excitement—I prescribed for her—I did not attend her after that—on that occasion Mrs. Porter was nursing here and I gave her directions with regard to her treatment—I ordered her a little weak brandy-and-water if she felt faintness coming on—I believe that was the last time I saw her—on the following morning, the 24th, about 9 or 10to'clock, Paine called on me—I told him that I should prefer her consulting a London obstetric physician, as she imagined herself to be pregnant, and as she was so greatly deformed; that she would have friends in London, and I thought it better that she should be removed to where her friends were and be surrounded by her friends—I understood from him that he would remove her to London—I declined making any examination of her—I saw Paine some time afterwards; he called one evening at my house and said, "I have taken her to comfortable lodgings in London,: and two doctors are attending her, and I have asked them to give a statement of the disease she is suffering from, that it may be sent to her brother in America"—to did not give me the names of the medical men—from what I saw of the condition of the lady I did not think she was in any danger, not in imme<lb></lb>diate danger at any rate—I supposed her to be Mrs. Paine—I had attended her for an eruption on the face, eczemas perhaps six weeks or a month before the time I was called in in September—I had also attended her for an extraordinary twitching of the muscles of the mouth and neck; that was during the time she had the skin eruption—I thought that might be due to a nervous feeling, she had been bitten by a little dog.</p>

I would not take it," and then she said "He makes me drink it"—during the time I was with her she showed no inclination for raw spirits, and she never had any—I did not know of any raw brandy being there—I believe she was a perfectly sober woman, and I believe be now, notwithstanding what Matthews told me—I did not know Mist Maclean till April last.</p>

I am one of the firm of Taylor and Sons, Solicitors, of Gray's Inn—on Monday, November 10, Mrs. Wilson called on me, and I made arrangements to go to 128, Seymour Place, where Miss Maclean then was—I arrived at about 3 p.m.—I went up into the room where the deceased was, with Mrs. Wilson—I had known Miss Maclean for many years professionally—she was in bed—she appeared to be exceedingly weak, so weak that she could scarcely hold her handker<lb></lb>chief in her hand—I went to make her will, but she was not in a fit state and I came away without her doing so—the day following her death I saw her, and placed myself in communication with the Coroner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Wilson told me that Miss Maclean wished to make her will, but when I saw her she was utterly unfit to give any directions—she was under the delusion that Paine was lying in the bed with her—she said, "Poor fellow! he had gone out early; he is lying there and has gone to sleep"—she was quite unconscious of what she said—she was possessed of a very small annuity from the East India Company—she was very weak, but her mind was perfectly clear—she was suffering under the extraordinary delusion that Paine was in bed by her side, therefore she was not fit to make a will—she was the very reverse of appearing to be in terror of him.</p>

                  </hi> I keep a coffee-house at 128, Seymour Place, Mary<lb></lb>lebone—I have lived there twelve mouths last August, with my wife—in November last we had a servant named Ann Slaughter—in March or April last Paine came to my house with his wife, the one in Quebec Street, and two children—they stayed five days—J did not know him before—I saw him twice between that time and the November following—on those occasions he came alone and had a bedroom—at the end of October he sent me to take care of a large wooden box, like an ordinary travelling one—on Monday, 3rd November, I received this letter: "Dear Sir,—Will you kindly send the heavy box I sent to you to No. 9, Great Quebec Street, with the enclosed letter; also get a bedroom ready for to-morrow night, Monday, and oblige yours truly, Lewis James Paine." A letter was enclosed addressed to Mrs. Paine, 9, Great Quebec Street, and I sent the box and the letter there at 10 or 11 a.m.—on the same day, about five o'clock, a cab came to my door, and I saw the prisoner, Fanny Matthews, and a lady in it—Paine asked me if I had received his letter that morning—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Have you a bedroom?" and I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have had a little trouble lately, and I hire with me an invalid lady who is entrusted to my care, with money: it will pay us well, as there is money in it; you won't have her in your house long; she is very ill; I think she is dying now"—he asked if I would get her carried upstairs—I then went to the cab—the lady appeared very ill, and said, "Oh, dear, "Or something—I took her in my arms—it seemed to hurt her to move her—I carried her up to the bedroom, the back room on the first floor—I laid her in an arm-chair—I can't remem<lb></lb>ber whether she said anything—Fanny Matthews had come up, and the servant was lighting the fire, or had just lighted it—I then left the room—my wife was at home—about ten minutes after I left the room I saw Paine going away—he said, "I have brought her up to get a certificate for her"—he did not tell me where he was going, or when he would return—the next day I saw him at 9 or 10 in the morning—he came downstairs and asked me to change a cheque, giving me one of his own on the Union Bank for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he told me to keep the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance on account—he said, "I want the money to go out to buy Matthews a jacket, she has been so kind to her mistress"—Matthews was, I think, then upstairs—shortly after Paine went out with some one—I don't know who it was—I and my wife then went to Miss Maclean in the bedroom—that was about eleven in the morning—she was in bed—I don't remember seeing any one with her—I noticed two tumblers on the table near the right-hand of the bed—some spirits appeared to be in them, and my impression was that it was either brandy and whisky or brandy and rum—in one glass there was brandy and in the other rum, the colours being different—each tumbler was more than half full—I put them both on the mantelpiece—I and my wife spoke to Miss Maclean, and she replied—she appeared to be very distressed—I was not in the room more than five or ten minutes—she spoke to me in a rather wandering way—I did not see her again that day, but I think I saw Paine in the afternoon—he went away on Tuesday, the 11th, to Worcester, as he told me, and came back on the Saturday evening, when I had some conversation with him after he had been upstairs—I said to him that Miss Maclean had been asking for something to drink—he said, "Oh, let her have all she wants; it is a sin to prolong such a life as that"—upon that he left the house—this con<lb></lb>versation</p>

               <p>occurred about 7 in the evening—I did not make any reply when he made that observation—he did not tell me what he went to Worcester for—I saw Miss Maclean on several occasions while he was away—she remained in bed and was very ill—I do not remember seeing her up—I was in the bedroom once when Paine was there—I think it was after his return from Worcester—Dr. Thorman and my wife were also present—I had only looked in, and meant to go out, when Paine stopped me—he said, "I want you to hear this; I want to get at her"—he then poured something out of a bottle into a tumbler; it appeared to be spirits, and said, "Now, Annie deary, I want you to take this"—I don't remember what she said in reply, but she took it very reluctantly—Paine then said to Dr. Thorman, "I want you to hear this. Now, Annie deary, what did Norman give you for his share of the house in Eastbourne Terrace?"—she answered directly, "Six hundred pounds"—Paine said to her, "You are an artful little devil"—that is all I remember—I don't remember what sort of a bottle it was that he pointed the stuff out of; I did not take particular notice of it—I do not remember how much was poured into the tumbler—Miss Maclean during that time was sitting in a chair—I was with her about an hour before she died, on Monday, 17th, at 9 in the evening—I had seen her on the Sunday, when she seemed more herself—she did not then appear to wander so much in her mind—I sat with her below she died—she then seemed to be rather anxious about her end—Dr. Thorman had been attending her—he was called in on Thursday, the 6th, and he came daily from that time—I did not know him before—Mr. Waller was our doctor, and I recommended Mr. Paine to get him before Dr. Thorman came, Mr. Waller having attended me during a fever—this was on the Wednesday—I told Paine that I would fetch him—I asked him whether he was not going to get a doctor, and he said, "She has seen several doctors"—that was on Wednesday or Thursday morning—when I offered to fetch Mr. Waller he said he would get one himself, and soma time in the afernoon he came with Dr. Thorman—I called in Mr. Waller about 9 o'clock in the evening of the same day—I did it at the suggestion of my wife—Mr. Waller saw Miss Maclean that evening, and I believe he spoke to her, but he declined to attend her as another medical man was attending—he was called in again on Sunday night or Monday morning at 1 o'clock—I saw Paine about a quarter of an hour or 10 minutes before the deceased died—two females were with him; one of them he introduced to me as his daughter—I don't remember his saying anything to me about the other—they were in the bedroom—I should think each of them was nearly forty years of age—I heard the lady whom Paine introduced as his daughter ask if there was not a doctor attending Mis Maclean, and he said, "Yes, two"—about that time I left the room—I saw the ladies shortly after on the doorstep—I then went up to the bedroom again; and Miss Maclean did not live 10 minutes after—I saw Paine with the ladies, and he went with them, and in less than 10 minutes afterwards Miss Maclean was dead—I was paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether; part of it, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being for damage to the room—there were nurses employed who sat up with the lady at night—I charge ordinary persons 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per night for this room.</p>

               <p>Mr. Paine in the street for it; I met him one day accidentally—I asked him for what was due to me—I asked him to pay my bill, I did not ask him for any particular sum—he had had one bill—I should have been satisfied at the moment if I had had that; I thought it was better to have some than none—I don't remember the amount I gave him first, he knows it—it may have been about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other bill was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that included all—I don't exactly remember what he said when I asked him for it in the street—he said I should have it by-and-by, something to that effect—I did not apply to him again for it—I saw him shortly afterwards and he told me I was to apply to Mr. Taylor, of Field Court, for it—I did apply—I did not get it then, I have got it from Dr. Maclean, that was perhaps a month or six weeks before I gave my evidence before the Coroner—I mean the inquest was perhaps a month before—Mr. Humbert had told me he would see Br. Maclean about it, and probably he would pay me—I did see Dr. Maclean—I am quite sure I had given my evidence before that—it would be six or seven weeks after I had given my evidence at the inquest that I received the money from Dr. Maclean—I am not quite sure as to the date, it was about three weeks ago—I have perhaps said some things to-day that I did not say at the inquest—I can't remember I and my wife having a row with Paine in the inquest room about the money—I won't say we had not—I don't remem<lb></lb>ber; that I swear—I said before the Coroner "Paine asked the deceased what she gave Norman for his share in the house"—that is true—I may not have said before the Coroner that Paine repeated the words twice, "I want you to hear this"—when I say that the deceased took the spirits reluctantly, I mean she did not wish to take it, she offered some objection to taking it—I don't remember anything she said—I know by what I saw that she did not want to take it—I may not have stated that before to-day—I am not thoroughly acquainted with my evidence before the Coroner, not all of it—I have not studied it—I have not read it—I read it at the time but not since—I omitted that, because I was never asked—I saw him force the spirits on her that once—I heard it from the deceased's own lips—I think it is all in my wife's evidence, something to that effect—she was examined before me—my house is a perfectly respect<lb></lb>able one.</p>

"She is very ill and likely to die. I will not leave her in your house many days," Or words to that effect—he asked my husband to can you her upstairs—he carried her like a baby, and placed her in an arm-chair before the fire in the first floor back room—she groaned very much—I said, "You appear very ill; would you like something after travelling?"—there was a great smell with her of spirits—she said she would like a cup of tea or a hot glass of whisky-and-water—I told Paine I had no whisky, and asked him if I was to get some—he said, "No, she does not want anything, if she has anything it must be milk-and-water"—I said that I should get a cup of tea—he said, "No, she does not want say. thing; you know, Annie, you won't drink it"—I then left the room and sent the servant up with a glass half or three parts full of milk—before that Paine came down as the cab was still at the door—he said he had brought her up to get a certificate for her—he left her, and I did not know he had returned until on going upstairs I heard high words in the room—I went in and saw the lady in her chair, and Matthews in another char crying—Paine was there also—I did not go in—I said, "I just wanted to see if you wanted anything on the fire"—Paine said sharply, "No; we don't want anything," and I withdrew—he went out again, and later on I was fetched up to see the deceased by Fanny Matthews—it was wet time after 10—the deceased was lying on her face on the floor, apparently in a fit—she had only her chemise and one stocking on; no other clothes—I gave my servant 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sent her for half-a-quartern of gin—I mixed a little with sugar and hot water, and went on my knees on the floor and lifted up her head and brought her round—we then lifted her into bed—there was no night-dress for her to put on, because Fanny said that Mr; Paine had the keys—there were two boxes and two portman teas, but they were all looked—having put her into bed I left her and looked in again about 11, but did not speak—Fanny Matthews was lying on the bed in her clothes alongside of the deceased, and I thought she was asleep—I lifted the deceased into bed because she was helpless from weak<lb></lb>ness, not from intoxication—on the next day, Tuesday, 4th November, about 9 o'clock, I popped out of the closet and saw Paine on the stairs with his arm round Fanny Matthews's neck, whispering something—he said that he had been to sleep at his sister's and had been taken very bad—I left them on the stairs—Paine came down a few minutes after and asked my husband to change him a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my husband only had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by him, and Paine said that would do—he was going out to buy Fanny a jacket, as she had been so kind to her mistress, and as he passed me he said, "Don't you think she deserve it?"—I said, "If she has been good to her mistress."—they went out together about 10 o'clock and deceased was left alone—after this my husband and I went up into the deceased's room—as far as I knew she had not had any breakfast that</p>

I wont have her here, she knows too much for me"—then I ran upstairs—Paine had gone before me—I said, "You said you were going to leave Fanny Matthews"—he replied; "Didn't she stay?"—I said, "No, she went away directly after you"—I said I would not have allowed the lady to have slept alone in my house in that condition without somebody with her—I don't think he made any reply—the deceased did net join in the conversation with Paine—Paine afterwards came down-to the kitchen—my,</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 16, Hay's Place, but I have removed—I am the wife of Alfred Bowden, a constable, Metropolitan police—on Monday, November 10th, I called in at Powell's coffee-house about 9 a.m.—Mrs. Powell spoke to me about an invalid lady upstairs—I attended! her after<lb></lb>wards—I first went up between 10 and 11 on the Monday morning, and stayed there all day till between 10 and 11 p.m.—she seemed to "be very well in health, except that she had lost the use of her hands and legs—I saw Paine in the morning before going up, and afterwards in the bedroom in the daytime—I was there when he came into the room with Dr. Thor<lb></lb>man—while Mr. Paine was present the doctor said I was to give her very weak brandy and water and plenty of food, and whatever she wished for—Mr. Paine followed the doctor downstairs—Paine came in again in the evening—I don't think he spoke to me—he asked the deceased how she felt—she said she felt very well—in the evening she asked me for some weak brandy and water, and Paine said that he would give it to her—he turned his back to me, and poured a small glass of neat brandy out of a bottle, lifted her head up, and gave it to her—some of it went down her throat and some on her nightdress—he then rinsed the glass and told me I was to give her the brandy and water stronger—it was not strong enough—I told him that Dr. Thorman said she was to have it weak—he said, "Never mind what the doctor says; do as I tell you"—I was there when Mrs. Wilson came, and Dr. Thorman came while she was there—this was on the same Monday evening—Mrs. Wilson came about four or five o'clock—Mr. Taylor was with her, and Mr. Paine came in after a little while—Mrs. Wilson asked Mr. Paine if he was not ashamed of himself to take a poor little deformed orphan away from her home and ruin her, and also to rob her of her money—he said, "She is my wife"—Mrs. Wilson said, "She is not your wife"—Miss Maclean said, "We were married at Gloucester"—Paine then said to Mrs. Wilson, "Who sent for you? these are my apartments, you go out, and don't enter them again till you are sent for"—Mrs. Wilson turned to Miss Maclean, and asked if there was anything she could do for her—Miss Maclean said, "No, no"—Mrs. Wilson said, "Very well, then, I will wish you good-bye; perhaps you will be glad of me when it is too late," and then she and Mr. Taylor left—Dr. Thorman was there, but I do not remember that he said anything—there had been a little conver<lb></lb>sation between him and Mrs. Wilson before Mr. Paine came in—after they left, Paine told me that if Mrs. Wilson came again I was not to admit her into the room; all that were to go into the room were Mr. and Mrs. Powell, Dr. Thorman, Paine himself, and myself; and if any one else came I was to shut the door in their face—he said, "I have brought her up here away from all her friends and relations, thinking that none of them would ever find her out, and now to think that b——d——has come"—I think that was all that passed—Dr. Thorman had left; he left a minute or two after Mrs. Wilson—after the conversation with me Paine spoke to Miss Maclean, hut I did not hear what he said, and then he left—I think he came back at about 9 o'clock that night—I saw him in the room—he said, "Well, Annie dearie, how are you now?"—she said, "I am very well, thank you, Lewis"—he turned round then and took, some<lb></lb>thing out of a box, and went away—he did not return that night while I was there—I remained until half-past 10 o'clock—during the day I had</p>

               <p>attended to Miss Maclean—in the morning she had two oysters, and a little bread-and-butter; at dinner-time she had a little mutton; and at night some stewed rabbit—I got these things from Mrs. Powell—I gave her to drink some weak brandy-and-water and a cup of cocoa—next morn<lb></lb>ing, Tuesday the 11th, I returned about 9 o'clock—Paine was downstairs having a cup of coffee—Mr. and Mrs. Powell were there—Paine said to Mrs. Powell, "I am going to take the little lady down to Brighton"—Mrs. Powell said, "Why, man, she would die on the road"—then he said, "I'll tell you what I will do, I will go down to Brighton and take apartments for Fanny and myself, and send you a telegram to say that the little lady and I have arrived all right, and then you can show it to her troublesome friends when they call"—Mrs. Powell said, "I will do no such thing"—Paine then went upstairs, and Mrs. Powell followed him—Paine came down in about five minutes, and then I went up—Dr. Thorman then came up; I was in the room—I afterwards saw Mr. Paine downstairs with the doctor in the morning—Dr. Thorman told me in his presence I was to go on giving her weak brandy and water, and let her have whatever she wished for to eat—the doctor then walked down the shop, and Paine said to me, "She wants nothing of that, all she wants is brandy" (the doctor was then out of hearing) "and you must give it her stronger"—I said, "You know what the doctor said, that she was not to have it so strong"—he said, "If you do not do as I tell you I must remove the patient away"—I turned round and went upstairs—that was between 10 and 11—I saw him again in the afternoon—he came up into the bedroom, and asked Miss Maclean how she was—she said she felt very well, and she asked me to give her a little brandy and water—Paine poured out a wineglass of brandy from a quartern flat bottle which was on the dressing-table before he came into the room, and crave it to her—he put his hand under her head and lifted her up—she said, "I don't want that," but he said, "You must take it," and then he poured it down her throat—there was a tumbler on the table with a little weak brandy-and-water in it, and he poured more brandy into it, and said, "Give her that; that is how she likes it"—I had mixed that in the tumbler, it was about half full, and he nearly filled it—he emptied all that was in the bottle—the bottle was nearly full—there was nearly a quartern in it—when he poured the brandy down, her hands hung down useless—after he had filled up the tumbler he left the room when he left the room, I emptied most of it, and filled the glass up with water—the deceased then seemed to be suffering from the effects of brandy—she was rambling in her talk—Mr. Paine came about 9 that night—he gave her a small wineglass of neat brandy from the bottle the dressing-table—he raised her head as before—she swallowed some and some ran down her night dress—I left that night at 11.15—during that day I had given her oysters and mutton—I saw her once or twice during the week, when I called to see how she was—I did not attend to her then—Mrs. Tyson was attending upon her—she seemed pretty well in her mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Since the inquest I have several times seen Mrs. Powell, Rosa Wright, Annie Slaughter, Mary Jones, and Louisa Tyson they were all at the inquest—I have not been living with Mrs. Powell—I don't know that I have seen them all together, but I have seen. them and have had conversations with them about this matter—I told the Coroner about Paine telling me to give the brandy strong—I knew that</p>

               <p>what was in the bottle was neat brandy—I did not taste it, but Mrs. Powell told me it was brandy; she supplied it—I first mentioned the story about the little woman being taken to Brighton at the Treasury—when I talk of Paine pouring the brandy down her throat, force was not required, as she had not the use of her hands—I saw Mrs. Powell leave the Court yesterday, but did not speak to her—I bought a paper this morning, but I have not had time to read it, I do not know what she said—I was in at<lb></lb>ten dance when Mrs. Wilson came—I don't think she was abusive—I think Mr. Taylor was outside the door when Mrs. Wilson was talking to Paine—I only know of one tumbler containing brandy-and-water when I came in the morning between 9 and 10—I do not know of one containing castor<lb></lb>oil—I never saw any castor-oil—I only know of the one containing brandy-and-water—if there had been two tumblers with brandy and castor-oil I should have seen them—whatever she asked for she had.</p>

                  </hi>. I had apartments at Mrs. Powell's—I am a laundress—I was living there when Miss Maclean was in the house—I assisted in nursing her—I began to do so on the evening of Tuesday, November 11—I sat up all night with her, and continued to nurse her up to the following Sunday morning—I saw her again on the Monday, when she died—on the first night she took weak brandy-and-water, and something to eat—Paine was not then there—on the Wednesday morning I gave her some food—she was not able to feed herself, as she had no use in her hands—I fed her with a spoon—on that morning Paine came in between 10 and 11 o'clock—he spoke to her and asked her how she was—she said about the same—he said he was going to the Broadway and asked me if it would be safe to leave her—I said I did not think she was so near death as that—he said he should not be back till 6 the next evening, and asked if it would be safe to leave her all that time; then I made that reply—Miss Maclean was there but she made no remark—he went away, and told her he was going to Broadway, and she asked him what for, and he said, "To see to the house at Broadway"—she said, "Lewis, I think that is all right"—he said, well, he had some business there, and would not be back till next day; but he came back the same day—he only stayed a few minutes—she asked him for something to drink, he said he was going out for some brandy, but he did not bring any brandy with him—did not see him again till Saturday—that was the 15th—I attended her night and day, and gave her what she required—Dr. Thorman came on the Wednesday morning, and ordered weak brandy-and-water—she did not take much—she was satisfied with anything to drink, and did not require raw spirits—Paine came about 8 or 9 o'clock on the Saturday—I was in the room, and Mr. and Mrs. Powell came up—Paine went and spoke to her, and said he had just come from Broadway, and that he had left her little dog there—she turned away her head—he told me, when I was going to give her some brandy-and-water which was on the table in a tumbler, that it was not strong enough; and he went to take the bottle to put some more brandy in, but there was not any—he told me to go down to Mrs. Powell to get some more—he, I, and the deceased were then together in the room—I did not go then, because I thought the brandy-and-water quite strong enough—he said she could</p>

               <p>take more neat brandy than I could brandy-and-water—he said she could take an ounce of laudanum when I could not take a quarter of an ounce—he said nothing about food—he told me before going to Broadway that I was not to let any one see her—he did not stop more than half an hour on the Saturday evening—I stopped all night, and he came in again on the Sunday morning—nothing happened then—I went away for the day and returned at 11 on Monday morning—he asked me if I thought she was dying, and I said yea, I did—the deceased was not then conscious—she was much worse then than on Saturday and Sunday morning—he said it was a sin to prolong such a life—I don't think, any one else was then in the room—he asked me if I would sit up with her that night—I said I could not, and that I did not think she. would require anybody—I said so because I believed she would be dead before night—the doctor came and Paine was present, and the doctor said she was very bad—he went out and returned about half-past twelve, and brought with him a young woman—he said she was the daughter of a friend of his in Broadway, and that he had brought her as a witness—Dr. Thorman had asked me to stay with her that day—later on I went downstairs, and before going I said to Mr. Paine, "If she wants anything to drink, you can give her same of this"—it was weak brandy-and-water—he replied, "I will give her nothing, and then nobody can say anything"—he went out to get some extract of beef, and he said he would send it in by the young woman—it did not come—in the afternoon Dr. Thorman came in again—I had, with his permission, put a poultice on the chest of the deceased, which relieved her breathing very much, and the doctor said she was better—Paine came back between 6 and 7 in the evening—she seemed much better then—Dr. Thorman was there, and said to Paine he did not think much of her at 1 o'clock, but he thought she would rally now—Paine had the young woman with him and did not stay very long—I left about 8 o'clock, before Miss Maclean died.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before Dr. Hardwick, the Coroner—I then used the expression "The deceased craved for drink"—so she did—I meant any kind of drink—I did not mean to convey that she craved for spirits, she would take anything, lemonade or milk, or weak brandy and water, or anything else, she was satisfied with it—I have not been a nurse before—she missed Mr. Paine very much, and spoke of him very affectionately—I was examined at the Treasury, but I cannot say by whom—there was a detective named Morgan there at the time, and Mrs. Powell was sitting there part of the time—there was no Magistrate there that I know of.</p>

I live at 10, Upper Dorset Street, Bryanstone Square—on Thursday, 6th November, about 10 p.m., Mr. Powell called on me—I had attended his family—I went with him to his house—we got there about 10.10—I saw a lady in a bedroom on the first-floor—she was in a helpless state—my opinion was that it was from the effects of drink—Mrs. Powell and her servant came up immediately—I mean the chronic effects of drink: the effects of long-continued drinking—her pulse was very feeble, showing that the heart was very feeble in its action—beyond her being very weak I did not 6ee anything else the matter with her—I examined her stomach, in consequence of what Mrs. Powell said, and found it very large, and the liver very hard and enlarged—it felt very prominent—the stomach and bowels were very much distended with flatu<lb></lb>lence and gas—she seemed a little dull of comprehension, but, after pressing, she would answer questions—she seemed drowsy and dull to talk to—her face looked like that of a person who had been drinking, or was waking up out of sleep—there was nothing particular about it, it was not swollen—it was as if she had just woke up after drinking—I stayed with her a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes—I learned that some medical man had been attending her—I told Mrs. Powell that I considered the state she was in was due to the influence of drink, and told her to give her a little weak spirit and water, and a milk diet—I then left—I called again the next morning, and heard that another doctor was in attendance, so I did not go up—on Sunday, the 9th November, Mr. Powell called again about midnight, and I went with him to the coffee-house, and up into the room—the lady was still in bed—I found Mrs. Wilson there, and two or three other persons—the lady was a little better—her stomach was not so distended—she seemed the same as to her strength, and she seemed</p>

               <p>blighter on the whole—I was called in to say whether she was in a fit state to make her will, and I examined her as to her state of mind—I think she might have been in a fit state from what she said—I asked her if she was married—she said "Yes"—she was not fit to be removed from the room to another house—I was with her a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes—I saw her again about the 12th or 13th November—I called to inquire how she was—I went into the room—she appeared to be brighter in her mind, and better a little in herself—I did not examine as to her general state—I merely walked in, and said "How do you do?" and asked how she was—I saw she had a nurse there—from the condition in which she was, I think raw spirits would not be fit for her—I believe the congestion of her liver had been going on for some time, and drinking raw spirits would be injurious if continued for a long time—she died on 17th November; and I believe if she had been in the habit of drink<lb></lb>ing raw spirits from the beginning of October, a small quantity, even a wineglass a day of raw spirits, would have accelerated her death—I did not consider her in immediate danger for a day or two, or two or three days—she might have lived for several weeks, but I thought there was a doubt as to her recovery—she required the greatest care and attention.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Forman is a neighbour of mine within three or four minutes' walk—I was called in casually—I should not continue to attend another doctor's patient—I did not communicate with Mr. Forman—I did not interfere with his treatment—I was not personally acquainted with him—I did give directions to Mrs. Powell the first night—I do not bow who started the notion of making a will, but Powell wanted to know whether she could do so, and whether they could move her, or what could be done—if she had died at that time, having made a will, I should have been prepared to give evidence that she was quite competent to do so—I have seen a good many drunken patients in all stages—drunkenness kills gradually, but sometimes it terminates suddenly by apoplexy—some livers would require longer than others to bring them into a state of cirrhoses, but I should think a year of habitual drinking would do it—I am acquainted with the text books on this disease—some cases come on much quicker than others—I do not think the liver could be brought into that state much under a year—I cannot say whether it would take two years' habitual drinking—there is nothing in a liver in that state to pro<lb></lb>duce sudden collapse—it is what we call a drunkard's liver—it would not produce sudden death—people linger a considerable time and the brain gets affected, and ultimately there is a shrinking of the brain—the sub<lb></lb>stance is not softened, it shrinks and fluid is thrown off—the technical term is effusion on the brain—that may be gradual—drunken patients are difficult to restrain—I have known them recover themselves of their own accord without being kept under restraint, but then they turn teetotallers—unless they do determine to correct it, it is almost impossible to recover them—if a person had been drinking for eighteen months she would be extremely difficult to restrain—although persons may try themselves and determine to do so, if they have been under the effects of liquor for a great length of time it is necessary gradually to reduce the stimulants: it is dangerous to stop them all at once, there would be a collapse—a person who had been an habitual drunkard to a large extent and had left off drinking altogether for six or eight days would, if she had a diseased heart, he very likely to collapse and die—I did not know then that this</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am Divisional Surgeon to the Police—I made the post-mortem examination of the deceased on 20th November—she was a woman of diminutive stature, with curva<lb></lb>ture of the spine, and one leg in consequence shorter than the other—the skin presented a waxy pearl-like appearance—the abdomen was very much distended and a little discharge was issuing from the vagina—post-mortem changes were beginning, and the body presented a greenish aspect in some parts—internally I found the vessels of the dura-mater and brain were congested, filled with blood, and some fluid was effused over the surface of the brain, and the meshes of the arachnoids under the membrane—there was none in the ventricles—the brain itself was natural—the right lung was healthy—the left lung in its upper and middle part was somewhat congested—both lungs were somewhat adherent to the chest walls—the heart was a small, weak organ—the ventricles and cavities were empty—the bowels were healthy—the heart presented a pale appearance, and to the naked eye there was somewhat the appearance of fatty degeneration—I subsequently examined it microscopically, and found evidence of commencing fatty degeneration, which had not advanced to a mature stage—the liver was enlarged—its weight was 60 ounces, which is excessive for a female—the average weight of a healthy liver of a female is 45 ounces, and this was about 15 ounces in excess—I should sup<lb></lb>pose it rather below 45 ounces than above in this case—it was flattened out somewhat by the curvature of the spine, and so presented a somewhat un<lb></lb>natural appearance, and to the naked eye the appearance which is connected with a fatty liver and commencing cirrhosis indicating that the disease had been progressive—I should think that such a condition had existed a year or two progressively—a disease like that would progress in some persons more rapidly than in others—I have no doubt that its progress would depend upon the character of the life—it is not possible to predict the duration of time which a disease of that kind has been in progressing—microscopically the liver presented markedly the characteristics of fatty infiltration—the kidneys and uterine organs were healthy—the intestines were considerably distended with wind, and contained a little billiard matter, but otherwise were empty throughout, with the exception of the colon—the stomach contained about half a wine glass full of a brownish fluid—the stomach itself was healthy—the inference I draw from the</p>

               <p>condition of the heart and liver is that she had been a drinker—I have no doubt that the administration of raw spirits in small glasses to a person in that condition would accelerate death—if a person had been habitually a drinker I should expect them to crave for raw spirits—I gave evidence before the Coroner that the cause of death was syncope, from failure of the heart's action while suffering from liver disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As soon as a cell forms, degeneration of the heart has taken place to a certain extent—the disease has then established itself in a portion of the heart—the evidences I saw under the microscope were only a commencement, because the fat cells were few and far between—there were fat cells—degeneration had commenced, but it might go a great deal further if nothing happened to hasten the catastrophe—with care the person might last for a considerable period—it is very difficult to diagnose disease of the heart—there are other causes of weak heart besides fatty degeneration, which no ordinary person would guess in its earlier stage—the ventricles were empty, showing that the death had been sudden—the stomach was healthy, with the exception of a patch of redness 2 or 3 inches in size—that would not indicate anything—if the administration of raw spirits, sometimes two-thirds of a large tumbler, and at other times a wineglass, had continued up to a short interval before death, I should expect to find the stomach inflamed—I should expect the gut to be in an inflamed state, but more especially the stomach—the spirits go down the ordinary canal into the Stomach, and then are carried through the liver, and the reception of a large quantity would cause the stomach to be inflamed—ulceration of the mouth would arise from many causes besides drink—if raw spirits had been poured into the woman's stomach shortly before death, I should expect the stomach to exhibit an in<lb></lb>famed appearance—by shortly before death I mean within a day or two; but if it had been a month before, I believe the stomach would have re<lb></lb>covered from the possible effects of it—the fact of finding the valves of the heart healthy induced me to come to the conclusion that her death was attributed to a feeble heart rather than to alveolar disease—there was no alveolar disease—in my opinion the valves of the heart had nothing to do with her death—that is merely a circumstance which does not help us at all—I should say that the disease of the liver had been increasing for a year or two, but I should not like to say that it was impossible under a year, it is so entirely dependent upon surrounding circumstances—the liver in some cases might become enlarged much more rapidly than in others—if Dr. Norman Maclean saw a blue spot on the deceased's stomach early in July, it would probably be from an enlarged vein; but it is possible there might be a spot independently of that—if there were enlarged veins on the abdomen during life, I should draw the in<lb></lb>ference that the liver was congested—I examined her body thoroughly externally—there were no signs whatever of violence—it was fairly nourished—I drew the inference from that that the body had deteriorated to an extent, but she was not emaciated; I am not in a position to go further—it is usual in certain circumstances for the medical man who attends a patient to be present at the post-mortem, but he was not, and I knew nothing whatever of the circumstances.</p>

               <p>up irrespective of nutritive food—it would be quite possible for her not to have taken much food for a considerable time before her death and yet for her body to be fairly nourished—if the taking of raw spirits had continued uninterrupted to within a day or two of her death, I should have expected to find inflammation of the stomach; but supposing she had been drinking considerable quantities, and then ceased, say for a week before her death, and only took weak spirits and water, I should not expect to see any inflammation—if she had ceased to drink raw spirits for four days or a week before her death I think the mucous membrane of the stomach might have recovered itself, and I should not expect to find any trace of inflammation, and the stomach might not have presented an unhealthy appearance—from the appearances I saw on the post<lb></lb>mortem, the immediate cause of death was the enfeebled heart, or syncope—that is, from some cause or other, the heart ceased to act, and the patient died—from what I could judge on the post-mortem, and from the evidence, the syncope of the heart was due to the diseased condition of the liver—that is, the cirrhosis of the liver—the effect of cirrhosis is to contract the liver and diminish its size—this liver was larger than usual—that is what we frequently find soon after the disease has set in—the ultimate effect of cirrhosis is the contraction of the liver, but the earlier effect is otherwise; it is somewhat enlarged, and in cirrhosis its structure is altered; and as the disease goes on the structure becomes more and more altered, and it results at length in contraction—an excessive indul<lb></lb>dence in alcohol is nearly always, I believe, the cause of cirrhosis—excessive drinking produces a nervous collapse, and degenerates the whole of the tissues, and the collapse of the nerves affects the muscles—it would be likely to produce syncope of the heart if it was accompanied by organic disease in consequence, such as cirrhosis of the liver—I did not see Dr. Forman at all.</p>

When I say syncope of the heart 1 mean the result of a disease existing in the heart—the fatty degenera<lb></lb>tion of the heart causes syncope, and that was the immediate cause of death—it was the result of fatty degeneration in this particular case-fatty degeneration of the heart can be associated with the enlargement and cirrhosis of the liver, and frequently is—you may get fatty degenera<lb></lb>tion of the heart without any disease of the liver—you may have the fatty degeneration of the heart without the liver having anything to do with—it may cause death without the liver operating in any way to assist it, but usually where there is fatty degeneration the other organs are also affected—I have never met with any case in which a person with fatty degenera<lb></lb>tion of the heart had all the other organs healthy—I should not like to say whether the person might not die of fatty degeneration such as I discovered and yet the liver be a healthy organ, that is beyond my experience—in my experience it is extremely difficult to restrain anybody who has been once a drinker—I never met with a case of a man or woman yet where I could alter it when they have once assumed the habit, that is, after they had once given way to it chronically.</p>

                  </hi>. I a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—in November last I was living at 31, Nutford Place, I was staying there in apartments—I carried on my practice there—my name was not on the door—I first became acquainted with Paine on Thursday morning, 6th November, he was staying at the same house, I did not know it till that</p>

               <p>morning—I did not know that he was staying there with Matthews—he came that morning to consult me about the lady who was at the coffee-house—he said she was passing under the name of Mrs. Paine, or in other words, as his wife—he did not tell me then what her real name was, afterwards he did, when I wrote the certificate that went to his brother: that was on the 12th—I am not quite sure whether he told me that her brother was Dr. Norman Maclean, then in America—I knew that I was writing the certificate for the brother's use—he did not tell me that Miss Maclean was the daughter of Colonel Maclean—he gave the brother's name as Norman Maclean—I don't remember whether he gave the prefix "doctor" or not—I did not inquire—in the course of my attendance on the lady I did not make any inquiries from Paine as to who her friends were, nor from her—I saw her first on the afternoon of that same day, the 6th—she was then in bed—she appeared to be very ill; indeed, she presented to me the appearance of a person who had evidently been having, vulgarly speaking, a long bout of drink<lb></lb>ing; she presented the appearance of a drunkard: medical men know that state under the term of alcoholism; her face was bloated, swollen, dusky in appearance, the pupils of the eyes were contracted, the con<lb></lb>punitive, or white parts of the eyes, were very much congested—she seemed quite powerless—her mind was not at all clear, she rambled during the time I was there, that is, she did not seem to be at all sensible of what was going on around, in a kind of stupor—my instructions were that she should cease to have spirits in any quantity, but that she should have weak brandy-and-water—it would be very bad for her to drink much raw spirits, either raw or diluted—raw. spirits would be more prejudicial to the patient than diluted—in my view the proper course of treatment was gradually to cease taking stimulants—I certainly did not think it would be wise to cease altogether, but to take weak brandy-and-water—i gave those instructions to Paine, and expected them to be carried out—I thought, under the circumstances, that the patient might rally, supposing my instructions were carried out—if my instructions were not carried out, I considered that life would be materially shortened—I think that in the condition she then was it would have been very dangerous to administer much stimulant, either raw or in any form—I thought that the patient did not require any medicine, she only required to leave off stimulants—I could tell that the liver was enlarged and congested—the symptoms were excessive hardness of the structure itself—a congested liver is not necessarily a result of excessive drinking, still it is more commonly due to that cause, and often leads to cirrhosis—cirrhosis may be described as a destructive inflammation of the tissue of the liver, and the ultimate result is that the liver becomes empty and puckered up, contracted—that is a very common result of excessive drinking—I did not, from what I saw of this lady, suspect cirrhosis—I attended her daily until her death, from the 6th to the 17th—on Wednesday, the 12th, I gave this certificate, "I hereby certify that I am at present attending Miss Annie Maclean, also known as Mrs. Lewis Paine, who has been suffering from mental and physical derangement, the latter referable to congestion of the liver; she is now improving, and I think will soon be convalescent"—I was induced to believe there was mental derangement, as Paine had told me about the adventure at Stratford-on-Avon, about the discovery of a pistol; according to his statement that worried her a good deal, and then her brother</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090156"></xptr>
               <p>going away—I found that she did at times wander in her talk, imagined people were in the room when they were not, and so on; the physical de<lb></lb>rangement I have already described—I had not the slightest doubt in my own mind that it was a case of alcoholism—at the time I signed that certificate she was better; she was progressing, so far as I could judge under the circumstances, satisfactorily, hence the certificate—I saw her on the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday; her mind grew very much clearer—I was not present when she died, I was there a few minutes afterwards—I gave a certificate of the cause of death—the primary cause of death was congestion of the liver; the secondary cause was disease of the heart terminating in fatal syncope; the certificate is in the form of primary, secondary, and tertiary—the immediate cause of death was fatty degene<lb></lb>tion of the heart—by syncope I mean that the heart became so enfeebled that it ceased to act; syncope is simply the result of a feeble heart—the primary cause was congestion of the liver; I don't mean to say that that set up the syncope; in my view the lady died thus early from ex<lb></lb>cessive drinking; that would produce congestion of the liver, and probably cause the state of the heart I have described—the first effect of excessive drinking is collapse of the nervous system, that operates on the muscles and so enfeebles the heart; the sooner a drunken person leaves off stimulants the better; not suddenly, gradually, and then altogether.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not present at the post-mortem—I came to the conclusion that there was a feeble heart during my attendance upon her—I gave my certificate before the post-mortem—I heard when I came back 10 minutes afterwards that she was dead, and I assumed from that that the feeble heart ended in syncope—I had previously ascertained the existence of congestion of the liver—the death might have been occasioned by the state of the heart independently in any way whatever of the operation of the liver—either of those symptoms might have killed her—supposing cirrhosis killed a person it would be a very lingering death—I had not known Mr. Paine before the Thursday morning—he heard that I was a medical man and spoke to me—he gave me the history of the case—he said that he had brought a lady to town to have medical advice—he was pleased to find that there was a medical man in the house—he said the lady was passing as Mrs. Paine—she was under the impression that she was pregnant, he wished me to see her to satisfy her on that point, at the same time telling me that she had been for a length of time addicted to habits of intemperance—we then arranged that I should meet him in the afternoon at 128, Seymour Place—on our arrival I found the lady in bed, and in the presence of Mrs. Powell and himself made the required examination—I found that pregnancy did not exist—the appear<lb></lb>ances were owing to the enlarged condition of the liver, which was rendered more apparent from the pressure caused by the curvature of the spine—I did not prescribe medicinally—I instructed Paine that the stimulants were to be reduced, and that she was to have plenty of light food—I saw her every day from that time to the day of her death—it appeared to me there were occasions when my directions had not been carried out—I spoke to Paine about it, but I cannot remember what be answered—she appeared to me to be improving; in fact, on the Sunday following there was a very marked improvement—I judged that my instructions had not been carried out from her wandering in her speech more than I thought correct—I saw spirits given to her upon the first</p>

               <p>occasion only—I think it was rum which Paine gave her then, mixed with water—he took it from a flat bottle in his, pocket—having poured out the rum, if rum it was, he turned round to me and said, "Now, doctor, I will show you her weakness," upon which she replied, "Lewis, I don't want it"—he then said, "You artful little devil; you would take it if he were not here," meaning myself—when he used that expression, it did not seem as if it were in unkindness, it seemed more as if it were in joke than anything—there was no repulsion on her part towards him—I saw her frequently alone—she never made any complaint, and always spoke of Paine in the kindest way—I am not aware that Paine ever gave her any stimulant after that day—I did not ask her any questions, I was guided by her general appearance—I remember Friday, the 7th of November—I deny that he uncorked a bottle of whisky while I was there—I never saw him uncork any whisky—it is not true that he gave the deceased some, and that I took some too; there is not a word of truth in it—I remember on the morning of the 17th, saying that she would live for twenty years yet—I will explain that—on that morning I found her very bad—her face was dusky and she was complaining of shortness of breath, which I ascertained to arise from congestion of the left lung—for this I ordered a linseed-meal and mustard poultice, and administered to her spoonfuls of hot diluted brandy—at this time Powell came into the room and said audibly, "Anybody can see she is dying"—I said, "No; she is not dying in the sense that you understand dying"—when I called in the evening she had considerably rallied—observation was made again that she was dying, and I, with a view to calm and reassure the patient, said that she might live for twenty years, or as long as any of us—that was not my real view or impression, but was simply given with a view to cheer the patient—I did not expect her to die so suddenly; but still, I was not surprised—she might have rallied and lived for months, perhaps even years—if spirits had been given five days before death inflammation would have been quite distinctly visible—her tongue was always what we call clean, by which I mean not covered with fur;—it was not ulcerated or raw at any time—I know of her having beef tea, I gave her some myself—after my instructions I have seen tumblers, probably containing a third or so of diluted brandy—I ordered no castor oil, nor did I see any—I have been in practice about eighteen years—I prescribed no medicine at all—if any spirits were administered according to my directions they were in water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The administration of raw spirits would produce inflam<lb></lb>mation of the stomach—if the patient had been accustomed to take con<lb></lb>siderable quantities of spirits, it would only intensify the effects—if the administration ceased, I should still expect to find the stomach inflamed at the end of a week or 10 days—assuming that raw spirits had been taken for weeks previously, it would have taken weeks to have recovered from it—the history of her case, as I understood from Paine, was that she had been drinking in excess up to the time I saw her—excessive drinking would produce inflammation of the stomach—I should have expected that the post-mortem examination would have revealed those appearances; even if my instructions had been obeyed, especially in a constitution such as hers, where the power of recovery was so singularly small—it was a very strong stomach—I think a strong stomach would inflame as readily as a weak one, in fact more readily—as a rule, in all cases of persons dying from excessive drinking, I should expect to find the</p>

I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, assistant-surgeon to the Westminster Hospital, and lecturer on forensic medicine at that institution—I have seen a great many cases of excessive drinking—it causes exhaustion of the nervous system, and, following upon that, paralysis of the muscles—it also frequently produces cirrhosis of the liver—I have, by the instructions of the Solicitor to the Treasury, been in Court during this inquiry—I have heard the general history of the case—in my view, Dr. Spurg in has correctly diagnosed the cause of death—I think that death was caused by syncope of the heart, produced by the fatty degeneration which has been described, and also by the nervous exhaustion—it is my opinion that it was a case of "alcoholism"—I think it was dangerous to administer large quantities of spirits to the deceased, either raw or diluted, in the condition in which she was described to be—I have heard that the stomach did not exhibit any sign of inflammation—that evidence rather surprises me—the effect of raw spirits would tend to produce inflammation of the stomach—if it were chronic inflammation the effects would remain a considerable time—if it was acute congestion it might disappear in a few days.</p>

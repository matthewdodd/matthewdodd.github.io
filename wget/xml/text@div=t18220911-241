            . I am a slop-seller. On the 11th of September I was called into the shop to the prisoner; he asked me to buy a chinese palanquin; he said he came from India. He asked 6 s. for it. I looked at it, and said it was British manufacture. I called Mrs. Goldston to look at it; she said it was a sofa cover. He said it was his own, and that he lodged at No. 7, New Gravel-lane. I went there and detained him.</p>

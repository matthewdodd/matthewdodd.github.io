I live in Tooke's-court; about one in the morning of the 4th of January, I met the prisoner; she wanted to entice me to her lodgings; then she proposed to go to my lodgings. I complied with neither of these propositions; then I found her hand in my breeches pocket; she took something out of my pocket; I saw her put something into her bosom, upon which I held her hands, and called the watch; the watch came up, and she was secured; I charged them to take care of her hands that she did not convey out of her bosom what I saw her put there; she was conducted to the watch-house by this man. The constable searched her, and found 4 s. upon her; I proposed that her stays should be taken off; upon taking off her stays and shaking her cloaths, there fell down a guinea, a half guinea, a half crown and a shilling, which with the 4 s. that were found before, made up the money that I missed.</p>

               <p>I had been very ill a great while; I sent to my parents in the country; they sent me up a couple of guineas that very day; I had been and redeemed my stays for 3 s. and that was the change; I had a hole in my stays, and I put the money into my bosom for safety. I was coming by the court and the gentleman laid hold of my hand, and pulled me up the court; he said he would not detain me long; I said I did not know any thing of him, and I did not chuse to stop in such a place to speak to any one; he lifted up his hand and was going to give me a slap in the face, and then said I robbed him; when they found the money they pushed me away, and should not let me say one thing nor another I had not any money to send for any friend.</p>

            . I manage the business for Mr. Special, the horse-boiler. On the 4th or 5th of March, the prisoner, in company with one Crowling, or Cowling, came to me in the boiling-place, at my master's; the mare was then tied I think to the wheel of one of our carts; but I don't know by whom she was tied there. Baker, the prisoner, asked me if I would buy her, and I asked him what he wanted for her; he said, thirty shillings, and I agreed to give him one pound seven shillings and sixpence, as her hide would not fetch much, because she had a bad back. I gave the money to Baker; each held out their hands, and I put into Baker's. The prisoner told me his name was

             when I asked him, and he lived on the green at Tottenham, with one Mr. Hudson. Then Mr. Green came and owned his property at our place the next day. On his coming, I went towards Tottenham, and described the two men, and they were both found at the Bull, at Newington. I saw a drunken man at the door of the Bull, and told him what business we were upon, and asked him if they were there, and he said if we would give him a pint of beer, he would fetch them out, and he brought them both out; they went home to their own place, up a court just by where we took them. The other man said he would not run away, he said, he had nothing to wear but a pair of slippers, and he wanted to get a pair of shoes; the other man ran away. The prisoner said he would not run away, and he did not.</p>

               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

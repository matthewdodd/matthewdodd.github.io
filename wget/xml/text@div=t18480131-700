                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father. I was at home when this matter happened—George was drunk—I saw his head bleeding; that was occasioned by his pitching on his head—my son did not throw the trussel at him and hit him on the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother. I was at home when this happened—George was drunk—he fell, and I saw his head cut—my brother did not throw the trussel at his head—I state positively that the wound was not occasioned by the trussel being thrown at him—he fell himself, from the effects of drink.</p>

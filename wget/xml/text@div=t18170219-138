On the 17th of January, the window-curtains belonging to Berkeley-square were brought to my house; in consequence of what I heard, I went to my house in Berkeley-square, and missed three carpets, a blanket a quilt, and four chairs-the prisoner was taken up two hours afterwards. The next day, I went to my house in Baker-street, and missed two carpets. I went to the prisoner's house with a search-warrant, and found the property there. I had a threatened the prisoner about the curtains, and at night they were sent to me in a parcel.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 17th of January, I apprehended the prisoner. I told him what I took him for - He denied it. On the Monday, I went with a search-warrant to his house, and found two carpets in his loft-the prisoner said it was his house. Mr. Stewart was with me. I then went to No. 4, Bury-street, St. James's, and found three carpets and four chairs-they were laid down as the furniture of the room, and a quilt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190057"></xptr>and two blankets on the bed. I knew this was also the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>-WILMOT. Mrs. Stewart sent me to take down the curtains - I found they were taken down before I got there. I took a bundle to Mr. Stewart's house - I saw the prisoner put curtains into that bundle-It was not out of my sight till I delivered it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Stewart gave me the things.</p>

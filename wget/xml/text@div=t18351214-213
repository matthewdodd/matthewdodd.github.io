                  </hi>. I live in Lime-street, and have a shop in Leaden<lb></lb>hall-market—I have a cellar under the shop, which joins to the Rose and Crown public house—there was a communication between my cellar and the public house, but it was parted off with boards, till a communication was made by some one—about the 1st of December I had twelve phea<lb></lb>sants and eighteen grouse in my shop—I missed them on the morning of the 3rd of December—I afterwards saw the aperture which had been made in my cellar—no one could have got into my cellar without that aperture—It had been partitioned off with egg cases, and they had been brokes down—no one could have got this game otherwise than by that aperture.</p>

On Wednesday night, the 2nd of December, he came to me, and asked for a key and candle, to go into his master's celler, to get a parcel out—I gave him a light and the key of Mr. Hascott's beer-cellar—he could get thought a trap-door from the beer-caller to his master's cellar—this was between ten and eleven o'clock—he returned in ten minutes, with a basket containing eighteen grouse and eight pheasants—he said, "Let them <hi rend="italic">bide</hi> here in the coal-caller till morning"—I said, "There will be a piece of work about them"—he said, "No, there will not"—a bawker came to me the next morning with a basket, and told me to fetch up the things that had been left there the night before—I brought the parcel up to the hawker and he gave me 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver to give to Lawrence—I offered it to Lawerence—he told me to give him 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and keep 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. myself—he said "Hold your tougue, I got the things from Mr. Howard's last night" I said, had I known that he had gone with the intention of getting the things from Mr. Howard's he should not have gone in; and he said he had not been tipsy at the time, it would not have happened—I took the 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and when Mr. Howard came to me, I told him about it.</p>

I am a corn chandler, and live at Blackheath-hill I have a storehouse at Deptford-creek—it is one of the railway arches—this is the padlock of my storehouse—I had a large number of trusses of hay in my storehouse on the evening of 27th June—on last Thursday morning I went with the policeman—I could not positively say that I missed any hay—I had a large quantity, ten loads—I had some sacks shown me, which were marked with my name—they were in the prisoner's stable—he had no</p>

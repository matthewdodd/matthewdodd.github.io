I went into the parlour to speak to company, that were there waiting, and in about two minutes returned to the street-door. I saw the coach-door shut, and the window up. I gave him three shillings, and gave him sixpence over, because he drove expeditiously. Before I went to dinner, I asked the servant for the parcel; the servant answered, she had received none. I went to the coach-stand in Palace Yard, where I knew he belonged to; I knew his coach and person. I offered a reward by an advertisement, which he did not answer; and, on Monday the 29th, my servant saw him, and knew his coach and person, and took his number.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said nothing to me about the parcel being taken out; she gave me my fare, and I went away.</p>

               <p>I board and lodge with Miss Dixon. I was with her in the coach when she purchased the things, and saw them put in. On Monday, the 29th of December, I was going up Piccadilly. I saw the man's coach on the stand, and him on the box. I told him I could swear to his person and coach; and that he had carried a lady and myself from Manchester Buildings to Mr. Patch's, the linen-draper; and that there was a parcel deposited in his coach; and if he would bring that parcel back to us, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140103"></xptr>Manchester Buildings, I was very well convinced the lady, my friend, would reward him, on a proper concession. He then said, that he knew nothing of me; that he had drove the coach only two days.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I produce two pieces of cotton, and a piece of flannel. On the 31st of December, the prisoner was summoned to attend at Bow-street; he was charged with this offence, and he sent me to a muffin-shop, in the Sanctuary, Westminster. I went there, and said I came from Seers, for the parcel; and a young woman said, if I would go with her, she would give it to me. I went with her to Bow-street, the back of George-street; and upon her bed, as she said it was, this piece of flannel lay; and these two pieces were in the box. The things were sworn to before the Justice.</p>

               <p>I took the gentlewomen from Manchester Buildings to a shop in Oxford Road, and brought them back again; then I went to Temple Bar with a gentleman; and after, I had a fare to Tower Hill. I do not know who left the parcel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the prosecutor's wife; I live in the same room with them; he has a box which he keeps his Sunday clothes in. On the Tuesday afternoon the prisoner came and knocked at the door—I opened it, and he asked if Mr. M'Donnell was at home—I said no—he said he came to borrow a hod, he had a job to go to—I said he would not be home till half-past six o'clock—he was standing over the box at the time, and I was splitting some wood—I then heard a noise, and heard the lid of the box fall—I went to strike a light, and he rushed out sideways at the door—he was half-way out before I saw him—about ten minutes afterwards another man came—I had got a light then—he asked for Mr. M'Donnell—he stopped about half an hour—he did not go to the box, I am sure of that—I saw him go out—the prisoner came again that evening, and asked if Mr. M'Donnell was at home—I said he was not, and he went away.</p>

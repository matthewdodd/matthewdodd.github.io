                  </hi>. I have been a friend of the prisoner's. On the night of 21st June, he and I went to a concert—we left rather before 12 o'clock—we went along the road, I was going part of the way home with him—he met a man and stopped—I walked on, thinking he was following me; I found he did not, and I called him and went back to my stable—when I got there I found I had been robbed—my box was open, and a watch, a waistcoat, two pins, and a necktie were gone—I had seen the box safe at hall' past 9 o'clock that night—I saw the prisoner on the following evening—I saw that he had a great deal of money about him, and knowing he had none before, I said to him, "You have been and broken into my stable, George;" he took an oath that he had not done so—next morning, I was told that he was offering a watch for sale, but he stood to it hard and fast that he never had the watch—a few days afterwards I wont to his mother's, and waited there till he came in—I told his father, in his presence, that I</p>

               <p>had been told he had broken into my stable and stolen my watch; he said he would go with me and get the watch—I went with him, and he said he would get me the watch in a fortnight—I allowed him a fortnight, and never went near him till the fortnight was up, and then he said he had not the money—my mother went to his house last Thursday week, I did not go with her—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I can swear to it.</p>

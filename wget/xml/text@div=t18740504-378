                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, of Elizabeth Street, Walworth—about 12.30 on the morning of 29th April, I was was going down the London Road—when I got near the South London Music Hall,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187405040045"></xptr>
               <p>two men overtook me and walked one on each side of me—one of them made a remark about the play there—I turned and looked at them very hard—when we got to the corner of York Street they threw me against the shutters of a shop and picked my pockets—the prisoner was on my left side—I had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in a purse in one of the pockets of my trousers, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the other—after they had pinned me, I called out "Police!" as loud as I could—a policeman came from the opposite side and followed them round the corner—they ran up York Street—the prisoner was after<lb></lb>wards brought back to me—I said that is one of the men—I was afterwards shown this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contained the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I waited until the man was brought back by the police-constable—I did not run after them, because I could not—I saw them run away—I lost sight of the prisoner completely for a minute or two—I am sure I had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon me—I changed a cheque in the morning for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not leave it at home, as I had no one there and I thought it would be safer in my pocket—I saw it safe about 8.30 or 9 o'clock—I was at my niece's from 4 until 11 o'clock on the previous evening—I am sure I had the money safe before I saw the men, because I walked with my hands in my pockets—I had not been into any houses after I left my niece's, and I had only had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin to drink—I will swear I was perfectly sober—I might have had two or three glasses of gin and water.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 201). Between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning of 29th April I was on duty in London Road, and I heard a cry of "Police!" once—I went in the direction of the cry, and I saw the prisoner and a man not in custody holding the prosecutor up against some shutters—it was a moonlight night—I am sure the prisoner was one of them—I went towards them—the prisoner was the first to run away—he was about five or six yards in front of the other man, as they were running down York Street—I followed them and sprang my rattle—they turned up London Street, and I lost sight of them—<hi rend="italic">com</hi> York Street into London Street is only about 40 yards, and that was the only time I lost sight of them—I saw the prisoner again in London Road in custody of 129 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>—altogether that was not two minutes and a half from the time they started—when I got up to him and said "This is the one," he said "You have made a mistake; I only ran because the others ran"—we took him up York Street—the prosecutor identified him at once, and charged him with stealing two purses out of his pocket, one containing 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the prisoner said at the station "I can easily clear myself"—he gave his name William Williams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At the time the prosecutor was pinned against the shutters there were no other people about—when I first saw them they were about 140 yards from me—I said at the police court "I was about 250 yards off when I heard the prosecutor call 'Police!' and the closest I got to the prisoner was about 150 yards"—the prosecutor was very much excited—I said at the police court that he was a little the worse for drink—I did not hear the Magistrate order him out of court and tell him he had been drinking—he was very much excited and he was ordered out of court because he had his hands in his pockets—he was not put in the cells, he went away of his own accord and came back again at 1 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After having given the distances at the Police Court, I went and measured them—it was 140 and not 150 yards from the place where I first saw them, and 90 yards was the nearest I got to the prisoner—the prosecutor was not drunk—he might have had some drink.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 129). While on duty in the London, Road about 12.45 on the morning of 29th April, I heard cries of "Police!"—I proceeded towards the Elephant and Castle a distance of about 200 or 300 yards before I got up to the corner of London Street, London Road—I heard a rattle sprung directly I got to the corner, and the prisoner and a man not in custody came rushing up to the carmen—I got hold of them both and said, "What are you running for?"—I got no reply, and they got away from me—I pursued the prisoner about 30 or 40 yards, and caught him—I do not know which way the other man went—Pepperday then came up and said, "That is the man, hold him! I believe he has, robbed a man up in York Street"—the prisoner said nothing to that—we took him back to the prosecutor who identified him and charged him with stealing his money—we took him to the station—he was searched, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found upon him—I afterwards went over the ground at 4 o'clock in the morning in company of two other constables, and I found this purse there in the condition in which it is now—this part of it I found first lying about thirty yards from the London Road, on the right hand side of the street, in the gutter—the other part of it was very near the place where I first got hold of him, in London Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard the prosecutor give his evidence at the Police Court, and say that he was a commercial traveller out of employment.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he on horse-back, or a foot at that time?</p>
               <p>Howell. He was on horse-back upon the mare, but he leap'd off; we took him again, and carried him before the justice; there we charged him with stealing the mare, he said he had an aunt at Hounslow, and that he took the mare to carry his linnen to have it washed.</p>

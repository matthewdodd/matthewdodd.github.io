                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 4th June I received a communication from a man named Matthews employed in rebuilding Anderton's Hotel, in consequence of which I followed Matthews next morning at 8.25 down Fleet Street, and saw Miles just turn from Barclay's door dressed like a porter, with a canvas apron and a skull cap—he turned into Farringdon Street as Matthews approached, stood on the other side, and I saw Matthews turn up Fleet Street—on 10th June, about 8 am, I watched again, and saw Miles standing at the end of Fleet Lane and the Old Bailey, and looking down Fleet Lane—I left Detective Parsons there, and went to the other end of the lane in Ludgate Hill, which took me about three minutes, and then I saw Miles come out with this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he came towards me and I., said, "Where are you going to take that I am a police-officer"—he said, "To my master at 18a, Giltspur Street"—I said, "Who gave it to you?"—he said, "A man"—I said, "Who?"—he made no reply—I said, "Where did you see the man?"—he said, "About here"—I took him to the station, and found in the parcel 2 dozen bottles of Eno's fruit salt—I then went to the prosecutor's office, Anderson was called in, and I told him he would be charged with stealing a parcel containing 2 dozen of Eno's fruit salt, the property of his masters—he said, "There is another one a-doing of it. at the back"—I said, "Who is it I There is your master, you had better tell</p>

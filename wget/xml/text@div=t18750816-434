                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Brown, a cabman, of 11, Castle Street, Horseferry Road—on the morning of 7th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was in the Horseferry Road and saw Richard Hicks in the custody of two constables—the prisoner was standing in the road—I asked him what the matter was, and he hit me a blow with his hand which cut my lips top and bottom—my mother, Mary Ann Hill, and my sister, Mrs. Hicks, were there—my mother said "Oh, my God, what did you hit my child for like that"—he then struck my mother, she had given him no pro<lb></lb>vocation—I said to her "We will go and report him at the station"—I walked to the station with her, and when we got between Austin Road and Earl Street he knocked my bonnet off and told me to mind I did not lose my comb—my mother stepped back and we walked as far as Mr. Bovett's yard where he heard me say that I should go to the station, and he gave</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160046"></xptr>
               <p>me a blow at the side of my face which knocked me down and my mother as well on the top of me—I did not go to the station, I went no further—I was out at that time of the morning because we had been to see my other sister, Elizabeth Hicks, who had just been confined—she is another brother's wife—I did not go to the station to make the charge, till the next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to the Magistrate the nest morning,' that was after my brother-in-law, Hicks, was in custody for assaulting the police—I live in the same house with my mother and sister-in-law; Mr. Hicks lives at 101, Praed Street—when I came up, my sister was in the custody of another policeman, and upon my asking him quietly what was the matter, he struck me a violent blow on my mouth with no provocation at all—he had his uniform on and I knew he was on duty—Hicks was going quietly with the constable, and thirty or forty people were following—I saw Hicks struck by the policeman but not by the sergeant—I did not see the sergeant Hicks was going quietly, he did nothing to provoke it that I saw—my mother also was knocked down without provocation—I should say if the policeman was not drunk he was mad—I don't know what Hicks was taken for, he was orderly and quiet, and so were the rest of the people as far as I saw—I had not been out with Hicks that night—I did not ask him what was the matter, nor did his wife, or mother-in-law—he is a cabdriver—I did not see Pizey that night, Mrs. Pizey was not with me, but I saw her after she came <hi rend="italic">from the</hi> station—I did not see her struck—there were several people there—I did not see the sergeant draw his staff—I did not hear a cabman say "The b----is drunk, I should like to have him in the square and I would give him a b----good hiding"—my husband was not in the crowd, he was at home when I got home—he did not go the station—I went there next morning with my mother—I did not hear a cabman say "I have a mark on you you b----and I will do for some of you"—there was no shouting in the Horseferry Road—I call forty people a crowd—they smacked Hicks' face and I said "Go quietly or you will be killed."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you said just now that you did not speak to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at first, it was afterwards, when they brought him to the station—I attended the police-court on every occasion—I have not seen much of the cabman since I saw him there on the case—the other cabmen are no acquaintances of mine or my husband, they do not work in tie same yard as my husband.</p>

               <p>a blow and knocked me on top of her—two cabmen came out of the yard and picked us up—I said we will go to the station; the cabmen begged us not, but my daughter went next morning—the prisoner was almost mad I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Only seven or eight people were following my son, and they ware going quietly—when I came up, the first thing I saw was Hicks being struck in a brutal manner by the police—he went quietly—my daughter asked the sergeant what was the matter and he struck her in the mouth—I was knocked down twice by his fist, not with his staff—he struck my daughter as hard as he could, and he struck me so as to fell me to the ground—no bad language was used by the cabman or the people.</p>

I am the wife of James Pizey, a mason, of 31, Rodney Street, Westminster—on 7th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Horseferry Road, and saw Hicks, and I afterwards saw him in custody—I knew him him, and I knew Mrs. Brown—my husband was in front with my baby, and Mr. Hicks was about crossing the road, and he stopped and said "Come along, mother" once or twice, and the two police-men came up him and shoved him—I said "Be off; get along"—he said "I am going home"—they took hold of him, and the sergeant came across and struck Hicks in the face—I said "What a shame to knock a man about like that"—he said "What has that to do with you" and he knocked me down with his hand on my chest—I was going to the station to report him and had got into Vincent Square when I saw three young men in the road—he went up to them and asked them who they were following—they said they were not following anybody, and he struck them with his staff—I cannot say whether he struck all three—he turned into Rochester Row, where he pushed me and struck me across the back of my arm with his staff—I went to the station door to go in to report him, and the policeman said that there were too many in; I could not go in then—I had a bruise from my shoulder to my elbow from the second blow—my husband had gone on with the baby—the staff did not knock me down; it descended on my shoulder, but I was knocked down in Horseferry Road—I went next morning and took out a summons by myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 42). On the night of the alleged assault I was at the station door while the charge was being taken against Hicks—I shut the door and remained outside—three men—and a woman came up and said that they wanted to see the Inspector, I told them that he was engaged taking the charge, and if they waited a few minutes they could see him—they waited about two minutes and then went away—the people out<lb></lb>side were very obstreporous, and were kicking up a noise—I saw the</p>

               <p>defendant there, he did not strike anybody, if he bad I must have seen it—I did not see him drive anybody out of the police-station and run after them up Warwick Street—the door was not opened, and nobody was let into the passage until the charge was read over, and then all the three men had gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Chief Inspector B</hi>). The defendant has been twelve years in the service, he has always borne a very high character, and is a very quiet man—on Friday, 16th July, Sarah Jane Stephens came to the station, that was the same day that the case against the defendant was before the Magistrate—she made a communication to me which I reduced to writing in the book kept for that purpose, which I have here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Greek Street West—my husband is a carpenter—on the Friday on which I went to the police-station and made a report—I was at the Westminster police-court on business of my own, and I never saw any of the parties there before—I saw a woman there, who I afterwards found to be Mrs. Pizey, and a man—who I afterwards found out was Hicks—it was raining—in consequence of what I heard pass between Hicks and the woman, I went to the police-office next door and made a report to the inspector, and he wrote in my presence, in this book, while I was telling it to him—Hicks put his hand in this way to Mrs. Pizey and said "You must stick to it and swear to it and swear that the sergeant struck me when I was in the Row, bidding my mother good night"—I then went in and told what I had heard—I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Cornwall Street, and am a boot maker—on the morning of the 7th July, I was in Rochester Row, between 1 and 2 o'clock, and saw the sergeant there in his uniform—I saw people outside the station, and saw a man put his fist in the sergeant's face, saying that he should like to have him in the square, for it was not him he was frightened of, it was his coat—several men and women were round the sergeant, pushing him about, and he took his staff out at that time, but did not use it—he did not strike anyone—my employer was with me and at his request I made a statement at the police-court.</p>

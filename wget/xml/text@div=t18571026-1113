                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, V</hi> 303). I was on duty on 23rd Aug., near Battersea Bridge. About a quarter past 12 o'clock I heard A noise—I went on the bridge—a young man spoke to me—I cannot recognise him—he complained of an assault, but I did not interfere as I saw no assault committed—I saw Peter O'Brien clapping his hands together, and calling for any b—rascal to fight him—I desired him to go home quietly, and not be making any disturbance there—he said, "Is it for you that I am to go home? I will go home when I think proper"—he still continued to call for any rascal to fight him—I said it was better for him to go home quietly and not get himself into trouble, or I would be obliged to take him to the station—I did not see Simon at that time—Peter went towards home, and Simon joined him, and I followed in the same direction a few yards—I saw them quietly off the bridge—as I was following them, the young man who had spoken to me asked what was the reason I did not take him in charge, and I was explaining it to him—he asked my number, and said he would report me at the station—while I was talking to him Peter O'Brien turned back and came to me—he said he would not go home without fighting some b—rascal, and on that he struck me—I had not interfered with him in any way, except in saying what I have stated—he struck me on the head, and on the shoulder several blows—one of the women returned with him, and she got behind me, and put her arm round my body—Simon O'Brien came up and struck me several times on the left side of the head and the shoulder—one of those blows knocked me down—I fell against the kerb stone of the bridge—when I was down Peter O'Brien got on the top of me,</p>

               <p>and put his hands in my stock—my hat had fallen off—when Peter knelt on me Simon kicked me in the lower part of my stomach at the side while I was lying on the ground—I then became insensible—when I recovered my senses I found a person of the name of Henry near me—soon afterwards two constables of the A division came up—at that time Peter O'Brien had hold with his two hands in my stock—he was shaking my stock, and choking me—I desired him to let go—one of the constables tried to unfasten his hands from my neck, and could not—he then knocked Peter O'Brien down, and by that means his hands got loose—I had got up from the ground, and the two constables assisted me to the station—when the constables had knocked Peter down I found myself up—I was confined to my bed seven or eight weeks—I lost a great quantity of blood by the bowels—that stopped on Sunday week last—I did not know either of the prisoners personally—I might have seen them.</p>

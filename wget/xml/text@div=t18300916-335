               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not own to me that you heard this woman demand the money of me? A. No, I did not; on taking her to the station I said, "What money have you got belonging to Foster?" she said she had 2s.</p>

I met the prosecutor - he was very much in liquor; he desired me to go down Gravel-lane - he bought some fruit, and put it into this handkerchief; we then went to a public-house, and had five pints of gin - the witness and another woman were there; he desired me to go and get some oysters - this woman came and demanded part of the 5s. piece, and she said if I did not give it her she would say I had robbed him.</p>

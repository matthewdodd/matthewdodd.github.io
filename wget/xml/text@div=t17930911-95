               <p>I am a constable; I have got an handkerchief which the prosecutor gave into my possession and have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am positive about my handkerchief; I had my pocket picked about an hour and a half before this; there are three little holes in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will be much obliged to you my lord to hear me. He asked me for two handkerchiefs that he had lost on Ludgate-hill two hours before; the constable would not take charge of me till he broke the handkerchief out of his pocket, tied by a piece of tape; directly as he collared me, he says, I will be revenged now for the two handkerchiefs I have lost. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was it separated from your pocket? - It was not entirely separated, it was on the ground, but it was tied to my pocket by a bit of tape.</p>

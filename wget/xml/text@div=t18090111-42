On Wednesday the 4th of this month, between five and six at night, I saw the prisoner at my window; I saw him lift my shop window open; I was standing behind a screen that parts the shop and the sitting room; he put his hand in and took a silk umbrella from the inside of the window. that was there for sale; when he opened the window a board tell out, it had on it, lodgings for single men; I went out of doors after him into the highway, I could see nothing of him; the next morning I went to Shadwell office and described the man; he had lodged with me; he left his lodgings ever since the 8th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he and you differed about something - A. I never spoke to him after I was married to the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find men for ships - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. They are called crimps - you know the prisoner was a seafaring man - A. He is so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he lodge in the house - A. Two years; he never lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been married to this woman - A. About three months on the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner left your house by your account on the 8th of October - that is just a week after you was married to this woman - when did you take him up - A. On the 7th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your umbrella - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you saw him so plain he could see you, you had lights in the shop I presume - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could see you - A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you prevent him from taking it when he opened the window - A. If I had gone out he would not have taken it.</p>

               <p>MARY - . I am a poor woman, I sell fruit in the street; I have known the prisoner about two years; he lodged in this man's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he lodge after he left there - A. I do not know; as I was going for some coals at past five o'clock in the evening, I saw him look at this man's door, and when I came down the place he past me with an umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether it was his umbrella or whether it belonged to any body else - A. No.</p>

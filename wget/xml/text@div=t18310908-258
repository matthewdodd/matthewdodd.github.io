The prisoner was in my service about eight months, and was employed to receive money, for which he was to account the same day - on the 1st of July I delivered him ten loaves for Mrs. Moore, and on the Tuesday following I gave him some more for her; I saw him no more till the following Friday, when the officer brought him to me - he had 18s. a week, and what bread and flour he wanted for his family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When was the last day he received any money? A. On the Tuesday - I did not offer to the prisoner's wife to take from her the amount he had not accounted for; it was offered, and laid on the counter, but I refused to take it - my barrow had been broken; I did not hear that the prisoner had been drunk in a skittle-ground, till it was stated before the Magistrate - I would not have taken the money his wife offered me, if she had paid me for the barrow; I did not say I would look over this if he would pay the money, and make an apology; I said I would not hurt him on account of his family.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you deliver the prisoner any bread for Mrs. Denby? A. Yes - on the Friday and on the Tuesday; on the 30th of June I delivered him one loaf for Mrs. Lambert - on the 1st of July another - on the 2nd and the 4th one on each day, and she had one on the 5th, which was paid for.</p>
               <p>ANN MOORE. I am the wife of William Moore - we live at Lea-bridge. I received ten loaves of the prisoner on the Friday, and eight on the Tuesday; he brought them, and I paid him 12s. on the Tuesday for his master, to be paid the same day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What time was it? A. About ten or eleven o'clock.</p>

            . I was servant to Mrs. Lambert. On Tuesday, the 5th of July, I took in one loaf of the prisoner - I had taken infive loaves before, and I paid him for the whole six 4s. on account of his master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then bread is not always paid for on delivery? A. No; there was no book kept between us - it depended on his memory and mine; I do not recollect that it had ever happened before, but there was no memorandum between us.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on Friday, the 8th of July - I told him it was for embezzling money and I asked what had become of it; he said he had lost it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not add that he had been into a skittle-ground, and been drunk? A. He did not then, but he did before the Magistrate; he did not say he had been robbed by some person putting their hand into his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. DELVES. The prisoner has never accounted to me for these sums.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any book kept? A. I keep my own books; he does not keep any - he did not say that he had been drunk and been robbed; he sent word on Thursday night by his wife, that he had got a situation, and he would pay me by instalments.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master agreed with my wife and Mrs. Melville to take the money, if I would send a written apology - I sent the money to pay him, and also for the barrow, which was not broken while it was in my care; he took the written apology, read it, and showed it to his wife, and Mrs. Melville put the money down twice, but he would not take it - he said he would if I were discharged, but if not it would do to keep me in prison.</p>
               <p>MR. DELVES. He certainly did send a paper to me with an apology; I said that if he would send a written apology, and say he was sorry and pay the money, I would not have any thing further to do with it, but I was told I should get myself into trouble, and refused to have any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080117"></xptr>more to do with it; I would receive him into my employ again.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

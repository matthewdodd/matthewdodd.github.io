                  </hi> The prisoner is my husband, he is a clockmaker, we live in Compton-street, Clerkenwell, and have been married twenty years. On 26th Jan. I was out with him and my son John—we had been to a friend's house, and had some bread and cheese and a pot of ale and a pot of porter between five of us—we were all sober—in coming home he walked very fast, and was quarrel some, and struck my son, and said he would strike me, but did not—we got to our door about a quarter to one—he said, "D—your eyes, neither of you shall enter these doors to-night"—my son was in the road—the prisoner took the pendulum of a clock from his side and struck me on the head with it—it cut through my bonnet and cut my head—I went to the station, and had it dressed—it is nearly well now.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I was walking with my father and mother—when we got near home I said to my father," Why don't you come home like another man"—he rushed to me and struck me—we were all quite sober—my father had a little to drink, but knew what he was about—I had not struck him—I was in the middle of the road, and could not see what he did to my mother—I saw him lift his hand and heard her cry, "You have cut my head"—I went up; she was bleeding, and her bonnet was cut—he had a pendulum in his hand.</p>

                  </hi> I am assistant to Mr. Taylor, a surgeon of St. John-street-road—I was called to the station to attend Mrs. Crawley, and found her bleeding freely from an incised wound in the head, about an inch long, and rather less than quarter of an inch deep—the edge of this pendulum would have caused it—it was not dangerous then—I did not attend her afterwards.</p>

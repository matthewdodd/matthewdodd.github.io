I had a mare, which was valuable for breeding - I occasionally rode it about the fields - I kept her for breeding; she would have foaled in about six weeks. On the 22d of February the prisoner told me she was ill. On the next day i saw her - She could not move then; I had her killed; she was lying on the ground in the stable. I had seen her a few days before as well as she could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any visible wounds upon her - A. No; she could not stand, she could only move her fore feet - She was quite paralyzed, and groaning very much. When I put my hand on her back she groaned dreadfully, and tried to get up. Seeing her in that situation I ordered her to be killed, and afterwards skinned - She was completely putrified. The prisoner's son was in my service until within four days, or a week before this. I had discharged him about the 12th or 13th of February; for, having ordered him to go and assist the shephered, he told me he would not. The prisoner applied to me to take him again - I refused. He asked me two or three times, but I still refused. He said nothing, but shook his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever desired the prisoner to physic the mare - A. No; her state of body did not require it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Passingham. The prisoner had the care of the mare. On Friday, the 20th of February, it was in the stable. I had seen her two or three days before that, she was very well then. On the 20th the stable-door was open - I was passing by, and saw the prisoner strike her violently twice across the loins with the iron part of a pitchfork. I said, "Gently, Plane, or you will break her back" - She flinched. I did not ask him why he struck her-this was about three o'clock in the afternoon. I saw her again in about half an hour, lying down on the litter. On that evening the prisoner came and asked me to come and help her up, as she was down, and he could not get her up - I went, and got her up; she dropped her hind-part immediately, she could not stand. The prisoner asked me to go and tell my master - I did so. The next morning I saw her again, lying in the stable in the same form. I am sure she never was up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.He sent you to tell your master on the Friday night - A. Yes. She was killed on Monday. I saw her flinch from the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say she was setting on her hannches, and he could not get her up - A. No; he struck her as hard as he could. She was not of a vicious temper.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How high is the roof of the stable- A. Ten feet- there is room for a man to swing a pitchfork.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GILBERT. I am a farrier. On the 19th of February, the prisoner brought the mare to me, and said she was not well, and would neither eat nor drink. I bled her, gave her what I thought proper, and told him to take her home, and give her warm water and mashes, and to keep her warm in the stable. This was necessary.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Passingham. On the 19th of February, after the mare came from the farrier's, I saw her turned into the yard. There was a ditch there with plenty of water-the horses water there. The mare had no clothes on to keep her warm. I saw the prisoner in the afternoon, and asked him how he came to turn her out so? and told him she had been to the cold water. He asked me if the gate was open? I told him it was. She could get at the water if the gate had been shut-it runs through the yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you told him she had been to the cold water, did he walk her about - A. No.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Passingham. I saw the mare on Thursday, when he took her to the farrier's. I was thrashing in the harn - He brought her in to me, and said he was going to take her to the farrier's. He said she was swelled and not well. He then took her. On the next day I saw her, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, lying in the stable. I, and two or three of the men, tried to get her up - We could not get her on her legs - She neighed, and made a groaning. The next day I asked the prisoner how she was? he said she was down and very ill. I asked him if he had given her any thing to cat? he said that was of no consequence, for she would die. The mare was killed on the Monday. I skinned her-her back was mortified and putrified at the loins for a space as large as my hat. I opened her, and took a fine foal from her. She had about a fortnight or three weeks to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge from the wounds what they had been done by - A. It was impossible for me to say, when the mare was down, whether she was bruised, or whether she had bruised herself.</p>
               <p>Q. She was lying on the litter in the stable, how could she bruise herself - A. She was had across the loins. There was no skin knocked off the hip or shoulder.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If you had seen the would, not knowing she had been struck, should you think she wounded herself, or any person had wounded her - A. She could not have bruised herself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does not improper medicine, administered to mares when with foal, occasion death - A. The wounds she received would kill any animal whatever.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SALMON. I am servant to Mr. Passingham. Sometime after the prisoner was discharged, I was walking with him, and talking about the mare, he said he knew the cause of her death. I did not ask him what it was.</p>

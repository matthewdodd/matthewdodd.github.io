            . My mother keeps a haberdasher's shop - the two prisoners came there on the 21st of April - they asked to look at some green satin ribbon - I showed them some in a box - they said that would not do - I then showed them some more - they said that would not do, but Beaton said as they had given me so much trouble Cain might as well have some of the narrow ribbon, as it would do to tie caps with - I then missed a piece of ribbon, and told them they had taken it - Beaton said she was sure she had not, and she ran out of the shop - Cain then said, "I am sure she would not rob you," and then she ran out - I ran after them up Singleton-street, and gave them into custody - this green ribbon was found in the street, and this pink and black were thrown into a grocer's shop.</p>

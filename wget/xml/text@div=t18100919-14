               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, to say that I am totally innocent, in every respect, is not consistent with truth; but the crime of burglary, for which I am charged before you, I solemnly protest I am not guilty off. I will state to you the circumstances as they occurred, and the occasion of my retiring from London. On the 11th of October last, I received samples of these ribbons from a person of the name of Robbins, with whom I had some dealings; on my receiving the samples, it was agreed to meet him the next day at twelve at noon, at the public house of 
               <persName id="t18100919-14-person170">

            , Creed Church-lane; we met accordingly, he bringing with him a box containing the goods, and I not having the sample with me, could not conclude the purchase; he requested me to take care of them; I said, I was not going home; he said, he would take them; he took them to my house and left them. But to say I was about to purchase these goods in a fair and honourable way, would be to deceive the court, and make me appear more culpable; I had every reason to suppose that I was about purchasing goods dishonestly come by; and on my hearing that the officers found the goods in my house I retired from London, by advice of my friends; my absenting myself was not from a consciousness that I was the robber. The goods themselves lay in the most conspicuous part of my house, just as if some person had just brought them; had I stolen them, should not I have concealed them, and left the samples in any careless situation, instead of which, the principle was to be seen; was it not necessary for me to have the samples while the goods were in my possession, samples which shewed the quality of the goods; for this purpose I kept the samples till I purchased the goods, which is usual. And, as I have stated to you before, that the person with whom I was about to purchase the goods, had, in my opinion, come by them dishonestly; he brought the goods to Mr. Hodges, they were taken to my house, and I sealed the box, that I might be sure the box should not be opened: it was sealed in the presence of Mr. Hodges, who is since dead, which the officers can testify; had it been stolen by me, that seal would not have been left in the place. In it such an act, which a man guilty of the crime of burglary would have committed. It is always a presumption, that persons committing robberies are always anxious of getting rid of the goods; this bulk of property was disposed in different quarters, one

Mrs. Jackson, whom I shall entreat your Lordship to call, had part of the property. Is it natural to suppose that I should be the person who committed the robbery, whose interest it was to dispose of them; instead of which there is not the smallest degree of intimation, that I offered them for sale. The officers knew the things in the box, were what they searched for, and unexpectedly these goods were found in my possession twelve days after the robbery, is that a proof that I must have stolen them. Nor was such a key found in my house, at Sandy's-row. And, however blameable I may be for the intent to purchase this property, for which, I had every reason to believe, to be dishonestly stolen; my conscience acquits me of the theft. I trust you will see this transaction in a true light, and that you will not convict me of the capital offence because I am guilty of a crime of less magnitude; and if any doubts are entertained by you, I entreat you that I may have the benefit of that doubt.</p>

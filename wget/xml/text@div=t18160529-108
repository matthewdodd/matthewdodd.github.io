I let them stop there that night, thinking to take them in the morning, when the house was cleared. I stepped into the bar to settle the days accounts, and one thing or another, and on going down the cellar stairs to shut the door, the light blew out, and I was making the best of my way up to my bed room in the dark, when about half way up I was met by the prisoner and his wife, and they said, it was day, and they would not stop in the house any longer, for there were so many men. I had a great many soldiers in the house. I took the prisoners into the tap-room, and called for lights, and several persons came down stairs, and we found a shirt and flannel waistcoat on the prisoners, which belonged to a dragoon that was quartered at my house. I went out, and got the nearest watchman I could.</p>

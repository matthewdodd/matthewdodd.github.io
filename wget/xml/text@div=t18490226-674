                  </hi> I am a dock-labourer. On 11th Dec, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I went into a public-house in Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel—there was to be a raffle, and a young man named Middleton had asked me to come and take the numbers for him—I went up-stairs; there were about twenty men and women there; they began throwing the dice for a silver punch-ladle—the prisoner was there—an elderly female sung a song, and then the prisoner began to sing a song in a foreign language—some of the females began to laugh; he jumped up from his seat, and said, "You d----d b----hes, I will kick your b----d a----s;" they said, "Who do you call b----hes?"—I said, "Friend, take my advice; you are in the wrong, sit down"—he swung his hand round; I saw a polished thing, I cannot say what, and felt a tremendous blow on my fore<lb></lb>head; the blood gushed out; I was insensible, and was taken to the London hospital, and remained eleven weeks—I am sure it was done by the prisoner—I should say he was perfectly sober.</p>

I was present; the prisoner sang a foreign song, and got up, and said, "I will kick your d----d a----s"—I do not know who to, but there were three or four females sitting there-* they said, "Who are you calling b—hes?"—I did not see Seihler do anything, but the prisoner got up, took this instrument (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his pocket, and struck Seihler on the forehead with it—he threw it, and kept the string on his wrist—Seihler fell; the blood flowed; and I went for a policeman—I afterwards picked up the instrument, and gave it to a young man named Smith—the prisoner had been drinking that evening, but I did not see that he was the worse for liquor.</p>

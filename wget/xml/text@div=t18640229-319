                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspecter of the Metropolitan Police; I am now employed by the Mint in detecting persons passing counterfeit, coin—on 24th February, I went with other officers to Charles-square, Hoxton, in consequence of information, and met the five prisoners and another person, a female, walking together, and apparently talking—we went into a passage to conceal ourselves, and as they passed, Fife seized Harding, Webster seized Cameron, and Abbott attempted to seize Baker, who was outside the others; he ran away, and I saw his left hand go in this position, as if throwing something away—Baker and Eveson were walking close together; I heard something drop, and saw that it was a florin, but could not see who dropped it—I seized Eveson, and a gentleman picked up the florin and put it into my hand—I said to Eveson, "I believe you dropped that; is it bad?"—Harding said, "No, I dropped it"—I put my hand in her dress<lb></lb>pocket, and found an empty purse with another bad florin in it—I said, "I have found a florin in her pocket"—she said, "It is a lie"—I put my hand in Harding's pocket, and found two paper packets containing two florins and a half-crown wrapped separately in paper—Baker ran away, and we took the others to the station, where Harding gave his address, 12, Hoxton-square, which was false, though I do not think it was intended to mislead me, as I knew he lived at 12, Hoxton-market—he said, "I will be on my oath this is</p>

               <p>the first time I ever took her out with me to do any of these things"—I then got a lamp, and went to 12, Hoxton-market; but on opening the door, I saw Baker put the candle out with his finger and thumb—there were two other men with him—I said to the officer, "This is the man who got away"—he said, "No, I will be on my oath I have not been out from here since 4 o'clock"—we then went to the station—I then went to Hoxton-square, where I had seen Baker throw something, and at that very spot I saw Inspector Fife pick up a paper packet containing three bad half-crowns—I knew Baker, Abbott, and Cameron before, and have seen them go to Harding's house at different times, and I believe Eveson lives with Harding as his wife at the same place—I also knew them at their previous address—Cameron said the coin was given him by one of the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer's servant, and live at No. 6, Cottage-place, Rumley-street. On 3rd July, about half past 10 o'clock at night, I was going to my own home—as I was passing the corner of Rumley-street, I saw two men standing on the opposite side, against a post in the road; the prisoner is one of them—I had not known him before—I was scarcely five yards from my home; I live in a court, called Cottage-court—as I passed, one of the men, not the prisoner, came behind me, caught me round the neck, and the other one gave me a blow and knocked me down—the prisoner tried to rob me of my watch and money while the other one had me on the ground; we were all three on the ground together—it was the prisoner who knocked me down, he hit me in the stomach—I had a good hard struggle to hold my watch, the prisoner was trying to take it—a window opened on the other side, and the one who had me round the neck got up and ran away, and the prisoner got up and followed as fast as he could—I followed them to the corner of Marshall-street, and then came back to Rumley-street—I followed them down to the corner of the Horseferry-road, and stood to see if I could see a policeman to give them in charge—I could not, and they crossed the road and knocked me down again a second time—that was, I should say, about 180 yards off—I swear the prisoner is one of them, I never lost sight of him; a policeman came, and took him into custody—no other party came up to my assistance—these are the trowsers I had on at the time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the fob is torn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Peter-street, Westminster. On 3rd July, about a quarter past 10 o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another man standing at the corner of Market-street and Earl-street—the prosecutor was hallooing out for a policeman, and the prisoner and another man rushed from the opposite side to him and fought with him—as soon as they heard somebody coming, they felled him to the ground, and ran away—I went to his assistance, a policeman came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge; I had never lost sight of him—the other man ran away—this was in the Horseferry-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Fleming, and lodge at No. 5, Lant-place, Southwark-bridge-road. On Saturday night, the 11th of January, I left home about seven o'clock in the evening—I left nobody in my apartment—I left the window quite down, but not fastened, and the shutters were closed, but not fastened—I left a bundle of linen on the table, rough dry—it was all in a dark cotton apron—I returned about eight o'clock, found the shutters thrown to, but the window half open—any body could get in—the bundle was gone—I have found nothing but one towel, which the policeman found two or three days afterwards—I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live in Little Suffolk-street with my grandmother. The prisoner Richardson lodged at my grandmother's at the time in question, but not Manning—he came there with Richardson when the stolen property was brought to our place, and I had seen him about the street two or three times before. On Saturday, the 11th of January, I went with my grandmother after some money, and when I came home to the corner of the street, the prisoners and a boy named Robert Wheeler ran by me—Richardson had a bundle on his head—they were running towards our place, and ran in-doors—the bundle was very large, wrapped up in a kind of apron—I was standing still, and they ran close by me—it *was between seven and eight o'clock—I went in-doors, asked for a light directly, and went up stairs to Richard<lb></lb>son's room, in consequence of what a woman said, and found him there—I asked him for the light—he would not let me have it till he had done with it—Manning and Wheeler were in the room with him—Richardson put his foot against the door, but I forced my way in—there was a light there—I saw a number of clean things in the room, a shirt, shift, and half a coloured handkerchief, and a number of towels and aprons—the thing they had been wrapped in seemed to be a coloured apron—I said, "Halloo, Richardson, how did you come by them?"—he said they were his sister's—I took the light from him directly—the things were on the floor—Richardson held up the towels and said, "Them towels are of no use to us; they will only <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> us from selling them"—nothing more passed—I went down with the light, and they came just after me—I was not in the room again.</p>

I did not—I can swear to the towel which has been found, because Richardson held it up, and I noticed three holes in it, and a loop at the end.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Monday morning, the 13th of January, I took Manning at his mother's room, No. 6, Market-street, St. George's-market—I searched a room at No. 7, Suffolk-street, but could find nothing there—Richardson was taken by a brother con<lb></lb>stable, and Wheeler was taken—they were all three discharged by the Magistrate, as we could not find any property; but on the Wednesday following, the 15th, I found a towel in the bottom room of the house where Brownutt lives—it is a lodging-house, and they all come down there to wash—there are six or seven lodgers—I found the towel just inside the door, on a little shelf among other dirty things—the prisoners were taken again the next day—on the towel being presented before the Magistrate, Richardson said something—I believe it was taken down in writing—I am not sure, it was before we gave our depositions—it was said in the presence of the Justice—we go round to the clerk to give our depo<lb></lb>sitions, after we have been before the Magistrate—it is all in the same office—it is taken down in the presence of the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Manning</hi>. The policeman said at the office the towel was found up stairs, in the bed-room, and when our commitment was made out, it was said it was found down stairs—he said that was true, and they altered the depo<lb></lb>sitions. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not say it was found in the bed-room—I found no<lb></lb>thing up stairs.</p>

            . I am just turned of eleven. I am servant to Mr. Barrett. He sent me with a bag of plate to St. James's-street, Piccadilly, about a quarter before eight in the morning. I met the prisoner in Castle-street, Holborn; I asked him the way to St. James's-street. The prisoner answered, he would shew me. He said he wanted two shirts fetched in Drury-lane, and if I would fetch them he would give me two-pence. I was to ask for the name of Mrs. Smith, at a house in White Hart-yard, Drury-lane, and if they said any thing I was to say they were for Mr. Smith, a coachman, at Temple-bar. He told me to give him the bag in his hand; he would hold it. I made answer, I will not give you the bag out of my hand; I will take it up stairs with me. The prisoner said, they will not give you the shirts if you go up with the bag; they will not think you come from me. I then said, I will leave the bag on the one pair, and go up to the two pair. I went to the house, and left the bag on the one pair of stairs, and when I came down I saw no bag. I went to the door, and saw no man stand there. I ran out, crying. A man asked me what was the matter. I told him a man had taken my bag. He asked me the description of the man and the bag. He told me he saw a man run up the court with a new damask bag. He took me to Bow-street; there they said it was of no use unless I went to my master, and got the description of the things. I went to my father first, and then to my master, and my master went up to Bow-street. None of the things have been found. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give you the shirt - A. No. They said they knew no such person.</p>

            . On the 22d of February, I was in White Hart yard; I saw the prisoner come out of the house the boy has described, with a bag hanging down. He turned up Round-court, and in about two minutes I saw the boy coming out, crying; he said a man had run away with his bag. I took the boy up to Bow-street, and gave information there, and when the prisoner was taken they sent for me. I am sure that is the man that run out with the bag. He had a drab coat on. There was not a man passed but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HUMPHREYS. The witness and boy came and gave information to me at Bow-street. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070080"></xptr>was several days trying to apprehended him. I did not. After the prisoner was taken he was remanded for another hearing. I took the boy into the lock-up-house, and as soon as the boy opened the door he said that is the man that robbed me.</p>

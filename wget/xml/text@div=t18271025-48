            . I am the wife of Samuel Jones, and lodge in the second floor back room of Thomas Elmer's house - the prisoner lodged in the same house. On the 5th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went out to work; I locked the room door, tried it after me, and took the key with me; I returned soon after twelve o'clock, and found it locked as I had left it, but missed two sheets, a pair of bellows, a cup and saucer; two jugs, a tea-caddy, and three plates, all of which I had left safe in the room when I went out; I saw Fordham find them in the prisoner's room; (looking at the property) these are my bellows - this jug and every thing here is mine.</p>

            . My husband rents this house - it is in the parish of St. Luke. The prisoner lodged in the next room to the prosecutrix; when Jones came home she unlocked her door, and found her room stripped; she came down, and told me she had seen the prisoner with a mug in her hand, similar to hers. I then went into the prisoner's room, and found the crockery on the bed, and my own things were taken out of the room - I sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I leave myself to the mercy of the Court. My husband had left me in distress - I could not get my own living; I had just come out of the hospital, and took this room; I did not take the sheets; a person found them in her own room; she had been in the habit of lending me crockery out of her room - I took a female there, who took the bellows to use.</p>

            . She was in distress; I never lent her any thing but once, that was when she first came - she asked me to lend her a mug to get a pint of beer; I am sure I never lent her any thing else - I am sure I locked the door.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you examined the property? A. Yes - it is common crockery, but I am positive of it - there is no particular mark on it, nor on the bellows; my sheets were thrown into the middle of the room afterwards. I have had the bellows about two months, and am certain of them. I can swear to every thing - this tea-caddy I bought new, about a fortnight before; I used some of the crockery that morning at breakfast.</p>

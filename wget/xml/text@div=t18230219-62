            . I am clerk to Messrs. Russell and Co, carriers of Friday-street. On the 11th of February, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come down the ladder of the adjoining premises, in <placeName id="t18230219-62-crimeloc357">Watling-street</placeName>

He fell on his knees and begged, forgiveness. He said he took it from the ruins; it was partly melted as if it had come from the ruins. Four houses were burnt.</p>

            . I took him in charge. I could not find which house the lead was taken from - he appeared in a distressed and starving state. He was employed there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at work for a bricklayer, who is employed by the Sun-fire-office. He was not there that morning, so I begun clearing away the rubbish, and was bringing the lead round to where the firemen threw it, and was stopped, but did not intend to steal it.</p>

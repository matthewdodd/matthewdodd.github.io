On Thursday, 21st Feb., about 7 o'clock, the prisoners came—Walsh had a great coat on with a stripe on the arm, which means corporal—Jones had red clothes on, a militia man's coat, but no great coat—Walsh produced the billet to me, signed, H. Jones, constable—it is the duty of the police constable on duty at the station to sign billets—Walsh handed it to me and said, "Here is a billet for this man," pointing to Jones, "for seven nights"—I said to Jones, "What will you do, stop here, or be paid out?" Walsh answered for him, "He had rather be out"—I asked Jones what he required—he said 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he went away.</p>

On 22nd Feb., about a quarter past 10 o'clock at night, the prisoners came—I had found a billet at my house, and I produced it to them, and asked them who it was for—they said that it was for Jones—I said, "Are you the man that brought the billet?"—Walsh said, "Yes"—I asked which was going to remain; he said, "Jones"—I asked what he would require, Jones an<lb></lb>swered, "7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I gave Jones the billet, and a pen and ink to write a receipt on the back of it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Walsh said that they belonged to the 20th regiment of militia, and got the billet at the station house—I bad a policeman waiting to take them in charge; he did so—I gave them no money.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, L</hi> 21). On 21st Feb., I was acting inspector at Tower-street station—it was my duty in that capacity to give out billets for the district in which Mr. Brownley lives, and for the whole parish of Lambeth—these are not my signatures, nor are they the sort of billets which we issue—ours are of a different form entirely—there is no one named Hammond who issues billets—no other constables of that division issues billets—to the best of my recollection I have given Walsh billets on one or two occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Walsh. Q.</hi> Is there any secret business passing between you and sergeant Adams on particular occasions, have you ever signed billets out of a red book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I do not recollect seeing a red book—I know sergeant Adams, and know him to be a respectable man—I do not recollect giving him three billets for one on lit or 2nd Feb.—I did not do so—there is no business between him and me—you never left me sixpennyworth, nor sergeant Adams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones.</hi> Sergeant Adams gave our pay sergeant three billets on 1st or 2nd Feb. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Not unless it was done in the regular way of business—we never give billets except when they are applied for, and they are entered in a book—we do not infringe on die publicans—he bad no right to receive three, and I never gave him three—I pledge my oath to that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergecmt</hi>). In consequence of information, I went in plain clothes to Mr. Blanchett's house—I followed the prisoners in—Mr. Blanchett showed them this billet, and asked them where they got it from—Walsh said that he got it from the police office—I then said, "It is false, it is ft forgery, and you must both consider yourselves in my custody."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Walsh. Q.</hi> Did I say that I got it from the police office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, those were your words—Mr. Blanchett did not give it to Jones to sign after that—he had signed it, and it was taken from his hand, and held to you—I saw him write this, "Thomas Clark."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Walsh's Defence.</hi> I was in charge of the recruiting officer for a short time, and during sergeant Adams's absence, I saw this red book with the billets in it signed and dated; I took them out, and saw other billets of put dates, Sept. and Oct., and with different signatures; these two were the only ones for dates to come on; I took them out, and told Jones of it, and we went; I believe sergeant Adams has been carrying on this game some time; I am confident of it; the book has been taken to the police court and signed, and he has taken and done it himself; there is great animosity I between the sergeant and me, and my comrade; we have been courting his wife, in fact, and he has been trying to get us away, and has put this on us; they were laid in our way, and I took the billets, not thinking that it was any harm; I had a good character from my former employer, and was on the road to promotion; within another fortnight I should have been made a full corporal; I have not a scratch against me in the books.</p>

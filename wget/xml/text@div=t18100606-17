In consequence of information on the 10th of May I marked some lead; it was concealed in a cupboard, when I marked it I replaced it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark any solder - A. No, I had some solder in the house I had recently cast it and of that casting I had sold none. On the next morning I was on the watch about six o'clock, I saw the prisoner on my premises, in consequence of that lead being missed that I had marked the night before, I took one of the men into custody, and in consequence of what he said I took this man into custody; I sent for an officer between six and seven o'clock and charged him with the theft. The officer enquired of him whether he had any property of mine or my partner's; he said he had not, we then went to his apartments, No. 11, King's-head-court, Shoreditch, there we found six bars of solder laying in a chair in the parlour and six bars more in a cupboard concealed in the same room; we then returned and brought the prisoner to his room, Armstrong then produced the solder. We had cast the solder a few days before and not sold any, I knew the solder to be mine, this is the mould that made the impression in the sand to cast it in. This is the lead that we found under his own chest in our own workshop.</p>

Sir; I was immediately forced away by the mob, and obliged to quit my hold; they made way for him, and he ran up the Strand; I was prevented from following him; then I staid to get him by the carriage-way, but some of them pushed me under a horse; I never got my watch; I saw him standing about ten minutes; I got assistance, and came up with him in Essex-street; there was a gang of thirty, whom I believe to be his companions; then he put himself into a posture of defence; and said, now, damn you, what will you do? he was secured.</p>
               <p>This was at mid-day, one o'clock? - Yes, noon-day.</p>
               <p>At the time you lost your watch, did you see any motion in him? - I was looking to see him, and he ran away, as I felt my watch slip out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you see him move his hand?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have good people to my character; and I have a good shop in Lombard-court.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Palmer's Folly, Shadwell. I and my sister went out about seven o'clock on the night of the 15th of September—we closed our room after us—the door did not lock—we came home between ten and eleven—I missed from my room the articles stated—the pri<lb></lb>soner had slept in the room two or three nights with my sister—on the following morning I went to her father's, and found the property—she said she had taken them—she is thirteen years old—I am nineteen, and my sister seventeen—the prisoner followed the same occupation as we did with us.</p>

I went with Jane Davis to a cottage in Gun-lane, looked through the window, and saw some pictures among other things inside—there was no one at home then—I waited til the prisoner came home with her father and mother—I asked her if she knew any thing of the pictures—she said she had paid part of the money to Jane Davis to purchase them—Davis said she did not—I found a shawl, a shift, two half-yards of calico, a table-cloth, and a pair of sheets—the prisoner handed me the sheets from a basket under the bed, and said, "These are the sheets"—she afterwards said she took them till they paid her the money they owed her.</p>

            . On the 13th of October, I was obliged to attend the funeral of my wife's mother. I left my home in the care of my children I returned about a quarter before six o'clock, to see that the children were put to bed. My door was locked and I could not get in. After I got in, I found the hasp wrenched off, and the property in question gone. The prisoner Edwards is my brother, and I saw him again last Monday week. I told him what I had lost, and I insisted on his telling me where the key was; and he said I must take hold of the other.</p>

            . I took both the prisoners. I understood the money was lost in guineas, and I said to the prisoner Edwards what have you done with the guineas, he said, he does not know what he has lost, for it was in silver. I said what have you done with it, and he said why, we shared it equally. He said this without either threat or promis held out to him.</p>

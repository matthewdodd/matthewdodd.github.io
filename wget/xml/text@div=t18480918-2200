                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live four miles from Rochester.

Borough, where I had something to drink, and remained till the house clock—they could not let me have a bed there, and I left—I then felt my money safe—I had spent about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went down the street as far as the bridge, see if I could get a lodging—I could not find one, and went and sat on the step of a door for about half an hour—while sitting there the prisoner and two others came up—he said, "What are you doing here? let us see what you have got about you"—I told him to go on, and let me alone—he took me by the collar, and struck me a very violent blow in the mouth, which made it bleed—he put his hand into my waistcoat and trowsers-pockets—my money was in my trowsers-pocket—I called out, "Police!"—the police-sergeant came up, I told him what had happened—the prisoner had then let go of me, and stood about two yards from me—he must have heard what I said to policeman—I told the policeman to take him in charge, he had struck me—i; immediately ran away—my money was goue.</p>

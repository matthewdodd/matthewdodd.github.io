I occupy the house, and live in the front parlour. On Friday, the 11th of February, I went out to work, at ten o'clock in the morning, locking my drawers and my parlour door. There were five sheets, three silver tea-spoons, a table-cloth, a night jacket, and a shift unmade there. I was fetched back about six o'clock the same day. I found my son and daughter there; the door was open when I came home, and two or three people were there. I did not see any appearance of force about the door; it appeared to be unlocked; the drawers were broken open - I lost a cloak, three gowns, and a shawl. The prisoner Eddy's parents live in my first floor: I did not know him till I saw him before the Magistrates.</p>

            . I am a butcher and live in Eagle-street, opposite to Mr. Hill's. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th of February, I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner Leslie go into that house without any thing: he came out, in about ten minutes, with two bundles. I did not see any body ele with him, nor any one join him. I had before that seen a young man go in, dressed in blue, but I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>BEATRICE HATTERSLEY. I live at No. 7, Eagle-street. On Friday, the 11th of February, I was on the first floor, and heard a single knock at the door, at twenty minutes past three o'clock. I answered it, and a young man passed me, dressed in blue: he ran up stairs to the first floor back room; I do not know who he was; he knocked at the room door once or twice, but got no answer; he then ran down stairs, and I called to him and said, "If you please, Sir, have you any message;" he said, "I have no message, I will call again, bye and bye." I did not then know who lived in that room; but I have since heard, it was his father and mother. He went away; I heard the street door shut after him. As he was a stranger to me, I went down, and tried the street door: it was shut safe - Mrs. Hill's parlour door appeared to me to be all safe - I did not try it. I then went to my own room, which is up three pair of stairs - I did not come down again for an hour, when I came down with some dust, I then saw the street door open; I went to shut it, but I saw Mrs. Hill's parlour door open - I did not observe whether it had been forced open; I did no go in, but gave an alarm.</p>

            . I live at No. 34, Eagle-street. I was at Mr. Grice's shop about half-past three or four o'clock on Friday, the 11th of February, and saw a young man in blue go into No. 7; and, in about ten minutes, I saw a man of colour come out with two bundles on his shoulders; one bundle in a white wrapper, and the other in a yellow handkerchief: I then went out of the shop by the street door, and saw somebody who appeared to be the same young man, in blue going on before the man of colour - I watched them, and the one dressed in blue turned into the hair-dresser's; the other went to the bottom of Eagle-street, and turned into Red Lion-street - I do not know who the person in blue was, but believe it to be Eddy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What do you mean by swearing, you believe it to be the prisoner? A. Because I saw him go into the house - I saw him again the next day. I was not told I should see him: it was between half-past three and four o'clock. I have lived in the neighbourhood some time; I have seen the prisoners before; they did not go together now in the street - the one in blue had nothing in his hand. I attended the Magistrates the next day, and another examination in the same week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Did you see the man of colour go into the house? A. I saw him come out - I swear he is the person; I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>BEATRICE HATTERSLEY re-examined. Q. You say you heard the knock, and a young man, in blue, came in, and passed you in the passage - can you tell who it was? A. I did not know him then, and did not see him when he came down; I only called to him. I am sure the person I saw at Hatton-garden is the person who entered the house. I went to Hatton-garden last Wednesday week. I am quite sure he is the same person - I marked him particularly, being a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. At the time you shut the door after him, did you not say that all was quite safe? A. Yes; it appeared so to me; it was an hour after when I came down with the dust, and saw the door open.</p>

On Friday, the 11th of February, I took up the prisoner Eddy, at a public-house, in Eagle-street; he was committed to the New Prison, with two others, but he made his escape in a passage that goes to a New building. I had observed his person, and am certain of him. When he was takn at the public-house I do not know that we stated to him the nature of the charge: he was taken to the office the same night, examined, and committed.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Red Lion-yard, and am a shoemaker. I have seen Leslie three or four years ago; I have entrusted him with bundles many times, to carry for me, which he delivered right, and returned me the money - he has been a servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LESLIE. I was in company with this witness from two o'clock on that day till half-past five o'clock - I never was in the house that I was taken before in all my life.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MEREFIELD re-examined. Q. On the 11th of February were you in company with Leslie? A. Yes, at the sign of the Griffin, at two o'clock - he was there when I went in; I stopped there till a quarter before five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stop all that time? A. He did go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170089"></xptr>out two or three times, but was not absent five minutes each time. I looked at the clock when I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ him to carry a bundle for you? A. Yes; he was to carry it to Portpool-lane; I gave him 6 d. to carry it - it was tied in this handkerchief - I left him in the public-house when I went away: he was to deliver the bundle to Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver it? A. Yes, he did deliver it at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons drinking in the room besides him? A. Yes; three or four persons who I know, and have seen before, because I work for the house.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRICE re-examined. Q. What was the colour of the bundles you saw? A. I did not observe them particularly - they appeared light.</p>
               <p>SARAH ANSLY re-examined. Q. Did you notice the bundles particularly? A. Yes; one was yellow, and one was white.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LESLIE. Most of the men that use that house were hackney coachmen, and have to work for their bread - they cannot be here two days running. Mrs. Hill has women of the town lodging in her house.</p>
               <p>MRS. HILL re-examined. Q. What was the value of all your things? A. About 4 l.; that is a low and moderate value.</p>
               <p>JURY to GRICE. Q. Can you swear to Leslie being the man who came out of the house? A. Yes; I have known him before - it was about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

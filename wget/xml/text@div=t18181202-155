On the 2d of December, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was informed somebody was on my roof, stealing lead, and sent my man up. I sent to Bow-street and got two officers, who took the prisoner into custody. About 9 lbs. of lead were cut off my gutter, which was afterwards compared with the rest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who was taken - A. The prisoner and one Reynolds. They were taken coming out of the next house. I do not know that the prisoner lived there.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was working up stairs in a house opposite the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner standing on the gutters, shifting the tiles with one hand and the lead with the other. I at first thought he was employed there. I went down stairs, returned, and saw him rolling the lead up, and informed the prosecutor. He was gone when I went up again. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was about forty feet from him.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I was sent for and took the prisoner and another, who were coming out of the next house, which was a public-house. I went on the roof of the next house, and got on the prosecutor's roof through the loft. I found a small axe in the loft, which appeared muddy, and four pieces of lead, rolled up in a corner; the edges were bright, as if it was fresh cut; it fitted the gutter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was on the roof, seeing the pigeons fly; some dirt was in the gutter.</p>

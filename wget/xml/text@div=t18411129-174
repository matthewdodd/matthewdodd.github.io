                  </hi>. I live with my father, John Rogers, a bootmaker, in St. Martin's-street, Leicester-square. On the night of the 26th of November, I was by the shop-door—I saw the prisoner unhook the scales from the chain at Mr. Mudie's which is next door—he put them under his arm, and ran away with them—I went into the shop, and told Mrs. Mudie—Frederick Mudie ran out after him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Peter Mudie. I ran after the prisoner, and followed him as far as St. Martin'-lane, when I saw him collared—he had the scales under his arm, which were what we lost, and a weight in them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence</hi>. I was at the corner of Orange-street, Leicester-square—a man came and asked me if I could tell where to sell the scales—I said I did not know—I asked what he wanted for them—he said 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said they were not worth it to me—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, which I gave him for them—I did not run—I walked slowly to the corner of New-street—the policeman saw me, and I gave myself up immediately.</p>

Not more than two minutes elapsed between the scales being lost, and their being found on the prisoner—I saw him going along by the square, but I was not aware he was the same man—I followed an ostler, and he stopped the prisoner in St. Martin's-lane—he was walking very quick up New-street, and when he saw the policeman, he walked away again—there was no time for him to have bought the scales of another man—as soon as the boy cried out, he</p>

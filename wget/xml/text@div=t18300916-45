            . I took up the prisoner on the 21st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160032"></xptr>July - the Magistrate directed me to search the premises; we found the duplicates under the grate among the ashes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is the prisoner married? A. Yes, but her husband is at Sheerness - he never lodged in my house; I have about seven other lodgers, all married people - she took all these articles from her own room, and one other; I have not visited with her at her brother's - I have a son, but she never visited him with me - I never left her to take care of my house, or permitted her to pawn a single article.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband lodged at her house at this time. Witness. She stated at Marlborough-street she had not a husband - that man has a wife and four children at Bath; he came to my house with the prisoner, and they lived together as man and wife.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. How do you know that the person, who lives at Bath, is his wife? A. By her own words - the prisoner's husband is transported to Sheerness; the man, who lived with the prisoner, sleeps in the one pair back room - I have not trumped up this prosecution to get rid of the prisoner; I consider she has robbed me: on my oath the man does not sleep with me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never pawned any thing without her knowledge - she said I might take any thing I pleased; she was sitting playing cards at and drinking in my husband's room when the things were pawned.</p>

            . I produce a bundle, containing this property, which I received from Harding.</p>
               <p>DAVID HARDING. I clean boots and shoes at Mr. Mitchell's house; this is the first bundle which the prisoner gave me; she told me to take it home, and take care of it, as she was going to leave her situation, and wished to live with a single person - I told Mr. Mitchell of it the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not a talk in the house about something being lost before? A. Not that I know of; I do not know whether she had a box to put this bundle into - I did not ask her if she had a bedroom of her own; I took it home, and the next day she gave me the other - I hardly ever changed a word with her; I never did so for any servant-maid before - I had no great regard for her; I have been in the bed-room many a time - I never said I would have brought down the shoes myself, but Mr. Sturz was so sharp; I do not know whether the slippers I burnt would fit Mr. Sturz - there is another gentleman lives in the house; I generally go between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and sometimes in the evening.</p>

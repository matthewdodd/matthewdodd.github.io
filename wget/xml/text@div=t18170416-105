On the 19th of February, about five o'clock in the morning, he was going to take a cart loaded with straw to town. I saw him on the top with a sack on his shoulder. I told him that was the way the barn was robbed. I went and told Mr. Hewinson, who is the bailiff, and brought him back with me. Duffey stood by the cart while I was gone. We found the prisoner had gone, and left the cart in the yard.</p>

            . I am bailiff to Mr. Mellish. The prisoner had received orders to go to town with straw. Hodge fetched me to the barn-yard about half-past five o'clock in the morning. I found the cart there loaded, but the prisoner had left. Duffey was by the cart. I saw the sack in the cart; it contained four bushels of oats-there was quite sufficient in the nose-bags for the horses, ready mixed. I could not find the prisoner. The two men who worked in the barn also absconded. When the prisoner was apprehended, he said, he was sorry for what he had done. He came to his lodgings, on the 10th of March, for his clothes, and they sent for me. I had been there to look for him before, but he had absconded from there. I had got a warrant for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He did not say the thrasher gave him the oats. Hodge gives the corn out for the horses.</p>

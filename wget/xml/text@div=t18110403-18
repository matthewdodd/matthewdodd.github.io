Mrs. Humbleby, saw him go in; I staid at the front of the house and the witness at the back; she saw him come out with the tools, and gave me the alarm. I pursued him and took him, I saw him drop the saw and the plane as he was going through the field; I found the rule in his pocket. The prisoner said he took them to go to work with, and wished us to send him on board the Tender. The saw is worth seven shillings, the rule eighteen pence, and the plane three shillings. They are all my tools.</p>

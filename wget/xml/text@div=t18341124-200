                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Vauxhall. On the 21st of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house—there were persons there—a party at cards was made up—we played at Whist—the prisoner was one—I was one, and there were two other persons played—the cards were dealt, and they wished me to go and fetch the pot of ale for which we were playing—I do not know who asked me to go, but I left my cards on the table, and when I came back the prisoner proposed a bet—he said he had a very excellent hand, and he thought he should win the odd trick—he said, "I will bet I do it"—he looked at me—I said I should not bet—he said he would bet 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a reason why I did not bet—I told him I should not bet—he then proposed it again, still moving his cards about—I said, a third time, I would not bet—he then said I had no money—I told him I had, but I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240223"></xptr>
               <p>did not think proper to bet—he again said, "You have no money, I am sure"—I then produced a bag, in which I had game money, which I took out of my left hand trowsers pocket, and put it on the table—there was a £5 note in it, and sixteen or seventeen sovereigns—I am sure there were sixteen—the prisoner instantly took the bag and said, "I shall retain this till we play the game out, and see whether you win the odd trick or not"—I said I should do no such thing—I put down my cards, and refused to play the game—the prisoner got up and went to the door, taking the money with him—he went out—I had not given him any permission to take up my money, to retain it, or to go out with it—he went out at the side door—I thought he had gone out for a necessary purpose; but he was gone, and the rest of the party immediately followed him—I saw him again in the Strand on the 30th of October, and gave him into custody—I had seen him twice before, but had no acquaintance with him—we had some conversation—I was looking for him when I met him in the Strand—he was taken before the Magistrate, and bailed after three examinations—I have never got my money since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you kept your beer-shop in Vauxhall-road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four years, and upwards—I play at cards at times, but very seldom—many weeks elapse when I do not see a card—we have other amusements when we do not play at cards—we play at quoits and knock-em-down—we play for love, or a pot of beer, or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we generally play so—always—never for more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever play at quoits for any money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have done so, for more than a shilling or two—on one occasion we played for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not at the beer-shop—I was one who played—I won half of the money—I cannot say how long it is ago—about two months, I think—we played at Clapham—the persons we won the money of, were Magnus, a butler, and Buxton, who, I believe, lives on some property—he is not a friend of mine; not at all—I know but little of him—I have known him three or four months—it may be five, not six—I can well swear it, is not twelve months—I never knew he was in the police—I heard he was one of the Union-hall officers—I never heard he was tried for felony—before I kept this beer-shop, I was a publican for three years—I kept the Red Lion, at Lambeth—this game of whist was played in my tap-room—there were only the four persons present who played at it—when the prisoner came in, there were several persons present; but my time expired at ten o'clock, and others left—I had no appointment with the prisoner to come there that afternoon, to play at quoits; none whatever—I do not know John Cotton—I know this person, (<hi rend="italic">a witness</hi>,) but I understood his name was Colton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did you never, in presence of Cotton, appoint the prisoner to come to your house that evening, to play quoits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; but I dare say I can explain it—Ryland came to my house a few days before this, and had several pints of ale with a person at the bar—he then addressed himself to me, and said, was not I a quoits player?—I said I could play, but I was not the best player—he said there was a person at Chelsea, whom he knew, who was anxious to back a man he had against any other, for any sum of money; and if I thought I could play sufficiently, he would get the match for me—I told him I had no objection to see the parties, and if I thought I was able to compete with him, I would play—he told me he would see him that night, and mention it to make an appointment to meet me; and the same afternoon, I received a note from Ryland, (but I have not got it here,) wishing me to meet him at the General Hill, at Chelsea—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240224"></xptr>
               <p>I went and saw Ryland—he said he had seen his friend, and he had pro<lb></lb>mised to be there, and he was agreeable to put down 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to make the match—we waited about two hours, and his friend did not come—he ex<lb></lb>pressed his sorrow, and told me he would see him again, and come to my place on the following Sunday or Monday morning, and let me know what he said—he did not come on either of those days, but he came on the Tuesday evening, the 21st, and said his friend had given him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make the match with me, and if I did not think that sufficient, I was to meet him at the Spotted Dog, in the Strand, at nine o'clock, and there the money would be made up to any sum I pleased—I wished to know on what particulars the match was to be made, and he pretended to find a paper, (but could not,) stating the terms which his friend had written down—the prisoner is a Chelsea carrier, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to tell the Jury, just now, that you seldom play, and then only for a shilling or a pot of beer, when you went to find a stranger to get him to play? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did so, from what the prisoner said—when I play, it depends on chance whether I win or lose—I won the man's 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and kept it—the money had been deposited—when I played at whist with the prisoner, the money had not been deposited—I never said it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you never directed your attorney to apply for the restoration of a sum of money deposited in his hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to my solicitor, and he asked in what manner I should wish it to proceed—I said, as quietly as possible—I did not wish to make any <hi rend="italic">oration</hi> about it—I wanted my money—I did not direct my attorney to apply to him for a sum of money deposited in his hands—I heard his clerk had written—it was on the 21st I lost this money, and I went to the attorney the next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did Mr. Humphreys know where to find him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not know—he wished me to make inquiries—I understood his cart came to the Spotted Dog in the Strand—I went there and got the address, and then I went to Mr. Humphreys directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, on the 22nd of October, you knew that he lived at No. 1, Cheyne-row, Chelsea, why did you not go to the cart and take him di<lb></lb>rectly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not drive the cart, for I watched for several days after Mr. Humphreys showed me his answer—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sir, In answer to your application to me, of the 23rd, I beg to inform you, as a solicitor, I had no money, as stated by you, deposited in my hands by Mr. C. Ireland. I have been advised to answer your letter, and inform you of the same, as whatever inconvenience I may be put to in consequence, all parties con<lb></lb>cerned shall have due notice previous to their illegal proceeding, as threat<lb></lb>ened by you;—further, if it is the intention of you to proceed, after this no<lb></lb>tice, (if by bailable process,) my solicitor will give an undertaking to your officer, if you will inform me his name, or will receive any process for me, which will prevent your sending so far.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you apprehend him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I believe it was on the 30th of October—I cannot say when I spoke to the police about it—I spoke to two or three—I took him on the 30th, a little before he got to the Spotted Dog.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now did not you before the Magistrate state, in the pretence of Mr. Wontner, that you gave no information to any officer, till after you had taken the man into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that I did—I do not believe I did—I should expect that if I had been asked the question, I should have said I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you state in the presence of Mr. Wontner, and on his cross-examination</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240225"></xptr>
               <p>of you, that you went for no warrant to have him apprehended because you did not know where to find him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he ask you how it was, if you did not intend, nor make any bet, that you put your money on the table? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not make any bet with this man—I put the money on the table to show I had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to state that you (under all the circumstances that you have now explained) was induced to put the money merely to satisfy an almost entire stranger that you had got money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was my motive—that was the first game we played—we did not play it out—I did not play twenty games afterwards with him—decidedly not—I did not bet ten to one on the odd trick—I did not lose any money after I had lost the bag.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were first before the Magistrate, did you state that the prisoner went out of the house alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He went out frequently—he went out alone—I found Grinham was coming to give evidence—I had him taken by the Magistrate's direction—Mr. Minshull was the Magistrate—I did not state, when Grinham was before the Magistrate, that he and the prisoner went away together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you did not, at the first examination, state that the prisoner went away alone, and afterwards say that he and Grinham went away together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I could not—I do not believe I could say it, I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the Magistrate and his clerk both fern to your de<lb></lb>position, and tell you that you had sworn that the prisoner went away alone, and discharge Grinham instantly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They discharged him be<lb></lb>cause none of the money was found on him—there was some remark made by one of them—he was not discharged because I at first swore that the prisoner went away alone, and afterwards that Grinham went him—I have seen Grinham about—he was one who was playing at whist, and Shillitoe was the other—I did not have Grinham taken up to prevent his coming forward—I have known him four or five yean—he was not a very intimate acquaintance, but was frequently calling in—I did not lend Grin<lb></lb>ham money to play, that I will swear—I did not lend him any money that night, that I know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you did not lend him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not lend him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or any money whatever—he had no money of mine at til that night, to my knowledge—I do not think I could lend him any money, and have forgotten it—I swear positively I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask the prisoner whether he would bet twenty to one upon the odd trick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not ask him alter that if he would bet ten to one—I did not tell him he was no sporting man—it was between ten and eleven o'clock when I lost my money—I did not con<lb></lb>tinue to play till between one and two o'clock—I did not play for stakes varying from 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was Mr. Humphreys to suppose that this money had been deposited by you in the prisoner's hands, if you had not told him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was not at home—his son was—this letter is not stating what I told him—I did not tell Mr.. Humphreys, Senr., that his son had written the letter according to my direction—I did not know whether it was his son or his clerk—I said the letter was according to my di<lb></lb>rection, but I never said the money was deposited—it was laid on the table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Wontner read this note of Mr. Humphreys, describing</p>

               <p>the mode in which the money was deposited, before the Magistrate, to you, and did not you state it had been written in those terms by your direc<lb></lb>tion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was to that effect, that it had been written by my orders. I did not state the terms were by my direction—I did not dictate the letter—I did not tell the Magistrate it had been written in these terms by my direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that the prisoner went out of the room, as you sup<lb></lb>posed, for a necessary purpose, but before he went, he said he should keep this till the game was played out—I suppose you did not ask him what he was going out for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I went out in a minute or two after<lb></lb>wards—I found at the Spotted Dog, that he lived in Cheyne-row—I did not go to his house—I thought I should not be able to find him—I was at a loss how to proceed—I have not seen Buxton here to-day—I did not employ him at all in this transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that the cards were dealt—that you left yours on the table, and went to get a pot of ale—upon your oath, when you were before the Magistrate did you state that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—I do not know—if I had been asked the question I should—I believe my cards had been improperly dealt with while I was out—I do not know whether I said a word about that before the Magistrate—I should expect I did, for I stated every particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the first occasion before the Magistrate, did you say a single syllable about your having been playing at any game whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider that I must—I explained how the thing occurred—I will swear I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, upon the second examination, did not Mr. Min<lb></lb>shull complain of your having omitted to state any thing about the game till you came to the second examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard any com<lb></lb>plaint.</p>

               <p>the odd trick—the prosecutor never refused to bet—he generally proposed to bet—at one time, there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. betted on the odd trick—the prisoner won it, and it was paid—it was laid down on the table—they went on playing for two or three hours after, and the prosecutor still kept betting on the odd trick, as before—he lost, but I do not know how much—it is not true that he produced some money, upon the prisoner saying that he had not got any, and that the prisoner snatched it up, and ran away with it—no such thing occurred—the prisoner did not take up any money, and, go away with it—he was not so anxious to bet as the prosecutor was—there is no truth in what the prosecutor has sworn, that he only played part of a game—that he did not play out—he continued to play till one or two in the morning.</p>

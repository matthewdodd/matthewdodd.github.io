               <p>Q. Did he know you had a peace-officer with you? - A. Yes; I looked at the upper leathers, and found them to be my own; there were twenty-four pair of upper leathers besides fifteen or sixteen pair that he ought to have had.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he had not had them for the purpose of his business? - A. Yes; he could not have had them without the bottom stuff, and those had not; we often deliver out bottom stuff without upper-leathers.</p>
               <p>Q. But never upper leathers without bottom stuff? - A. Very rarely; my man is here that delivered them out, his name is Simpson; the upper leathers have the initials of my name, 8. M.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any other person deliver out besides Simpson? - A. It is usually by him, it is rarely other wise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the sole of a shoe? - A. Yes, at Mr. Godwin's, near the Obelisk, to whom the prisoner had sold it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Whether you here confident that no body has given out the work besides the person appointed for the express purpose? - A. I before stated that I am not confident of it.</p>
               <p>JAMES SIMPSON sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Miller: I delivered out the work to the journeymen.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the articles that were found at the lodging of the prisoner? - A. Yes, they are upper leathers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those upper leathers your master's property? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you delivered them to the prisoner for the purpose of working them up? - A.Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deliver upper leathers with the bottom stuff to journeymen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever deliver them without the bottom stuff? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it out of the ordinary course of trade so to do? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q.Can you positively say you never gave out any upper leathers, to any person that works for Mr. Miller, without the bottom stuff? - A. I cannot positively say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not remember your having some returned to you by a person of the name of Lediard, that you had given over the number? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am foreman to Mr. Godwin, shoe-maker, in Blackfriars-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember buying any leather of him? - A. Yes, Boreham has got it; I bought eleven pair of shoes of him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110014"></xptr>Luke. I delivered those shoes to Mr. Miller, they have my mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Barahem. These are the shoes I received from Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Miller. These are the shoes that I had from Luke, one of the soles has my stamp mark upon it, by which I know it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you delivered to the prisoner that sole? - A. To manufacture for me I certainly had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordship, Gentleman of the Jury, as I am called upon for my defence, I shall endeavour to he as concise as I can; near two years since I began to work for Mr. Miller, and from that time to this I have every reason to believe I did him all that justice which he could expect from me as a journeyman; about the middle of January, or March last, these very upper leathers I am charged with stealing, were given to me in addition to the usual quantity of work; he gave me out a dozen upper leathers with half a dozen of bottom stuff, I made up the work; I conceived it was done for the purpose of trying my honesty, but certain I was that either that was the case, or it was a mistake; in a short time the same circumstance occured again, and I declare I am as innocent of the charge as the learned Judge upon the bench; they were given out to me in that manner I positively declare; and with respect to the sole, your Lordship will pardon me, I am sure it is better calculated to provoke the mind of any man rather than to alarm; I would ask, how could I steal one sole? I declare, all the time I worked for Mr. Miller there was not one sole in the shop, how could he insinuate that I came by that one sole? I believe he has taken upon him to swear to that sole, but it is a very difficult matter, for there are slaws in soles, so that it is impossible; and I caution Mr. Miller, the prosecutor, how he encourages himself to persist in it, for I am persuaded he will have enough to do to stifle the stings of his own conscience; there was no sole leather kept in the shop; in the name of God then, how could I steal it? the leather is given out in large pieces, according as the shoe runs, and when that piece of leather is designed for eight or nine pair, it will sometimes turn out to such advantage that it will sometimes deceive ourselves, and then do they ask this to be returned? certainly they do not. When I began my defence, I told you I should be concise; my defence is somewhat incorrect from the agitation of my mind; I now return you, my Lord, my most hearty thanks for your manner of examining the witnesses, and I wait with heart-felt impressions the verdict of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Miller.) Q. Do you never sell leather after it is stamped? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Are the soles given out in a piece of leather, or cut out in soles? - A. It is frequently given out in a piece of leather.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, is it not possible he might have stretched the leather so as to get a pair of soles out of them? - A. It is possible by paring them close.</p>

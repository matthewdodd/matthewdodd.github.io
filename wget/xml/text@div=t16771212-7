The woman had been an old Offender, and now no less than nine or ten Indictments found against her for Felonies; being so frugal and industrious, as first to steal Plate, and afterwards make Money of it, to save the trouble of Exchange and the charge of Coynage. Yet as cunning as she was, she became accessary to her own Discovery: For upon promise of Secrecy, she tells an acquaintance that she knew some persons that had store of Cash, and were resolved to set up a private Mint; and she would order it so, that he should surprize them at work, and then get a good sum for concealment, wherein she was to go snips. He seemingly consents, but honestly imparts it to a Gentleman to whose care and office it belongs to inspect such offences. Several times she came to him, and sometimes brought him new-coyn'd Counterfeit-money to put off; but still on pretences the business was not ripe, and perhaps then somewhat distrusting him, delay'd the Discovery; so that at last having learnt that she had taken a house about <placeName id="t16771212-7-crimeloc23">Hounslow</placeName>

She did not much deny the Fact, but wholly clear'd him (to whom not above a fortnight before she had been married) protesting that he was not privie to any of her actions of that kinde. The Court asking the man upon his Tryal whether he were content to part with his Wife, he, like a kind Husband, replied, I am very willing the Law should have its course: Better one than both.

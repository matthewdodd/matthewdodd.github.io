               <p>WILLIAM SAUCUTT. On the 17th of July, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in <placeName id="t18270913-249-crimeloc1408">Leonard-street, Shoreditch</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not take liberties with her? A. I spoke to her - I asked who she was waiting for - she said her friend had got her key, and she could not get in; nothing more passed - I am a cabinet-maker - I was not in liquor at all - I did not ask her to go to a house with me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard a call of Watch! and took her in charge - the prosecutor appeared sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear her say she was a respectable person, and he had no business to speak to her? A. No - she said he was not robbed, he had got his property again.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had taken very indecent liberties with her, and as she had resented them, he charged her with the robbery.</p>

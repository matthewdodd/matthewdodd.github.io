                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Indian army—on 10th December I had arranged to meet a lady in Cork-street, who was coming there in a cab—I had some money to pay her—it was half-past 5 o'clock—the prisoner drove her cab, and when I drew out my purse to pay her the prisoner was standing in the pathway, almost touching me, under the light of the street lamp—I had ten 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in my purse, which 1 had received that afternoon at 2 o'clock at the Bank of England—I saw them in my purse when I held it under the light of the lamp, to pick the silver out—the lady attracted my attention by asking me what the cabman's fare was—I told her about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I shut up my purse without thinking, and put it in my pocket—it was a <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>—the notes were in one compartment, and the silver in the other—I walked away, and about five yards from the cab met a gentleman who I knew—I stopped and talked to him, and while doing so the cab drove away—I then went into a shop to buy something, and missed the notes—I went back, and searched the gutter, but could not trace them—I had taken the numbers of them—these six produced are six of them, the other four have not been notified to me as having been passed into the Bank of England yet—I told the prisoner to drive the lady to Oxford-circus.</p>

               <p>was a police-constable—he said, "I expected that"—I asked him why—he made no reply, and I told him I had come to charge him with stealing ten 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I asked him if he had passed one at the "Ambassador" public-house, as I had traced it from the Bank to him—he said, "Yes, I did not steal the notes, I found them; I saw the gentleman kick them; and thought it was a bundle of cattle-show bills, and pot it in my pocket, and I did not know it was not, till I got home"—I had not said any thing about any gentleman before that—he told me he had passed another at the "Globe" public-house, Gray's-inn-lane, which I found was true—I did not find the notes—I traced some of them to him; and at the police-court next morning, he told me he had passed four more at Mr. Bailey's, Thomas-street, Oxford-street</p>

             came up to me and bid me stand and deliver; I asked him what I was to deliver, he told me either my money or my life, I told him I had very little money only a few halfpence, and if he would have patience I would give him them; he then said, damn you, where is your watch, I said, gentlemen, I have no watch, he immediately tore off a button of my breeches, and put his hand into my breeches pocket; than he began beating me with a stick very violently, I tried to wrest the stick out of his hand, I said for God's sake do not use me ill, gentlemen, for I cannot see; then the other man said come along, and they both left me; directly I heard a voice cry stop them; and I came back out of the path into Whitechapel, and I asked somebody where the people were that cried stop him; when I came up, Mr. Upsall had got him into custody; I cannot know him by sight; but I shall know him by his speech, because I took particular notice; when I was going before the magistrate I put my hand to my side, and I felt it wet, and I found my shirt was all blood, and I found there was a hole cut there, even to my skin.</p>

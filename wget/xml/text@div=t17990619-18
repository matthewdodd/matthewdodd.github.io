               <p>Q. Was he arrested at your suit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In February last did you see him? - A. Yes; he was at the Lock-up-house in Grays-Inn-lane, he then owed me forty pounds; I went to him, Mr. Barrett was present, who had been his partner, he advanced fourteen pounds in part of the debt, and, says he, I have got a twenty-five pounds note on Count Wedel, the Danish Ambassador's son; with that fourteen pounds, and twenty-five pounds, I thought I should be well off, he offered me the note out of his pocket-book; I gave it to Mr. Ford, I did not mark it, but I know it from a thousand; I am sure that is the note; I gave him his discharge, and when he was out of the Lock-up-house, says he, it is a very good one, and when it is due I will go with you and fetch the money. I went on the Saturday before it was due, and told the young Count I had brought a note of twenty-five pounds; he then said, I am not of age, I shall not pay the note; I went up stairs to him, and says he, I did not give my note; says I, will you be kind enough to write your name on a piece of paper, which he did; says I it resembles this note; the old gentleman, the father, was going to take me by the collar, and put me out of the room-upon my soul it is true - I wish I had that bit of paper now.

               <p>Q. Did the young Count say, I shall not pay the note, before, or after your producing it? - A. He said it as soon as ever I told him I had a note; I had not taken it out of my pocket, I told him I had a note of twenty-five pounds.</p>

Count Wedel came to him, and told him he was in want of forty pounds; he took him to his friend, who lent it him; on the morrow this note was paid to his friend: Count Wedel can write three or four different hands, fearful his father should know his hand-writing: after that he lent Count Wedel twenty-five pounds, and the note which he paid him he gave to

            : Count Wedel denied it being his signature, and so he has been arrested in consequence of that note. Count Wedel has three or four different signatures, fearful of his father being displeased with him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marshall.) The prisoner says, he gave you a note at another time? - A. He did, my Lord, it was fifty-nine pounds, drawn on Count Wedel, and paid at Thellusson's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Count Frederick.) The witness has said, your brother has two or three manners of signing his name; do you know any thing of it? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Nitcsh.) Do you know any thing of Count Wedel having two or three methods of signing his name? - A. No, my Lord, only one that I know of.</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The prisoner says, he supposes the Count never alters his hand-writing before the persons of the house, or before the persons that are with him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marshall.) Was the first note drawn by Count Wedel, or upon him? - A. I am not sure whether it was Count Wedel or his father it belonged to, it was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether it was drawn upon him or by him? - A. I don't know whether it was upon him or his father.</p>

               <p>Marshall. It is exactly so, and he told me the Count's mother would send money from abroad to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190021"></xptr>pay the note; says he, perhaps it may not be paid then, but in a few days after; that the money might be sent by his mother from abroad.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Were father and son both present when you presented it? - A.Both in the dining-room, and were going to put me out of the window, because I said, it was exactly like that he wrote on the piece of paper: the son was even so exasperated, that he threatened to throw me out of the window, and I was obliged to call for assistance. I would give a guinea if I had that bit of paper now that I asked him to write his name upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the young man did not refuse to pay it before he was in a rage? - A. There was something of that sort, I was then in the passage along with the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing of that sort - did you hear it? - A.Upon my soul, I did; says he, I cannot pay it, I am not of age; and I told the servant I would keep it till he was of age; I had not produced it, but told him I had it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When he saw it, he denied it? - A. Yes.</p>

            , Esq. Member of Parliament, who lives in Upper Harley-street; I have left him three days; I know the prisoner perfectly well, and I know the Count and his brother by fight; I have seen them at the prisoner's house repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any money transactions between Count Hermendt and the prisoner? - A. Somewhere about the latter end of November, or beginning of December last, I was writing out a bill of fare for the prisoner, and I think, he came and took away the pen and ink from me; these gentlemen were in another room, and were there for a considerable time; after having been there some time, I heard very high words, as if they were in anger with each other; I was called in; the conversation was then in French; the young gentleman wished to change it; the prisoner called me in, and the gentlemen changed the conversation into French; some part of the noise of words I had heard were in English, and when I was called in, it was turned to French immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sufficiently acquainted with the French language to tell us, whether there was any conversation about cash or notes? - A. I am not conversant in French, but, as far as I do know, I am almost certain there was a conversation about money transactions; there was one thing particular; there was another person in the room, whom I did not know, and who ought to be here; he was brought in as a witness by the prisoner; the prisoner was present, and that young gentleman; I asked the cause of all this; he said, it was concerning the note and pocket-book that was lost during the time he was with them, but he could not tell the manner in which it was lost; it was a note for ninety odd pounds; this person was called upon, who said, he had seen the note, and advised them to make another; they wrote another as a substitute for that which was lost; that was the ground of the quarrel; afterwards, however, every thing was quiet, and the gentlemen came to the adjoining room where I had been writing, and they told me they had been angry on all sides, but they had settled it, and hoped I would say nothing about it, and made me a present to hold my tongue; I received two shillings to keep the secret.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Count Frederick.) You have heard what that witness has said? - A. The whole is a swindling piece of business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were you a servant in the prisoner's house? - A. I was not, I went merely to assist him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Dupont? - A.No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever called yourself so? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you then been acquainted with the prisoner? - A. Not quite so much as three months, about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you converse with him? - A. Yes, almost every day, for five or six hours.</p>
               <p>Q. As you went to assist him, did you take your orders from him? - A. I might do as I pleased; I did it merely as a friend, not as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had a regard and friendship for him? - A. I had, in consequence of a friend of mine knowing him longer than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you converse? - A. But indifferently, I not understanding French, and he not English.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not understand what he said to you? - A. I understood at times what he said, and at times I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you understood him, were not those the times he talked English? - A.Certainly; he talked English so far, that after I had been there some time, I understood him, but not so well at first.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he converse with his customers, in English? - A. He did, but in bad English.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you converse with him on every subject? - A. On matters that might occur about the news of the day.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he did not understand you when you spoke in English? - A. He improves in English.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what occurred, in any other language? - A. I spoke a little in both, but very imperfectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190022"></xptr>Q. Did you understand French when you went first? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, in what language did you converse with him? - A. I could not very well converse with him; there were people in the house that understood English better than him, and they acted as interpreters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever employ any body to interpret for him? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the usual practice? - A. In general it was: when I did not understand him, I applied to those who did; every conversation that passed between us must be very imperfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he cannot talk English very fluently? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was capable of stating that examination in English? - A. I don't think he could comprehend the true sense of it, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you here when the Magistrate was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you now swear he was not capable of of understanding that in English? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were present when you were called into the room? - A.Those two gentlemen, the prisoner, and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell his name? - A.Probably the prisoner may tell, I do not know, I never saw him but twice, and both times at the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. It passed about December? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not his name Dupont? A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not hear him called Dupont? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He had some name? - A.Most undoubtedly</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought him there? - A. I don't know, I believe the prisoner; I think once I saw him come in, and once he was in the room when I entered.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay? - A. One time, I believe, about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared like a foreigner? - A. He was not English.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to pledge your oath you did not hear him called Dupont? - A. To my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever called by his name when he was there? - A. I don't recollect he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not introduced as Mr. Dupont? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was not called Dupont? A. I had no suspicion of any thing of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. What suspicion have you about his name being Dupont? - A. I don't know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he was not called Dupont? - A. I think he was not, but I will not take an oath.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did he call upon? - A. I believe the prisoner went out with him about this dispute.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he been before? - A. I cannot tell; it was concerning the note they conversed; I could not comprehend exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since that man went into the country? - A. I don't know, I was at Bath, but I have heard he is out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination of the prisoner? - A. I never saw him since his commitment till yesterday; I was in a confined situation, being in service.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear he was in prison A. I cannot say exactly say when it was, but I think it was in February that I heard he was arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go him? - A. I could not go, I was at Bath; a friend of mine wrote to me, and mentioned it in the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to him? - A. I had a respect for the man, and I wished to see him.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to know he was in Newgate? - A. He wrote by a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in town? - A. About six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive information from your friend he was in Newgate? - A.Ever since I have been in town, but I was contined; I received information the very day he came here; I never called or saw him till yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call in consequence of any desire, or on your own suggestion? - A. He desired to see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mention this circumstance to any body, or whatever you have heard of those two gentlemen, and about the note? - A. I have mentioned it to every body I know, and that knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you mention it first? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it directly? - A. Yes, after my understanding it was a forgery; I had too good an opinion of the prisoner to believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you see any note written by those gentlemen? - A. I did not see the note my self.</p>
               <p>Q. You swore they wrote a note? - A. They came to me for ink.</p>
               <p>Q. They were advised to write another? - A. That is as I am informed, I did not see the note; every thing was carried on privately.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is only from information that you knew upon what subject they were talking? - A. Principally by information.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you upon what subject they were talking, and upon what subject they met? - A. The prisoner told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to be secret? - A. That gen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190023"></xptr>tleman; he said, there had been a dispute, and hoped I would take no notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they know you before? - A. They had seen me once or twice in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they employ him in the confectionary way? - A. I don't know that they did; I think not, but cannot swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they ever conversed with you before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They gave you two shillings to keep a secret? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you heard any secret? - A. Not that I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk French, or join them in conversation at all? - A. No, I promised I would not mention it, and I would not now, except to save the man's life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you publish this story to every body you knew? - A. You asked me if I knew of those transactions you mentioned; I said, I did; it was not for the transactions, but for the quarrel I received the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not receive the money to keep the money transactions secret, but to keep the quarrel secret - was that the reason? - A. I don't know really, it might be for both.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Count Frederick). Do you remember the transaction the last witness has mentioned - you have heard of the bill of fifty-nine pounds said to be given by your brother - do you happen to be acquainted with that transaction? - A. Yes, I was; my brother's name was not upon the note; the bill was drawn upon Thellusson, and came from abroad.</p>
               <p>Q.For what purpose was that note put into the hands of the prisoner? - A. It was a commission, we intended to pay him the money; the debt was only forty-eight pounds, but there was a commission, ten pounds, and we gave him the difference.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom was that debt due? - A. We promised not to tell; if the prisoner chuses to mention it, he knows that it was none of our debts, but some body's else; it was neither myself or brother's, but a commission.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about a bill of ninety pounds? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of losing a pocket-book? - A. If you will give me leave, I will state that. About six weeks before that, he sent a letter, inclosing a promissory note; he sent a letter written in English, and a note, requesting an acceptance, saying, he could get the money for it; and that in the course of six weeks he should get the money; we signed the note for him at six weeks, upon which, some days after the six weeks were elapsed, he came with another note of fifty-eight pounds, upon which we asked him to give us back our note: we frequently went to him to get our note back, but he always had some excuse, saying, he could not get it, the gentleman would not give him the money for it, and would not let us know where it was, which made us suspect it would not be returned, this was after the six weeks: then we happened to want some money, and we asked him if he would lend us forty pounds for a little while; he said, yes, he would; then he said, he would certainly give it us, only he had spent some of it, about ten or twenty pounds; he said, he knew a gentleman who would lend us forty pounds; we went to that gentleman, and told him we would be very much obliged to him to get us forty pounds; about twelve o'clock the gentleman came with about thirty pounds, or something near; I believe he mentioned some name that commenced with an H; we asked him to make up the forty pounds; he then made up a story that he had lost his pocket-book; after this we went away, and we promised we would return it the same evening, about eight or nine o'clock; we came to the prisoner's house to Mr.

            and returned the thirty pounds, and he returned the note, and we gave him a guinea; we begged of the prisoner not to detain our note, he always having some excuse; at last we heard he had offered to sell it for a much less price than the value of the note; we asked him about it, and he swore he never shewed the note to any body; we heard he presented the note: after that a gentleman came and told us he offered to sell the note to him; we told him that we would call that person for a witness, and that we knew he had the note in his house; he then got in a passion, and swore that the note was not in the house, and that if he had it, he would return it; this was the dispute about which the other witness spoke: we told him we would take him up if he did not return it, upon which he called in that gentleman, and we thought it right to call the other gentleman who told us he wanted to sell the note; he fetched him, and at last he went up stairs to a little garret, and brought us the note out of a pocket-book: after this, we told him it was a swindling piece of business, and we could have had him taken up and punished, but we would pardon him, if he would promise not to do any thing like is again; he said, it certainly was the first and the last time that we should find him out in any thing like it; when we went away, we gave him two shillings, as a water, not to mention that we had a quarrel with his master, for that it was all settled: we went to Bath, and, in the mean while, he forged this note; we went to Bath immediately after this dispute.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home when Marshall brought the bill to your brother for payment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your father there when he first came? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190024"></xptr>A. No, my father was not, but my brother went down to the butcher and told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then you must not tell us what passed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 115). About half-past one o'clock on the morning of the 3rd January, from information received, I went to 1, Ann Street, Waterloo Road—I found the prisoner and another man in bed in the top front room—Policeman 135 L went with me—I said "Saunders, get up"—I knew him—I said "You have counterfeit coin in your possession"—he made no answer—I said "Are those clothes in the chair yours?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I will search your clothes"—I did so—in the trousers I found 13 half-crowns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped in tissue-paper—I said "Put the trousers on"—I made him get out of bed—he put them on and I saw him wearing them afterwards—on searching his undercoat I found 35 florins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); three packets of 10 florins each were wrapped up, the other five were loose—I made him put on the undercoat—in the greatcoat he is now</p>

               <p>wearing I found 44 shillings, wrapped up in three packets of 10 each, and the rest loose—I produce the 44 shillings—I found a key in his trousers' pocket—I asked him if it was his—he made no answer—I said "Is that the key of the portmanteau there?"—he said, "Yes"—I unlocked it and found in it 42 florins and 40 shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped up in four packets of 10 each, in tissue-paper—there were two loose—he had a purse in the trousers pocket containing 12 sovereigns in gold, good money, and three half-crowns, four shillings, a sixpence, 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, loose in his pocket—also two watches; this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the undercoat breast-pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 135). I was with the last witness when he entered the room, and saw him search the prisoner's clothes—I saw him take from his trousers-pocket the 13 half-crowns, and the 35 florins from his undercoat—also the 44 shillings from the greatcoat pocket, and the 40 shillings from the portmanteau—I heard him ask the prisoner whether the key found was the key of the portmanteau—he answered "Yes"—I saw it taken from his trousers pocket and the portmanteau opened with it, and the coins taken out—I heard the other constable say "I am come to arrest you for having counterfeit coins in your possession"—he made no reply.</p>

The 13 half-crowns of 1877 from the trousers are all bad and from the same mould—the 35 florins of 1873 taken from the undercoat are all bad; several from the same mould, but not all—the 44 shillings from his overcoat are all bad—they were of 1866, 1868, 1872, and 1873, and all of one date are from the same moulds—the 42 florins and 40 shillings found in the portmanteau are all bad, and several of them from the same mould as those taken from the overcoat and undercoat—the dates were 1873, the shillings 1866, 1868, 1872, and 1873—they are the best made coins I have seen for some years—very dangerous indeed—they were blackened over to take away the brightness of the coin after they were made—they are very light.</p>

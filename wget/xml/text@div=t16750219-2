               the fact was apparently proved against him
            </rs> by divers witnesses to whom he confest it, and by examination taken before a Justice upon his apprehension neither indeed did he go about to deny it at his Tryal but rather seemed to justified it both by his words and carriage, for when the Court asked him if he did not find a remors and trouble in his spirit for what he had done, he repyled that it did not, and that his Wife might thank her self for what she suffered for that she urged him to it, upon the whole circumstance of the Evidence it appeared that this fellow had lived with this aforesaid wife for the space of near too Years, leaving her that time in the Country, and keeping himself in London, where he drove the Trade of a Butcher, of which profession he proved to be from first to last, about the Bowling-ally in Turnbal-street; the Tuesday before the fact was done, the woman his wife, having been with him some days in town, and did by his order go back to the Town where she lived to fetch up some things that he wanted, and was to return again the Tuesday following, which she did and <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16750219005"></xptr>as soon as she came to Town, poor Soul, goes directly to her bloody minded Husband, who seeming all this while to be taking care for a settlement for her, was in the mean while rather studying to destroy her, for upon her arrival he acquaints her that he had taken a new Lodging at Islington where they were to lye that night, and thither she must go with him, which she did, following him along Hatton-Garding, to Clarkenwell and so to Islington, where taking his opportunity near the Gravel-pits, a place fit for his hellish purpose, he fell upon her, and in a Barbarous manner gave her several deadly wounds in her head and Breast with her own Pattin, of which wounds she was found dead the next Morning being Saturday, and the same day the Murtherer was also by the providence of the Divine justice found out and discoverd, as hath been formerly related to you in another account of this Targedy.</p>

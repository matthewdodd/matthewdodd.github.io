                  </hi>. I ammanager of Richards and Co., coal merchants and colliery colliery proprietors, having offices at 1, Fenchurch Street, City, and they have a colliery in South Wales—the certificate of the registration of the Company is in Court—early in February we were in want of a depot at Faddington—the defendant called on me on the 6th, and told me he had his coal depot to sell and plant belonging to it, at Mileage Station of the Great Western Railway—he gave me some particulars of the extent of the business, and finally told me that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the price of it—I said that, judging from what he had said of the business, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. seemed a great deal too much, but I would mention the matter to the directors—I did so, and on 10th February I went with Mr. Shirley, one of the directors, to see the premises; we saw the defendant there, he showed us some rough books—Mr. Shirley left before me: after he had left the defendant told me that he had been offered 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that morning for the depot, and the plant as it stood, from a person in the South of London—I said that was more, than I could recommend the directors to give, and I left—on 23rd February he came to our office in Fenchurch Street—Mr. Philpot and Mr. Shirley, two of the directors, were present, the matter was again dis<lb></lb>cussed, and he agreed to take 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid at the rate of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton on bouse coal, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton on steam coal, sold to his customers—Mr. Philpot asked him if he had the authority of the Great Western Rail<lb></lb>way Company to make the assignment of the premises to the Company—he said "I have seen Mr. Morgan of the estate office and he has consented to the assignment "Mr. Philpot asked him to get a note from Mr. Morgan and he said he would—it was then arranged that he should attend on the 25th to sign the agreement—he came on the 26th—at that time I had she agreement drawn out by our solicitor—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produeed</hi>)—I took him to</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first heard of this property being in the market through Bellus, a clerk—he was with the defendant—he is now with us as depot clerk—I have seen him here to day—I did not see him during the course of these negotiations, except once, I think on the 25th, when he came to the office with a message, asking if we would give the amount that Mr. Macartney had telegraphed for that morning—he came a second time that day and said that Macartney could not come down to-day as he had not been able to see Mr. Morgan, but he would come next day—we were not very anxious to have this matter carried out quickly—the defendant telegraphed asking for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than he had agreed to take, and I telegraphed in reply, "If you mean business come here at once, the</p>

               <p>agreement is prepared"—a Mr. Watson came with Macartney the first day I saw him, he is a house and estate agent—I think he came twice—Macartney brought me his agreements with the Great Western on the morning of the 26th, and I handed them to Mr. Philpot—Mr. Philpot was a solicitor, he has retired—I was only once at the premises before the matter was concluded—Mr. Philpot did not go with me, Mr. Shirley did once—Macartney did not tell me that he was doing all he could with Mr. Morgan—when he came on the 26th he said he had not got the note—I did not say no doubt it would be all right; I expected that it would, as he said so distinctly, and I went to the place and took possession—we have since then carried on business at the office at the pleasure of the Great Western Company, but the wharf was taken away from us by the Com<lb></lb>pany—Bellus has been representing us at the office at 8, Westbourne Park Road, but we only occupy it at the Company's pleasure—we also have an office at Lord Hill Bridge, we have a lad there, but that again is only at the Company's pleasure—we hope to retain them, but do not expect to succeed, they have refused both to us—there is no condition with regard to the past—we did owe the Great Western 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was previous to the suspension of our Company—since then it has been reconstructed with fresh capital, and is entirely a new concern—it had been in liquidation—Macartney suggested that there might be an objection—he said it was our own fault, that they never would refuse a substantial firm, and that the real source of the objection was the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that after I had dis<lb></lb>covered about the bill of sale—the Great Western Company have taken possession of the stock—no one has claimed under the bill of sale—Macartney said at last that the person who held the bill of sale had agreed to take another security and release that—I have very great reason to doubt all he said—I did not believe it, and I do not believe it now—Mr. McColl held the bill of sale—I have seen him here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have heard that Bellus is here, subpœnaed by the defendant—Mr. Philpot wrote the body of this receipt—this letter is in the defendant's writing.

                  </hi>. I am a director of "Richards and Co., Limited"—the Company at one time went into liquidation in consequence of the failure of a Scotch bank—it is now in a large business—on 23rd February I saw the defendant with Mr. Coles—he said that he held these premises at "Mileage annually, from the Great Western Railway Company—I asked him if he had the permission of the Company to assign them or to dispose of them—he said he had, that Mr. Morgan, the estate agent of the Com<lb></lb>pany, had given him permission to dispose of them—I told him he must bring a letter from Mr. Morgan to that effect; he said he would—when he came on the 26th, the first question I asked him was, "Have you got the letter from Mr. Morgan as you promised"—he said he had not, that he had been there two or three times, but had not been able to see him, but he would get the letter in the course of the afternoon—before he signed the agreement I read it over to him—I first asked him if he was being sued by anybody—he said he was not—I then asked if he had given a bill of sale to any one—he said he had not—I then asked if he had committed any act of bankruptcy—he said he had not—I then said, "As you have answered my</p>

               <p>questions, you will have no objection of course to sign a paper which I shall draw out"—I then drew out this paper, which he signed—we were to pay him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and there was another sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more to be paid by commission, and I asked him how he would have it, whether by cheque or cash—he said he should like cash, and I sent one of the clerks for the cash, which was given to him by Mr. Coles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I first saw his three agreements on the 26th—I did not see Mr. Bellus—I heard afterwards that he had called—no attempt has been made by any creditor of the defendant to prevent our enjoyment of the premises, only by the Great Western Hallway Company, because we were trespassers there—they made no reference to the debt due from the late firm of Richards and Co., because they had accepted payment of the instalment of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound on the composition; there was no debt due to them—I applied to the Great Western Railway for a licence—there is still an application before them—I hope to get it—they have already turned us out from the wharf, which was the important part we wanted, but negotiations are pending under which we hope to get from them as an act of grace one of the offices lately held by the defendant—I have not seen the defendant to speak to him since the negotiation with Mr. Wilkinson. Thomas Morgan. I am agent to the Great Western Railway Company—on behalf of the Company I entered into these three agreements with the defendant; they refer to two offices and a wharf at Paddington—they con<lb></lb>tain a covenant binding him not to underlet without the consent or licence in writing of the Company—I never gave any such consent—I never pro<lb></lb>mised to do so—he asked me to transfer the tenancy to Messrs. Richards and Co., and 2 told him I had no authority to do so without the sanction of the traffic department—I recommended him to go and see Mr. Wilkin<lb></lb>son, and he would no doubt assist him to do what was necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not speak discouragingly to him—supposing the party introduced by him was substantial, I did not see any difficulty in getting the transfer; but that was not my business—these three agreements were prepared by me—the defendant has been a tenant of the Company for 15 years—we have known him for 20 years—he has always paid hi rent and the money I had to collect from him—I considered he was in a prosperous state of business—I know that lately he has been in rather embarrassed circumstances through some building speculation—he does not owe us a farthing—he is our tenant now, at the De Berg Hotel at West Drayton, under a seven years' lease—he is a man who has risen by his own exertions—he was for 14 years a non-commissioned officer in the Horse Guards Blue—he afterwards became one of the Queen's guards on the railway; he saved money and got into business under the Railway Company—I am not aware that he has done anything to forfeit that character.</p>

The Prisoners came in, drank Brandy, and some Discourse passing between them and me about Kicking and Jumping, they ask'd me what I was? And my Wife answered jestingly, Perhaps he is a Running-Footman. They went away before 11 o'Clock, and I and my Wife, and Munday, went soon after Eleven.

My Wife went homewards; and at the End of Greyhound Lane, I parted with Monday, and went to my Father-in-Law's, with whom I staid till about Two about Two in the Morning, and then went to my own Door. The Key being usually left for me under the Door, I was stooping to take it from thence, when the Prisoners came up to me, Oh! D - you, (says Grayer) you are the Running-Footman, are you? What do you mean, Gentleman? says I, D - him, says Whitehead to Grayer, Does be bid you stand? Knock the Dog down. They beat me, hauled me away, and asked me where the other Rogue, Tom. Munday was? I told them I could not tell. Then they said they would have my Money: And Whitehead held me, while Grayer thrust his Hand into my Pocket; which bring Pretty right, the drawing his Hand out again, pulled the Lining after it; and at the same time bursted the Wasteband of my Breeches, which was only fastened with a Pin. Gentleman, says I, have a Care what ye do, for I know ye both. This, I thought, would frighten them; but I was mistaken, for then they beat me worse. And Whitehead cry'd, Murder the Dog No, says Grayer, Let us carry him to the Watch-house. Pray, Gentlemen, says I, don't kill me: Do but spare my Life, and carry me Where you please; is will never be in my Power to do ye any Hart; for I don't know ye, and 'twas nothing but a damned Lye that I told ye when I said I did. At last I got away from 'em, and ran for my Life to Mother Aldridge's, at the Corner of White-street, and told her all that had happened.

About Two in the Morning I heard somebody knock at the Door; and thinking it was a Kinsman of mine that I expected, I got up in the Dark, and let in the Prosecutor, who was then a Stranger to me. He presently lock'd the Door. I was frightened when I found my Mistake, and would have put him out again; but he beg'd for the Lord's Sake that I would let him stay, for he had been robb'd of 10s. and was in Danger of being murdered. I struck a Light, and he shew'd the several Places where he was very much Bruised.

I had sold Mr. Grayer some Goods; and we afterwards went to drink together at the Cock, where Wright and Munday forced their Discourse to us, the former pretending to be a Running-Footman, and was for laying Wagers of his own Activity. We not liking their Company, went from thence to the Blind Beggar of Bednal-Green, where we staid till it was late. It was a Moon-Light-Night. We came away together, and at the End of Greybound-Lane, Wright met me, and stopt me, and hollowed for his Companion, who started from behind us. I knock'd Wright down; upon which, his Companion threw a Brick-Bat at us, and ran away. I ask'd Wright why he stopt me? Gentlemen, says he, if you knew but my Necessity, you would not blame me for going upon the Highway. My Wife is ready to Lie-in, and I have not a Farthing as myself or her. For God's Sake let me go. I told him I would first know who his Companion was. He refused to name him for a long time; but as last, threatning to carry him to the Watch-house, he said it was Munday. Some People who lived there-abouts, looked out of their Windows, heard this and a great deal more. One of them bid us search him to see if he had any Pistols about him; which we did, but found none. In the Struggle, his Breeches fell down, but he pinn'd them again, and got away.

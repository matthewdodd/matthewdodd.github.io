                  </hi>. I live at 85, Little Windmill-street About half-past 11 o'clock on a Sunday morning, at the beginning of this month, I was in the Clothes' Exchange, Houndsditch; there is a narrow passage there, and there was a great crowd—a man in front of me made a thrust at my watch, which was in my waistcoat pocket—I caught the prisoner with something in his hand, which I thought was my watch; he dropped the chain from one hand, but still had something in the other—I caught him by</p>

               <p>the waist; he got away, and went to another man in front of him, who had been pushing to keep us together—I said he had got my watch—he said he had not, and up with his fist and threatened to strike me; and the other man did the same—I followed him, and gave him in charge; he was searched, but the watch was not found—I am positive he is the man.</p>

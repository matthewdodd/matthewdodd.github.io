                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman A</hi> 231). About 12 o'clock on the night of 31st May, I was passing through Cockspur Street, coming from King Street, Westminster, where I am stationed—I was in plain clothes—as I crossed from the bottom of the Haymarket to Cookspur Street, the female prisoner secosted me, and asked me to go with her, which I refused to do—she still kept by me till I got to Spring Gardens Passage—as soon as I turned into the Passage she rushed at me, put her left arm round me, and put her right hand into my trowsers pocket at the same time—I had a purse in my pocket, containing a half—sovereign and a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—she took it out—I turned round and seized her with my left hand, and the male prisoner was on me in an instant—I saw the woman pass my purse to him distinctly—I seized him by the collar, and asked him to hand my purse over, as he had got the wrong party that time—two men then came up behind me, and one struck me a violent blow on the back with an umbrella—I turned round and just escaped a blow on the head—I fell down in the struggle, but still held the two prisoners—I then used my own umbrella in self defence—the other two men got away, as a constable in uniform came up—I had not taken any liberties with the woman—I was perfectly sober—when the other constable came up I handed the female prisoner to him, and I kept the man till he was taken to the station.</p>

I was on duty on the night in question in Spring Gardens—I saw the last witness struggling with the prisoners—I saw no one else there but the constable and the two prisoners—I went to his assistance, and he gave the female prisoner into my custody for robbing him of his purse, containing a half-sovereign and a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said be gave the male prisoner also for being concerned with her, and assaulting him—he did not go quietly to the station—Hopkins could not manage him him<lb></lb>self, and another constable came up and helped him—he was perfectly sober.</p>

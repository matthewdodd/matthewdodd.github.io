"—he said he would make an alteration—I did not know where to go to, being a stranger in London, and thought I might as well stop there—I had seven sovereigns and three shillings, and the articles stated, with me—as I undressed myself I dropped them out of my pocket—he said, "What have you there? "—I said, "Money"—he said, "Take care of it"—I said, "I am not among strangers, I can put it on the table, " which I did, in my hat—I went to sleep—when I awoke, his wife said, "Jacob, get up, my husband has gone to work at two o'clock this morning"—I said "A journeyman in England</p>

"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Will you do me a favour? "—I said, "Yes"—he asked me if Mendalson had some money—I said he had worked very hard, and I thought be had got a few pounds—he asked me to go and fetch him, as he bad something particular to say to him—I did to—Mendalson came out, and they had some talk together, but I did not hear what it was—I know this waistcoat—I have often seen the prisoner wear it—I believe he had it on the very Saturday I fetched him to the prosecutor.</p>

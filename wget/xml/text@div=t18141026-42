I went up, and opened the door of my bed-room; when I went in my son was there; on my going into the room, I missed my property; I missed a canvas bag, and some silver, and a one-pound note in that bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How much silver was in that bag - A. I cannot exactly say; there were some pounds of silver in that bag, and a little brass box, with two half-guineas,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260029"></xptr>and two seven-shilling pieces, and another box, with crown pieces, and half crowns, and a good many foreign silver coins.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money altogether in point of value - A. Seven pounds in money, besides the two half guineas, the seven shilling-pieces, and the foreign coin.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming down stairs - A. Yes; he came down stairs in an hurry, about the middle of the day; I cannot ascertain the exact time. On the 15th of October, I saw the prisoner again in the Compter. I asked him how he could think of robbing me and my children? my little child cried; he said, do not cry my little man. said, he was very sorry for what he had done. That is all he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in the Compter where your property was - A. Yes. A gentleman wrote into the country in consequence of what he told, and my property came back. I live in the house, and my husband lives with me.</p>

            , I am the son of the prosecutor. On the 1st of September, the prisoner asked me for the key of my father's door, to go and shave himself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lodged in the house - A. About ten days. I opened the door for him, and I locked the prisoner in the room; because he said, he allways stripped himself start naked; he said, he allways locked the door when he stripped himself, I locked him in, and I went up stairs to feed, the rabbits. I did not come down untill half an hour. I ran down, and fetched the key again; then I came, and unlocked the door again, and I asked him if he was ready; he said, yes, and just after he came out of the room; I went into the room to put on a clean shirt to go with the prisoner to meet his ship. I continued in the room until my mother came up, and on my mother coming up; she missed the property in question.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever been in that room before by himself - A. No.</p>

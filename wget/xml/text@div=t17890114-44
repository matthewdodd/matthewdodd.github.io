He went out, and said he was going to Leadenhall-market. I was in the kitchen; a woman brought me the bill down; her name was Hutchins; it was on Christmas-eve, or Christmas-day; she said Mr. Weston desired I would get it changed, and pay myself. On the Christmas-day, in the morning, I was dressing the prisoner's hair, and he said he'd go out and buy something, and get the note changed; the note was in a wine-glass, in the kitchen. He said, you shall go with me to Mr. Roberts's, in Bond-street, and we'll have a Twelfth-cake; we did not go that day. On the 26th, he said to me, you have got a watch to raffle; we will put it up at the Green Man, in Bond-street; so he made out a raffle for my watch, and put ten people's names to it. We sat there, and drank three pots of beer; he went out, and came in again, and said, he had had good success, and the note would be taken up on Saturday, at three o'clock. He said the watch should be raffled for on Monday evening. We came away; and on the Saturday morning, he went away from my house, and told me to go to Mr. Roberts's, in Bond-street, to get the note discounted, and keep the balance till he returned. I went to Mr. Roberts, of Bond-street, on the 27th of December, and offered the bill for discount; he told me to go and see if Mr. Hatchett would accept the bill, and Mr. Hatchett stopped me with the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. This bill is the same bill that the prisoner told you to get discounted, and keep the balance till he returned? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>(The bill read, as in the indictment.)</p>

               <p>The only way you get your bread? - I let my lodgings in the best manner I can. I have a wife and four small children.</p>
               <p>Who lodged in your house? - They are unfortunate women; the best lodgers I can get; sometimes they pay me, sometimes they do not.</p>
               <p>Then I understand you keep that sort of house, the resort of a number of bad women? - My lodgers are the best I can get, and I never suffer any noise or riot in my house.</p>
               <p>You was taken up yourself for this? - Yes, I was stopped with it. Nobody ever could say any thing against my character.</p>

I did; and on Christmas-day, when we got up in the morning, he told me to give it to Brannon, to get it discounted, and pay himself, and to keep the change till he came back again. I gave it to Brannon. Mr. Weston did not go away till the Saturday morning, which was the second day after Christmas-day. The prisoner had lodged there about a week or ten days.

               <p>What was it? - I cannot say positively what it was; but I am sure that was not it. I said it to himself, when he was going into the coach; and nobody was present<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140059"></xptr>but myself and the man and woman that went out with him.</p>
               <p>Was not there a man of the name of Farthing that heard it? - No, there was not; I do not know such a person.</p>
               <p>You are in that unfortunate way of life, I understand? - Yes; he lodged with me. I was very much displeased at his going off with Miss Boston: I cannot remember my words, but I did make use of some threats.</p>

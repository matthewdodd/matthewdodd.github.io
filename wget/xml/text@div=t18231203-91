I shewed it to my wife, and kept it separate - on the following Sunday he came again, and asked the price of a hand of pork; my wife asked him 6 1/2 d. I offered it him at 6 d.; he put down a half-crown - my wife took it up and said it was bad; I said I suspected so - he immediately took it up, and walked out with it. I followed, and about six doors off he dropped the half-crown down the area of an empty house. Taylor got the key of the house, and afterwards produced it to me; it is very bright, but is dated 1819. The pork came to 1 s. 4 d.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 9th of November, I took the prisoner coming in a direction from Harold's. I went to the empty house, which Harold pointed out, and got from the area a half-crown, on Monday morning; we could not get the key before. I found two good shillings and a penny in his pocket, and three quarters of a pound of mutton chops, undressed. I produce both half-crowns.</p>

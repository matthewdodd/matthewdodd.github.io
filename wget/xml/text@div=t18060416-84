               <p>Q. Did he steal any ham at any time. - A. Last Sunday week I detected it on him in the evening, I was on shore the whole of the day, when I came on deck I found the mate had him confined.</p>
               <p>Q. The mate accused the prisoner of having taken some hams out of the ship. - A. Yes, we got a candle and lanthorn and went down below, and we found a ham under his head as a pillow in his hammock, I wished him to confess whether he had sold one, he gave evasive answers; I confined him on board that night, and the next morning I sent for a Thames police officer, who came and took him in custody; on the following day he acknowledged that he had offered the second ham for sale on shore; he offered to give me a guinea, provided I would say no more about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not offer him a guinea to my knowledge.</p>

             sworn. I live at Stone Stairs, Ratcliff, my husband is a victualler. About four o'clock in the afternoon on Sunday, the 13th of April, the prisoner at the bar came to my house and offered me a ham for sale, I told him I would not buy it, he went out of the door, in about a quarter of an hour he returned without the ham, with some money in his hand, I suppose he had sold it; he called for a glass of liquor, which he paid for and went away.</p>

             sworn. I am a Thames police constable; the prisoner was given in my charge on the 14th of April, together with the ham, I produce the ham.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the ham I found under his head as a pillow, I am sure it is mine, we had a good many in a crib in the gun room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went on shore the mate and me had some words; the carpenter had offered me some provision if I would stay on board, but the sails being unbent the mate was very angry with it, with that I took my bag out of the ship; the mate should have overhauled it; when I came alongside of the ship Nancy, I found there was something in my bag that should not be, I hoved it out on the lighter, this gentleman's mate was looking at me the whole time; I found that I was trepanned by some means, I stood by the lighter till I could get a boat to give me a cast on shore; when I came on shore I took the ham along with me, and when I went on board I took it on board again, and went to sleep, not knowing there was any thing laying to my charge; about nine o'clock the mate waked me, the captain said I had stole a ham and carried it on shore; I had a ham, and carried it on shore; I had a ham that somebody put in my bag, I brought it back, it was wrapped up in a piece of printed canvas; I was seen by the people on board with the ham, if they were but here they know it, but they are out of the way; I never stole nothing in my life from a King's ship nor a merchantman, I never was detected of any thing of the kind before in no place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and now live in Nelson-street., Bethnal-green. One Bailey and I had a little house together in New-court—Bailey mov<lb></lb>ed into the prisoner's house—I went to him for a trine of rent which he owed me, the prisoner interfered, and called me a name I did not like, and I struck him—we fought, had a few rounds, and I found I was stabbed in the breast, and in different places—I saw nothing in his hand—nothing was found after<lb></lb>wards—I went to Dr. Oakley, then to the police station, and then to the London Hospital—I struck him first—I was in the hospital from Monday until the Sunday, and then I ran out—I had one wound on my breast, one below my hip, and other places of no consequence—I did not see him eating anything when I spoke to him, nor with a knife—he was sober—nobody was near enough to have done it but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Eustace, and live in New-court, next door to the prisoner. On the 28th of Aug. I heard the prosecutor speak to Bailey—the prisoner interfered, and called him bad names—Tubbs struck him, and they both fought—I ran for an officer—when I came back, Tubbs was going to the doctor's bleeding—I put my band on the prisoner's shoulder—he put up his hand to push me away, and told me to let him alone, or he should hurt me—I found my finger cut—I did not see anything in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the prosecutor came there—I examined, and found six or seven wounds on the lower part of the chest, immediately above the breastbone—some were punctured, and some incised wounds, none of them were seri<lb></lb>ous—they must have been done with a small cutting instrument, most likely a small clasp knife—there was a puntured wound in the upper part of the thigh, about half an inch deep, and one-eighth wide—one wound was about two inches long, it was no depth, quite superficial—the greatest depth was about a quarter of an inch—if the instrument had passed between the ribs, it might have done injury.</p>

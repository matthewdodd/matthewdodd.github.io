Newton, silk manufacturers, and I have had the notes from them"—he did not say what for—he said he had been doing Business with them, but did not say in what way—I took Debock and Barker to the station—they both gave me their true address in London—next morning, 20th March, I left them at the police-station, and went to Newton, junior's, between 1 and 2 o'clock—I aroused him, and with him I went down to Newton's—we found him in Bed—his son told him that we had come about the silk, as there was some unpleasantness about it—the son had a good deal of talk with him about the silk, and I told Newton that we had</p>

Agg and Jim Hunter; they owe me nigh upon 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and it will Be the ruin of us"—he asked me whether we had got Agg or Hunter—that was before the conversation took place that I have just given, but it was in the same conversation—I said that we had not—he said he knew nothing of those two men that we had got in custody—I had not told him who the men were who were in custody; I had said nothing to him; but he might have heard it.</p>

Agg and Hunter;" he produced the receipt, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him what Agg and Hunter were—he said they were dealers in silk, and kept public-houses in London—I said, "I do not see Hunter's name on this receipt"—he said, "No, sometimes one sells and sometimes the other, for it so happens that people will not Buy of one of them, when they will of the other; they were both here yesterday, and I paid them myself; I gave Agg three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and a cheque for 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "But that does not make 738<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I turned, and was looking at the silk again, when Newton left the room by a side door which goes into the house—I sent a constable to keep watch that the silk should not Be removed, and then went to the Town-hall; at that time De Bock and Barker were in custody—I had them taken before a magis trate, and they were remanded for a week; they were brought into my outer office on the way to the gaol, while the commitments were made out; they were then conveyed to gaol—I had heard nothing of any robbery of silk at that time—I told De Bock I was going to London to make inquiries, and asked him his address; he gave mo his correct address, and said that I should find the silk was all right; that he bought it of a man named May, and gave 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for it, that he did not know the weight, but he bought it by the lump—I said, "Well, if you bought it of May, you can produce the invoice and the receipt"—he said, "No, I cannot; I never had any; it is about four months ago, and it has been warehoused in my Brothers house ever since"—I said, "You mean Mr. Barker"—he said, "Yes"—I after wards saw Barker—De Bock said, "I called at Agg's, and I came down with hi a to receive the money"—I told Barker I was going to London to make inquiries about the ten Bales of silk which had been sold to Mr. Newton; he also gave his correct address, 2, Hope-street, Spitalfields—he said "I know nothing about any ten Bales of silk; I never saw any in my life"—I said, "Your Brother-in-law has just said that you have had it in your house for the last four months"—he said, "No, I have not; it might have been for three months"—he said he did not know what he came to Derby for; but he was out of work, and his Brother said if he came he would pay his expenses—I went to London, and returned on Friday, 22d—I telegraphed to Derby on the 22d, and when I arrived there, I found Sergeant Green in possession of 109 Books of silk, and a complete Bale of skeins—I saw Mr. Newton, Mr. Newton, jun., and Mr. Leach, Mr. Newton's solicitor, all together—that was on Saturday the 22d—I said to Newton, "I want a receipt I</p>

Rothschild, and part to Messrs.

               <p>that neither Newton nor the men changed places, though I cannot swear it—I saw Newton directly he got out, but did not see him get out—I had then been on the platform a minute or so—Gutteridge was with him; nobody else—I did not see Bartlett—I Began to put out the parcels—Gutteridge came to me and made a communication that Mr. Newton had lost his ticket and portmanteau—Wilcoxon is a guard in the Company's employment—he came down by the train from Leicester to Derby—I do not know where he rode—I saw him after we arrived on the Derby platform—he said, "I have been asleep; I am going to Row Botham's: there are some passengers going there;, I have recommended them for a Bed" I understood him they were two men with whom he had been riding—I do not know why he told me that—he asked me if I would go and have a glass of ale, and I said, "No"—there were several houses open—there were two Breaks, up to North Derby Junction, and only one from North Derby Junction to the station—I never saw Wilcoxon in the Break—the first I saw of him, was when he came to the Break-van that I was riding in, and took his signals out—that was the only Break-van there was—he was not in the Break before that: had he been I must have seen him—if he rode to Leicester in the Break-van, he must have got out there—he was not in the hind Break-van in which I came—if he came in the first, he must have got out at the junction—there is a train from Derby to London at a quarter-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a platform porter at the Midland Railway station, Derby—I occasionally collect tickets at night time—I collected the tickets on the night of 18th March—the collecting platform is about one hundred yards from the station—if my re recollection is right, the train came in on that night at a few minutes after 1 o'clock, or something like that—it was composed of three carriages; one parcel van, one composite carriage, and one guard's break van—I collected the tickets from the composite carriage—that was a first-class between two second-classes—there was nobody in the first-class—there were three in the first second-class compartment; two passengers and one guard, that was Wilcoxson—he was lying asleep on the seat—in the other second-class carriage was Mr. Newton by himself—I Began at the end of the train and worked up to the engine—I did not receive a ticket from Newton—I rode from the ticket platform to the station, on the step of the carriage Newton was in; and riding for one hundred and fifty yards in that way I will swear that there was nobody in the compartment but himself—I did not see Bartlett at the station—I rode on the step of Newton's carriage, because he could not find his ticket—when I got to the platform, I saw Mr. Measurer, the foreman—I saw the two men who were in the carriage with the guard, and also saw them on the night following on the platform—De Bock and Barker are the men—I saw them step out of a carriage—they took no notice of Newton at all, or of anybody—Newton did not get his portmanteau from the train on his arrival at Derby—I afterwards went up to Bartlett in relation to that portmanteau—that was the first time I had seen Bartlett—I had to walk about a hundred and thirty yards to him—he was in the entrance hall—that is not in a direct line of sight—when Newton did not get his portmanteau, I spoke to Taylor about it—I afterwards went with Newton for him to pay his fare—he paid it to a clerk in the office—I saw what money was given—there is a clerk there all night to Book the night trains, and he paid it in the ordinary office to the ordinary clerk—I afterwards went with Newton to Row Botham's, and there saw the two men who I had seen in the carriage with the guard—they did not in any way recognise Newton, or Newton them—I had some ale—Newton paid for it—I stayed at the counter perhaps three or four minutes—I afterwards accompanied Newton home—I have never seen him come from London by any other than the mail-train—it is generally my habit to walk home with him when I am not on duty—there are no cabs at the station to meet persons, so that a porter must carry a portmanteau—we generally call at Row Botham's as we go By, and drink—when I spoke to Bartlett in the entrance-hall, he had not time to see the parties get out of the carriage—I recollect De Bock and Barker being apprehended—I heard Bartlett say, after that, that it was those two men who had come down by the mail the night previous—that was all he said that night with reference to them; but a night or two afterwards it was being talked over on the platform, in Bartlett's presence, and he said, "I must have my spoon into that affair"—some weeks after, we were down in the lamp-room, talking about this affair, and he said to me, "Are you not going to London?"—I said, No; not that I am aware of"—one of the other men asked him if he was going; he said, "Yes"—the other man said, "It will Be a good job for you, if you go"—he said, "I do not care if I can only make a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out of it"—the other man said that he would make the cat's tail spin about that night—I do not know what that meant—Fearn and Vessey came to my house, and asked me some questions—that was before Bartlett was brought up to London as a witness—I do not know when he was brought up, but it was about 23d or 24th March—some time afterwards, I went to</p>

Joseph Wilson")—this name, "John Newton" is my lather's writing—this was given to me on the afternoon of 19th March, in part payment of the account running—up to that time I had not bought any silk of Agg, but I had sold some right out, not on commission, on several occasions—I found an entry of them—the first sale to him is on 24th January—all these that have got 5 per cent. allowed are sold out and out—this cheque and the Bill were payments on account of sales made—it was Alexander Cox's Bill—my father came in afterwards and Hunter—Agg then said, "Your father has bought these ten Bales of silk from me for cash"—my father said to me, "You pay for them"—I asked Mr. Agg how much they would come to—he said, "Over 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "It will not Be convenient to pay the whole amount at this time; we have other payments to make; will 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. do to-day, and more in a few days?"—he said, "Yes"—I then wrote a cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not specify any particular amount that he wanted—I took the cheque to the Bank, and cashed it as I was going there on other Business—this is the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I drew—it is my writing—this counterfoil is also in my writing—I went to the Bank, because it was getting near closing hours, and I had to run to get there before it closed—he asked me to cash the cheque for him as I was going to the Bank—when I brought back the notes he gave me the invoices of ten Bales of silk—they were three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I believe this invoice is in the same state as when he gave it to me—it has my initials on it—he had written it out when I came into the office with the notes, and receipted it as it is now—I did not observe that it was headed "London," or "15th March"—I was in a hurry, because I had many letters to write that night, and hands were waiting, and he said he wanted to go to London by a train leaving at half-past 4—I do not know what day it was my father spoke to him about the silk—when the invoice was handed to me I asked my father how much we were to pay—my father said, "Pay him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so, and carry a Balance to his account"—I proposed 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to the notes, and to carry the Balance to his account—I wrote out a cheque for 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and made it payable on 22d March—that would be the three days that I had proposed—I find the counterfoil here of that cheque, "Agg, March 22"—immediately after that I find a cheque drawn on March 20th, another on 21st, another on 22d—I gave that on the 19th—it was incon<lb></lb>venient to me to pay the cash on that day—I had other payments to make</p>

               <p>at that time, and it was inconvenient to give the whole sum—Agg saw that I had post dated the cheque—the difference was not made out, and the account gone into between us—he went away with Hunter and my father, and shortly after he had left I Balanced the account in the ledger—I showed him where to get a ca B as he was in a hurry to catch the train, and the station is a mile from our house—I have never seen him or Hunter since—I directed the police at the police-office to go to the address of Agg and Hunter—I made an effort to find them For the police-constables—I did not look into the invoices particularly, as I had been dealing with Agg for some time—he owed us a Balance of 394<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; not before the cheque—the whole amount that Agg owed us before he came was 563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—first came a cheque for 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then the acceptance for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; deducting that, we get 393<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when he left he owed us 176<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not find Agg's acceptance to the amount of 323<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered in this pass-Book—some short time after the 19th I was requested to return the acceptances with another name—he owed us more than 176<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at that time—during the whole of these transactions my father took no part in it at all—I have entered up the purchase of the ten Bales in the bought invoice-Book, which I have got here—I also posted up the ledger the same night—I have copied this from the invoices—I also enter up the sales in this sold invoice-Book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—about 2 o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 20th, Inspector Fern came to my house, and knocked me up—I live away from my father, at my own house—he asked me whether we bad had any silk transactions that day—I told him that we had had transactions with Mr. Agg, and that we had paid him three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, and the Balance was to be carried to his account—I proposed to go with him to my father's, and did go—my father said, in answer to a question by Fern, that he should Be at the mill in the morning—Fearn then left—Between 9 and 10 in the morning Hilton came, accompanied by Fearn and Vessey, and I explained the facts to them, and offered the Books which I have now produced, and the invoices, but they left them with me—I offered to show them all the Books—I fetched them down stairs—Mr. Hilton placed his hands upon them, and said, "There, I see them, but I won't see them"—I did everything in my power to clear up the transaction—I never saw De Bock or Barker until they were in custody—I had seen Crane as a porter at Drakeford's—I gave a plain description of Agg and Hunter—when my father could not go to the police-court I went—I took one Bundle of silk to the station and one of the Bags—that was on the 20th—I attended before the Magistrate—Mr. Hilton came again to the mill on the afternoon of the 20th, accompanied by Mr. Davenport and Mr. Cramont—they are in partnership as silk manufacturers and thrusters—they looked at the silk in the presence of the police, who came with them—I repeated that I had paid for it in their presence—on Saturday, 23d March, Hilton came again with Mr. Leach, and I gave up the invoices, and offered to show the Books—Mr. Leach said he did not want them except for this one transaction—the silk was then packed, and taken away—Between giving the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the cheque coming due I sent for some money to meet the payment—it was a telegraphic message to Rigg, "Send me a cheque on account of sales"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of it—in cones<lb></lb>quence of that I received this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to enter that corrected account into this Book while this matter was under trial?"Agg owed us some money, and we had an acceptance to meet it for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some silk was returned by Agg's agency since this robbery—this was written in Derby—this was the original entry—some portion of it is what I referred to as the original account of Agg—I wrote it on 19th March—I entered it from our consigning Books—Agg had given us notice of the sale of the silk—I believe he had gone over some of our Books containing this account and different invoices—there is an account sale of China train and Bengal train—no part of these ten Bales is contained there—I have not entered them in any part of this day-book because I keep a Book for all sold accounts, and you will find nothing but received in that—I copy all the invoices—the invoices always specify the weight; this Book only exhibits the date of the original invoices—there is no Book at all which exhibits the date of the transaction except this which I took from the date of the invoices—I should put against it "clod" for "cleared" from the Docks—the Bill had been sent down, and we paid for it when it came back—if we had a ready money transaction at Derby the ledger would show it—I am quite sure I am correct in saying that I entered this 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., having discovered the mistake the same evening the 19th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of the firm of Broom, Bag shaw, and Westcott, 35, Coleman-street, London—I have been in Business some thirty years—shortly after Newton's arrest, I was directed by his principal creditors to investigate the affairs—in consequence of that I went down on 4th April without any communication from him or his friends—I appeared there on 5th April—all the Books and papers were su Bmitted to me—I examined all the Books, the day-Book, ledger, bought and sold invoice-Books, the consignment-Book, and the carriers-Book—I saw the Bankers' pass-Book, and examined it sufficiently for the purpose for which I went down there—I prepared a statement of account for the creditors from those Books, and from the materials and assistance which I had—for instance, we had to take an account of the stock—I prepared a statement of his affairs—I examined Agg's account—my attention was directed to it from the circum<lb></lb>cumstances that I then heard—I see the account of Agg's in the ledger—I have carefully, for that purpose, traced that account from the Books, and other documents, more particularly the-consignment-Book—I find that this supports the subordinate Books, but it is very Badly put together, unscientific<lb></lb>cally—if the Jury have time to go through this Book and the consignment-Book, they can trace out every item in the ledger—there is no appearance of fraud about it, nor in any portion of the Books I have seen—I found that Newton was solvent, and as my object was to get the true statement of his affairs, I took care not to overstate anything—I found there was a surplus; not very considerable—I did bring the account here with me.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe the first time you visited the mill was on Saturday, the 3d? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the ledger was then as it is now—I have seen it once or twice since, and it always appeared the same, balance and all—the officer was in charge of the silk at that time—I was first applied to on the Wednesday or Thursday; I think it was Thursday, 21st; it was, I think, one or two days before the Saturday—Hilton was in London, Because, when he came to me on Saturday morning, he said, "I hear you have been engaged for Newton"—I was retained by the creditors on the very night before Mr. Broom went into the investigation—I cannot remember the date: it was on 4th or 5th April—Mr. Broom was in Derby three days, and it was the first of those days—that was after the prisoners were committed to London—I fancy they were sent on the very day I was at the police court at Derby—I was only there once—Mr. Lewis was one of the Magistrates on the Bench—I do not say that he Behaved worse than anybody else.</p>

                  </hi>. I first saw the silk at Newton's mill about 9 o'clock on morning of the 20th—it was all mixed up, and I remarked it at the time.—<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this evidence—first, because it was part of the original case, and could not therefore Be given in reply; and secondly, because grave imputations had been made upon the conduct of the Derby police, who had been in Court and heard them.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">overruled the objection.</hi> I have not been in Court, and have heard nothing—I was ordered out—I know the character of the Derby police has been attacked here, and unjustly so—the silk was on the counter, and it had never been touched, I believe from that time until I took it away—I was there with Mr. Davenport, the first time I saw the silk—. I believe young Mr. Newton left it as I found it, until Mr. Thompson, who is a very clever man, saw it packed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I went with Hilton to Newton's mill, on the morning of the 20th—I had been there in the night and called him up,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186106100136"></xptr>
               <p>But never was there before the 20th—T saw a great quantity of silk on the counter or sideboard, and one bale lying on the floor covered over—I never touched the silk—on Sunday, 24th March, I went to Gutteridge to ask him questions about this matter—I spoke to him, but did not see him—I went to the bottom of the stairs and said, "You were ticket collector last Mon<lb></lb>day night"—he said, "I was"—I said, "I want you to tell me what you know about Newton and the party who came with him in the train"—I asked him what he knew about it—he said, "I cannot remember anything about who came besides Newton; the reason I noticed Newton was, that he was drunk and had lost his ticket."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you out of Court when Gutteridge was examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went out before his examination wag finished—some part of the questions were asked before I went out—I we out when the order was made—I did not, I believe, put my head down and cover my face with my hands when Gutteridge was answering these ques<lb></lb>tions—Superintendent Mumford did not come and tell me to put my head up and not let the Jury see me in that bate—he never came to me, not to speak to me and I never put my head down—I knew Gutteridge and Taylor were coming up, told the attorney what had occurred—I did not know that Taylor was the guard of that very train—I did not inquire who was the guard—I understood, till lately, that Wilcoxon was the guard—I saw him the day but one after; that was the first time I heard him say anything about it—I knew he was a guard, and I took it that he was the guard of that train. I did not ask him at that time if he knew anything about it; he told me without asking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be very careful, because Wilcoxon has been examined, and has sworn you never found him out till Saturday last; did you go to him before Saturday last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I had not time to ascertain who was the guard of that train till Saturday last—I knew he was the guard, and had been many years—the first time I asked him about coming as a witness was Saturday last—I can tell you the conversation—he said, "I should have got into the same carriage as Newton, Barker, and Debock, if one of them had not been drunk"—he did not tell me that he himself had been drinking—he did not tell me that he was in the carriage—I always thought, till last Saturday, week, that Wilcoxon was the guard, and yet I made no inquiries of him till Saturday last—I did not go to How Bottom, but he came to me about ten days ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear any rumor that Newton had been robbed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard his portmanteau was missing—in the conversation I had with Wilcoxon, I did not hear him say, "What a pity it is I did not know it; I could have caught them, for I let them into the train."</p>

                  </hi>. I was telegraphed for last night, to come up this morning—I remember, on the night of 18th, or morning of the 19th March, Gutteridge bringing Newton to me to pay his fare—he said, "This gentle man has lost his ticket"—he did not say to Newton, in my presence, "Where have you lost your ticket?"—I heard Newton say he did not know where he had lost it, unless one of the two men who were with him had got it—he said that in Gutteridge's presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the the son of David Stanley, who lives in the parish of Rotherhithe. On Sunday night, the 13th of August, I came home from work, at two o'clock in the morning, or before two—I found the street door was wide open, and the lower-sash of the window was up—I went in at the door, and I called out, but no answer was given—I called out again, but my father was asleep—I called again, and at last he made an answer, and said he would bring me a light—I then heard a female voice say, "Let me out"—my father came down stairs with a light, (I had shut the door before he came down,) and I saw the prisoner with a shawl on, two caps and a handkerchief—she had her shoes in her hand—I left her with my father, and went for a policeman—I returned in five minutes—she still had the shawl on, and the handkerchief, two caps, and a pair of child's trowsers in her possession—my sleeve-waistcoat, and a pair of trowsers were on the floor—they had been brought down two pair of stairs—and two pictures and a salt-cellar were on a table in the room—I knew the prisoner before, but she never lived in the house—the policeman took her.</p>

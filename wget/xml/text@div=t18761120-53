                  </hi>. I am one of the under gamekeepers in the employ of Lord Braybrooke, and live in one of his lodges—Alfred Chandler is the head game keeper—I went to his house on 17th October about 7 o'clock, and he gave me orders in consequence of which I went on to Warner's field—I went down Windmill Road and across the cottage allottments—there is a gate at Warner's field, but not a public footpath—we went into Warner's field and into Cockbush Lane and then came back into Warner's field where we saw the prisoner, but I did not know that it was Thomas Tugby till I got close to him—he had two large lurcher dogs with him—we first saw him between 7.30 and 7.45—the sun had set, but I cannot say how long—it was not dark nor yet light; it was dusk—he was in Warner's field with the two dogs, walking to meet us—I spoke first and asked him where he was going to that way; he said "What has that to do with you," and swore at us and blackguarded us—we asked him his name and he gave a wrong name; I cannot say what it was—I looked at him and said "No, that is not your name, your name is Tom Tugby"—he said "Your name is <hi rend="italic">Bean</hi> Barker"—that is short for Silvanus—I got hold of him by his collar, and Last who was with me caught hold of him on the other side—he said that he would not go to Chandler's, and he blackguarded us and called us everything—he got down on the ground and I pulled him up—he slid down two or three times—after some time he said that he would go to the station</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200089"></xptr>
               <p>—I said "Come on then"—he then put both his hands into his pockets' and I saw a knife in his hand; I gave a grab at it with my left hand—we still had hold of him—he gave a rush, got away from Last, and twisted me round—I kept hold of his collar, but he got away from me also, and came back and stabbed me with the knife—he struck at me back handed—he was at liberty then on my left side—I had this thick coat and waistcoat on (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my wife has washed the waistcoat since, because of the blood, but this coat was cut at the time—I felt a stab, blood ran down my side, and I felt very weak—I saw the knife in his hand—I put my hand to my side and said "I must go to the doctor; I feel blood running down me"—I said to. Last "Knock him down;* he has stabbed me with that knife," and Last knocked him down with a stick—when he was on the ground he kept swearing and said "He would kill both we b——y b——s" Last helped me to Dr. Steal's, whose assistant attended to my side—I have been under his care five weeks yesterday and am still—I suffered considerable pain and am very weak now—I next saw the prisoner a week ago to-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a watcher over seventeen years—all that time my duty has been to be out at night looking after poachers—I have not taken very many poachers to Mr. Chandler's in the seventeen years, but I have caught hold of a good many in the time—I do not play rough when I get hold of a poacher—I had a thickish stick—I do not always carry it—I like a stick in the day as well as in the night—I have brought the stick which I had with me that night—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not loaded—you can give a tremendous blow with it if you hold it down low—I do not know whether Last's stick is heavier still—there is no footpath where I met the prisoner—whether it would be a "near cut through Warner's field to Cockbush Lane would depend upon where he was going—it is not a nearer way to the top of the town than by the road; it is a near way to the bottom of the town—he had no business there at all—people have no business to go that way, but it is a way that people habitually go to save distance—when we saw the prisoner we halted and then walked on—instead of halting he walked straight down to meet us, and as he came near I asked him where he was going that way?—I said "What do you do here" and "Where are you going?"—he said What has that to do with you <hi rend="italic"> V</hi>—that did not put my blood up at all—I have known him by sight and by name a great many years, but did not know where he lived—I cannot say whether he was born and bred in Saffron Walden, and I do not think he lived there—I asked his name because I did not know it just for the moment—I did not know who he was till I looked at him hard, and then I said "Your name is Thomas Tugby;"he said "I know it is; and your name is Bean Barker"—I did not much mind that—I cannot tell whether I clasped the stick a little tighter or whether I did not, but I did not hit him—Last took hold of him by the left side and I by the right directly he said "I know it is; and your name is Bean Barker"—the dogs did nothing in my presence; they kept with the man; I did not see them or feel them—it was when he slipped down on the ground that I said he would have to go to Chandler's—Chandler's was a little over a mile off, and the police-station was very little over a quarter of a mile—he said that he would go to the police-station—he only slipped down once that I know of while we had hold of him—he did not slip down three or four times that I know of—I saw him all the while—we did not haul him up from the ground four times at least; once</p>

               <p>is all that I can remember—when we hauled him up off his feet he gave a jerk, and by that means got rid of Last—his coat was then torn; that was not the coat ha is wearing now—it was a dullish night; I have described it as not very light and not very dark—this was all done in a second—as soon as he got away from both of us he came back within a minute and stabbed me—I had not got hold of my stick then; he knocked it out of my hand—I had got him with one hand and I grabbed at the knife with my left, and he knocked the stick out of my hand—I did not call out to Last to knock him down, till after I was stabbed, as far as I remember—I did not as far as I remember tell Last to strike him, directly I saw the knife—I did not say "Knock him down" before he stabbed me—I knew that I was stabbed because I felt the blood—I did not call out "Knock him down; he has got a knife;" but after he stabbed me I said "Knock him down"—it was the very instant after he had put the knife into me—I did not see him strike Last across the breast; I saw Last knock him down, but only once—I saw Last turn him over and search his outside pockets—I did not see him take 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him; I did not see any money in Last's hands—Last has not told me that he spent the money; he did not take any—I saw the prisoner lying on the ground; when Last and I walked away I did not see him bleeding—I believe Last hit him on the head with a walking-stick—I was not at Hudson's public-house many minutes that afternoon; I did not go there more than once that day—I had had a little beer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was sober and so was Last; we were not at all the worse for drink—when I grabbed at the knife with my left hand, my stick was in the other hand—before he stabbed me neither of us had struck him either with our sticks or with our fists—I bled very much after this wound; Last had to assist me to the doctor—Last did not take any money out of the prisoner's pooket—he felt his pockets—we found no game on him—besides his sliding down on the ground there was a little struggle; he wanted to get away but I kept hold of him, and then he slid down as I have described.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at North End, Saffron. Walden, and am a game-watcher in the service of Lord Braybrooke—on 7th October I saw the head keeper Chandler, and Barker and I afterwards went to the Allotment Gar<lb></lb>dens and into Warner's field—it was about 7.30 after we came back out of the lane—we then returned into Warner's. field and saw the prisoner at the bottom of the field meeting us—he had two lurchers with him, or something of that species—Barker spoke first; he asked him what he did there with those two dogs—the prisoner said that he was going that way—Barker said "No, you will have to go with us to Chandlers"—the prisoner slid him<lb></lb>self down on the ground and said he would not—Barker asked him his name and he gave him a wrong name; I do not know what name it was, but it was not Tugby—Barker then said "Your name is Tom Tugby"—he said "I know it is, your name is b——y <hi rend="italic">Bean</hi> Barker"—we both took hold of him and pulled him up on his feet as well as we could and he slid himself jown three different times, he getting down and we pulling him up—Barker asked him where he would go—he said he would go to the police-station—we pulled him and he stood up and then he gave a chuck away, got himself away from me, and twisted round with Barker, and his back was against Barker's back, I think, and I heard a blow struck against Barker, but did not see it; it was like this (<hi rend="italic">striking a book</hi>)—Barker then said "Oh! I'm stabbed with that knife, Last, knock him down;" I saw no knife—as soon as he cleared himself from Barker he struck at me and something touched</p>

               <p>me across the breast; I do not know what it was, but it was either his hand or something in his hand; there was no cut on my clothes—I knocked him down at that instant with my stick; I hit him by the side of the head—I then turned back and picked up Barker's stick, which was on the ground, and gave it to him—the prisoner was rising from the ground when I turned back and he said "I will kill both of you b———y b———s "—I then hit him again on the side of the head with the same stick; I have not brought the stick here; I set it down at the station and left it there; I am not quite sure whether it was as big as this stick, but it had no nob; it was ash wood—I hit the prisoner a second blow as he was rising; he was not rightly on his feet—he then laid still, and I turned him over to search for the knife—I felt about where he fell and about his things, but I did not find any knife—I took nothing out of his pockets—I took Barker to the surgery, he was bleeding so that he could not stand up; he was bent down on one side like this; I assisted him to Mr. Stear's surgery in Saffron—Walden; he was attended there by the assistant and was afterwards seen by Mr. Stear—it was about 8 o'clock when we left Warner's field—I went back to the field that same night and Creffield came there after I was there—I pointed out to him the spot where that had taken place—we searched. for the knife for a little while, but could not find it—it was neither dark nor light, it was very dull—the field is meadow land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before the Magistrate—a gentleman took down my examination and read it over to me; I have not been reading it over since; I did not read it yesterday or the day. before; I cannot say that I have not read any of it; I read some a day or two after it was printed—my stick is not so very heavy or. so very light—I do not know whether it is the same sort of wood that they make axe handles of—we have heavier wood in our part of the country—I left it at the raflway. station—they did not object to my bringing it away, nor charge, me any extra for it—I will swear that Barker said something about the dogs; I did not forget it until to-day—I read very little of the case in print—I will, swear that Barker said "What are you doing here with those two dogs?"—the pri<lb></lb>soner aaid he would go in spite of us and the next words were "No, you will have to go with us to Chandler's "—I did not know the prisoner until that night—I am not a native of Saffron Walden—I do not measure 6 feet out of my boots—when Barker said "You will have to go with us to Chandler's "the prisoner laid himself on the ground; I have said that be<lb></lb>fore; he did not lay himself down before we touched him; he slipped him<lb></lb>self down, he did so three times; I am not certain whether it was three or four times,' and we two hauled him up, both' of us holding sticks, of which you have a specimen—I am positive that he slid down three or four times—he gave a chuck and I heard a strike against Barker, and he said "Knock him down, Last," and then a blow was struck and immediately I knocked him down; I do not know whether I made his head bleed—when he was getting up I knocked him down again—I only felt in his outside pockets; I did not take three or four shillings in money, I never picked up any money—I swear that I never put my hands in his pockets, I felt his pockets; I did not feel anything in them; I only felt the outside of his pockets—I had to turn him over and I felt under him and over him—I do not know whether he was bleeding—I then walked away with Barker and left him—I did not send a medical man to him.</p>

I am a surgeon, practising at Saffron Walden—on Tues<lb></lb>day night, 17th October, I saw Sylvanus Barker at his own house between 11 and 12 o'clock—he was in a state of collapse from loss of blood and from the shock of the injury—I found a clean cut wound on his left side, pene<lb></lb>trating into the chest—I could put my finger into the cavity of the ohest—it was about 2£ inches long, and was very dangerous—he had lost a very great deal of blood—I stayed with him the whole of the night—I con<lb></lb>sidered him in so much danger that I sent for a Magistrate to take what I thought was his dying deposition, and I sent for another surgeon—I con<lb></lb>tinued to attend him—he is out of danger now—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by a stab with this knife—it had gone through the coat and waistcoat, and considerable force must have been used—it could not have been inflicted by a nail sticking ont of a piece of wood or paling—it was a clean-cut wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A piece of iron attached to the wood would make a clean cut if it was sharp enough—I haw seen hoop-iron—I said before the Magistrate that it was a penetrating wound—I do not think I was asked whether it was a clean cut—looking at this coat, I should say that it was not more probable to have been done by some sharp piece of iron attached to the wood than by a knife—it is a clean cut; it is not a straight cut, and the edges are perfectly clean—this waistcoat looks torn at the upper part—here is a partial cutting through, where you have put this pin—there is a trace of something not having gone through in another place—it has not gone through where the pin is—there is a mark where the lining has not been actually penetrated, and there are blood marks there—it has torn the coat and gone in at another part—I should say that it was not done with a nail attached to a stick—I will pledge my oath that it was not, after your calling my attention to that—this is not a clean cut on the waistcoat; it is a frayed edge—I have not got the deposition which the Magistrate took—he took it away with him.—.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). There is a low fence not far from where this matter took place—there is a gate a little way-off into the next field, but I never saw any paling—I was not at the place the following morning.</p>

I do not know how many people occupy the Allotment, that is on the other side of Warner's field; you go from the road—I never saw any posts or rails in the quick set edge—the place where I knocked the man down is not more than 4 or 5 yards from the nearest fence; as far as from me to the lamp.</p>

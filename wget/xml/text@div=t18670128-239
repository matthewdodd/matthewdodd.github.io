On the 3rd of January this year, about five o'clock in the evening, I went with another constable to 21, Newnham Street, Whitechapel—I had had no communication with any person connected with the Russian government—we went into the back room on the ground floor and found the two prisoners there, but no one else—it is not a very large room, there was room for a bedstead and two or three tables—I took them in custody and told them in English that I was a police officer and took them in custody for having in their possession, as I was informed, a quantity of forged notes; Groeger said, "Not me, I am innocent"—I searched Groeger, and found on him this black bag containing this genuine rouble note and three Russian coins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), also these five papers in an envelope—I saw Gulley, who was in plain clothes, search Szapals—I searched the bed and found these 107 notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped in this cloth, and folded as nearly as I can say in this manner, as near the centre of the bed as could be, and between it and the mattress—the bed was about three feet and a half wide—it was made—the prisoners were sitting on the edge of the bed when I went in or one might have been in the bed and the other on a chair; it was dark and I could not see—there was no light but the fire—they saw me find the notes and made some remark in their own language—I cannot say that either of them said anything in English—we took them to the station, when Groeger said that he was innocent, and Szapals said something in his own language, which I could not understand—I showed Groeger one paper, it was translated by an interpreter, and he said in English, "That is mine, I wrote it"—Szapals did not appear to understand.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Groeger's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>:—"I beg some paper to write down what I have to say. I am innocent. I have given information to the Emperor of Russia. Where I came from, in my native place, we can get plenty of forged notes there: we get them from a Jew named Moses. I was going to give information to the Emperor of Russia where these papers were manufactured. Moses told me he would take me to the manufactory where they were made the day after I saw him. Instead of that, he brought me to London, without my knowing where I was coming, and he got a room for me for eight days. I asked him to take me back again the Thursday the landlady was present. I went out with Moses to get provisions. Moses did not come again, so the landlady sent out her son for them. Moses thought I was going to inform against him, and put the notes between the bed and mattress. As far as I know, he put them there the Wednesday morning when the snow was. I was going on Fri<lb></lb>day evening to the Prussian, or Russian, or English Consul, or some one high in authority. I was going to give information that I was brought to London without knowing it, and that I was going to Berlin to find out where the notes were forged, and to ask the Russian Consul to send me back home. Whilst I was thinking of this I was taken into custody. If I had known that the notes were bad, then I should have taken them to the Russian Consul. If I was allowed I would prove that Moses dealt in these false papers, if the English government would assist me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Giveger's defence, being interpreted, was that, after writing the letter to the Emperor, he pretended to Moses that he wished to become a dealer at the forged note manufactory, believing that Moses would take him there, and he should find out where it was; that Moses brought him from Berlin to Lon<lb></lb>don, and when they were sleeping at Ghent, Moses, having found the letter to the Emperor and discovered from it his (Groeger's) intention to betray the man<lb></lb>factory, determined on ruining him, so that he could not harm him or the manu<lb></lb>factory and for that purpose placed the notes in the bed, and then gave information to the police, leaving him with only a penny, and unable to speak English; that Moses might be arrested in Borlin, as he lived at the house</hi>

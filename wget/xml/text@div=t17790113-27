               <p>I am an apprentice to Mrs. Wright.</p>
               <p>What age are you? - Thirteen. The prisoner came to our shop last Saturday, and bought a handkerchief; she then asked to look at some lace. I sent a little boy into the parlour, where m y mistress lay-in, to bring a little box of lace out, and I showed her several pieces; there was none that would do. As I was putting the lace into the box off the counter, I saw her take a piece, and lay it on the paper her handkerchief was in, and put it altogether in at her pocket hole. When she had done this, she was going sharp from the counter; I called out stop ma'am. She was opening the street door in a great hurry; I ran round the counter, laid hold of her gown, and called for nurse, who was in the next room, to come and assist me; we took her, and brought her into the parlour. I charged her with stealing the lace; she instantly denied it; she was very willing to be stripped and searched twice; the second time the lace was found. I was not in the room when it was found.</p>

               <p>I went to this shop, and bought a handkerchief. I went to put my handkerchief in my pocket, the lace lying by it; I took it up by mistake with the handkerchief, and put it in my pocket. I told them so when they charged me with it, and took it out and gave it them.</p>

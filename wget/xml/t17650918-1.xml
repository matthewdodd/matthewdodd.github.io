            . On Friday the 26th of July, I put thirteen quarters of oats into the bin over the stable, which just filled it; and on the Saturday morning I went to unlock the stable door, and found the lock had been tampered with, as I had found it before. I went and looked at the bin, and there was a hole sunk, by letting some down a spout into the stable; there appeared to be two bushels or more gone out: I let my master know of it, and

            . I and Mr. Thompson were, by Mr. Cousin's order, lock'd in the stable to watch, on the Sunday night, but nobody came: we were lock'd in again on the Monday night; about half an hour after one o'clock, we heard the prisoner's voice in the yard; he unlock'd the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180003"></xptr> door with a key of his own: he came in with a sack in his hand, and went to the spout, and when he was going to take out the slide, in order to let down some oats, Thompson took hold of him, he drop'd the sack immediately under the spout. (The lock the prisoner's key, the proper key, and sack, produced in Court.) When we charged him with taking the oats, he owned he had taken some before, and he came in then for a few more; that he took them for his rabbits, and desired we would let him go.</p>

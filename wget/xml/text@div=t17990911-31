               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Your wife and the prisoner have been on good terms, I believe? - A. I believe they have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe your wife might have given her property? - A. How is it possible for me to believe what I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you not really suspect that your wife gave it to her? - A. I should have a very indifferent opinion of my wife if I thought so; she was a good woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen her with these things that you have charged her with taking; how many times has she shewn it you? - A. She has not shewn it to me at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she not spoke to you about the persons that she should employ to make it up into a gown? - A. No; nothing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You have visited her frequently, have not you? - A. No, I did not know where to find her.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there has been a little bit of cookery in this business; do you know any one of the witnesses, who has been prompting the others what to say; have they not been instructing each other what to say? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. You and this lady at the bar were not upon very sociable good terms; did you never endeavour to win the lady over to become Mrs. Henbethel the second? - A. I have been a dying man these four years.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know if you have not been a dying swain, as well as a dying man? - A. I have had the asthma four years, the yellow jaundice twice, and the dropsy once.</p>
               <p>Q. I fancy you wanted to get this lady's yellow coin; have you not now been endeavouring to win over this lady's affections? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor her sister's, in case she should not consent? - A. Her sister I have a respect for, and had before my wife died; she is about my own age; I felt myself very awkward as a single man.</p>
               <p>Q. So do I; and you wished to change your condition? - A. Not with her; she had the yellow jaundice too.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I think there could not be a better couple come together; you would be a better match for each other? - </p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long were you robbed after your wife's death? - A. I missed it the very same night; I had seen the silk in the box after she died.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it your wife died? - A. I think it was the 16th; I told the prisoner I wished she would go with me to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. For what? - A. To be searched.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110070"></xptr>Q. What property did you charge her with stealing? - A. The silk and the watch chains.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner any relation to your late wife? - A. She was her niece, as I have been informed.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know whether she was or was not? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. I lodge in the prosecutor's house; I take in washing; the prisoner at the bar washed some silk, and asked me to take it to be mangled; it was a raven grey, or a black, I am not sure which; she said she would go with me, and turn the mangle for me, and I did; it was on a Saturday morning; I cannot tell what day of the month it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after the death of the prosecutor's wife? - A. Yes; she said it was some silk that she had given her by a lady she lived with; I cannot tell whether it was this silk that she said she had given her, or whether it was some silk that she had to make up a gown; after it was mangled, she said, Mrs. Badham, I believe I have not got all my silk; she counted it, and, I think, there were either twelve or thirteen breadths.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long had you known her before? - A. I have seen her once or twice; Mrs. Henbethel always told me she was her niece.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner told you she had it from a lady that she had lived with; had it not the appearance of having been part of a court dress? - A. No, I did not take any notice of it; she told me she had given the silk to her aunt to take care of for her, and that she was to have a petticoat off of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner lived in the prosecutor's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she gave it to you, publicly, in the prosecutor's house, for the purpose of being mangled? - A. Yes, but not in the presence of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make any secret at all of it? - A. Not the least in life.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I lodge at the prosecutor's house; all I know about the silk is, Mr. Henbethel came to me with a bundle of silk, and said -</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; on Saturday, the 20th of July, the prosecutor brought the prisoner to me, at the Marlborough's Head, in Malborough-street, and gave me charge of her for robbing him of silk and watch chains; the prisoner had a large bundle in her custody, tied up in an apron; I took the bundle from her, and searched it, and found this piece of silk (producing it); the prosecutor said it was his property; I asked her where she got the silk; and she said, she got it from the silkdyer's; I said it would be material for her to send for the silk-dyer, as that would be of great use to her before the Magistrate; then she said she had the silk from some place in the country; I then searched her pocket, and found two steel watch-chains; the prosecutor said they were both his; she said, no, only the small one; I then asked her where she lodged; and she said she had had no lodging for two or three nights.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you recollect her saying she had it from her mistress, in a place that she lived in the country? - A. I do not recollect that; I know she said she had it from some county in England, I forgot what.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the prisoner before? - A. No; nor the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever present when any conversation has been had with the prosecutor, or any friends of his, to endeavour to settle this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear, either from the prosecutor or the prisoner, that the prosecutor had sent friends to settle it? - A. I heard the prosecutor say, he had got a letter to compound it; indeed I have seen the letter myself; that was, I think, on Friday last, since we have been at the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether that is the same silk that belonged to your wife? - A. She had a great deal of silk in her box; but I can swear that this is the silk, I saw it three times in the box after my wife's death.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that to be the silk that was in your wife's box; - suppose I had produced that piece of silk at York, could you have sworn that that was the piece of silk that came out of your wife's box? - A. No, by no means; it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know that this is the same silk? - A.Because I saw it three times in my wife's box.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the chains? - A. These chains were in the same box; one of them I know perfectly well, for I had worn it fourteen years; I had put it by because it was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these seals upon them at the time you lost them? - A. They were not on them, but they were in the same box, lying in the same paper, I had put them by; I am not such a buck as I was fourteen years ago, I wear a piece of ribbon now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did your wife keep her box locked up? - A. Yes, to a certainty, for I myself tried that.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before your wife's death had you seen the chains? - A. A very short time.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110071"></xptr>Q. Where was the key of the box kept? - A. In a private place, where my wife and I knew where to find it.</p>

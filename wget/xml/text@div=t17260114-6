             thus depos'd. I drove the Chaise. The Prisoner Sells rode up to me with a Pistol in his Hand, presented it to me, and swore if I did not stop, he'd shoot me thro' the Head. In the mean Time, Mattocks who was on the other side of the Chaise, demanded my Masters Money and Watch, which my Master deliver'd, and then they rode off. I am certain that the Prisoners are the same Men, for I took great Notice of them both.</p>

             thus depos'd. There having been many Robberies lately committed about Highgate; and several Circumstances making Sells's Landlord suspect that he follow'd ill Courses; the Landlord informs me of it, and thereupon I surpris'd him in his Lodging, a-bed with a Woman. I found in the Room these Pistols and some other Things, which I took Possession of, as my own, according to Act of Parliament, which gives the House, Furniture, and Arms of a Highwayman, to those that apprehend him. Sells presently impeached Mattocks, and was an Evidence against him last Sessions, for robbing two Gentlemen in the Night, near Holloway, but for want of sufficient Proof he was acquitted. Several Witnesses appear'd in the Behalf of Mattocks, deposing that they had known him a great many Years; that he used the Sea, and had formerly bore a good Character.

                  </hi>. I live in Cheapside, and am an auctioneer. The prisoner lived with me as cook, about eighteen months—she had left my service two or three days, but had not taken away her trunk—I in<lb></lb>sisted upon searching it—It was seorched in my presence—there was a diamond ring found in it, and a duplicate of another ring—the diamond ring was Mrs. Newton's the other ring was my daughter's—Harrison has the ring—he took it out; it was mine.</p>

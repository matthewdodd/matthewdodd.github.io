On Sunday the 22nd of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, my brother called me from the adjoining room to the bar; I searched the drawer where my money was kept, and missed it - it was not locked. I cannot say how much I had there; there were more than twenty half-crowns, some shillings, and sixpences - I went to the prisoner and accused her of it; she denied it - I requested to know where it was, as it had been in a bag; she still denied it; I told somebody to fetch a constable - she then said,"Pray, Sir, forgive me, I will never do so any more," and pointed to a corner in the wash-house, where the bag lay, covered up; it was my bag, and contained 3l. 13s. 6d. in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. Her box was searched, and nothing found but new clothes, worth about 3l.; there were gowns, stockings, caps, thimbles, and a pair of scissars.</p>

At nine o'clock on Sunday morning, the 22nd of October, I saw this bag of silver in a drawer at the further end of the bar - I was in an adjoining room at three o'clock that afternoon, and saw the prisoner pass the door and go to the farther end of the bar; I heard the drawer open; she passed the door, returned into the kitchen, came back, went to the further end of the bar again, and I heard another drawer opening, and silver rattling; she then returned into the kitchen, and I went into the bar, and sat by the drawer till my brother returned - I informed him - he afterwards called me, and showed me the bag.</p>

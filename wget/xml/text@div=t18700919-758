                  </hi>. I reside at Rectory Place, Woolwich—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased child—it was about three months old—a male child—I saw the prisoners at their house—Elizabeth Saville said she was the mother of the child—the child was in an extremely emaciated condition, smaller than a child of its age ought to look—there were no external marks of violence—it died from the effects of neglected diarrhoea—there was no food in the stomach—but food quickly passes away during diarrhoea, and some may have passed away out of the system—it was healthy in every other respect, and capable of all the functions of life—I should say it had been suffering a week or ten days—I asked the mother if she had had a doctor—she said no, her peculiar notions precluded her from sending for a medical man—I ascertained they gave the child wine and arrowroot—I never found that they gave it medicine, but they gave, it other things—I think they gave it castor oil, but there was no immediate treatment in the last week or two of its death—had the child been treated in the ordinary way I think there is no question about it that its condition might have been ameliorated, and its</p>

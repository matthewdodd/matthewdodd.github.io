            . I am an officer. On the 17th of March, about one o'clock in the morning, I went to the prosecutor's house - I knocked at the prisoner's room door, and went in. He was at home. Mrs. Pounsberry said she suspected her things were taken. She read over an inventory of the things which she let with the room, and she missed these things. He said he had pawned them. I asked for the duplicates. He said he could not produce them, because they were with his brother-in-law. I said if they were not produced I must search him. He then took out a purse containing about fifty duplicates, and selected four from them. One of them was dated the 10th of February. The prosecutrix said she only let him the lodgings on the 9th. His wife is a short woman.</p>

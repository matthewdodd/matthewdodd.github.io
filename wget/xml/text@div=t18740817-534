                  </hi>. I am a commission merchant, at Mark Lane—on 24th July, about 10.30 at night, I was in Cornhill attempting to get into an omnibus—I saw the prisoner standing partly at my side and partly behind me, and I fancied I felt my watch being taken—I put; my hand to my pocket and discovered the watch was gone—I turned round and saw the prisoner handing it to another man—I had seen it within a quarter of an hour before—it was unhooked or else the bow was broken, for' the chain was perfect—I tried to catch hold of the prisoner—I said I had lost my watch and he bolted off directly—I followed him—I did not call "Stop thief" for some little time—I did eventually—he ran up Cornhill a little way and up an alley—I hit him on the head with my umbrella to stop him—it did stop him—an officer came up and I charged him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 664). The prosecutor gave the prisoner into custody in Pope's Head Alley, and charged him with stealing his watch—he said he knew nothing of the watch—I asked him what he was running for—he said he was running to get away from the prosecutor, he thought he was drunk and tried to get away from him—I found nothing on him.</p>

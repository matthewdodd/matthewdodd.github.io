                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Giddings, and live at 31, Green-streen, Blackfriars-road—I have seen the hide of a chesnut horse at the police court, which horse I knew to be my husband's when alive—it was lent to a man named Henley, on Tuesday, the 25th Nov. last—he wu to return it on the Saturday evening—he did not do so—in consequence of information, I sent my man Day to the prisoner's house on Sunday evening, the 30th Nov.—I am quite sure the hide belonged to my husband's horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. Giddings. On Tuesday evening, the 25th Nov., the evening the horse was lent to Henley, I saw the prisoner at a public-house opposite my master's premises—he said, "I have just told your mistress a horse, and she has just lent me another one"—on Sunday evening, the 30th Nov., I went to his house, and told him I came from Mr. Giddings, for the horse—he said, "The horse is a mile off, I cannot fetch it to-night, but I will bring it home the first thing in the morning."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I told him the horse would be home on Monday; I thought you bad come for a horse I had hired on Saturday to go to Deptford.</p>

I am a horse-slaughterer, and live at Wandsworth—on Saturday, the 29th Nov., between ten and eleven in the morning, the pri<lb></lb>soner brought me a chesnut cart-horse—it was then alive—it was the horse the hide of which was afterwards shown to Mrs. Giddings in my presence—I asked him where he bought it—he said it had it in a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi>—he did not say where—I purchased it of him—the horse was killed, the hide taken off, and sold to Mr. Hepburn, of Bermondsey.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had a horse to sell—on the 3rd Nov. I saw this party, and told him I should take it to market, and <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> it away; he said he could make a better bargain than I could, and get more money for the horse; I said I intended to send it to Mr. Giddings; he said, "Mr. Giddings knows me well; I will take it and make a better bargain," and I let him take it; my little boy went with him to bring back the money, instead of which he came back with another horse; I gave him no authority to get me another horse; he said, "I have brought you 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and another horse, do not you think I have made a better bargain than you would?" I said, "Yes," and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for himself; next morning he came up; the horse was put in my cart, but could not even draw the empty cart; it was not worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for work; I told him to take it back to Giddings; he said, "No, do not take it there, you will get nothing for it; they have so many horses; if you take it to a man at Wandsworth, you will get 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more," and I took it, and sold it to the gentleman; on the Sunday night Day came for the horse; I was sur<lb></lb>prised, for little did I think there was anything wrong; I told the gentleman I sold it to my right name and address; I had no knowledge it was got in</p>

               <p>this way; I have known Henley a month or five weeks; I have a wife and five children, and always worked hard to get an honest living.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the publisher of the "Derbyshire Courier," and a printer and bookseller, living at Chesterfield. The prisoner came into my service at the latter end of September, 1839—I gave him four weeks' notice to quit on the 6th of February—he was to leave on the 6th of March—on the 22nd of February I paid him his wages to the following Saturday—on the 24th of February he did not come to his employ in the morning as usual, and on inquiring at his lodging I found he had gone away—I have seen him write, and on the 26th I received this letter in his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—" Sir,—By the time you get this I shall have ter<lb></lb>minated an existence, begun and continued in sorrow; no efforts will find any trace of me. Your account I have sent to my brother, as well as several others; he will discharge them in a short time.—J. G. P.—Hull."—in consequence of suspicion I set off for London, and got here on the 1st of March—on the 2nd of March I went to Gray's Inn coffee-house, about eight o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner came in with a companion—the officers I had there took the prisoner—I asked him what he had done</p>

               <p>with the books he was seen to take from the shop—he made no reply—he was then taken to the station—while in my service he went by the name of John George Portman, but at the station he gave the name of John Porter—he said he did not know the name of the place he lodged at, but he was willing to take the officer to the place, and we got to Johnson's-court, Fleet-street—he pointed out some books, some of which I claimed, and there was a case of instruments, which though the mark was gone from them, I believe to be mine, as on examining my stock I missed a case like it—these books have my private mark on them—the prisoner had access to the stock where they were—before I took him I had been to Pickford's wharf—a box was produced to me there, and I have found the porter who assisted to get that box away from Chesterfield—the clerk at Pickford's opened the box, and I found in it a Shakspeare and several other books, which belonged to a private library at my house—I had no right to sell these books—I found also some memorandum books in it—the box was afterwards opened at the station—I made a further search in it, and found three dozen of pencils, a Bible, three folding knives, and four or five packets of sticking plaster—they have my private mark on them, except those two books which were taken from the private library—I had seen this Shakspeare a short time before he left—I can undertake to say I had sold him none of these things—I had no right to sell those belonging to the library, and I certainly did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What was my general character during the time I was in your employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say any thing in your favour, particularly for the few weeks before I gave you notice to quit—previous to January 1841, I certainly had occasionally suspected you, but 1 was averse to entertain those suspicions—I found you embezzling money, but you was a preacher among the Wesleyan society, and I was averse to encourage those suspici<lb></lb>ons—you held a confidential situation with me, because I believed your character was good—I cannot state any time, but I fancied that when you have been left in the shop, money has gone from the till—it might be fancy—when you was on a journey, you returned a Mrs. Frazer's account as un<lb></lb>paid, which I found was paid, but I was willing to attribute that to forget<lb></lb>fulness, and to give you credit for it—I believe you gave her a receipt for the money, and acknowledged you had it—I carry on the printing, bookselling, and stationery business beside the newspaper, and I keep a post-office—Miss Clean and Mrs. Roberts assist in the business—Mrs. Roberts is not here—I chiefly attend to the printing and the newspaper, and occasionally in the shop—Mrs. Roberts chiefly attended the shop—you attended to keeping the books, to reporting, to making out accounts, and assisting in the shop—you assisted in the paper as sub-editor—I have been twice up in London lately—I was at Eastbourn for three weeks in August last—you never bought any of these things of me, and I ascertained from the only parties that could have sold them, that you never did buy them—I have the account kept by yourself, which commences December, 1839, and is up to December, 1840—here is entered all the things he had during that time—here is a pencil, a small box, six envelopes, and some other things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

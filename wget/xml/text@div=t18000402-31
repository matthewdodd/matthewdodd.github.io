               <p>Q. Should you know a Bank of England note from a country Bank-note? - A. Yes; I had three from him, I spent and laid out the other two; I received the half-guinea in change of one of them; went down to Chatham after him, by land, two days after; I did not find him there; I staid in Rochester two days; I came to town again, and got an information that he was in St. Giles's; I found him last Tuesday morning was a week, in Church-lane; when he robbed me, he had on a brown jacket; and when I saw him in St. Giles's he had that coat that he has on now; I knew him directly, in about a moment I believe.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Rosemary-lane: Cogin was a ship-mate of mine for a few months in the year 1795; I met him and another person in Rosemary-lane, he asked me to go and drink with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. That is not the man; he was a man about five feet ten or eleven; the person that was with him took off his hat, and he was not like the prisoner; I had never seen him before I saw him at Bow-street; they were both very much in liquor, and I was sober; I am a salesman; they said they would call in the afternoon, and buy some clothes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you had no acquaintance with the prisoner? - A. None; I saw the man that was with Cogin again the same afternoon; I saw him go into the Clothes-exchange and buy some clothes; I saw him with a coat that he had bought, a dark-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. But who that strange man was, you cannot tell? - A. No; he had a full head of hair.*</p>
               <p>*The prisoner was bald.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cogin.) Were you sober? - A. I was sober enough to know him at any rate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not change your companion between Darkhouse-lane and Rosemary-lane? - A. No; if I wanted to part with him he did not intend to part with me; he was too fond of me. When this man was before Mr. Bond, he said he had never seen the crown of his head.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Holland.) Did you say any thing before the Magistrate about his head? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you, if there was so much difference as you speak of? - A. I was not asked about it, and I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of the matter; I was not there; I know nothing at all of the man; I was in Salisbury at the time.</p>
               <p>Holland. Last Thursday or Friday was a week Cogin came to me with a subpoena; and I said, if you say this is the man you were in company with, I must swear to it, and I do not like to go before a Justice; then he said I should have half the benefit if the man was hung; I made answer, no, I would sooner give you the money out of my pocket, than be taken before a Justice or a Jury, that I never was before in my life; he said, never mind, you shall have the benefit of it; you shall be well paid for your trouble; I told him I did not want any thing of the kind; then I went to Bow-street, and there I saw the prisoner at night about eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you saw him without his hat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And yet you did not take any notice to the Justice of the difference of the bald head? - A. No, I did not; I forgot it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a salesman in Rosemary-lane: On a day somewhere about the Fast-day, Cogin and another man came and shook hands with my man, the last witness; after he was gone away, I asked him what he had to do with that fellow; Cogin had lived servant with me formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who was in company with the prosecutor? - A. I saw him in company with a stout man, at about twenty yards distance, at a public-house door, the Blue-boar in Rosemary-lane; I saw them afterwards again; he was a very tall stout man; he was, I dare say, five feet eleven inches high; the prisoner at the bar is not the man that was in company with Cogin.</p>
               <p>Cogin. I lived about sixteen months ago, with Mr. Leary; I was with him four days for one shilling a day, and he used me very well for that time.</p>
               <p>Q. And you still persist in saying that the prisoner is the man? - A. I do.</p>

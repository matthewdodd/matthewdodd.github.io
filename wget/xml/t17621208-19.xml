I was called up by the watchman about 3 o'clock on the 5th of this instant; he asked me, whether I had left my window open? I got up, and let him in. We found a little window open, and 4 panes out of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that window fast, when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Francis. I do not know. There had used to be a shutter to it; but then it had only a hasp to the casement. I cannot say, whether it was hasped or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any glass out of it, before you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Francis. I do not know there was any out. I missed some money out of my desk in the parlour; that I know was shut when I went to bed; I cannot say whether it was locked or not. I missed a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080023"></xptr> silver milk pot and a silver punch ladle. There was a mark made with a knife in opening the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. How large is this window?</p>
               <p>Francis. It is about a foot wide and two feet high. I don't think a man could get into the window; but they might put their arm in and reach the desk. The watchman said, he had turned a young man out of the vault about an hour before; he described the person, so that I suspected the prisoner. He was an apprentice to a neighbour of mine; I went and found him about 8 o'clock in the afternoon. He confessed the taking the things. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . When we found the prisoner, I desired him to tell the truth. He was charged with this fact; he delivered the milk pot and ladle here produced to me. Since the bill was found against him at Hicks's-hall, he has confest, that a woman, who is now in Newgate, asked him if he had any money? he said, he had not. She then shewed him where to get some; that she went with him and shewed him the window; that he took 4 panes of glass out, and she received them of him, and was concerned in the robbery with him; her name is

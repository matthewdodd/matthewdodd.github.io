There was a general fight between the prosecutor's son and Smith. A person gave Smith to me; I took him to the watch-house, it was said a man in red hair, was in his company. I went directly and saw Mason in Pall Mall, and told him he was wanted; he said he would go with me, and walked by my side to the watch-house.</p>

            . About a dozen of the gang got round and hustled him. I did not see the watch taken, but saw it in Smith's hand - he was close enough to take it. A person with red hair was in the crowd; I am not certain whether it was Mason; I had seen them in company before the robbery. I afterwards assisted in taking Smith out of the crowd. I saw Mr. Chapman's son endeavouring to take Mason. I rather think Smith struck him in the mouth. I saw him pass the silver watch to another man.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. We drew aside when the carriage came up. My attention was drawn to a man with red hair about a yard off; he could not take the watch. I saw him attempt another person's pocket, and I tried to seize him; he drew me out, I was knocked down and he was rescued. I will not say it was Mason, as I have seen two persons so much like him since. Smith knocked me down while I held the man.</p>

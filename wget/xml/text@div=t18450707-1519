                  </hi>. I live in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. On the afternoon of the 15th of June I left an omnibus at Westminster-bridge—I took out my purse, paid my fare, and then put my purse into my outside coat pocket—I then went to the pier on the Westminster side, where there were a great many people waiting for the steam-boat—when the steam-boat came I went on board—there was great pushing and crowd<lb></lb>ing both on the steam-boat and on the pier—I observed the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing close by my right side—he was pushing very violently—I turned to expostulate witri him, and saw my purse in his hand—I accused him of having taken it—he replied he had not done so, and if he had it must be on his person—I watched him—we went as far as Chelsea, and there I gave him into custody—I know it was my purse I saw in his hand, because it was covered with steel beads, and it glistened in the sun—it was made of brown silk—there were four sovereigns in it, one half sovereign, and five or six shillings in silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and live in Austin Friars—I accom<lb></lb>panied Mr. Wigan in the omnibus, and when we got on the steam-boat he spoke to the prisoner, who was standing immediately next to him—he accused him of having taken his purse—the prisoner said, "No, I have not, if I have I must have it on my person now"—I said, "That does not follow, for some person has just left you and gone on the lighter alongside of the pier"—the prisoner remained on board the steamer—he did not attempt to go away—we were going on, otherwise I should have stepped on shore and detained the other man—I spoke about it, and called to the people to detain him, but they did not understand me—we landed at Chelsea, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier, of 48, St. George's-place, Knightsbridge—on the evening of 21st March, the prisoner was at my shop—I came in and found him there, and my young man asked me in his presence to give change of this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he had bought goods to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—immediately I took it in my hand, I thought it was a bad one, and asked the prisoner where he got it from, and if he could give me some account of himself, and if he did not give a satisfactory account I should have to send for a policeman—he then stated that he took the note from a gentleman at Brighton—he then said that he lived in Raleigh-street</p>

               <p>—I said there was no such street in that district—he said it was Raleigh-street over the water—I then sent for a constable and gave him the note, after marking it and showing it to a neighbour—at the station, the prisoner said he had just come from Liverpool, and had taken the note there—he was asked for his residence, and he said "Raleigh-street;" that he should have stopped there that evening had he not been taken, but he had no residence in London.</p>

There is no legal evidence to show that I had guilty knowledge or that I was previously acquainted with forgery; it may be the misfortune of any one to be in possession of a forged note. It may not he a satisfactory way of showing how it came into my possession, but my occupation leads me into business transactions with persons who I am totally at a loss to give any account of. I am a stranger in London.</p>

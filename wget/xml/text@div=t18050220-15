               <p>Q. What were they about? - A. The lead was stripped and cut in seven different peices, laying down between them; I laid hold of Miles, I asked him what he was doing there, he said nothing, I asked him again who employed him to do such a piece of business as that to injure me in stripping the lead from that gutter, he made no reply, I told him he must go along with me; I told the other man not to stir, I would run him through if he did, I had a bayonet with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw it, it did not remain fixed to the building? - A. They had fixed cords to it to pull it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they are? - A. One is a bricklayer and the other is a labourer; one of them is a lodger of mine, in the front garret, No. 4, though I had not the pleasure of knowing him then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These houses belong to you? - A. Yes; I rent them of Mr. Lumley, in Tower-street, and I let out each house to separate persons, No. 6, and No. 4, I receive my rent quarterly, and No. 5, I let to a yearly tenant; I pay my rent for them to Mr. Lumley, quarterly.</p>

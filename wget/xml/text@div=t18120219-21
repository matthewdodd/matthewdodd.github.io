On the morning of the 31st of January I had occasion to go into this repository of coals between eight and nine o'clock, accompanied by my carter, and at the father end of the warehouse, against where the prisoner was employed, I discovered two boards were removed.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the removal of these two boards enable a man to creep through - A. Yes, and there were a large bulk of the coals gone, many chaldrons of coals had gone I determined to lay wait at night to see whether any person was employed in taking them, and between six and seven o'clock; on the same evening after dark I saw the prisoner go into his stable with a light; I then lay as close concealed as I could in the warehouse, and heard a shovel employed in throwing coals out of the warehouse; I then went to Mr. Winkle's, and a man that is not in custody opened the door to me, and he immediately let the stable-man run away; he has not been seen since; I then went to the further end of the stable, I cried out to the prisoner, I knew he was inside of our warehouse, that he must come out, or if he did not I would certainly shoot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190018"></xptr>him, he then told me to take the pistol away and he would come out; I had a pistol with me; he did come out, and I took him in custody. The boards were down, he came out through the opening of these boards; we measured the coals afterwards, there were three sacks thrown out.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-house, in New Compton-street. I had employed the prisoner for two years as a jobbing bricklayer and painter—he was there on Saturday, and Monday the 3rd of February—on Thursday evening I missed a pair of boots from my kitchen—I told him I suspected him, and not to come near my place any more; but on Thursday he came and had some coffee, and offered two rings for sale to a customer in the shop, but I did not know they were mine—I heard him tell the man he was going to sell them—he went out directly, and then the man gave me information—I went up stairs, and missed two rings and four or five shirts, and several other things—one drawer was nearly cleared—I waited outside my house, expecting him to return, which he did in about two hours—I told him I had every reason to suspect he had some of my pro<lb></lb>perty—he asked, "What?"—I said, "Two rings"—he said, "I know nothing about two rings; I never had any thing of that kind"—I said, "Yes, you offered them for sale in my shop"—he denied it—I then con<lb></lb>fronted the witness with him, and he said, "Oh, you mean the rings I showed you; I found them in the drain"—I asked him what he had done with them—he took me to the shop where he had sold them as old gold—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they had been locked up in my first-floor bed-room.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner in a long address, complained of the prosecutor being a very mercenary man, and stated that he found the rings in the drain of the house which he was repairing; that the prosecutor had been twice convicted of keeping a bad house, and wanted him (the prisoner) to perjure himself on his behalf; and he believed the rings were placed there on purpose to entrap him</hi>.)</p>

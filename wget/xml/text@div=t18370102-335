                  </hi>. I am porter to Thomas Pickford and Co. I received from Ridgway, Dakin, and Co., about half-past six o'clock on the night of Friday, the 23rd of December, a tea-chest, to go to the wharf at the City Basin—I placed it on the copse of my cart—I went from there to Newbery's, for a bale of silk—I left my cart at the door while I went in, and when I came back the tea-chest was gone—this is it—it corresponds with the others which I had in the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. About half-past six o'clock on the evening of the 23rd of December, I was at the bottom of Fore-street. I saw a cart opposite the silk-shop there—I saw the prisoner take the chest off the copse of the cart, and drop it on the shaft—he then took it in his arms, ran across the street, and very nearly hit my horse's head—I though it was not right, and jumped over the copse of my cart—he made a stumble at the pavement, and nearly fell down, and dropped the chest—I told Cowburn to take charge of the chest—I pursued and took the prisoner.</p>

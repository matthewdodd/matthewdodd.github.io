I had a band-box, a bundle, and an umbrella. I met three men; they were strangers. I know the two prisoners; they are two of the men; Capsey caught the bundle off the bandbox; he went a few steps, and it fell, then it dropped. I went and tried to pick it up. He gave me a push, and I slipped down. He got it up again and ran away; I ran after him a little way. I did not overtake him. The other man, Lewis, asked me what I wanted; and I said I wanted my bundle, and I would have it. He said no more. He seemed to smile; he did not prevent me from running; and then he and the other ran after Capsey, and I came back again. I saw Lewis and the other go after Capsey. I then went on to Newington. They went on Islington way. I next saw the prisoners at about twenty minutes before two o'clock. They were then taken into custody. When I got across the fields, almost to Newington, I met a young man. He asked me if I was frightened at the cows, and I said no; but that I had been pushed down by two men. I told him what had happened, and he went after them. I can't recollect what was in the bundle. There were about six pairs of stockings; they belonged to Miss Parker, and she was with me. There<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100027"></xptr>were focks, but I can't recollect what else. There were shoes, a pocket handkerchief, a shift, a night gown, and a night cap. They all belonged to Miss Parker. There were some other things which I have not mentioned; there was nothing of my own in the bundle. I was to take them to Dr. Gascoigne's. Miss Parker was going there on a visit; she is eight years old; it is about twenty minutes or half an hours walk. When I was pushed, and slipped down, the bundle was close to me at the time he pushed me; he picked the bundle up, it was then close to me. When I saw them again, it was about two hours after. I knew them again, and I am sure Capsey is the man that took the bundle of the box.</p>



               <p>JURY. Did the prisoners speak together before the assault was made. - A. I did not hear them talk; they were as close together as persons usually are, who are in company with each other, and the man who asked me what I wanted saw the other run.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Lewis. Was I within ten yards of you when it happened - A. They were all together when I saw them.</p>

               <p>Lewis. Did I run the same way as the others - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Lewis. Did I not say I would foilow the man and get the bundle back - A. No.</p>

               <p>Capsey. I wish to know whether it was I that shoved her - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>BENJAMEN CLARKE. On the day in the indictment, I was in a field near Paradice Row, in a field facing the church. Before the young woman came up to me, I saw the prisoners and another with them. They were coming over Kingsland-road, and they passed me as I was milking a cow. I first saw them in the road, and then in the field. That was the field the young woman complained of being robbed in. It was the same field in which I was; and about seventy or eighty yards from the spot where I stood. They were in company with them; I saw them all in company together in the road also, looking into a watch-maker's shop. They seemed to be persons loitering along, and not walking like regular passengers. Their manner was such as to call my attention to them, and it did. The young woman came up to me; I asked her if she was afraid of the cows; and she said no, she had been knocked down by three men. In consequence of that I pursued the men. They were then out of my sight; but I got sight of them again in about a quarter of an hour. I got sight of them by Cannonbury House. I saw them all three stop under a tree. I got near to them. I believe they took an apron and put the bundle in it; for I saw them doing something with the bundle under the tree with an apron. A servant of Dr. Gascoigne's came after me in the pursuit. I got near to them almost by High-street, Islington, and they were both taken. I was present when they were stopped. I am quite sure they were two of those persons that I had noticed before.</p>

               <p>JOHN LOCKE. I am servant to Dr. Gascoigne; I followed the last witness in pursuit of these men. I came up to them, just by Cannonbury House. I was not up with him before the cry of stop thief. One was stopped by a man who could not hold him, and I assisted him; I seized Lewis, and gave him and the bundle to an officer. The prisoner Lewis said he was running after us.</p>

               <p>Capsey's Defence. I never saw this man Lewis before in my life.</p>

               <p>Lewis's Defence. I was coming from my uncles at Stoke Newington, and I met three men, and asked them the way to Islington, and one of them told me to follow my nose; and then one of them hallooed out, that I might follow them if I liked, or something similar to that, and I did follow them; but I know no more of the robbery than the child unborn.</p>

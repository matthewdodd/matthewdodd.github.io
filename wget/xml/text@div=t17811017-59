               <p>On the 13th of September, about four in the afternoon, I was drinking at the King's-arms, in Beach-lane. The prisoner came to me, and said he had a hat in pawn, which I should have, if I would fetch it out. I said, I would go and fetch some money. I went out. The prisoner followed me. I met with

I had a box, with four guineas: I took one out, and left the other three in the box. I put the box in a drawer. I locked the drawer, and my room door. I put both the keys in my right-hand pocket. I went again to the public-house. In about half an hour after, the prisoner, who sat on that side on which the keys were, went away, and said he would call for me when he had got the hat ready. I waited for him about two hours, and then missed the keys out of my pocket. I had felt them in my pocket while I was in the house. I went to see after the prisoner, but could not find him. I went home, and found the door upon the single lock. The drawer was not locked at all. I found the box in two pieces, lying open, and the money gone. On the 20th of September, I found the prisoner at the Red Bull, in Long-lane. He skulked behind the box when he saw me. Upon my bringing him out, and saying he was the person that robbed me, he said there was another person as guilty as he was of the robbery. I got the key of my room again of

I asked him what business he had there. He said he came for the pair of shoes he was sent for by Collins. I went down for a pitcher of water, and he came down and went away.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 13th of July I was on duty nearly opposite the House of Lords, as the Prince Regent was returning from the House. I observed several gangs of pickpockets - among the rest I saw the prisoners and a third person, whom I very well knew, sounding peoples' pockets. After watching them three or four minutes, I saw them following two gentlemen very close, until they came <placeName id="t18190915-185-crimeloc988">opposite Palace-yard</placeName>

One of the prisoners got close behind, and tried the gentleman's right-hand pocket, but, I believe, did not succeed. The procession passed, and the gentlemen ran across, which disappointed them. The three overtook them in Great George-street. I went along on the right side, and directed Glassborough to keep on the left. A coach or two intervened, which prevented my seeing at times, but I saw them draw close round the gentlemen. The hand of the middle man went into the pocket - I think it was Lewis, but am not certain - a pocket-book was drawn out. I turned to secure them, and heard Glassborough call out,</p>

            !" I collared him, and took him back to Glassborough, who had hold of Lewis with his right-hand, and the pocket-book in his left. I called to the gentlemen, and told them they were robbed - they came back. The right-hand gentleman claimed it, and wanted me to give it up, which I refused to do until we went before a magistrate. He followed me into a public-house, where we took the prisoners to search them, and threatened me with an action if I did not give it up. He followed us to the watch-house, and said he would come forward if I would give him some papers of no consequence out of it, which I did. He took a memorandum or two, rubbed some out, then threw the book at me, and said I might keep it and be d - d, for he was not going to have the trouble of prosecuting. As we went to the office, the prisoners said, as the gentleman would not come forward, they wished they had a few pounds to make it up with me - I said I would hear nothing of the kind.</p>

            . I was with Gook, and saw the prisoners and another following the gentlemen. They crossed over to George-street, and went about six or seven yards down the street. I saw Lewis put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, take the pocket-book out, and hand it towards Cook, but before he could take it I secured Lewis and took it from him. I called to Gook to secure Cook, which he did. I had seen Cook feel several gentlemens' pockets.</p>

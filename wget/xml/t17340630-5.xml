               <p>Mr. Thornbury. About 12 at Night, the Prisoner as usual undrest me in my Dressing-room where the Bureau stood, and he put my silver Buckles in his Pocket to clean them next Morning as I thought, but about 7 in the Morning I heard he was gone. As I did not think he had taken any thing with him but his Livery and my Buckles, I only said Let him go - he's a sorry Fellow. But going into my Dressing room, I found the Bureau was broke open and mist 27 l. 14 s. 6 d. of Mrs. Fleet's Money, and 23 l. the Money of

I was afraid some Bank-Notes were gone too. But opening a Book I had put them in, I found them all safe. We went to the Cheshire-Cheese in Arundel-street where the Prisoner had lodg'd; we heard he had hired a Horse of Mr. Child behind St-Clement's-Church, and had changed his Livery. I got a 1000 Advertisements printed, describ'd the Prisoner and his Horse, and put them in the Post-Office to be sent all over England. On Friday the Horse was return'd <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173406300006"></xptr> to Mr. Child, and he told me he had heard the Prisoner was at Huntington. I sent Mr. Child Post after him, and he return'd on Saturday Night, and said the Prisoner was taken with 41l. and my Buckles upon him, and committed to Huntington Goal. Here's the Money and Buckles seal'd up in this Bag.</p>

            . I had been out of Town, and when I return'd, my Partner told me, he had let a Horse to the Prisoner. In the Evening Madam Fleet's Servant came to enquire if the Prisoner had hired a Horse. I said Yes. They told me he had committed a Robbery. 3 Days after this the York Coachman brought back my Horse. I told him what had happen'd, and he said he had left the Prisoner at Stevenage; and if I took Post I might get to Huntington before the Coach went out. I accordingly took Post Horses at Mid night, and came to Huntington by 7 in the Morning; but the York Coach was gone. I and the Landlord follow, and at the End of 6 Miles overtook it, and seiz'd the Prisoner. I ask'd him how he came to rob his Mistress. He said he had done it, and could not help it. I found 2 Guineas, half a Moidore, and some Silver, in his Pocket, and he said it was his Mistresses's Money and that the rest was in his Cloak-bag. I search'd the Cloak-bag, and found 7 pair of Stockings, some Linnen, a pair of silver Buckles, 12 Moidores, 11 Guineas, and 3 Portugal Pieces of 3 l. 12 s. each. I carried him before Justice Forkington, at Huntington, where he made a Confession, and afterwards he wrote this Letter, (I saw him write part of it) to his Mistress, and I carried it to her, at her House in Great-James-street in Bedford-Row.</p>
               <p>Then the Letter was read. He therein says, he has confest all before the Justice, and begs Pardon of his Mistress, acknowledges that he had receiv'd her Pardon once before; but his fellow Servants twitting him with it; that put him upon Robbing her and running away.</p>
               <p>His Confession being prov'd, was likewise read in Court. In this, he owns, that about 6 in the Morning he broke open the Escritore in Mrs. Fleet's House, and took away 12 Moidores, 3 Portugal 2 l. 12 s. Pieces, 3 Guineas, a half Moidore, and about 8 l. in Silver, and a pair of silver Buckles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Child took me, he said if I'd own the Fact, my Mrs. would take me into her Service again, and I being in Confusion and Light-headed, by means of a late Feaver, I did not know what I said or sign'd, but I remember that Mr. Child Pick'd my Pocket.</p>

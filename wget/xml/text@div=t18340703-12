            . I live in Bartholomew-terrace, City-road. On the 13th of June, I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Mr. Smith's pocket - he threw it back to a companion who ran off - I informed Mr. Smith that the prisoner had taken his handkerchief - he secured him - I am quite certain the prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him he was wrong - he at first said a man was begging alongside the gentleman. Witness. I did not - I saw a tradesman who said he had been watching three of them nearly all night, and that one of them had asked the prosecutor for charity - he ran off when the prisoner was pursued.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been to my sister, at No. 53, Leather-lane - the gentleman came up to me, and said, "Young man, I think you have picked my pocket" - I said, "You are wrong, and are welcome to take me" - I walked into a pastry-cook's shop while he went and brought the officer - the young man said he thought he saw me take it and give it to another - at Guildhall he said he actually saw me take it - I was one hundred yards off, and made no resistance to get away - he never laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>C. SMITH re-examined. He did not propose to go to any shop to wait for an officer - he was never three yards from me - I had a lady with me - I put her into a shop and followed him - he did not know I was behind him - he was walking on - I seized and took him into a pastry-cook's shop - I am quite certain he is the person Thomas pointed out to me.</p>

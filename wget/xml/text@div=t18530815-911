                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in Brindley-street, Harrow-road. On Saturday night, 25th June, about half-past 10 o'clock, I was in Dudley-grove, at the corner of Dudley-street, Harrow-road, with my wife—there is a pickled-eel stall there—I had some eels—the prisoner was standing at the stall—he dropped a basin accidentally, and when it was down he put his foot upon it, and broke it on purpose—it was a basin that he had been eating the eels out of—he then asked for some more eels—the man wanted the basin—the prisoner said he had not got it—there were three others in company with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185308150063"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoner, and they all said they had not seen it—I told the man that kept the stall that the prisoner had dropped the basin accidentally, and broken it for the purpose—I saw him with his foot upon it, and I said to the prisoner it was a pity he should rob the man out of a paltry penny basin—he asked me what business it was of mine, and called me a b——snot—he then picked up a basin off the stall, walked round the stall, and threw it at me; it struck me in the eye—I was about four or five yards from him at the time—directly he had <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> the basin at me, he rushed in at me, and pulled me down; and while I was down, he got his thumb in the corner of my eye, trying to gouge my eye out—I pushed him off as well as I could, and got up—he ran in at me again, got me down, and tried the same thing over again—he had his finger in my eye, and my eye was nearly out; and after I stood up, he <hi rend="italic">clawed</hi> at my eye twice with his open hand—I cried out, and somebody came and pulled him off me—the basin he threw at me was shattered into many pieces; it cut me all round my eye; a piece of the bason was taken out of my eye—I shall never see so well as I did before—I had not said or done any<lb></lb>thing to provoke him—I had never seen him before—I was quite sober—my wife and I had been to market, I had but one pint of beer the whole evening—the prisoner was taken into custody by an officer, and he was very glad to go.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a stall, and sell pickled eels, at the corner of Dudley-street, Harrow-road.

                  </hi>. I live in Dudley-street. On 25th June I was in a beer shop at the corner of Dudley-street—I heard a cry from a female, and ran out directly—I saw the prisoner striking at the prosecutor three or four different times—I did not take much notice of that, not knowing which was in fault—the prosecutor turned his face towards me, and I saw it was all in a gore of blood—the prisoner had his hand on the prosecutor's face, with one finger in his eye—I heard the prosecutor halloo out, "Oh! oh!"—I rushed up, and pulled his arm away—I was then pushed away myself, and he rushed at him again, caught him by the face again, and said, "I suppose you want a pearl, don't you?"—he was then in the act of throwing him—I rushed up as well as I could to part them, and we all three went down together—in trying to get up I was pushed down again—I scrambled up as well as I could, and saw the prisoner running round the corner by the beer shop—Lawrence and a great number of people were following him—I got on my legs and followed him, and we caught him at the butcher's, a policeman came up, and he was given into custody—as soon as the policeman came up somebody knocked his hat off—the prisoner ran very fast; he did not stagger; he ran as well as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon of St. Mary's Hospital on 25th June last. Green was brought there about 11 o'clock at night—he had a wound on the left lower eye-lid, and another smaller one below; there was a great deal of bruising round the eye itself, and the left eye was rather more prominent than the other—there was a piece of crockery ware in the wound on the lower eye-lid—blood was effused in the membrane which covers the eye, and there was blood within the eye itself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the left eye was more prominent: do you mean more swollen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The eye-ball was more protruding, the globe of the eye itself was rather advanced.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could the man see at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; one of the injuries was such as might have been produced by a basin thrown at him—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you to say, that the throwing of the basin, taking into account that a piece of crockery ware stuck in the eye, would alone produce the effect which you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think it might; the effusion of blood in the eye might proceed from a blow, and that would make the eye-ball protrude.</p>

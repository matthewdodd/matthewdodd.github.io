                  </hi>. I live at the "Bedford Arms," Copenhagen Street, Islington—on 17th August, between one and two in the morning, I was coming up Rahere Street, Goswell Road—three men came up to me—they caught hold of me behind—I immediately turned round, caught hold of two of them, and missed my watch, which was in my waistcoat pocket—they got away—the prisoner was one of them—I caught hold of him, called out, "Police!" and a policeman ran across the road—the prisoner ran towards Charles Street, and the policeman took him—I ran after him—I never lost sight of him—I had had a little to drink—I knew what I was about.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman G 175). On the morning of 17th August, about two o'clock, I heard cries of "Police!" went to the place, and saw the prisoner running—I stopped him, and kept him till the prosecutor came up—he was about twenty-five yards behind him—he said the prisoner, with two others, had stolen his watch, and he would give him into custody—the prisoner made no answer at all—he was sober at the time—he appeared to be drunk when we got to the station, but was sober again in a very few minutes—the prosecutor had certainly had a glass to drink, but he was not drunk—he could run fast—he knew what he was about.</p>

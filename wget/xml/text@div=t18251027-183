On Wednesday, the 12th of October, I was standing in the turnpike-road, when the prisoner came out of a house and said, "Halloo, young man, what is the matter?" he took my hat off and ran away with it - he was taken into custody on the Saturday following - I know him by sight - he lived about two miles from me - I have seen the hat in the possession of the constable.</p>

I told Price not to pursue him, because there was a company of them, and I thought they would ill use him, if he got out of the town - I am a labouring man, and the prisoner worked the same as I do, at what he could get to do.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ford, clerk of the arraigns. The prisoner, my Lord, has been tried twice, but not for the crime charged in the indictment. The first indictment charged him with having uttered the bill of Exchange in question, knowing the same to be forged, with intention to defraud Mr. Dickson: that indictment could not be maintained for two reasons; the first, because there was no such person as John Richardson, the supposed drawer of the bill; and secondly, it was not uttered with intention to defraud Mr. Dickson, but Mess. Brown and company. The second indictment against him charged him with having forged the acceptance of Mr. Dickson to a certain bill of Exchange, drawn by one

On the 29th of December last being at Mr. Hinton Brown'sa banker in Lombard Street, and with him in a back room, his clerk came in, saying, This man is come again with another forgery; upon which Mr. Brown desired me to step forward with him into the shop, and taking with him this bill ( holding it in his hand) asked who brought it, and the clerk pointed to the prisoner. who was then in the shop. Mr. Brown said to the prisoner, Did you present this bill? he said he did: he also asked him who he had it of; he replied, of a grazier, a very eminent man in Lincolnshireand a man that came to Smithfield every market day; adding, that he was well known, and that his name was

            . Mr. Brown said he had too much reason to believe it was a forged bill; and the clerk said, This is the man that brought the draught, two days before for 3 l. 10 s. Mr. Brown asked the prisoner if he was there two days before with a draught, but he denied it. Mr. Brown then sent for Mr. Dickson, and when he came the bill was shewn to him; he said, The drawer I know nothing of, neither did I order it for payment: and addressing himself to the prisoner, said, Mr. WomerslyI am very sorry to see you the presenter of it, but I had too much reason to belive it was you, from the description Mr. Brown's people gave of your person. He was then taken into a back room, where Mr. Dickson talked to him, and said, WomerslyI do not think you are the only person concerned in this, therefore you had better discover them, that some lenity may be shewed you, or you must be hanged for it. Mr. Dickson, and Mr. Brown had a good deal of talk with him, but he would make no discovery. Mr. Brown (being a quaker, would not take an oath) desired me to go with him before my Lord-Mayor, who examined the prisoner: there he denied knowing any thing of the forgery, but said he had it of this Jones, whom he before named. The bill was then presented to him, and he was asked if it was the bill he presented at Mr. Brown's for payment; he said it was. This was on the Wednesday. He was committed for further examination,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175405300005"></xptr> and having told his Lordship that Jones came to Smithfield every market day, my Lord indulged him till Friday, at which time he was re-examined: then he said he had sent a man and horse, in order to meet Jones upon the road from St. Allan'sand the messenger was not returned; upon which his Lordship said he must commit him.</p>

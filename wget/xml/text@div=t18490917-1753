                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Muddiman; we live at Homsey; we keep a receiving-house for letters. The prisoner was in the habit of coming for letters—he came on 12th Sept.—I had left my niece in the shop, while I went in the washhouse—the prisoner came, and sent her out into the street to pick up a stick about twenty yards off—I went into the shop in about ten minutes, and found several shillings, sixpences, and groats gone from the till, and eleven pence in copper—I did not see the prisoner in the shop, but I heard him—no one but him had been in the shop from the time the money was safe, about half-an-hour before.</p>

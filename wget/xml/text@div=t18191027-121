            . I am the wife of Augustine Stanley. On the 4th of August, in the afternoon, my linen hung in my garden to dry. I was in the yard ten minutes before five o'clock, the door was bolted, and the things safe; in a few minutes a young man told me I had been robbed of my linen. I went into the yard, found the door open, and my linen gone out of a basket, and one shirt was taken off the line, which I had pinned on. The lad took me to a field-gate, and I saw the prisoner running; Blain followed and secured him at Bagnigge Wells; he was brought back to my yard, I opened his apron, and took the linen out.</p>

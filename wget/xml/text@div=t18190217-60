On the 29th of January I missed a piece of French cambric - I accused Elliott of robbing me, which he denied for a considerable time, but afterwards said he had stolen that and several other articles, of which he gave me an account - he said he had delivered them over to Osband. I went with an officer to the house of one Mackintosh, in Sun-court, which is by the side of my house, and took Osband there. I charged him with receiving the goods from my servants - he denied it for sometime, then said he had done it, and took me and the officer to his lodgings, three or four doors off, and in his box we found the articles stated in the indictment - I knew them all to be my property. I never saw Osband in the house. I dare say the things were taken at different times.</p>

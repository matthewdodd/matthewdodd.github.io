            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a salesman, I live at Mr. Gower's in Holborn, my own residence is 26 Compton-street. On the night of the 25th of May I was at my benefit club; I came through Holborn, near to Middle-row, I came up to the waggon. After I got through the row I saw a man in a mixture coat, he came up to the waggoner, asked him where the waggon came from, and who the waggon belonged to, he answered; the man in the mixture coat said he knew the owner exceeding well. I got a-head of the waggon, and I stopped at Chancery-lane, and the waggon got before me again; I heard him ask the waggoner to have something to drink; the waggoner drawed up to the George and Blue Boar; I told him to go about his business for they wanted to rob the waggon; the waggoner went on. The man that was in the mixture coat flew round the back of the waggon, went over the road, and went into the Red Lion public house; I went on a head of the waggon as far as Turnstile; there I told the waggoner to keep his course and not stop for any one. I saw no more of the waggon till I came to Smart's-buildings; there I saw the man in the mixture coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160025"></xptr>Q. Did the waggon stop there. - A. No. I did not see the face of the man in the mixture coat; I saw him come round the waggon. As soon as I saw this man in the mixture coat he struck him in the face and knocked him down with his fist between the wheels, with intention to knock him under, but he did not do it. The man retreated, from that I retreated, and went to the watchman at Smart's-buildings. After the watchman came up I went round of the other side and took the waggoner away, and went up St. Giles's. At the time the waggoner was knocked down I saw no man but the man in the mixture coat.</p>
               <p>Q. After he knocked the man down what became of him. - A. I cannot say; the watchman sprang his rattle; in two or three minutes afterwards the spring of the rattle at the corner of Smart's buildings brought other watchman, and the inhabitants out. I told the waggoner to come out of the narrow part of Holborn, I told him he was in a dangerous place.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw several people assemble. - A. Yes; I do not know how many.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this. - A. It was about half past eleven. it was a fine night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to describe the men. - A. No, I should not know them by the face at all; he had a dark mixture lapelled coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Look to the men at the bar, and tell me whether you can speak to either of them. - A. I cannot speak to either of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. It was dark. - A. Yes, I could not take any observation at all.</p>

            . - Mr. Andrews. What are you. - A. I am a bookseller in Holborn. On the night of the 25th of May I was standing at my desk in my shop, I heard a waggoner apparently stop his horses; the man was crying out why do you use me ill, or why do you knock me down. I went out of the side door, I came round the corner (my house is the corner of a court), and at the next door there stood two men by the shutters, and opposite that there stood the waggoner and Mr. Watkinson, and the next door was an alamode beef shop with a patent lamp each side the window, and a patent lamp in the shop. I saw the persons of the two men.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the waggoner say or do to these two men. - A. The waggoner seemed to describe the assault that these two men had been making to him; the waggoner was very bloody in the face, he said that one of these men had knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the two men at the bar, and tell me whether you recollect the persons of the two men that were present. - A. I will tell you as it has struck me all along; I imagine I stood next to Caddick.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be one of the men you have described. - A. Yes, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear positively. - A. I could not take upon me to swear positively to a man whom I had seen but once. The waggoner said he had knocked him down, and he would swear to it; the men were both impertinent. I seeing the waggoner bloody, and they impertinent, I said, my friend, there is a watch-box, you had better charge the watch with him. At that time the watchman was coming with his lanthorn; young Mr. Watkinson said, here is a watchman; I said now you charge him with the watch. As soon as I advanced a step or two to the watchmen these two men run off; the shorter man stood near me, he had a kind of a speckled frock coat on, and they both had the resemblance of gentlemen's grooms; I perfectly recollect the dress they had on. I stood still myself; I had no apprehension of the danger that took place. The watchmen pursued them, and young Mr. Watkinson pursued, and in a very few minutes Mr. Watkinson came back; he said he was struck; I thought he said he was stuck. He took his hands off, and I perceived he was wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the two men you have described after they run off. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you at all describe the tall man. - A. Why. the tall man had a dark dress, I cannot say the colour of the coat. I only think they are the men; when I saw them at Lambeth-street it struck me they were the men, they were dressed different to what they are now; I believe Caddick is in the same dress, I cannot say positively. Briant was dressed in a suit of black there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the tall man Briant. - A. I cannot speak to the countenance only. From the general appearance they were like grooms. It has struck me all along that they are the same men. I cannot say more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You had but little time to observe these men - how much time had you. - A. About two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. That person that you describe to be Caddick was next to you; had you the opportunity of observing him better than the other who was farther from you. - A. Most likely.</p>
               <p>Q. You were alarmed. - A. I had no alarm then.</p>
               <p>Q. These persons you had never seen before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These persons are now trying for their lives - do you mean to have it understood that you mean positively to swear to the persons of these men that you saw only two or three minutes. - A. I cannot say; I think they are the men, and it has struck me all along so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where next did you see them after this night. - A. At Lambeth-street. I saw them before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not their persons pointed out to you as the persons against whom you were to appear. - A. Yes. I saw another man, but I could not point him out; I believe they resemble the men that I saw that night.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you live in High Holborn. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of May the 25th was your attention attracted by any thing. - A. Yes, I was coming down Broad St. Giles's at about half past eleven at night; in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160026"></xptr>the narrow part of Holborn; I perceived four or five people standing together, by the alamode beef shop. When I went to see what was the matter, I saw two persons, and one of them stood by Mr. Cawthorn's shutters; they appeared to me to be suspicious characters; the alamode beef shop was open; the waggon was stopped, and the waggoner was standing off the curb; when he came near the short man, he said you are the man that knocked me down, I will swear to it; Mr. Kettle who was standing by, said you have been ill used, you had better call the watchman; a watchman came from the corner of Smart's-buildings; I said to the waggoner, there is the watchman; the waggoner turned round, he said watchman take charge of this man; that was the short one. The tall man took hold of the short one, turned him round, and gave him a push up Holborn, the opposite way from where the watchman was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the light of the alamode beef shop give you any light so as to speak to their persons. - A. Yes, the short one; the tall one was standing towards St. Giles, he was rather out of the light.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look, and tell me whether either of them are the persons. - A. If either of them are the persons I have lost my recollection; the prisoner at the bar answers to the two men in height; I do not recollect their faces.</p>
               <p>Court Are they unlike the men. - A. They are like the men; I cannot recollect enough to say they are the the men; I think the tallest of the two prisoners is not so lusty as the tall man was. The short man appears to be of the same size.</p>
               <p>Q. Now pursue the story. - A. The watchman came up, and the waggoner gave charge of him; the tall man gave him a shove, the short man ran off; I pursued him; when he got the distance of four or five houses, I laid hold of him by the left side of his collar; the instant I laid hold of him, some man came up and struck me in the back; it appeared to be the same man that stood behind the shutter; that man went away from me; upon that I left hold of the short man. I was stabbed in the back, and was under the care of the surgeon some time.</p>

               <p>MARIA - . - Mr. Andrews. Where do you live. - A. I live at the Windsor Castle, I am servant to Mrs. Atkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near the alamode beef shop. - A. It is almost opposite of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a waggon stopping there on one evening in May last. - A. Yes, about twenty minutes past eleven; I saw the waggon stop, I saw the waggoner and a man talking; the waggoner pointed to him, and said he could swear to that man, that he knocked him down; he said that he had been used very ill; he took up his smock frock and shewed the blood upon it; there were several people told him to charge the watch with him; as soon as the watchman came the man ran away; then young Mr. Watkinson came up, and he said he was hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at these two men at the bar, will you swear to either of them; was the light of the night sufficient to enable you to observe the persons of these men - A. I cannot positively say it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the dress of the men. - A. He had a light coloured drab coat on; I cannot recollect any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn round and see if you see any men that resemble the persons you have described; have you looked at these men at the bar. - A. Yes.</p>

I was called by two men; when I came up I saw the waggoner standing by the waggon, by the alamode shop, High Holborn; he appeared to have some blood about his face; as soon as I came up, they told me to take charge of that man; as I was coming up they said</p>
               <p>'bone him'; there were three men walking behind him, and two before him; one of the men turned round, and whipped his knife into me here, [witness putting his hand to the lower part of his stomach]; with that I turned round and struck one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and see if you see any one that you can speak to. to be that man. - A. As I have said before, I cannot clearly swear to any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to belief; do you see any person that you believe to be the man. - A. No, I told you I cannot swear to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember this affray in Holborn, on the night of the 25th of May. - A. Yes, I was coming past at the time, in Holborn, towards St. Giles'. I saw the waggoner being ill used.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you present at the alamode beef shop. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons might there be assembled there. - A. I should imagine about four at first; I can swear to one of them. I did not see Mr. Watkinson.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them if you saw them. - A. I should know one of them if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that person since the night this affair happened. - A. Yes, I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then speak positively to him. - A. I did; his name is Briant; that is the man (witness pointing to Briant); he ran past me in Holborn, and almost knocked me down; I am sensible that is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Where were you in Holborn, at the time that you supposed he was running by you. - A. This side of the alamode beef shop; about two or three yards to the farthest; there was no one run but him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen that person, whom you supposed to be Briant, before in your life. - A. No, but he came with his face right towards me, that made me observe him; I only saw him as he rushed by me. I afterwards saw him at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you told before you went that you should see the person who assaulted the waggoner. - A. By all means.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, was the persons who are present now, then at the bar. - A By all means; there were four there; I looked round to be sure, and then I recollected Briant; he was the person that run by me.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you live near the alamode beef shop. - A. Nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you standing at the door about the time the waggon was stopped at your house. - A. Before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160027"></xptr>waggon came up I stood in the middle of the street, I saw the waggoner with a tallish man, I saw two or three others about the waggon; there was two of this side of the waggon. As the waggon passed that short man Caddick was at the tail of the waggon; the waggon passed me. I stood still at the alamode beef shop door and Caddick passed me; there was a good light at the alamode beef shop, and the lamp at my own house (I keep a public house), and it was a moon light night; I saw him, I was as close to him as I am to this gentleman; I have no doubt of his being the man. I returned to my own house and stood on the steps; in two or three minutes I saw Mr. Watkinson walk into the alamode beef shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the scuffle. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the waggoner knocked down. A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. At the time that you first saw the man that you now speak of (Caddick) you had not seen any thing improper take place. - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing still or walking along. - A. Walking along.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no other opportunity of seeing him than as he was walking along. - A. No other.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how you came to take such particular notice, you had no particular attention drawn to him. - A. No. There were four men scattered about the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in consequence if they were scattered about the waggon, your attention must have been divided. - A. If you was to come to see the situation that I stood in the street, there is a parting in the houses between the potatoe warehouse and the pawnbroker's; the reflection of the light came down so that I could see him; had the waggon came the other way I could not have seen him; but the moon glared.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was a moon light night. - A. It was a moon light night.</p>
               <p>Q. You may be positive, and you may be mistaken, it has positively been proved by the witnesses that it was a dark night, how long was it after this that you saw the man in custody. - A. About a fortnight or three weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me leave to ask you whether at that time you did not say you could not venture so swear to him. A. I said Briant appeared to be the man. I was asked by the attorney of the prisoners whether I could swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you said that although Caddick bore the appearance of the man, yet you could not venture to swear to the man. - A. It was Briant; I did not say so of Caddick. I always said Caddick was the man that passed me; I did not know whether or no he was the man that did it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Carron-place, Old-street, St. Luke's. The pri<lb></lb>soner came to lodge with me about the 13th of October, and brought a woman as his wife—they had one ready-furnished room—I supplied them with linen and bed-clothes—the prisoner worked about two hundred yards from the house and came home to his meals—on Tuesday, the 20th of November, I missed my great coat—the prisoner went into the country that morning with some horses for his master, and came home on Thursday night, between eight and nine o'clock—we got into their room that night, and missed the greater part of the things, and some were taken from another lodger's room—on Friday morning, when he came home to breakfast, I told him what we had lost, and asked him where the things were—he said his wife had gone out to fetch them, and he expected her back again to breakfast—she did not come—he said he should return at dinner-time, and I said it must pass on till then, but he did not come, nor the woman—I then missed my waistcoat, trowsers, and several things—I had not seen them perhaps for two or three months,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183812170031"></xptr>
               <p>and cannot tell when they were taken—I teat for the prisoner to where he worked, and he came—I told him I had lost some of my clothes, and many other things, more than I knew of the night before—he said he could not account for it—I asked if he had been to see after the woman—he said he had not—I asked whether he had done work for the day—he said no, he had got about half-an-hour's work to do—I told him he had better go and do it, and in the interim I got a policeman—we then went in search, of the woman at her cousin's, where she used to frequent, but did not find her—I asked him whether she was his wife or not, and he said no, but they always passed as man and wife in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner and the woman came to lodge with us in October—I let the lodgings to the woman—the prisoner was not present when she took them—she passed as his wife—she said he had sent for her out of the country—on Tuesday, the 20th of November, the prisoner went into the country with his master's horse—on the Monday night before, I missed a blanket and great coat off my lodger's bed, which is in the next room to the prisoner's—I mentioned it to the prisoner when he came home on Thursday—he said he thought he had slept a night or two very cold, and he had asked his wife to put his great coat on his bed, as the clothes seemed very thin—I went into his room, and missed two blankets, a pair of sheets, a bolster, two pillow-cases, and a pillow—there had been two pairs of sheets in the room when it was let to them, but the woman gave me one pair dirty, while the prisoner was away—she was often out three or four hours in the middle of the day, while he was at work, but she always locked the door, so that I could never get into their room, after they took it—next morning I went up into his room with him—it was in a very bad state, and he said, "Would any one believe there was such a woman, to leave a room in this state?"—I said, "Mr. Robinson, don't you know the woman?"—he said no, he knew nothing of her no more than I did—I said, "You know her cousins, and frequently see them, and they come here, you must know her?"—he made no answer to that, but said he would go after her—he did not tell me whether she was his wife or not—the trowsers, punch-ladle, and other things were taken from our room, which is the story below theirs—I cannot say when they were taken—I had seen them all safe, after they came there—I missed them on Friday and Saturday, when I looked over the things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She missed some rings out of her drawer? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Yes; a few days before I found out the other things—that was before the prisoner went into the country—there were some feathers taken out of the bed in the next room for their pillow, instead of the one taken away.</p>

            , the large hop grower; he said Yes, and that he had street to Mr. Ellis that he was about to take a public-house, and that Mr. Ellis told him he would accommodate him with any sum under 100l.; - that he might draw on him to any amount under 100l.; he then put this bill into my hands - I immediately noticed to him the word "Exceped" across it, instead of accepted; he said that did not matter, the bill was as safe, as the Bank of England, all the same for that, and it did not matter about being altered - he then asked me what money I could let him have immediately on it, as he wanted some immediately to buy some clothes; I told him I was then short of cash, but what I had in the house he should have- he asked me to let him have 2l.; I gave him a sovereign and twenty shillings, and then sent my brother over to the George inn, where the bill was made payable to make the necessary inquiry - my brother had gone before the prisoner went away, but I believe he did not know the bill was out of my hands; I advanced him 10s., more after my brother had left - my brother was gone four hours, or nearly so; the prisoner remained in my house I should think half or three quarters of an hour after my brother was gone - I do not think he knew my brother was gone on this errand, for he went out at the side door; I did not tell him my brother was gone - he came again in the evening, for some more money, I suppose, as I had appointed to let him have more that night or the next morning - on his coming, in consequence of something my brother said I had the prisoner taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What is your brother? A. He has only lately come from sea; he is a seafaring young man - he does not lodge with me; he has been from sea three months or nearly so, and has not employ at present - I am a publican; I have sold horses on commission - I kept livery stables seven years ago; I never dealt in horses with the prisoner; - I advanced the 40s. after the bill was shown to me; I had no previous meeting with him on that day, before the bill was produced - there was nothing to cause any suspicion on my mind about the bill till I saw it, and then the only suspicion was from the word exceped; knowing Mr. Ellis to he a man of opulence I thought he must know how to spell.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not, in the first instance. propose yourself to discount the bill? A. I said I would advance him the money on it - he said he did not want the whole immediately; I was not the first to propose it - he asked if I would advance him a little, and more as he wanted it; I do not think he had seen my brother - he might have seen him in the shop, but he went into the back room; it is very likely he may have seen him on the premises - after he was gone the prisoner asked for 10s. more; I advanced it - he saw my brother in the evening when he was taken; I do not know whether they recognized each other: 50s. is all I advanced on this bill - I have been kind to him in other instance.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Confident of your patient hearing, I will briefly state the cause which has placed me before you in so critical a situation. My life is in your hands; but I am persuaded, that if any favourable circumstances have transpired during my trial I shall have the benefit of them. The evidence on the part of the prosecution you have heard. I most solemnly declare that I was quite ignorant of the bill being a forged instrument. I was about taking a public house at Deptford; I became possessed of the bill in the following manner: - Smith, formerly a customer of mine, (and now I believe he goes to and fro in the country with fruit) was aware, that I was going into business, he requested me to draw up a bill for two months, and he would get it accepted by a friend of his who would honor it when due; so indifferent was I to what he proposed, that I forgot the circumstance altogether, till, unfortunately for me, I must Smith again: he presented a bill to me drawn for two months, and requested me to put my name, saying he would get it accepted and bring it back again. I did so, and it was brought again to me. My Lord and Gentlemen, is it likely? was it the conduct of a man in his senses to have a bill by me which I knew to be a forgery? and knowing of the fatal consequences resulting from committing the crime of forgery, should I have gone to a person, who has known me for so many years? rather, should I not have applied to have it cashed by a person who would not so easily have detected me; would I, after obtaining 2l. on that bill, have returned to the prosecutor, and that after a lapse of upwards of three hours, having given the said bill into his possession, and receiving 10s. more? I left his house, was absent about half an hour, and returned once more to his house, when I was apprehended on a charge of forgery, without the least inquiry being made as to whether the person who was said to have accepted the bill was a responsible person or not. My Lord and Gentlemen, I do not hesitate to say, that it was a vile conspiracy against me for my destruction. I will briefly state the circumstances, and leave the rest to your deliberate consideration. I called at the prosecutor's house and had something to drink; the prosecutor then asked me what he should lend me on that bill, as he could do some good with it. I told him I did not immediately want money; he however persuades me to take 2l., and sends me after the bill - on my road to fetch it, his brother way-lays me, and never leaves me till I am taken into custody. My Lord and Gentlemen, I beseech you most earnestly, that as my reputation amongst society, nay, my life is now at stake, and entirely depending on your verdict, I feel confident that you will give it every consideration that the nature of my case requires; and I aver, that which ever way this investigation may terminate, I am entirely innocent of the crime laid to my charge. I feel assured, after a candid and conscientious inquiry into the evidence, you will return a verdict in favour of the unfortunately person who now addresses you.</p>

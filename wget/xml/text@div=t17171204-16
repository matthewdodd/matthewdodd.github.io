The Prosecutor depos'd, That he and one Mr. Kemp passing along Fleet-street, met the Prisoner and another Woman, who ask'd them to give them a Pint of Wine; and afterwards invited them to their Lodging, telling them their Landlord sold a Glass of good Brandy : That accordingly they went with them to one Mr. Thompson's had each of them a Glass of Brandy, and no more: That the Prisoner telling him the beliv'd he had not Money in his Pocket to pay his Reckoning, he took about 15 or 16 Shillings out of his Pocket; that then she told him there was no God : To convince her, he singled our 2 Guineas, laying them in the Palm of his Hand, and that she snatch'd them out, putting one into her Mouth, and dropping the other into her Bosom . Upon which he demanded his Money: Which she not returning, he knoked for the Landlord; who was so far from taking his Part, that he vindicted the Prisoner, calling him Rogue, and stalking him, demanded his Reckoning, which was 5 s. for 4 Drams of Cherry-Brandy, which he and his Companion Mr. Kemp paid; and going down, call'd the Watch, and secur'd the Prisoner. The Prisoner acknowledg'd her being pick'd up by the Prosecutor, and drinking together, but deny'd the taking the Money ; saying that she was not near the Prosecutor, she being Mr. Kemp's Confort, and the other Woman the Prosecutors: Adding, that Mr. Kemp being asleep by the Fire, the Prosecutor would needs have sent her for a Penniworth of Rods to have flogg'd him with; which because she would not do, he charg'd her with robbing him. Mr. Kemp said he was asleep, and so could say little as to the Prisoner's taking the Guineas: Whereupon the Jury <rs id="t17171204-16-verdict88" type="verdictDescription">

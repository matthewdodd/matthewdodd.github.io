                  </hi>. I am a constable of the parish of St. Clement Panes. In consequence of information, I went, on the morning of the 9th of March, to Mr. Woodward's house, about half-past seven o'clock—I found the parlour window had been broken, just over where the latch of the win<lb></lb>dow is, so that any body could get in—I examined the various parts of the rooms, and then the yard, to find where an entry had been made—at the further end of the adjoining house to Mr. Woodward's, I found this hat—suspecting that I had a knowledge of the hat, I went in seareh of the pri<lb></lb>soner—I apprehended him in Clare-market, and asked him where his old hat was—he told me he had cut it up a fortnight ago—I then asked him where he was last night, and told him he must consider himself as my pri<lb></lb>soner—I did not say it would be better to tell the truth or worse for him—he said he was in bed at eleven o'clock—I took him to Mr. Woodward's house, and, when there, asked him where he lived—he told me at Mr. Cooper's, Clement's-lane—I asked him for the key of his room, which he gave me—on going to his room, I found two glass tumblers, three cruets, three pairs of spectacles, (one pair are silver, one pair tortoiseshell, and one pair cast steel,) part of a linen shirt, a silver thimble and thimble case—I re<lb></lb>turned to Mr. Woodward's, and asked the prisoner particularly what room it was he occupied—he said, the second floor back room, which was where I found the articles—I then observed him working his mouth about—I told him to give me what he had in his mouth—he said he had nothing, hut on putting my hand to his throat and pressing his mouth, I got from his mouth one sovereign, two sixpences, half-a-crown, and seven shillings—I then took him to Bow-street—I also took three others into custody on suspicion, who were discharged—I apprehended him about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning—he had another hat on when I took him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Reeve, Council for the Prosecution.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, Mr. Redgrave and I had information, that a cart was going the other side of the way in the Old Bailey to receive some copper; we came about two in the afternoon, and saw the cart set out from under the gateway and go across Smithfield; we then took a coach.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was with the cart? - Rothwell, the person who was tried.</p>
               <p>Nobody else? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he riding in the cart? - Yes, it was a little open cart; we took coach on the stand in Smithfield, and followed the cart to Muswell-hill; the cart stopped and went in at a pair of gates, which where opened on the ringing of a bell; we ordered the coachman then to go on that we might not be observed, and we came back to Islington, and there we waited to see if the cart came back the same way that evening; it returned a little after six, with Rothwell and the prisoner in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you seen the prisoner before that day? - No, I never saw him before, to my knowledge. Redgrave and me stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250168"></xptr> the cart, and they both came out; we took them into the parlour at the Woolpack, a public house in Islington-road; Redgrave went out to take care of the cart; the prisoner finding I was left alone, attempted to get out of one door and Rothwell at the other, I held Rothwell fast, and the prisoner got out at the back door which goes into Gwynne's Buildings; we found in the cart a deal of cut copper, called cecil, and 20 l. in halfpence; the halfpence were carried to the Tower long since, some of them are here, which I have had ever since.</p>
               <p>(Four halfpence produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. Did you yourself take those four halfpence out of that cart? - Yes, I am confident they were in the cart.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you first get those halfpence? - Out of a butter basket that was in the cart, I took them out myself: Redgrave and me, and some others, went back to Muswell hill the same night, to this house, and there we found a cutting-out press, a stamping press, and several dies, and some blanks, and some halfpence, fresh made but not coloured; the press was standing as if for work, the dies in the press, and a halfpenny between the dies, we brought them away, and they were produced here; they are at the Tower now.</p>
               <p>Court. This charge must be maintained against the prisoner at the bar, and you must have the evidence here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Council for the Prosecution. My Lord, I should think it was sufficient for us, in the first instance, to produce the conviction of the principal, and it is incumbent on the prisoner to impeach it; the Jury must suppose that conviction is right; the record is sufficient for me, if the prisoner can prove that these halfpence were good halfpence, then he is not active in the committing the felony; the law requires that these things should be carried to the Tower, and immediately destroyed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Council for the Prisoner. My Lord, I submit if the record related to any thing relative to this man, he must contradict that in the best manner he can; but you must prove that there was a felony committed; the record proves it against the man himself that was a party, but not against this man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Till it is impeached the record is right.</p>
               <p>Court. I ground myself upon this; Mr. Justice Forster is of opinion, and very rightly, That if a man is indicted as accessary to a felony, the imputation of the felony to the principal is not sufficient to affect him, he has a right to controvert that felony; it may be an exceeding nice question to discuss this thoroughly, but here is sufficient evidence of the fact, independent of these dies, and these machines that this man found; if the prisoner is found coming from a house, with a cart, in which was contained a great quantity of counterfeit halfpence, that is a degree of evidence, in my apprehension, to lay before the Jury, accompanied with the conviction of Rothwell, whom he is indicted as counselling, aiding, and abetting; I should think that will be a degree of evidence for the Jury's consideration, without the production of the machines, and without deciding the other point; therefore I shall take no notice to the Jury of this evidence of finding the dies and these things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Where did you see the prisoner first? - Just by the Angel and the Bluecoat-boy, at Islington.</p>
               <p>Coming to town, or going from town? - Coming to town.</p>
               <p>In a cart with Rothwell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know where he was taken up then? - I do not.</p>
               <p>This was an open cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The halfpence, that you say were in it, were they in baskets or in bags? - They were in different things, they were not all in one thing.</p>
               <p>Where did they come to? - To the Woolpack, some yards lower.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know Rothwell? - I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250169"></xptr>Then all that you can say is, that he was in the cart with Rothwell, and that you found these bad halfpence there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have never heard any thing of him since? - No.</p>

               <p>I was the other officer attending with Dinmore; I watched the cart to Muswell-hill, I saw it go in, then we went up to Highgate, and returned to Islington, and waited till the cart returned; I saw the prisoner with the other person in the cart together, we were at the One Ton, I was up stairs, they drove very fast, and I was obliged to run, and I overtook them at the Woolpack, then I told them to stop; Dinmore then came up to me, and they asked me what I wanted; I told them I had information they had some smuggled tea in the chaise; there was a hamper that one of them set his feet on, and there was some cecil in it.</p>
               <p>Court to the Monier of the Mint. Is that destroyed or not? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Redgrave. There was a seat in the chaise, and in it were two baskets of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any halfpence which were found in the cart with you here? - Yes, here is one.</p>
               <p>Were the rest of them like that? - All alike.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself see that halfpenny taken out of the parcel that were in the cart? - Yes, my Lord, we broke open one paper, and took them out for a sample, we opened them all, and they were all of that kind, they were in twenty shilling papers.</p>
               <p>How many were there? - I cannot recollect, we reckoned 20 l. in all; I run to the cart, and in the mean while the prisoner made his escape from Dinmore.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing when the prisoner was taken again? - Mr. Clarke received a letter from Scotland, that he had made his escape there, I was not at the taking of him.</p>
               <p>How long has he been in custody? - Above a month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What did you find at the house? - Every thing compleat, and some new halfpence that were not coloured; it is always usual to colour them after they are made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. What became of these dies and implements? - They were carried to the Tower.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I certainly may give evidence to what is found in a man's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. That is only introductory evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. If you give them in evidence, the Jury ought to see these instruments, unless they are gone, and that is not the case at all, because the gentleman who sits here tells me they are in a confused heap now existing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. The presses are never produced here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Always.</p>
               <p>Court. The law requires that there should be sufficient evidence, the Court and Jury are to judge whether the evidence is sufficient, you are to distinguish according to the crime, if it was for having a die or a stamping press in his custody, then you must produce them, because that is a specific charge, but they are to be produced here as so many circumstances of coining; but if you give evidence of these things, you must produce them; I do not think it is necessary to go that length.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My Lord, I should apprehend that they must produce that evidence that is sufficient to convict the prisoner, and it is fully in their power, and they have not accounted for it.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether they have produced evidence enough?</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My objection is that it was in their power to have produced evidence to shew that Rothwell was guilty of felony, and that the mere record is not sufficient.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You mistake the law, that record is sufficient at present to prove the conviction of the principal; you may impeach it if you can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. It is the conviction of another man, that this man is a stranger to.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury.

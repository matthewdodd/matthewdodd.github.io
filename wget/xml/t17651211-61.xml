            . Last Tuesday was a week, I was walking up <placeName id="t17651211-61-crimeloc365">Cheapside</placeName>

I led him to the Compter myself, and there had him searched; we found 2 handkerchiefs upon him, one was a large silk India handkerchief, and the other less, but my own was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be sure from the fact, that your handkerchief was drawn out that instant?</p>
               <p>Barnard. No, I cannot, I saw his hand busy afterwards shuffling something into his pocket, but did not see my handkerchief. I had made use of it but half a minute before.</p>

I being next the gentleman, he turned round, and said I had got his handkerchief. I desired him to search me; they took 2 handkerchiefs out of my pocket, one I was going to return to my sister, the other I had for my own use. I work for Mr. Kemp at Clerkenwell.</p>

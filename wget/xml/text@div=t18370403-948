I work for Mr. Charles Rowed; this plank of wood is his—about seven o'clock on the evening of the 15th of March I missed it from the yard, and about five minutes after, I detected the prisoner carrying it on his shoulder, in the Hampstead-road—I said, "Stop thief, that is not your timber"—he immediately ran away and dropped it—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Frederick-place, Hampstead-road. On this evening about seven o'clock, I saw three men standing near Mr. Rowed's garden railing, whispering to one another—I turned into the road to see what they were after—I thought they might be watching my shop—in a few minutes, I saw two of them in Mr. Rowed's yard—they came out with this piece of mahogany on their shoulders—they walked about a dozen yards, and then pitched it down—I went to the yard, and told them of it—Moore came and missed the timber—he came with me, and about four or five doors from where he had pitched the timber, we saw the prisoner and another carrying it on their shoulders—Moore was four or five yards off—he said, "Stop thief, you have stole the timber"—they threw it down, and the prisoner ran into Charles-street—I followed, he turned round, I took hold of him—"What is this about, "says he, "what is the matter?"—I brought him back to the place, and Mr. Rowed's young man gave him in charge.</p>

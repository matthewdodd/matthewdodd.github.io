            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 13th of August the prosecutrix came to me, between one and two o'clock - she told me she had been stopped by three girls in Parliament-street, as I understood; I asked where the girls were - she pointed to Martin, and said, "There is one of them going down to the Horse Guards, that is the one who struck me and robbed me;" I took her - Martin said several times she knew nothing about it; when we got to the corner of King-street, Storer and another girl were coming up as if from Downing-street, towards us - they said, "My dear, what is the matter?" the prosecutrix pointed to them and said, "That is the girl who has got my property, take her in charge" - I said to the other girl, "You must go with me to the watch-house;" she said she would, and she went as far as Garden-lane, and then ran away down there - it was rather a dark night, and she got away; Storer was in front of me, and struck the prosecutrix several times - I told her I would knock her down if she did not be quiet, and at that time the other got away; we went on to the watch-house, and gave charge of Martin - when I came out I saw Storer near the door; I thought she might be the person who had received the property, and desired her to go in that the prosecutrix might see her - she went in; the prosecutrix said she did not think she was the girl who had her property, but she knew she struck her when Martin robbed her; she seemed to have no doubt of that, and gave charge of her.</p>

            . I was night-constable at the watch-house when Martin was brought in; Storer was brought in then, and the prosecutrix gave charge of her as being the person who struck her while Martin robbed her - Storer then took hold of her bonnet, and tore it all to pieces - the crown of it had been broken in before; this is a part of the ribbon which was round the prosecutrix's neck when she came to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>STORER'S Defence. At half-past twelve o'clock at night I was drinking in the Heathcock public-house, and took home a girl who was tipsy; as I came back I saw this prisoner in charge of a watchman - I said, "Sally, what is the matter;" she said, "I am given in charge" - I followed them, and saw a girl behind with a bit of ribbon in her hand, which she said was part of the sandal of her shoe - I staid outside the watch-house, and the watchman came up and asked me to go in; I went in, and was given in charge; this girl walks Charing-cross, and I walk the Strand - we are both unfortunate girls.</p>

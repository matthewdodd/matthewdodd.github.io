                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Harding, who keeps the Three Compasses public-house, in Glasshouse-street, Whitechapel. On the 13th of January the prisoner hired a furnished room in Compasses court, which runs up by the side of our house. On the following Wed<lb></lb>nesday I employed her to clean part of our house—I had a watch hanging in the bar parlour—I missed it that evening, when the prisoner had not beta gone five minutes—my husband was serving in the bar at the time she went—I directly went to her room with the police-sergeant, but saw no more of her till she was apprehended—the watch was worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not lend it to her—she was apprehended about a fortnight after—my husband happened to meet her accidentally in the highway.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was I employed in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when you came in the morning you said you were very cold, and I lent you an old shawl—you were cleaning the bar out—I did not lend you the watch to pledge—you did not ask me to lend you money on a monthly note, and I did not say I would if my husband would do so—nothing of the sort passed—a monthly note was shown to my husband, to be left with us as a sort of security, but I never lent you the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not I leave money at your bar on Monday night, and in the morning spend every farthing I had with you in drink, which was the change of a sovereign I got from a captain? and did not you tell me in the morning, "I have got money belonging to you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in advance for a week's rent, that is all the money I received from you, except what you might have spent at the bar, that I know nothing about—you took the room on the 13th, and on the 17th took the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I left money with her to get a gown out of pawn—she was very much in liquor at the time—she told the Magistrate I was a stranger to her—he said it was singular I should be allowed to be in the bar-par<lb></lb>lour—then she said I was a friend. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not consider her any thing but a stranger, not having seen her till she took the room.</p>

               <p>my name—I had taken a room of Mrs. Harding on the Saturday previous, and paid her the rent on Saturday—on Monday night I was cleaning the up-room, having been employed in the bar, and then went out went out with her—she gave me money to buy grocery at a shop—we then went into a public-house, and had three quarterns of rum—I had received a letter from my husband to go to a young man's mother, and not being respectable, as they had always seen me, I asked Mrs. Harding to lend me money on a monthly note—she said she would, if Mr. Harding agreed to it—he refused, and while we were out drinking she said she would lend me the watch to pawn, provided I would get it out of pawn by the first of February—I went out the next morning, and pawned the watch for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had broken my arm that night—about a fortnight after I met the prosecutor walking with a gentleman, and spoke to him—he said I was the person he wanted, where was his watch—I said it was pawned, and told him where it was pawned—he said, who give me authority to pawn it?—I said, "Mrs. Harding "—he said, why not send him the ticket?—I said there was no occasion, as I had promised to get it out by the 1st of February—I asked him to take my monthly note is security, and he might send a young man with me to the Admiralty to get the money—he said he would not—I said, "Then I mast go home," and he gave me in charge.</p>

In going down the highway, about a fortnight after the robbery, I met the prisoner, and told her I wanted her about the watch—she said, "Mrs. Harding lent it to me "—I said, "Then why should you leave the house?"—she said, "I understood the police were after me "—I said, "If it was lent to you, why do you fear the police?"—I know nothing of her breaking her arm.</p>

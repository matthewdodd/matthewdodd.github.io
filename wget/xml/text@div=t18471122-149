                  </hi> I am a linen-draper, at Little Pulteney-street, West<lb></lb>minster—the prisoner applied to me for the situation of shopman, and re<lb></lb>ferred</p>

               <p>me to a person named Drew, of Back-street, Bristol, who he said he had been with two years—the reference was written for by my agent—I received an answer from Drew by post; but in three or four days my letter was returned, as Mr. Drew was not to be found—I do not know where the letter came from, as the envelope was destroyed, and I had no other means of ascertaining—the prisoner gave me another reference which I did not apply for, but took him into my service in consequence of the letter I had received—he came on Friday, Oct. 22nd, about the middle of the day—he stopped all day, and slept there—he went out next morning and did not come back—I never saw him again till he was in custody—after he was gone, I missed about fifty silk handkerchiefs, worth from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from a drawer in the shop, which was not locked—I have not found them since—I was not aware at the time I took him that the letter had not found Bristol.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Leather-lane. On 22nd Oct. I was in Mr. Sander's employ—the prisoner came about twelve o'clock—I was there the rest of the day—I slept in the same room with him—next morning, when we were dress<lb></lb>ing the shop, he asked me where the bandannas were kept—I showed him—he could not want to know that to put some out, as we had quite finished dressing the shop—I left him near the drawer; in about five minutes he came to me and asked me the way to the Post-office—he did not go then, but re<lb></lb>turned to the part of the shop where the bandannas were—in about five minutes he came and told me he was going to the post, went out, and did not return—about half-an-hour afterwards Mr. Sander opened the drawer, and asked me where the bandannas were—I went to the drawer; a quantity were miss<lb></lb>ing—I afterwards saw the prisoner in Cheapside, and asked him how he was getting on; he pretended not to know me, and asked where he had seen me—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not that three weeks afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was on 15th Nov.—I told him my name and where I lived—he did not say anything to that—I am out of employ now—I have left Mr. Sander since—I stated before the Grand Jury, that after speaking to me the prisoner went round to the drawer where the bandannas were—I am not certain that I said it before the Magistrate—there was not a bandanna on the counter that had to be put away—there had been no customers served that morning at the counter where the bandannas were kept—there is a counter on each side of the shop—there was another shopman and a boy besides me—we did occasionally serve bandannas on both counters.</p>

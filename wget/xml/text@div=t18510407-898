                  </hi>. I am shopman to William Stephen and James Burnett Dew, of 146, Cheapside. On 8th March, about half-past four o'clock, I came home, and found the prisoner in our shop—he asked for a <hi rend="italic">mode</hi> silk cravat; I showed him one, which he said was not quite the thing—I got another out of the window; he looked at it; I told him the price was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I told him I could not let it go for that, but I had some ties at that price—I went to the bottom of the shop for them, and as I returned I saw the prisoner tucking one of the cravats</p>

               <p>into his pocket—I mentioned it to Mr. Dew, and the prisoner went oat of the shop—I went after him, and called, "Stop thief!"—I saw him stopped, and Baker came up and took him—I went to the station, and saw this cravat taken out of his pocket, and a pair of gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced;</hi>) they are ours—we only had two pairs of these gloves, and they were on the counter, near where the prisoner was—this other cravat is the one I saw banging out of his pocket, and these others were also found, making four altogether, with our private mark on them.</p>

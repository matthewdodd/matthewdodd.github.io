             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Boot: On Friday the 29th of January, in the morning, I went to call one of my fellow-servants, and as I was coming back, I saw the prisoner coming from our house with the meat upon his shoulder; I stopped him, and asked him where he was going with it; he said, he was going to take it to Mr. Squires's, that is a carcass-butcher at the top of the street; I took it from him, told him it was my master's property, and I would swear to it; I kept him till my fellow-servant came up, and then we took him to the watch-house; the meat consisted of the two hind quarters of a sheep, the two fore quarters had been sold to the Jews; I knew it by a score that we make when we dress it; I went home immediately and missed it.</p>

            Suppose you had seen it at York, would you have sworn to it? - A. No; but I saw the prisoner come from our shop with it.</p>
               <p>Boot. We mark all the quarters differently; I kill a great many sheep for graziers, and we are obliged to mark them differently that we may know them one from another.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen it at York, could you have sworn to it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When they are cut for the Jews, they only mark the sides, and, I believe, there are people in Court, that can testify they never saw a pair of hind quarters marked.</p>

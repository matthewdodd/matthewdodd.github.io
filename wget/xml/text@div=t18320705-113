This man (Harry Child) requested me to write a note to Mr. Throp - it is not directed to any particular place; it was left for him at the White Hart, in Farringdon-street, for a Mr. Throp: I never knew where he lived - I saw him in consequence of this note.</p>
               <p>Q. As whom did you see this man? A. As the man; I did not ask if his name was Throp - I did not know what his name was.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Is this the note you wrote? Yes -(read).</p>
               <p>"Mr. Rose wishes Mr. Throp to meet him at Mr. Lay's, at a quarter before twelve o'clock this morning, on the Commons and bail business, and wait there till you see him; without fail"</p>
               <p>"To Mr. John Throp - May 30, 1832."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now did you not believe his name to be Throp when you wrote to him in that name, and he appeared in that name? A. I never met with the man in my life; he did not come to me - I think the note says, "Farringdon-street;" I went to Lay's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inquire for Mr. Throp? A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he appeared, did you not believe his name to be Throp, and not Harry Child? A. I did not know that this was the man; he never came in consequence of that letter.</p>
               <p>Q. What business on Commons and bail business had you but this? A. I forget; Mr. Lay keeps the White Hart public-house, where I sent the letter - I went there at a quarter before twelve o'clock, and inquired for a person of the name of Throp, but I did not see any person.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to write a letter to a man you knew nothing off, and had not seen, to meet you respecting the Commons and bail business? A. There was a gentleman wished me to call at Mr. Lays respecting bail; his name is Saunders - I do not know where he has moved to; I think he then lived in Symond's Inn; I also lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what occasion had you to go to Farringdon-street to meet him; you had no business in Farringdon-street, but for Mr. Saunder's? A. I will not be positive -Saunders is an attorney or an attorney's clerk: I have seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how Mr. Throp failed to come about the business in Commons and bail? A. I did not- I told Saunders I did not see him, not this man Throp; I went to meet Throp at Saunders' request.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me that this man (Child) desired you to send? A. I will not be certain whether I sent more than one note for a person of the name of Throp - I think this must be the note I sent to Lay's; I am not certain whether this is it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write two notes to Lay for a person of the name of Throp? A. I cannot challenge my memory; Saunders has asked me if I knew any person that would bail a friend of his; he did not tell me his name, and I never inquired of him afterwards - I was not to meet Saunders at Lay's - the note was sent on Child's account more than Saunders'; Child did not want me to find bail for any friend of his - I cannot swear whether I saw Throp the next day; it might have been the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me that you did not know the name of Throp till after the 6th of June - when did you see him next after the 30th of May? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not believe his name to be Throp when he went to make the deposition? A. I will not be certain, my Lord; you might direct a letter to a person in that name, without his being of that name; he might have gone in that name - I did not expect that to be his name; I thought he might have gone in other names.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, in what name did you think he might go, had he not, on the 6th of June, come to you in consequence of the letter you addressed to Throp? A. He came to me on account of my writing in that name -I could not tell what his name might be; I thought that Harry Child had that name directed on it there, for another person to call for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you wrote this name by direction of Child? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe the man's name to be Throp that you wrote the letter to? A. Yes, but I thought another man might call for it.</p>
               <p>Q. I rather think he was to be a witness for you in the Ecclesiastical Court? A. Not without Child's consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent that he should go and swear his name was Child? A. I had no alternative.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD to MR. ROBERTS. Q. It appears, by the proceeding, that this deposition is dated on the 6th of June? A. Yes, but he was sworn on the 4th of June before the surrogate, and again on the 6th, and he stated his name to be Harry Child.</p>

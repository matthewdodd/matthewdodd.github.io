                  </hi>. I am overseer of the sorters in the newspaper branch of the General Post-Office—on 18th of last month I was on duty at the Midland sorting division—the prisoner was on duty there as a collector; his duty was to collect newspapers and book packets from the general sort<lb></lb>ing, and convey them to the dispatch by the Midland mails—about 7 p.m. I observed the prisoner go to the mis-sort letter boxes, which he had no right to do, take a packet 'from a shelf, and convey it to the Midland division, which he had to collect for—he placed it on the Midland table, and I saw him looking at it; he left it there—I examined it, and placed it in the mis-sort box attached to that division—it was his duty then to clear his mis-sorted newspapers and book packets to the blind division—he brought the same packet back again with another collection from the general sorting—I saw him examining the packet there—he then subsequently, on his way to the urinal, which was just in the rear of the Midland division, placed the packet in his left breast coat pocket—I waited for some few minutes, knowing that his collection was getting in arrear—I followed him into the urinal; he was in the further partition—I placed myself in the next compartment to him—I there, heard the rustling of paper—I looked over the side of the partition, and distinctly saw him breaking the packet open—I took him by the arm, turned him round sharply, and told him to return to the office and get on with his duty—he then dropped the packet at my feet, put his hands together, and exclaimed "For God's sake, sir, don't take any notice of it"—I then asked him what it was he had dropped at his feet—he said "A packet"—I told him to pick it up, and as I was in duty bound, I took him to the superintendent's room to explain what he was going to do with the packet—he picked it up and took it with him—I sent for the superintendent, and upon his asking him what he was going to do</p>

               <p>with the packet he admitted that he had stolen it—the superintendent asked him whether he had stolen it, and he said he had—the address that had been on the packet was afterwards found in the urinal and brought in by a boy—it was addressed to Mrs. Thompson, of Dumfries, and it has the post-mark of St. Leonard's-on-Sea—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; it corresponds with the other portion of the wrapper of the packet—this is the same packet I had seen before on the table in the Midland division—it contains a magenta silk stocking and a letter—there appears to have been another address written on the inner cover, and it had been sent through the Post-Office again with another wrapper over it—the post-mark is the 18th; if it had been posted on the 18th it would have been in the office that day in time to be despatched by the night mail—the prisoner was given into custody—he asked for forgiveness—he said to the constable who took him in charge "For God's sake forgive me."</p>

I am a constable attached to the Post-Office—I was called in on 18th by the superintendent—I there saw the prisoner and the packet—as soon as I got in I told him he would be charged with stealing the packet—he went on his knees directly, and said "Do forgive me, do forgive me" several times.</p>

I am guilty of a careless fault, and that is all I did not intend to steal it or take it out of the Post-Office.</p>

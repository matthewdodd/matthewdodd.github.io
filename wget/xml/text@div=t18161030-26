            . I sold the prisoner a black mare for 30s. He said he had not money enough to pay for it, and asked me if I would go home with him? and I did. He took some things to pledge to pay the money. He paid me a one pound note, three three shilling pieces, and a shilling. He then asked me if I would go home to supper with him. As I was going past Mr. Rose's brick field, I found him trying to pick my pocket of my pocketbook. I tried to get it back from him, and he knocked me down against the bank, and then he took what silver I had in my pocket besides, two three shilling pieces, and a piece of paper and some halfpence, which Mr. Hatfield has got now.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner. I found this piece of paper on him, which the prosecutor told me was in his pocket with the silver at the time he was knocked down. I found nothing else on him. The prosecutor only told me of the money he had lost before, and did not tell me of the paper until he saw it.</p>

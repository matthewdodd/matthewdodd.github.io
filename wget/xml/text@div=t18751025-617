I live at 47, King-Street, Walworth, and am a coster-monge—on a Saturday in September I had had a little to drink, and was going home by a public-house called the Black Prince, in the Walworth Road, when I saw some one hitting a young woman, and I interfered—I could not say who it was; I had had too much to drink—I hit the man, and he said "Come round the corner"—I did not fight at all with the man—I was going to <hi rend="italic">spar</hi> up to him when I was stabbed with a knife here (<hi rend="italic">over the left eye</hi>)—he ran down the New Kent Road, and I followed him as soon as I could—I was close behind him—no one else was running besides—I don't recollect anything else until I found myself at the hospital.</p>

I went, and saw a shadow of a man, and they remained folding and unfolding till one o'clock, and then the light disappeared, and went up three pair of stairs, and stood steady for three quarters of an hour; I saw a young man come, and draw the curtain back, but cannot tell who it was; the candle disappeared, and presently it was down in the cellar; it presently went up stairs again, and there it was till the clock struck two, and then went out. The same morning between eight and nine o'clock we waited upon Mr. Deputy Brown, and the next morning we were sent for again, but I did not find the property.</p>

I went up stairs with the prisoner and the Deputy, and searched his box; he unlocked it himself; and in the box I found this property I have here. (Produced.)

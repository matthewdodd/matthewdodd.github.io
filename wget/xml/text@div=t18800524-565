                  </hi>. I am a widow—I live at Redhill—I get my living by selling oranges and nuts about Reigate and other places—between 6 and 7 on the evening of 29th April I went to the White Hart tap for a rest, and called for half a pint of beer—I knew a man called Bunkum for some years—I saw him there sitting on a form and laying his head on the table fast asleep—the prisoner was there; he had just cleaned two of the tables down, and he wanted to clean the other table down where the poor deceased was lying, likewise the stool, and he said, "Out you come, Bunkum, if you don't I shall pull you out," and he caught hold of his coat sleeve and palled him down with great violence, which I might call with vengeance—he did nothing more to him—he said, "Out you go; I am going to drag you out and put you outside in the yard, or else in the stable"—he tried to drag him out—the landlady came in and said, "Wash his face and set him up, and let him have his sleep out"—when the prisoner pulled him down the deceased said, "Tom, you have owed me this spite a long time, and now you have done it for me"—there were several people there then—I saw blood on the ground after he had been thrown down; it came out of the lacing of his boots.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a B.M. and a M.R.C.S.—I am also the medical official at the Reigate and Redhill Cottage Hospital—on the evening of 29th April, a little before 7 o'clock, I was called to the tap-room of the White Hart to see the deceased—I found that he was very much in<lb></lb>toxicated, and unable to give an intelligent account of himself or how the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188005240090"></xptr>
               <p>accident happened—he was suffering from a very severe compound fracture of the left leg, just above the ankle—the bone was protruding through the skin, and the large bone of the leg was splintered into several pieces—it was not broken directly across, but splintered-clothing was covered with dirt, and his face and hands were smutty—there was a considerable amount of bleeding—he had been seen before my assistant, who had endeavoured to stop the bleeding—there was a pool of blood on the floor—I dressed the wound, and he was subsequently remove to the Union infirmary, where he was under the care of Mr. Kelsey, the sur<lb></lb>geon to the infirmary—I saw him the following Sunday with Mr. Kelsey and several other surgeons—he was then in a very exhausted condition; leg, in fact, had become gangrenous or mortified, and this mortification was extending upwards towards the body, so that it became absolutely necessary to cut the leg off; that was the only chance of saving his life—I assisted Mr. Kelsey in that operation—he was then under Mr. Kelsey's care—he rallied fairly well from the immediate effects of the operation, and was removed to his bed—I did not again see him alive—he was almost unconscious when I saw him on the Sunday—a severe shock, such as the fracture of a leg, would be likely to bring on delirium tremens in a subject who had a tendency to it—the death was undoubtedly caused by exhaustion consequent upon the injuries he had received, and the delirium tremens from which he had suffered—I am of opinion that con. siderable violence must have been used to cause a fracture of that kind—I do not think that falling on the leg or being thrown on it would cause a fracture of that character—the only plausible explanation I can give of the occurrence of the fracture is that his leg must have caught under the table or in the trestle of the table as he was sitting on the form, and if he was thrown backwards with some violence the leverage of his body would cause a fracture of that description—I assisted in making a post-mortem examination by order of the Coroner—the liver was in an advanced state of fatty degeneration, and all the tissues of the body were more or less infiltrated with fat—there was no other disease—there was no disease sufficient to cause death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He died from exhaustion brought on by the injuries he received—the degeneration undoubtedly followed upon the injury—that form of degeneration would only occur in a man of intemperate habits—the post-mortem confirmed my opinion that he was a man of intemperate habits—the fracture was of such a character that con<lb></lb>siderable violence must have been used—I think a simple fall would hardly account for it—if he was pushed with some violence I think that would account for it.</p>

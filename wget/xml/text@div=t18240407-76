Mr. Ryan, a perfumer, has the other shop. I have a back door, leading into Goodwin's-court, St. Martin's-lane, which I open on Sundays, and he goes in at his shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you go from your shop to your neighbour's without going into the street - A. Yes, my Lord. There is a partition between the two shops, but there is a door to each shop leading into the passage and stair-case of the house - these doors are both locked at night; the dwelling-house is common to us both; we have one landlord; I pay 100 l. a-year rent, and he pays 80 l. we have separate rooms, and separate kitchens. On the 23d of March, at seven o'clock in the morning, the servant came up; I went down stairs, and found the parlour in a state of great confusion - the parlour is within my shop, and looks into Goodwin's-court. I was the last person up the night before, and saw every thing secure; the window looking into Goodwin's-court was secure. I found the box of the lock on the door leading from the shop to the parlour was taken off; it appeared that they had got in at the stair-case window. The back parlour has been built since the house; they had got on the roof of that, and opened the landing-place window, which was shut at night, and is generally fastened by a padlock; they could then walk down stairs. There is a small kitchen behind the parlour; they had gone through there, taken off the box of the lock, and got into the shop. I was not disturbed in the night. I missed between ten and twenty pounds of snuff, about thirty pounds of tobacco, and about thirty snuff-boxes, which were worth 3 l.; they cost more - also five hundred segars, and five amber segar-tubes. The prisoner is my landlord - I had been his tenant about six or seven weeks; he lodged with his father and mother, in Brook-street, Holborn. I knew him by the name of M'Craw - I was never at his father's before house the robbery. I get Avis and Smith, who went there with a search-warrant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you pay the taxes - A. I pay the taxes of the whole premises. Ryan is not my lessee, but a lessee of the landlord's, as well as myself.</p>
               <p>EMLY CHOICE. I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner is our landlord - I knew him by the name of M'Craw. On Monday, the day before the robbery, he came to the house; I was in the shop; the stair-case window was padlocked; he asked for the key of the padlock, to go out there, pointing to the window; I did not hesitate in giving it to him, being the landlord. I do not know whether he went out, but he went up stairs, came down again, threw the key into the scales, and went away; it was the same key. When I went to bed I looked at the padlock - it appeared to be fast. Next morning, when the robbery was discovered, the padlock appeared to have been opened with a key - it was not wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did he not come on that day for Mr. Ryan's rent - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to a lodger for rent - A. He went up stairs, and staid about three minutes - I do not know where he went; we have a lodger named Gale.</p>
               <p>MR. CHOICE re-examined. There was no agreement who was to do the repairs. Ryan came to the house since me. There was rent due to the prisoner by Gale, a lodger; he pays rent to me now, but owed the prisoner a balance for rent due before I came, as I understand.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Sunday, the 24th, I had a search-warrant, and went to No. 36, Brook-street, Holborn - the house of the prisoner's father; the prisoner opened the street door for me; I asked if Mr. M'Craw was within - he said Yes; I walked up stairs after him with Smith and the prosecutor, to the two pair front room, where his father was living; he took us up there. I produced my warrant, and said the gentleman present had been robbed, and in the table-drawer in that room I found two bundles of Spanish segars, and two amber segar-tubes, and in a cupboard in the room I found about a quarter of a pound of tobacco. I asked him where he got them; he said he bought the Spanish segars at Mr. Gordon's, a tobacconist, in Holborn, and bought the tobacco of a smuggler.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Choice. I was the first person up on this morning, and found the stair-case window open; it was shut when I went to bed. I found the back door leading into Goodwin's-court open, and the padlock laying on the window cill.</p>
               <p>MR. CHOICE. I know this tobacco by having prepared it myself a few days before; I did not prepare it from the leaf, but it is a mixture which I made for an experiment; I am as sure of it as if my name was on it. The value of the property lost is 12 l. as I have given it, but that is not a third of the real value. I can speak to one of the amber tubes particularly, it being a milky amber - I remember offering it to a gentleman a few days before. I am not so certain of the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070033"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You lost a large quantity of tobacco - A. Not of this description, not above half a pound - it is mixed with a particular bark, and different things; it is a secret of trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not Cascarilla bark bought at a low price - A. Yes; that mixed with tobacco gives it a perfume; it must be smoked to ascertain the perfume.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak from the quantity lost - A. No, the quality; it is a preparation of my own. Amber tubes vary much in appearance, make, and shape; a milky appearance is common in them, but two are seldom a-like; I only lost five. They are sold by most tobacconists - I do not swear to the tubes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was desired by my father-in-law to go and receive 5 l. 10 s. from a lodger at this house. I went, and saw the lodger's wife - and it was agreed that I should come in the evening and see the husband - and as I came down stairs, I saw a quantity of dirt on the tiles. I went down to Mrs. Choice, and said,</p>
               <p>"Have the goodness to lend me the key - there is a quantity of dirt on the tiles, and I will sweep it away." I went up and swept the tiles, as they complained of the rain coming in. Three people in the court saw me sweeping the tiles. I went down threw the key into the scales, and said I had been sweeping them - but she had a customer, and I did not disturb her. I believe the servant saw me throw the broom down stairs. I was at home in bed at the time of the robbery. As to the tobacco, I have smoked it myself, and have witnesses who have seen me smoke it. I buy a quarter of a pound at Gordon's, and put an ounce of Cascarilla back into it, as a fume arises from it exactly like musk.</p>

            . I keep the Skinner's Arms public-house, Coburg-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner eight months. I heard of his apprehension a few days after it happened - I think at the latter end of the week. On the night of Monday, the 22d of March, he was at my house, and left before twelve o'clock at night - he had been there about three hours. He always smoked his own tobacco in my parlour. I have had part of a pipe with him several times. I have bought tobacco of the prosecutor both before and since this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a flavour was it, as to what he lent you - A. It is the same sort and flavour as what the prisoner lent me - it is called returns, and is scented.

            . I live at No. 29, George's-place, St. John-street-road, and have known the prisoner some years. I heard of his apprehension on the Sunday following. On the Monday before, I called at his father's house, to consult him about some repairs, and while I stood at the door he came; that was at half-past two o'clock, and he met me at Matthewson's at seven in the evening. I went home about half-past seven, returned in an hour and a half to him, and remained there till half past eleven, and left him there. I have often had tobacco of his - there is something of a musky flavour in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since tried any tobacco bought at Choice's - A. Yes, I have smoked some that Matthewson bought. I think it is the same sort as the prisoner used, but cannot swear it; I thought it as nearly alike as possible; the prisoner's was mixed with Cascarilla bark, which is bought at the chemist's. I know Gordon's shop, King-street, Holborn - he is a large tobacconist; a customer could go there without a person being able to speak to them; there were three or four customers there when I went.</p>

            . I am acquainted with the prisoner. I did not hear of his apprehension till he was committed, which was on Saturday the 27th. I was in company with him on the preceding Monday at Matthewson's till nearly twelve o'clock. It is a mile and a half from Covent-garden. We came out together, and walked as far as Bowling-green-row, Leather-lane, which leads up to Brook-street, and left him about twenty minutes after twelve. I have smoked his tobacco, and have since smoked some bought at Choice's - they are both of the same flavour in my judgment.

            . I rented a room in Mrs. M'Craw's house, No. 36, Brook-street. The prisoner lived there. I let him in on Monday night, the 22d of March, about half-past twelve o'clock. I did not go to bed for two or three hours after. I work at the fancy trimming business, and am frequently at work all night. I think I must have heard him if he had gone out, as the door goes hard. He sleeps in the same room with his father and mother.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What trade is the father - A. A clerk in some office. I have frequently seen him in bed in their room. I live in the attic, and they on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What does the prisoner do - A. I never knew him do any thing. I believe his father is independent - he has property I know. I believe he goes by his mother's maiden name.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH M'CRAW. I am the prisoner's mother. My present husband is his father - my maiden name was Bailey. On the Monday night in question. I went to bed about half-past ten or eleven o'clock. The prisoner sleeps in the same room - we have no other bed-room. I awoke when he came into the room, about half-past twelve. I heard the watchman go, and laid awake till our clock struck one. We have a clock in the room which strikes. I remained awake till near two. He went to bed directly he came in, and remained in bed all the time. I was awake, and got up about eight o'clock - he was in bed then. I am sure he had not got up in the night, for I do not sleep very sound when I am disturbed. My husband is clerk to Rosser and Sons, and has been so for twenty-five years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the prisoner - A. He is nothing particular - his father employs him; he has a sufficiency to keep him; he gets little bills, and collects money for his father.</p>
               <p>Q. What bills has your husband to collect - A. I never enquire his business.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, is the prisoner engaged in any occupation whatever - A. No: he comes home sometimes at twelve and one o'clock - he was always out till twelve or one. He is nineteen years old in June.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not put him up a bed elsewhere - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070034"></xptr>That we may know what time he comes in: we advise him to come home early. We have three floors in the house, and two rooms on each. We have a man, his wife, and two female lodgers, besides the witness; the females sleep together.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your son landlord of the house in New-street - A. His father is - he employs him to look after that and two other houses.</p>
               <p>DONALD M'CRAW. I am writing clerk to Messrs. Rosser and Co., Bartlett's-buildings, and have been there twenty-five years. The prisoner is my son. He slept at my house on the 22d of March. I left him in bed between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, when I went to the office. I employ him to collect the rents, and look after the repairs of my house in New-street, and two others which I have, one in King-street, Covent-garden, and another in the City-road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many days does that occupy him - A. Not many - he was three weeks or a month letting this one in New-street. I have 32 s. a week. He has been clerk to two attornies, and left them three or four years ago, and since that (two or three years ago) he lived with Mr. White, a chemist, for some months. He has been in no employ for two years. He was often out at night, but always accounted for being in good company. He was out three or four nights every week.</p>
               <p>MRS. CHOICE. The prisoner said nothing to me about wanting a broom - he had none in his hand. I gave him the key because he was the landlord.</p>

             re-examined. I saw him with the key of the window - he had a broom in his hand - he said nothing about the dirt. I saw him outside in the gutters.</p>

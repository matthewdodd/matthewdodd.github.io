                  </hi>. On the 3rd Jan., between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I was in the Harrow, at Poplar, and saw the prisoners there—I went into the water-closet in the back-yard—Palmer came to me, and I felt her take the money out of my left-hand trowsers pocket—I followed her to the tap-room, and saw her give something into Sullivan's hand, who was near the fire-place—I afterwards saw Sullivan take his hand away from the fire—I had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in shillings and half-crowns, and I know I had it safe when I went into the yard—I had changed a sovereign in the house about two hours before—I then had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—after Palmer left me I had a halfpenny left.</p>

"I went down the yard with him; he gave me three half-crowns, another dropped on the floor; I picked it up and went into the house; I gave the man this money, as I thought there would be a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it."</p>

               <p>—I saw the landlord give the prosecutor change for a sovereign; after that he went backwards, and when he got to the back door he beckoned to the girl to come with him—she went—they were out together half or three-quarters of an hour—they came back to the tap-room, and in three or four minutes the prosecutor said he had been robbed, and called a policeman—if there was any handing from one to another I did not see it.</p>

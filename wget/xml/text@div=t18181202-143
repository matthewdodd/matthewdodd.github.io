On the 9th of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my room - I was in bed; I saw her put something into my milkpot, and asked what it was, she said it was some receipts; when I got up, I missed my gown, with Kelly's trowsers and coat - I found the duplicates of them in the milkpot. She came to my room two months after - I was then laying in, and could not stop her; she said she would bring all my things back at five o'clock; I followed her to a house in Field-lane - she had told the woman of the house not to let anybody in; the woman turned her out. I got an officer, but he refused to take her till I brought the duplicates; she was afterwards secured, and said that I lent her husband the things to pawn, which is false, for he was in Newgate at the time.</p>

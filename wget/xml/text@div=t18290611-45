            . I am a watchman of Kensington. On Thursday morning, the 14th of May, about four o'clock, I was on duty - and in Addison-row, at ten minutes past four, as I was leaving duty, and going towards the Uxbridge-road, I saw a woman lying on her face in the horse-road, her face rested on the edge of the footpath - I went over to the body, and when I moved it she felt quite cold and stiff; I turned her on one side to perceive her face, and saw she had been wounded in her left side - her clothes were not the least disordered - there was not the least appearance of a scuffle having taken place; she had on a dark cotton printed gown, a white bonnet, and white kid gloves; the one for the left hand was on, and a half-crown in the glove in her hand - the other glove was off, and clasped in her right hand; I went and told Mr. Parkin, the surgeon; I had not passed that place in the course of the night - it was beyond my beat; I heard no noise or alarm in the course of the night.</p>
               <p>HENRY PARKIN. I am a surgeon, and live in St. Mary Abbott's-terrace. On the 14th of May Davis called me up at about four o'clock in the morning - I saw the body of the young woman lying on the road quite dead; she had a wound in her side - I did not remove her clothes or examine her further till the constable came; I then found merely a wound in her side, which must have been inflicted by something like a knife, but rather large - I have since seen a knife which is capable of inflicting such a wound as to the size, but I do not think it probable that that was the knife - it was a flat wound; that knife corresponded in size with the wound; I had her removed to the public-house, and placed a constable there to prevent her being touched - I afterwards examined the wound more particularly - it was four or five inches deep; it passed between the ribs through the lower part of the heart, and penetrated through the left lobe of the liver - it is a wound which I should conceive would cause instant death; I perceived no other marks of violence on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Any cutting instrument would make such a wound? A.Certainly; I think the knife produced had not done it, as the cut in the liver was done with a very sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was it such a wound as might have been inflicted by the person herself? A. I should think not; it would produce instant death, and prevent her making any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110022"></xptr>cry; she was found in the position in which she appeared to have fallen; her glove was in her hand and nothing disturbed; had she thrown an instrument away, she must have thrown the glove at the same time - and she had not struggled at all.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PRICE. I knew the deceased, she used to go by the name of Mary Ann Brown, but I am certain her name was Mary Ann Waite - she was an unfortunate girl; I had known her about three months - I lived with her for that time; she had lost her right eye, it was quite closed; I knew the prisoner for about five or six weeks before her death - the first time I saw him was when I met him one evening, accidentally, with the deceased at the Camden Arms public-house; I have seen him with her about four times.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing about this pin (producing it)? A. Yes; I saw that pin taken from him by the deceased about a fortnight before her death - he was intoxicated, and she took it from his neckerchief; I saw them together after that - I went out with her on the evening of the 13th of May; she had the pin then in her cap - she took it out with the intention of showing it to Birmingham; I walked with her to between Knightsbridge-barracks and the Halfway-house - I parted with her at the Halfway-house about ten o'clock, and did not see her again till after she was a corpse, at the Holland Arms public-house; I first heard of it about ten o'clock next day, and again between twelve and one; I then went to the Holland Arms, I saw nobody but the officers showing the body; I saw the prisoner before Mr. Sketchley - he was asked if he knew a person named Mary Ann Waite, otherwise Mary Ann Brown, or

             Smith; he hesitatingly said, "No, he did not;" he was also asked if he knew the person who had lost her right eye, went by the name of Mary Ann; he hesitatingly said No, again; I was standing before him at this time - the body was not there; I said, "Thomas, don't hesitate, this is a serious circumstance, poor Mary Ann is murdered, she is no more - speak the truth;" he then said,"I recollect her;" this was about three o'clock - I know they were intimate, he knew her extremely well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When you saw the body the pin was still in her cap the same as when she left home? A. Yes; I first saw the body about two o'clock; I believe the Magistrate sent for him. because I spoke of her going to deliver the pin to him; Mr. Sketchley questioned him. as if he suspected he could give some account of her that night.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENNETT. I am the watch-house-keeper of Kensington. I was sent by Mr. Sketchley to Kensingtonbarracks on Thursday, the 14th; I first went and saw the prisoner in the stable saddling his master's horses, and said to him, "Thomas, the gentleman wishes to speak to you at the workhouse;" this was about three o'clock in the afternoon; he said, "It is impossible for me to go now, for I can't leave my master's horse;" I said, "You had better go Thomas;" and kept asking him several times to go - and he said, "Not only that, when master is gone, I am obliged to be at some Club-house in St. James'," which he mentioned - I said, "You had better go down, very possibly if you don't it will cause further trouble;" he said it was an impossibility, and he could not; I said, "You say you won't go?" he said, "I can't go, it is impossible;" I was about turning to leave the stable, his back was to me - he looked round, and said, "What do they want with me?" I said, "I don't know; but I believe it is for you to satisfy them where you were last night;" he said, "I know nothing about the murder whatever;" I had not mentioned any murder to him - nothing more passed; I returned to Mr. Sketchley, and in consequence of directions from him I went to fetch the prisoner down to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The murder had excited attention in the neighourhood, and every body knew it? A. Yes, and that it was committed the night before; the town was all in alarm - I went to him again in about ten minutes, and he was brought down to the barracks by order of his master, Lieutenant Ives - the barracks are three or four hundred yards from the work-house.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JOWITT. I am a foot patrol on the Hammersmith road. I saw the deceased after she was dead; I had known her before by seeing her walking the road as a girl of the town, but I do not interfere with them: I saw her about two o'clock on the morning of the 14th, near the Broadway, Hammersmith, in company with a young man, who appeared to be a gentleman's servant, as he had a round had on, with a cockade in it, and what appeared to me to be a short light drab coat, cut round; I did not observe the rest of his dress; as they passed me, the woman either pushed or struck him, and said, "Do you mean to serve me so?" the man was about five feet three or four inches high; he seemed much shorter than myself; I am five feet nine - I returned, and looked at them as they walked on towards town, but did not follow them; they did not appear to be quarrelling - they walked arm-in-arm. In consequence of a report from the Home Secretary's office, I went next morning to Kensington; I saw the body of the deceased; I then saw the prisoner at the barracks; he had a cap on; I said if he was dressed in that cap the preceding night, he was not the person - after being taken before the Magistrate, he was asked if he ever wore a round hat with a cockade in it; I am not positive whether he said he never wore one, or that he had not got one, but I think it was he never wore one; I was then directed to go with him and Bennett to his room at the barracks, to see if there was a hat with a cockade in it - he said there was a hat of that kind; it was then fetched; I believe two were brought - he put one of then on and on seeing him in it, I thought he resembled the man I had seen more than he did before, but I am unable to swear he was the man - there was no watchman in Addison-row but a patrol - I had passed the corner of the road about four o'clock in the morning, and spoke to Davis as I went by; I know where the body was found; I did not go up far enough to have seen it if it had been there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q.The prisoner is five feet eight inches, it must have been a shorter man than him? A. I thought he could not exceed five feet four, but cannot say positively - he appeared to me shorter than the prisoner does, but it was night. I have known innocent people tell a falsehood when accused of crime.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say when he put the hat on, he was more like the man; that is, a man in a hat is like a man who wore a hat? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHICHESTER REYNOLDS. My father is an attorney. On Sunday morning, the 17th of May, I found a knife forty-four yards from where the body was found, in Addison-row, and on the opposite side of the way; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110023"></xptr>was about three-quarters of an inch stuck into the earth -I knocked my stick against it, and found it; I produce it in exactly the same state as I found it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LEE. I am a prisoner in the New Prison, Clerkenwell, charged with felony; I was taken there on Easter Tuesday; I have been in custody several times on charges of misdemeauors and felony: I was there when the prisoner came in; he was brought into the infirmary on Friday evening, between five and six o'clock I think; he was brought up stairs - the turnkey showed him the bed he was to sleep in; we were smoking, and asked him to take a pipe of tobacco, which he did - a prisoner asked him what he was there for, and I immediately told him not to answer any questions; nothing further was asked him then - we talked on different things that evening, and next morning I had some conversation with him; I was cleaning the yard; and after we had been to chapel, he walked up and down the yard, and I walked with him: I said, "This is a terrible piece of business that you are here for;" he said, Yes, it was; I said, "You have left a pen knife in the lodge, I understand;" he said "Yes, I did;" I said, "There looks as if there were stains of blood on the knife, is it so?" he said, "No, it is rust on the pen-knife, which I tried to rub off, but could not - it has been on some time;" I said, "Then she was not murdered with a pen-knife?" "No, (said he), she was not;" I did not say any thing further then, but talked about what I was there for: I afterwards said, "How is it this young woman had a half-crown found in her glove when she was murdered?" he said he knew that, but he gave her no money, so help him God! that night; I said,"How do you account for having the breast-pin found in her cap?" he said, "I am not going to own it, and do not think any body can prove it is mine;" I do not think any more conversation took place that morning: after this I made a communication to the Governor of the prison: we were walking in the yard again; I said to him, "It is a most surprising thing about this murder, about this girl being found; what time did you leave her that night?" he did not reply to that question; I said, "How do you account for getting over the barrack-wall?" he said, "O, I am in the habit of getting over the barrack-wall at all hours in the night;" I think I put the question to him again about the pen-knife, and said, "Was it done with a bayonet? for I understand, (said I,) she was stabbed to the heart;" "No, (said he), it was not; and what it was done with I do not think it very likely they will find;" a great deal more conversation passed about one thing and another - he often told me he hoped what he had told me I should never state again; I believe that was all that passed at that time; but on Monday morning, about one o'clock, he started up in his bed, and said, "By Jesus, Mary, I have done it; where am I?" I then said, "Birmingham, what is the matter?" he said, "Oh! I am only dreaming," or some words to that effect: my bed is nearly opposite his, and I was ordered to pay particular attention to him: I asked how long he had known the girl; he said he had known her at Hounslow, and had known her some time. On Saturday there was a talk about clubbing for a newspaper; he said he would not be one; but we joined, and had a paper between us - I was present after chapel; the prisoner was lying on the bed; Arundel came running up with the paper, and said, "Birmingham, here is your case in the paper, I will read it to you;" the turnkey came up - the prisoner got off the bed, and sat on a seat, and I said, "His countenance seems very much altered since the paper has come in;" and while it was being read, there was an observation in it about his being a good singer, and using a public-house at twelve o'clock at night; I said to him, "Why you told me you was not there at twelve o'clock at night;" he replied, "You know nothing about it - don't you interfere:" we conversed again together before he went to be examined (he expected to go up between eleven and twelve, but did not go up till one), and he said he hoped the saddle would not be put upon the wrong horse, and hoped what he had told me would not go any further; we then talked about different persuasions of religion; and he was saying if he was in Ireland, for 2s. 6d. a man could have absolution - that was all that passed, to the best of my recollection.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Why, you treated him like a guilty man, and asked him how it happened? A. I asked him how it happened; I have no interest in it one way or the other - I told him not to say any thing before the persons in the room; I talked to him about our own affairs, and this conversation came up- I said there seemed to be stains of blood on the knife; I forgot to state that he said, "If I had done the murder with a knife, I should not have been such a fool as to have left it at the lodge;" I never went by any other name than Lee - I was circumsized by the name of Woolf, which is William in English; my wife's maiden name was Gable: when I came from India I took a shop, and put her name over the door - I was never committed by that name to my knowledge, nor ever known by the name of Thompson or Leach; I recollect about Mosely Woolf being tried for a conspiracy - I was committed in October, 1816, by the name of Lee, alias Gable, alias Thompson, and was acquitted at this bar; it was for stealing twenty-nine yards of sarsnet - there was no evidence against me; I was also committed for burglary, but no bill was found for that - the prosecutor was my brother-in-law; I was committed by Mr. Alderman Smith, when he was Lord Mayor, for obtaining goods by false pretences, that was when I employed you - I was acquitted; I have been sworn on the New Testament - I have always attended church and chapel since I have been married; I conceive if I call God to witness the truth, one oath is as binding as another: this affidavit (looking at it) is my writing; it is signed Lee - it is an information against a man having stolen stamps in his possession; an application was made to me by

               <p>SAMUEL ARUNDEL. I come from the New Prison, Clerkenwell, and was there at the time the prisoner was, on Sunday morning, the 17th, he was lying on the bed, when the newspaper was brought in - having it in my hand, I offered to read the article respecting the Kensington murder; he seemed not at all willing, but rather rejected it - I began to read, and after reading a few lines<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110024"></xptr>a stranger entered the room; Birmingham at that moment became alarmed - he immediately got from where he was lying, and seated himself on a form near the fire-place; about the fifteenth line of the article the woman's name was mentioned, and as I read Mary

            . I keep the Camden Arms public-house, which is opposite the Kensington barracks. The prisoner was at my house on Wednesday, the 13th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening - he went away about ten o'clock, and came back again about a quarter before eleven; I had a club meeting at my house that night, and the prisoner was up stairs in the room they assembled in - he left at half-past eleven o'clock, as near as could be; I saw him go out - there was no difference in his appearance that I observed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Did you ever see him in company with a young woman with only one eye? A.Once.</p>

            . I am a private in the 15th regiment, and know the prisoner very well. I saw him between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock on the night this murder happened - I was centinal that night; he was coming out of his master's room - he went up into the guard-room; when he came out of his master's room he asked me where he could get a light - he got one; when he had put the light in his master's room he went up stairs as if to go to bed - his room turns to the right; (I staid on guard from eleven o'clock till one;) I saw him pull his hat and jacket off - I saw him through the window as if going to bed; I went on guard again at five in the morning - Duckworth relieved me at one o'clock; I saw the prisoner next morning coming down stairs, about a quarter or twenty minutes to six, as if he had just risen from bed - he went into the stable; during the time I was on guard it is not probable that he could come down, and go out without my seeing him.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Did he go into his master's room after asking you where he could get a light? A. Yes - he took a light in there; his bed-room is one story high -I stood on the ground, but could see into his window; I saw-him take off his hat, it had a cockade in it - he had a fustian jacket; the barrack wall is low - any body can get over it; the part of the wall he could get over was not in my sight.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q.Was it a stable jacket without skirts that he had on? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DUCKWORTH. I am a private in the 15th regiment stationed at Kensington barracks. On the night in question I relieved Bryant, as centinal, at one o'clock; I remained on duty till three o'clock - I do not think the prisoner could have left the barracks while I was on duty, without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He could have got over the wall at a part which was out of your sight? A. Yes, over the Park wall.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is it not your duty to walk to and fro? A. Yes; he could not pass me without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Does the door of his passage come out at the place where you are stationed? A. No; a person could not come out there without my seeing them, for it was almost daylight - it was break of day at two o'clock; I was quite diligent on my post.</p>

            . I am a private in the 15th regiment. I remember the night this girl was murdered; I relieved Duckworth at three o'clock that morning, and was on guard till five; I know the room the prisoner slept in, and the part of the wall where people can get over into the Park - he might come out of his room and go out that way without my seeing him, when my back was turned; he might get through without passing me - I did not see him go out.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.How long is the walk you parade? A.About thirty yards - there are two front entrances to the barracks; we only walk at one end - he could have gone out in front without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>DANIEL DAVISON. I am serjeant to the 15th Hussars. On the morning of the 14th I got up at five minutes to five o'clock, and went to call the men to the stables: until a quarter to six I was at one stable or the other, and from then till a quarter-past six, I was sitting on a bench in front of the door, or walking about - I saw the prisoner come down stairs about a quarter to six o'clock; he came down the stairs which lead from his bed-room - he was in the state he usually comes to the stables; his neck handkerchief was in his hand - he was not perfectly dressed; he generally went to the stable between five and six; he does not belong to the regiment - he went into the stable.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you seen him in company with the deceased? A. I have seen him with a woman who had but one eye.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday, about six or seven weeks ago (I don't know what day of the month), between six and seven in the evening, I was going with the last witness and another person in a chaise cart; I sat at the outside on the left hand; Maddox sat on the right hand and drove; a man stopped the head of the horse; he came up on the right hand side I know, because while Maddox was thrashing him I did all I could to see his face, but the horse's head was between him and me, and of course I could not see the man; immediately the man at the horse's head said, blast you, fire at them: I did not see any body till I had received the fire; it was fired at the left hand, close to me; it was the man that stood at the horse's head that fired, I am certain of that; he gave the order to fire: directly as he ordered the man to fire, I naturally put my elbow up, and received the ball in my elbow, and the fire struck my face; the next morning, when I went to put on my coat, it fell out; as soon as I had recovered from the blow, I turned round and saw a man close to me, but who it was I don't know.</p>
               <p>Upon his cross examination, he said he did not know what it was that could stop the ball; that his elbow was scratched a little, that he had got the powder in his face.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you sensible of it at the time? A. No, for the fire came so strong in my face, I had not the least idea that it was a ball; it was a leaden ball. (Produce it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. And that ball was repelled by your elbow, with only a slight scratch? - A. I suppose it must have been put in loose, without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020005"></xptr>being rammed, and the powder upon it, or else it must have blown my brains out.</p>

               <p>The last witness and I were going home about a quarter after six at night, near the five milestone, just as you go down in the bottom between Highgate and Finchley; I heard a pistol go off, and I heard murder cried, and these two men ran by about a minute and an half after. Joiner caught hold of one of the men as he came through the posts, and desired me to catch hold of the other. The prisoner said he had been shot at he believed, for he heard the shot go over his head; I said, now then we will go back and see who has shot you. We took him back, and took him to the cart, about one hundred yards, as near as possible, and there they said that was the man that held the horse by the head. We then took him and put him into Highgate cage. I did not see him searched; I tied his hands behind him; he said, for God's sake, let me go.</p>
               <p>Upon his cross examination he said it was a dark night, but that there was a stage going by with two lamps, that Mr. Fox the constable had him in custody afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I waited at Mr. Bolton's to get a place to drive a stage coach; I had been there at the tap-room in the Golden Cross yard, and was drinking with four or five coachmen; we were talking about where we had drove; I said I had been in Ireland. driving the mails there, and they asked me if I knew one Joseph Daffney? One of them said, I came from him the day before yesterday, and brought a letter from him for you, and left it at the Lower Wrestlers, Highgate; he wrote down the name of Warwickshire and Gloucestershire, where he had been, and I paid a pot of beer, and went home to South-street, Manchester-square, and had some tea; I told my wife I should be back by nine o'clock at farthest; when I got to Highgate it was dark; I asked a man in Highgate whereabouts it was, and he directed me to keep strait forward, and I should see it on the right hand; I went forward, and seeing a light lower down the hill on the right hand, I imagined it to be the Lower Wrestlers; I made for that light, it being dark; I did not know the Lower Wrestlers; I walked on a great pace, and just before I came to this light I overtook a man with a light smock frock, and asked him which was the Lower Wrestlers; he said, my friend, you are coming beyond it; says he, it is farther back; I thanked him; he wished me good night, and we parted; I had not left him I dare say above thirty or forty rods before this cart stopped, and a pistol fired, though I did not know it to be a cart or a chaise, it was so dark; and by the pistol being fired, I dare say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020006"></xptr>I might run twelve or fourteen yards in a fright, not knowing whether the person in the dark might shoot at me or not, till I came to the posts, where I met with these two men, who asked me what was the matter; I said I could not tell; I did not know whether I was shot at or not; these two people passed me four or five yards; I went towards Highgate, and they went towards the place where the pistol was fired; they turned back, and one clapped his hand upon one shoulder and the other upon the other, and said you are the man I have been looking for; I made answer - then I suppose I must go with you, and then they took hold of me and pulled me right in the middle of the road, and kept crying out, - We have got him, we have got him! Upon that, they took me to the cart, Maddox was there, and he said he believed I was the man that held the horse; upon that they tied my hands behind me; upon which, Singleton laid hold of me, and said he was a constable, and would take care of me, and put me in the care of these two men that took me up; one of them was so intoxicated, he tumbled backwards. Maddox got out of the cart to secure me from running away, and they took me to Highgate, to a public house, I believe the Red Lion, and there they sent for a constable and searched me, and found nothing about me but a knife, four shillings, a pocket-book, with a direction to the person at the Lower Wrestlers, where I was going for this letter.</p>

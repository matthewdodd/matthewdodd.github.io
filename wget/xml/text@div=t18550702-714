                  </hi>. I am a draper, and reside in Church-street, Greenwich. On Wednesday evening, 30th May, I was in Greenwich fair, between 10 and 11 o'clock—I had a watch with me, in my waistcoat pocket—it was safe when I was in the fair—it might be a quarter or half an hour after I was there—it was a Geneva silver watch—it was attached by a guard chain to my waistcoat—I missed it about half past 10 o'clock, while I was in the fair—I found the guard chain hanging loose from the pocket—it was quite sound—the ring of the watch was broken and was lost—the watch was produced to me by an officer.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 118). I was on duty in Green<lb></lb>wich fair on the evening of Wednesday, 30th May—I saw the prisoner in company with three others—I watched them, and saw them hustle several gentlemen—I missed the prisoner—I then followed the other three from the fair to the church—I there saw the prisoner join them, and they all walked together from the church towards Deptford—I got assistance in the Broadway, and went to the prisoner—I asked him where the watch was that he had got—he said he had got no watch—one of the others ran away—we took, the three into a public house, and on searching the prisoner I found these two watches (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this one the prosecutor claims as his—he stated that a man had given him half a crown to carry them to London—he said, "Perhaps you saw the man give them to me?"—this watch has been broken off from the bow.</p>

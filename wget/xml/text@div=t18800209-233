Brown the articles are not accounted for—the examinations were not concluded at the Bankruptcy Court—I afterwards held an examination at my office by the direction of Mr. Registrar Brougham—I heard the defendant questioned as to an entry in his ledger to Jones, of Liverpool—the entry is March 1st, 1877, on the debit side 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the credit side it is pin 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and cash 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the defendant said it was not true that he had borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Jones and Sons, of Liverpool, and that he had balanced it off with goods, but that they never had goods—ring 955 would be nearly his last purchase of me—the stone in the emerald ring I mounted for him was worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the ring after the mounting would realise 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or even 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when asked about it he said he had sold it to a dealer in the North—he gave no name—he saw he did not know where he lived—I think he said he got about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he said he got the cat's-eye pin from a customer in Leeds—he refused to give the name—I think he said it was returned to him—an entry against the pin in the approbation book was pointed out to him—this is it: "A fine cat's-eye pin, own stock"—he said that was another pin altogether—he had sold it to the dealer in the North with the emerald ring, whose name and address he did not know—none of these alleged sales appear in the defendant's books.</p>

Brown, Manchester"—he did not say the sale was effected at the Washington Hotel, Liverpool—I was present at all the examinations of the debtor—I believe he said Mr. Brown was a gentleman who was going abroad and wished to make a present to his wife, and so purchased the ring—the entry in the ledger is "February 28th, 1878. One ruby and diamond ring, 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the defendant was frequently out of London on business—I cannot change my memory with his stating that his wife assisted him in the books—had the defendant said he was a bad bookkeeper I should not have believed him—I have no recollection of his doing so—I said before the Magistrate that the amount Harris was indebted to me at the commencement of the second proceedings was 2,651<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is made up of the whole 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was due, and the amount since accrued—it was an error when I said I was simply proving for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—my books are correct, but the amount I was untitled to was settled by the solicitation on both sides, and it is more a matter of law than for me—I really cannot answer your question as to what Harris put me down a creditor for—the last dealing with him appears to 5th June, 1878, showing 166<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of new debt—that added to 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would make the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not object to this account to the defendant—I told him before the meeting that most likely the creditors would require him to give some particulars, and he gave me that—I did not analyses any of tile statements, but I can tell you about some of the items—after paying 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound off the actual amount, 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the odd sum was allowed for my costs-Mr. Garrett told us only to put down 1,438<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because the debtor torn me Mr. Garrett would not prove for the whole amount, only for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I paid tuck and Godfrey their composition myself, excepting the list bill—there is only 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unpaid to them—if they are in the present account again, that is treating their debt as revived—the defendant estimates his household expenses for two and a half years at 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but from his examination at the Bankruptcy Court 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be nearer the mark that mistake is against himself—I prepared this amended deficiency account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which shows about 630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unaccounted for. (<hi rend="italic">Giving the items</hi>) top fame of the stock handed over to me by the debtor was 1,385<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the stock on approbation 152<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making a total of 1,532<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of stock available for is creditors-his daughter was married during that period, which put mm to considerable expense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not prepare this amended account by testing the books—I did not exercise my ingenuity at all; it is a plain statement of facts—there is in it a difference in valuation of furniture in 1876 and 1873—I put that in as a credit on the deficiency account—the amount is 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090100"></xptr>
               <p>it was valued at 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1876, and now it is valued at 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that is not a loss; it is a difference in valuation-as to loss by forced sale, I do not know of any forced sale, or that any loss whatever has been sustained by the defendant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 20, Baker Street, Lloyd Square, and have been in business 20 years—I attended the first general meeting under the petition of August, 1878—the defendant was present a statement of affairs was passed showing a deficiency of 940<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the stock was valued at 1,385<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. this is the inventory of the stock referred to it does not include the five rings and a pin, the subject of this prosecution Mr. Carter read an account of the deficiency, and I took a note at the time—there was a surplus of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after paying 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a deficiency on the statement of affairs of August, 1878, of 950<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which with the esti<lb></lb>mated profits on trading made a total of 2,206<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the defendant was ques<lb></lb>tioned, and confirmed those accounts—he was asked to sign it, but would not because Mr. Carter, his accountant, would not—I heard him ques<lb></lb>tioned as to what books he kept—he said that he kept no cash-book or stock-book, and that his bought ledger had gone behind, as he was so worried—I have been engaged some time investigating his affairs; his real defi<lb></lb>ciency between the first and second petitions was 4,212<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. after giving credit for every item he claims on the credit side, a deficiency remained of 2,058<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the first deficiency in 1878 was 949<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had con<lb></lb>siderable difficulty in going through the books, as there were no account! with creditors, and therefore the whole lists had to be verified by getting accounts from each creditor—I attended at his place of business on 3rd September, 1878-Mr. Carter was present part of the time, Mr. Wilson part of the time, his clerk part of the time, and the defendant the whole of the time—I saw the stock given up with this inventory, and checked it with Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Garrett; it agreed at that time with the inventory—I have been through it since, and it is in precisely the same condition—there was not with that stock the five rings and the pin men<lb></lb>tioned to-day—the defendant gave up a sold ledger; a day-book, a book for ordinary approbation goods, a pocket journey book for his travels, and an approbation book—I have been through the books from time to time, and cannot find any entry of the sale or disposal of these five rings, except the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ring—I have made very careful search, and have had the trustees' assistance—there is an entry in the pocket journey book of the return of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ring by Mrs. Thomas on 16th August—the prisoner had no other single ring of so great a value as 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have traced that ring as left on approbation with customers from time to time, within a fortnight of his having it from Mr. Garrett, on 7th April, 1877 it was first sent to Leeds on 24th April, 1877 ', being returned from there, it was sent to Hancock's, in Bond Street, on 8th August, 1877; then to Vassal, of Scarborough. on 4th September, 1877; next to Thomas, of Bond Street, on 17th February, 1878, and returned on 30th May I was present on 23rd May 1879, when the prisoner was questioned in Mr. Garrett's office—I asked him about a debt due to Jones and Son, of Liverpool—I complained that I could not find the goods in the journal, although there was the debt in the ledger—he said he had not sent anything; it was a false entry, that he had made it shortly before he gave up the books—I heard him asked to the rings 545 and 950 he said he had no recollection of having had them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090101"></xptr>
               <p>at all—him that it was a very recent purchase—he said that if Thomas of Bond Street, had had it must have been stated—there is an entry in the prisoner's journey book: "27th May, 1878, Thomas, two rings, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, one kept and one returned:" there are no numbers put—he was asked as to an emerald ring with two brilliants which Mr. Garrett had mentioned, and he said it was sold to a dealer in the north for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was asked the dealer's name: he said he did not know it—I asked him as to the cat's eye pin—here is an entry in the approbation book: "May as 7th, 1878, Messrs. Orton and House," among other goods, "a cat's-eye pin 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., own stock"—before that entry was shown him he said he had sold it, he did not say to whom or from whom he had it—I then called his attention to these words "own stock"—at last he got into a muddle about it altogether, and could give no explanation, it was so long ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In making up the deficiency account, I have not allowed anything for liquidation expenses—I cannot, because there is no entry in the books for it; he kept no cash book—the book debts turned out 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. better than they were estimated at; they were estimated at 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they realized 1,321<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the next item is a composition of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, 1,381<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he did not pay; that is treating the old debts as received, because he failed to pay the composition—1,160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the amount of the unpaid composition to Mr. Garrett—truck and Godfrey is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't allow for the whole of their accounts—there is a proof of J. Truck, seen for 252<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., subject to revision—Miss Skelton's revived debt is 177<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance of her dividend; she held securities, but they were not then realized—I have been an accountant about 20 years—my office is in the same building as Mr. Garrett's—I did not hear the prisoner complain that these question had not been put to him until eight months after his bankruptcy, and that his memory had been shattered by his worries—I do not find the five rings in the stock sheet—he kept no ledger—Jones's debt is 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that he had borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Jones, and that he wished to hide him from being a creditor—there are eight or ten creditors besides that, not entered on the schedule—nearly 100 creditors are omitted—Mr. Pearce is not a creditor, he is a debtor, a customer—I found out the eight or ten creditors four or five months ago—I mentioned it to the solicitor—the prisoner never explained about the cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Pearce—I only knew of it from his own accountant—the 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. described as the same ring—I have no reason to disbelieve it—there were other ruby and diamond rings, but at less prices, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not made any inquiry as to where he got the cat's-eye pin from—in the 2,054<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency account which the debtor claims there is nothing about the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I have allowed him the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound as if it was paid, and then charged it back again because he has not paid it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> According to the amended deficiency account the prisoner himself shows a deficiency of 2,154<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I charge Miss Skelton's deficiency 177<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because she has not been paid—there are three items of goods in the approbation book sent to Mr. Barrett on approbation: diamond carrings, 50 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that is ruled through and "own stock".</p>

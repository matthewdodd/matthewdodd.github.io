            . On the 28th of February, between twelve and one, I saw the prisoner standing up in a chair, reaching over a grate into my window: I said, Hey, hey! what are you about? then he stept out of the chair, opened the door, and away he ran. I concluded he had robbed me. I pursued, crying, Stop thief; in his flight he threw away two pair of silver buckles; and, in about 120 yards running, he was stopped by two men at the end of Chamber's-street; they brought him back to a public house near my shop. I went to see what I had lost from the window; then I went to the prisoner, and demanded my watches; he gave me two: I said, here is not all; you have another: then he pulled out the third, and gave it me: then I said, Where are my rings? after some little while, he gave me them: said I, let me have all: then he took out the other pair of buckles, and said, that was all; and held up his hands, and cried for mercy.</p>
               <p>- Steward. I was coming along: this gentleman cried, Stop thief: I stopped the prisoner, and brought him back to the alehouse: after that, the prosecutor came and asked him for his things, and he gave him them; the same things as the prosecutor has mentioned.</p>

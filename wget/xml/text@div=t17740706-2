            . The pawnbroker said when he came into gaol that he did not know the man; I would not say it now in the situation I am in, as I have not a month to go of my time, if it was not true, and I never took an oath in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you never upon your oath before at all?</p>
               <p>Brown. No.</p>

               <p>Brown. Not before such a court as this.</p>
               <p>She received a very severe reprimand from the court.</p>

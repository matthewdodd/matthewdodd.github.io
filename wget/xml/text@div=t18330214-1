            . I am clerk and book-keeper to the prosecutor - I occupy that portion of the premises which is not used as warehouses; I occupy them as the servant of Mr. Wheeler - the front parlour is what we call the warehouse; the house is in the parish of St. Andrew,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140004"></xptr>Holborn; myself and my son Joshua sleep in the back room on the first floor - Mrs. James sometimes sleeps there, but on the night in question she went to see a married daughter in Cross-street - I have two sons a wife, and a maid servant; my son Joshua John is sixteen years old - the other son is between eight and nine; he sleeps in the attic. On Sunday, the 20th of January, I was very unwell the whole day; I never stirred out from the Saturday till Monday - I went to bed before nine o'clock, being unwell; I had the care of the warehouse - Joshua went to bed with me, about nine o'clock, and I am pretty well certain he was in bed with me the whole night; I have no doubt of it, for being unwell I was awake most of the night - in the course of the Sunday I had occasion to go into the warehouse three or four times; it was quite safe - the drawers in the warehouse were secured with a bar across them, which was padlocked - I had seen them quite safe on Saturday night; the drawers were barred and locked, and the key of the drawers was in possession of a person not in the house; I locked the warehouse door between seven and eight o'clock, and put the key of the warehouse under my pillow; all was safe then - I got up next morning about a quarter before eight o'clock, and when I came down stairs I found a dark-lantern at the foot of the stairs, within a few inches of the counting-house door, that alarmed me - I then observed a stool in the passage, which belonged to the warehouse, and two small pieces of clean writing paper, and two worsted socks; I took them up, and immediately went to the warehouse - the socks were two odd ones; I gave them to Waller, the officer - the two pieces of paper were at the foot of the stool; I went to the warehouse, and found the counting-house door a little way open, but the key was safe in my breeches pocket, as I had put it the night before - I am quite certain I had locked it; that was the warehouse key, but it goes into both counting-house and warehouse - that is the door which secures all the property; I am perfectly certain I locked it overnight - I have been there fifteen years; on going into the warehouse I found the floor strewed with empty drawers - they were the drawers where the principal gold and silver articles were kept, and which were safe overnight, having a bar across them, and padlocked; they were all empty on Monday morning - I saw that the bar was not in its proper place, and that day or next, I saw a piece of wood sticking to it, with the marks of a centre-bit; I looked round, and found from fifteen to twenty skeleton-keys, a centre-stock, four or six bits, for making circular holes, a pair of gloves. two oranges half sucked away, a bottle of oil, a match-box, a bank of whipcord, a crow-bar, a tinman's soldering iron, a chisel, and one or two straps, apparently of a pair of trousers; these things remained in the warehouse, and in my fright I instantly ran off for Mr. Wheeler, who lives at Camden-town - he seldom missed coming to town every day; I remember finding a tin box on my son Joshua about a week before - this is the box(looking at it) - I have no doubt; but it then had a lid to it; I was searching in his pockets for a key I had lost; I did not find the key, but found this, and he immediately snatched it from me, and ran out of the house - it had a lid to it, but what was in it I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, and before the Sunday night, did you at any time see this tin article, in this condition, in your house (producing the lid of a tin box, with two wheels attached to it?) A. I did, but cannot exactly say whether it was before or after - I saw my little boy dragging it about, but it did not occur to me at the time that it was the same; (looking at it) I am the more strongly convinced of it being the same now, for I remember its being painted; while I was gone for Mr. Wheeler the officers were sent for, and I delivered to Waller the different articles found on the floor; here are the picklocks, crowbar, phosphorus-box, socks, matches, and other things - the picklock-keys were spread about the floor, and here is a knife I forgot to mention - it had been recently sharpened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I presume you have no share in the business? A. No, I am merely the clerk; Mr. Wheeler has no partner at all - he pays for the dwelling-house; I live there as his clerk; my son staid at home with me the greatest part of the Sunday; he was out two or three times for an hour or an hour and a half each time - he has just left school, and has not been put to any business yet; he may have left school six or eight months - I have been endeavouring to get him to sea; my wife had gone to Cross-street, Hatton-garden - I did not see her return that night, but she came in after I went to bed; I did not hear her come in, nor did I hear any body come in that night - I was pretty sound asleep for the first two or three hours.</p>

               <p>Q. If you were sound asleep, your son might have got out for an hour or two without your knowledge? A. He might; I came down in the morning, without being alarmed, and found things as I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. If the door was fastened and bolted inside, how could a person get in? A. I do not think there was any way, for there had been an attempt at robbery a few 
years before, and the house was perfectly well fastened.</p>


               <p>Q. There must have been somebody to withdraw the bolts? A. Undoubtedly; a short person would require a stool to reach it - I found all the things scattered about in different parts of the warehouse; my son was in the employ of Mr. Boyd, a jeweller, of No. 312, Oxford-street, for three or four months; that was the second place he had - before that he lived with Mr. Statham, a great tailor in Bedford-street, Covent-garden, and with an apothecary in Tavistock-street; this is since he left school; I was looking for a berth at sea for him, and during that time he lived with those people - it did not strike me to mention this; he was not more than a fortnight with Statham, and rather less with the apothecary, and with Boyd four months - I did not think that worth mentioning; he left the apothecary and tailor in credit; he left Boyd, I believe, because he had three shops, and gave up two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the real cause? A. Why the boy had stolen a knife - I cannot call it stealing; he had given it to be ground - he would have left the place in a week if it had not been for that; that accelerated his being discharged; I never saw the knife in his possession - I know he robbed Mr. Wheeler of 3s. 6d.; Mr. Wheeler found it out, and I returned it to him - I never heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140005"></xptr>that it was marked money put into the till on purpose; I understand some waste-paper was stolen while my son was in the house; it was books belonging to the late partnership, and was sold as waste-paper, and the prisoner Smith took it, with my son's consent, as I have heard - it was found at a cheesemonger's; I taxed my son with it, and he owned to it - he stole a shilling from somebody whom I do not know, and cannot tell when it was - I know of nothing else; I wanted to get him to sea for that very reason.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He was a very bad boy, I believe? A. I have related all I know of his badness; I cannot tell when the bolts were drawn - I know it must have been after eight o'clock; my son was acquainted with Smith when these wicked acts occurred; he has drank tea at our house full half a dozen times - my son was out three times on Sunday, and he was out about seven or eight o'clock for an hour; I cannot say how long he staid to half an hour - he was in the habit of going out with Smith repeatedly; I have seen Smith at the house six or eight times.</p>

             was my clerk and book-keeper. On Monday morning, the 21st of January, I arrived from my house in Camden-town, between nine and ten o'clock - my attention was excited by the unusual appearance of the door not being open, and the shutters of the warehouse were shut; they ought to have been open - (I pay the rent of the house and the rates; it is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn) - I was at the warehouse late on Saturday evening- my stock in the drawers was all perfectly safe on my leaving on Saturday, at near ten o'clock or later - when I entered on Monday morning I found my clerks assembled in the passage, who asked if I had seen Mr. James, but I had not seen him - I immediately went into the warehouse; my attention was drawn to the drawers strewed on the floor, and a variety of keys strewed on the counters, and various other implements: this lantern and other articles of housebreaking, which did not belong to my house - the value of the stock I lost I cannot state within some hundreds of pounds; but I lost decidedly considerably beyond 500l. worth of goods - I cannot speak with accuracy within some hundreds; among other articles which I deal in, is a waxer; I had several of them in my house on Saturday night - I have now brought one from my own stock; here is the die which the top of the waxer I have brought was stamped with; it is the die which made the impression on the silver - the die is made for the purpose of making one of a larger size as well; it has two borders - the waxer produced is made to the reduced size; you will also find that there is a screw for the purpose of screwing into this tube - on trying that through the guage plate, you will find it fits No. 10; this is not one of the articles stolen, and here is a die my bodkins are made with - here is a lead impression made from it, and here is a similar indented impression in the die - it is for the purpose of showing us where to make the hole.</p>
               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I produce two bodkins, one of which I picked up in the house, No. 47, Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell, and the others I received from Mr. Cope in the same house, on the 28th of January - the one I found was among some things in the front room; it was a week after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was any body at home in the house? A. No; the prisoners were both in custody - they were taken on the 22nd; I found the bodkin among some things which had been turned out of some drawers - I had turned several of the things out the first time I went, which was on the 22nd, about nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On the 28th, when you examined more particularly among those things, you found a bodkin? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. WHEELER. These are silver bodkins; when they were first produced, they exhibited an appearance of being new - they had the bloom of newness on them, evidently showing to me that they had not been used; if they had been exposed in a place where the air was damp, there would be a tarnish on them - to the best of my belief, this bodkin which I now hold in my hand is my manufactury and was made in this die; the bead in it exactly corresponds with the hole made in it - there is the piercing of it in the place where the indentation is made to guide my men where to pierce it; I cannot speak to the second bodkin with the same confidence, because the die from which it has been made has been much more used, and is very old - it is similar to those I manufacture, and it fits the die - it had the same degree of comparative newness when produced to me.</p>

            . I am one of the City marshals. I have a waxer, which I found in the front parlour, at No. 47, Red Lion-street; the prisoners were apprehended on the 22nd, and it was four or five days after that - the drawers had been examined and emptied on the night of the 22nd, by me and Forrester, but on making a more minute examination afterwards, I found this waxer and a bodkin; I delivered the bodkin to Forrester.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How was the house left between the 22nd and the 28th? A. We got in on the 22nd, between nine and ten o'clock at night - we left nobody in the house when we came out; there were no keys.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body was disposed to make evidence, they could have deposited these things there. A. I think not, for I recollect on the first night, on turning over the things, seeing the two bodkins and this piece of was; I was not aware that such things had been lost, not having read the bill minutely - I turned the things out of a kind of workbox.</p>
               <p>MR. WHEELER. This waxer bore every appearance of being new, and I have every reason to believe it was once my property; I tried it in the die, and have no doubt whatever that this was struck in that die - here is the die; it fits exactly - I have no doubt these two ends of the waxer are made in the same die.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long has the die for the waxers been in your possession? A. I cannot say; I have been a manufacturer thirty-three years<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140006"></xptr>- the die has been in my possession some years; a great many of these things have been made and sold to different people - I sell to the trade; I had not many waxers in my possession at the time of the robbery - I might have from a dozen to twenty - they were kept in the warehouse; I have made a great many bodkins - they are a common pattern; the eye and slit would be about the same position nearly in all the bodkins which are made - there would be a little variation in the end nob, as generally speaking they are made rounder; Joshua James could not have access to these things, for the drawers were always locked up, and the keys kept by my respective clerks - I cannot conceive any time at which he might have got at them; I saw some waste-paper which was said to have been brought from a shop in Clare-market, and questioned him about it - he said he had taken it together with another, who carried it out of the warehouse; this was before the robbery - on discovering this robbery, I occupied myself the whole of Monday taking the examinations of every body in the house; I asked Mr. James about it - I told him it must be a gross act of negligence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give him a hint that he would leave your service in consequence of it? A. He had a hint previous to that - the son gave me information on the following morning, and I sent the Police to Red Lion-street; I was there once when they searched, and saw the bodkins and the wax, but they were not brought away, because I brought away nothing - on picking up the waxer, I recognized it at once; I said "This is decidedly my property"- I brought nothing away; Joshua was not in my service; I never personally detected him in robbing me - one of my clerks stated some money was found on him; it was not produced to me that I recollect - that was full two or three years ago; I only knew of the paper being stolen since this robbery - I knew nothing of any ear-rings.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you have every reason to believe he was a very bad boy? A. Very great reason- I can safely say that at least every one of the articles stated in the indictment was gone from my stock; they are stated less in number and value than what I lost - Joshua and his father were kept separate in my house after I came on the Monday,</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WADHAM COPE re-examined. I was sent for to Mr. Wheeler's - I arrived between four and five o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, the 22nd;

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. That cord is common enough? A. I should think it is, and the oil also - I did not find every thing which I expected - I examined the back bed-room minutely, as far as I could.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you expect to find some other persons? A. Not in the house.</p>

            . I am a hosier. These socks are not in the state in which they were originally sewn - they agree in colour with the two pieces of stockings found at the house in Red Lion-street; these two pieces of white cotton appear to have been cut from the white part of the odd socks found at Wheeler's - I have not a doubt that this odd sock and the bottoms originally formed one stocking; in my judgment, the whole once formed a pair of stockings - this white piece undoubtedly belonged to this one.</p>

            . I was fifteen years old on the 20th of April last; I live with my father at Mr. Wheeler's. I have known the prisoner Smith about two years; I became acquainted with him by meeting him several times in the neighbourhood, and we went to the same school; in December last I was in the service of Mr. Boyd, a jeweller, in Oxford-street - I was then rather less intimate with Smith, but became more intimate with him after I left Boyd - we have talked together a good deal; I am sorry to say, I once stole 3s. 6d. from Mr. Wheeler - I do not recollect that I told Smith of that; I was in the habit of communicating privately to Smith about what I had done - I told him several things which I had done, and he told me several things that he had done, and we became very intimate; about a month before the robbery, I had some conversation with him about Mr. Wheeler - he asked me what Mr. Wheeler was worth, and if there was much property, and where it was kept; I told him - I know 47, Red Lion-street; I went there with Smith about a week after he asked me what Mr. Wheeler was worth, and where he kept his property - Smith's mother had asked me to go with him to No. 47, Red Lion-street while the lady of the house was absent, and I went with him; that was the first time I had ever been there - Mrs. Coney was the lady of the house; when I got to the house, Smith told me the house was kept by cracksmen - I asked what he meant; he said housebreakers - he then took me into the kitchen, which appeared like a cellar; he showed me a number of keys there and a life preserver which was broken (looking at a bunch of keys); I think they were larger keys than these(looks at another small bunch of keys) - there were several of these, and this is the sort of thing called a life-preserver, but I can not be certain of it, for it was broken at that time; and he showed me a number of old articles - he showed me some old drawers, and several rubbishing things; he did not that day show me any thing else that I recollect - I saw some whipcord there, but cannot say on what day, and a crow-bar; I went to the house a short time afterwards with Smith again - I have seldom gone without Smith: the second time I went I saw three more persons there, Coney was one, and when I got there (I think this was the second time), Coney asked me where Mr. Wheeler's property was kept, and what situation the warehouse drawers were in; I told him - (looking at the top of a tin box made into a cart) I know that; about a week after Coney asked me about the premises, Smith called for me at Mr. Wheeler's - I went out with him into Bartlett's-passage, and there I found Coney waiting - Smith produced a tin box to me full of soap, in Coney's presence in the passage; Smith had before that asked me to get him the impression of the counting-house key, and the iron chest key; the counting-house key opens the door leading to the warehouse - I had said I would get him the impression of only one; Coney was not present when Smith first asked me to get the impression - he was present afterwards, when he asked me about it, before I went into Bartlett's-passage- I refused to get the iron chest key - I said there was a great deal of property there, and I would not get it; Coney heard me refuse to get the impression of the chest key, and the (Coney) said I was a fool - in Bartlett's-pas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140008"></xptr>sage Smith gave me the box of soap out of his pocket; this tin cart was the lid of it, to the best of my knowledge - Smith gave it to me before I came up to Coney, and when I got up, Coney told me to press the key even with the soap; it did not matter which side - I was to get the flat side of the counting-house key and press it level with the soap; I was to wet the key before I pressed it to the soap, and I was to hold the key up afterwards, to see that no soap was sticking in the wards - I received these directions from both Coney and Smith in the passage; I took the box of soap, and had it in my pocket - I left them, and came home; my father was searching my pockets on the following Monday for a key, and saw the box of soap in my pocket - I had at that time got the impression on the soap; the lid was on the box - my father saw it, and tried to take it away from me, but I was quick and put it into another pocket, and I ran off to Coney's house in, Red Lion-street, and saw Coney, who was cutting wood; I told him the box had been seen - he said he hoped nothing was suspected, and while I was there he lent me a book called the Forget Me Not; this is the book, to the best of my knowledge - it had a cover exactly like this; Coney said they only wanted 20l. - my father had no opportunity of examining the impression of the key: this was at nine o'clock in the morning - I was to call again at eleven o'clock (this was the Monday before the Sunday of the robbery); I came home then, and lent the Forget Me Not to my mother - I went to Coney's again about eleven o'clock, and found Coney and two or three more men there; Smith was there - I now know a person named Cook, and another named Pearce, and there was a tall man who I do not know the name of; they were the three persons who were there; I should know them all three again - when I returned at eleven o'clock, Coney was filing a key in the vice; (looking at a vice) it was about this size, but not so rusty - the box of soap was on a window ledge by him, with the impression on it, and Pearce was making a little cart of the top of the soap box; he put this little axletree to it, and I saw him put these two wheels in, and saw him cut two other pieces to fasten the wheels to - he made the cart, tied a string to it, and told me to give it to my little brother, so that my father might see it, and be deceived, that he should not suspect any thing was in the box which he had seen; Coney and Pearce together told me that; I waited until Coney had finished the key, and after he had finished it, he put it in the fire, and then gave it to me to try if it would fit - putting it in the fire took away the brightness; I took it home, and had no opportunity of trying it until the Sunday night of the robbery - I delivered it to Smith, as I could not try it; he had it in his possession to prevent my father seeing it - he had it while I went in to dinner on Tuesday, and returned it to me again, but I had no opportunity of trying it; on the Friday before the robbery, I went to Coney's house - Coney then said, that he and another would call at Mr. Wheeler's with a job to mend, to see the situation of the premises; I was to meet him at the White Horse, Gilbert-street, Clare-market, on the Saturday afternoon - I went, and Smith with me; there was Pearce, Cook, and the tall man, and several others there, and Coney came about half an hour afterwards; I was talking with them, and when Coney came he asked me to bring the dog to Red Lion-street the next afternoon; I said several times to them on that Saturday, that they had better leave it alone, because I was afraid my father would be suspected - Coney said they would leave all their tools there, to wipe off the suspicion from my father, and to show that it was done by the profession; on the Saturday, Cook said, if I ever split, he would muzzle me (both the prisoners were present) - Pearce said if I did not go on with it, he would scrag me, and the tall man said he would take me before a Magistrate if I did not proceed with it; I am certain both the prisoners were present then - Coney said the tall man was to watch at the kitchen door, to see that the servant did not awake; Coney wanted me to poison the dog - I said I would not, because it was a favourite dog, and one we had hed by us for many years; when I would not-poison it, he asked me to bring it to the house on Sunday; I went home on Saturday, and was to come between five and six o'clock on Sunday with the dog - I went with it between five and six o'clock, and found Coney at home, and in a little time Cook, Pearce, and the tall man came and Smith came in - they saw the dog, and one of them remarked, "Have you got the barker?" and Coney said, "We have him all right;" the dog was running about there until the men came in - Coney then told me to come with him; I went with him through a yard into a shed, and he tied the dog there with a string to a post in a shed in the yard - we then all drank tea together; after tea I was sent for 3d. of sperm oil in a tea cup - I went for it to Cow-cross; I believe Mrs. Count was the woman I went to, but I cannot be certain - this is the sort of tea cup Coney gave me to fetch the oil in; I brought it back to him, and he then put some into a dark lantern, some into a phial, and some remained in the tea cup (looking at a dark lantern) - this is the lantern; I cannot speak to the phial - Coney said "I have got some laudanum, could not you contrive to put some into the servant's and your father's beer;" he said this in the presence of all the rest - I refused, and he said, I was a great fool, and Mrs. Coney said I had better not; after tea, Coney brought out all the housebreaking implements - Pearce, Cook, and all were present at the time (looking at the articles produced); there was a piece of whipcord like this on the table - I think this is the piece and the bag of keys; they were shook out of the bag by Pearce, shown to me, and put in again; I looked them all over in my hand, and then they were put into the bag again - it was such a bag as that; this centrebit I certainly saw, and the stock-handle - the bits were in this corderoy case, as they are now; a little before that, Coney was mending a pair of worsted socks - I asked him what they were for - he said they were to put on over his shoes, to prevent his making any noise - this is one of the socks, and the other was like this - they were odd ones; I saw them at the examination - they are the same as I had seen at Coney's, to the best of my knowledge; there were four or five oranges on the table, one of which was given to me, and I eat it; I asked what they were going to take the oranges with them for - they said they had got bad coughs - after tea on Sunday, Coney said he had been to Mr. Wheeler's, and seen a young man, and he asked me what was in the drawers in the chest opposite, and I told him all the silver; he said he had been to Wheeler's with a pin, to get a diamond put in, and the young man told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140009"></xptr>him they did not do such jobs for strangers, and there was plenty of shops in Holborn if he would go to them - he said the drawers were opposite just by the window; those are the drawers which are fastened by a bar and padlock - I left them on Sunday evening, about half-past six o'clock; I had the key with me then, and they told me to be sure and try it, and give it to them at the Magpie and Stump, Fetter-lane - I had not before that had an opportunity of trying the key; I went home and left Smith with them - when I got home my father was in the drawing-room; I went into the room - it was agreed that I should leave the door ajar, and return to them at the Magpie and Stump, and give them the key if it fitted, and that was to be a signal that I had left the door open; there is a fan-light over the door, and they were to put a piece of paper on the fan-light, as a signal for Pearce that they were ready to come out - Pearce was to be outside, Coney and Cook were to be in the warehouse, and the tall man, at the kitchen stairs; Smith was one of the party on the Sunday evening, and I asked him if he should be at the house with them; he said No, he would not, and he would never sell his liberty for such a thing as that - I tried the key while my father was up stairs in the drawing-room; it fitted - I was to meet them at the Magpie and Stump between eight and nine o'clock, and went there; I left the door ajar, as I had agreed - I was to deliver the key to one of them at the tap-room in Fetter-lane, as a signal that the door was ajar, but I found the tall man at the door of the Magpie and Stump; I gave it to him, and he said "We can't find George," meaning Coney - Coney came running up directly, and whispered to him; I then walked down Bartlett's-buildings, and saw Coney and another man (I cannot say whether it was Cook or not) dodge round the bricks to go in at the door; Coney was nearest the lamp and I saw his face - they went in before me; they were to hide themselves behind the counter in the warehouse till I was in bed - I went home directly and found the door open, and shut it; while I was at Coney's on the Sunday, I asked what the whipcord was for, and they said it would be useful, and I saw Pearce sharpening his knife - I asked the use of every thing; he was sharpening his knife on a new whetstone - I believe this is the knife; the life-preserver was on the table - I saw Coney at one end of the room, tying something, but I could not tell what, and just before I left I saw the life-preserver laying on the table, mended in the state it is now; Smith had it in his hand, and struck me with it several times in play, and said it would hit any body a good crack - I went to bed about nine o'clock, and after I was in bed I heard a ring at the bell, and a knock, and heard a man's voice; I do not know the watchman's voice - I had been in bed I should think three quarters of an hour, or an hour - I had not gone to sleep; shortly after that I heard footsteps running up the stairs, and the person that ran up tried one of the doors - he made a noise in running up - it appeared a man's footstep; I returned the Forget Me Not to Coney a few days before the robbery; I gave it into his own hands - I did not see the dog next morning till about twelve o'clock; I remember Mr. Wheeler's making inquiry on the Monday about this, and again on the Tuesday, and I made a statement to him, and afterwards saw Forrester and Cope - I disclosed to them what I knew, and where Coney lived; I afterwards accompanied them to where he lived, and to the public-house in Clare-market, where he was apprehended, and then went with them to No. 47, Red Lion-street.</p>

             re-examined. I went to a house in Great Mitchell-street with Smith; I waited outside while he went in; it was before the robbery - I have been there with him several times, and he told me the property was to be taken there - it is at the corner of Brick-lane, and a grocer's shop; the last time I went there with Smith, he said, "Mr. Wheeler little thinks that some of his prime stuff is coming here."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it for fear you have not done mischief enough to Smith that you add that, without being asked? A. No; Smith is fifteen years old - I should not have done this, if I had not been frightened at being muzzled or scragged - I was afraid of their threatening; I was not so much afraid at the beginning as at last - I never was with them in any robbery, not with Coney; I am sorry to say I have committed a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us how long it is since you began? A. I do not know - it is about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. I should not be surprised if you do not say it was Smith brought you into all the robberies? A. He did into this; I have done wrong things three years ago, and have been robbing at different times - I once took 1s. from my father; I stole it - I have taken some books from him, and have taken halfpence several times; I do not remember taking any thing particular of my mother's; I have stolen things from her three or four times, but do not remember what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it because you repented of this that you told? A. It was, Sir, I assure you; I was afraid something would happen to me if I did not tell - it was through fear and repentance both; I was afraid of being taken up - I have been in the infirmary at the Compter ever since this.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said a great many things here which you did not state at the Mansion-house? A. I was not questioned so much then; I was sworn to tell the whole truth; what I said was taken down in writing - I do not remember whether I said there, that Smith kept the key to prevent my father seeing it; I do not think I did - nobody has refreshed my memory in the prison; I have seen Mr. Wheeler there, and my father and mother - I did not state at the Mansion-house about leaving their tools there to show it had been done by the profession - that is the expression they used; I forgot to state it - I did not say that Cook said he would muzzle me, because I was not asked, nor that the tall man was to stop at the kitchen door, but Mr. Wheeler has all that in writing - I did not mention their asking me to poison the dog, nor about the barker, nor about Coney mending the socks, that I recollect; I was not so long at the Mansion-house as I have been here - I was about a quarter of an hour being examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not at least two hours? A. I do not remember how long it was - when my father found the soap-box he was searching for a little key; he asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140010"></xptr>for it; I said I knew nothing about it - I was not so intimate with Smith while at Boyd's as I was afterwards; he never came to see me there - I stole a knife from Boyd once, and some halfpence several times; I do not recollect any thing else that I did there - I pledged my own watch while there; my father had given it to me - I do not think I pawned any thing belonging to the family; I will not swear I did or did not, for I do not remember - I pawned my watch at Mr. Cotterel's, in Oxford-street; I pawned several of my own books in Gray's Inn-lane - I swear I did not pawn any of Mr. Boyd's books there, nor of any of the family; I never pawned any thing belonging to the family - I had several of his young man's books, and pawned them; I had bought them of his young man; I had exchanged with him - I got the money from my father to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pawn any which you had neither bought nor exchanged? A. Not to my knowledge, I do not remember - I have sold some of my father's books; I do not remember pawning Mr. Boyd's young man's books opposite Gray's Inn-lane; I cannot swear I did not - I do not remember doing any thing else wrong in Mr. Boyd's service; I might have taken a penny or so, but cannot remember - there was a printed circular came; I opened it, as I found it was printed - Mr. Boyd found it in my pocket very soon after; I should have given it to him, or laid it on the counter for him - he searched my pockets before I went away, and found it; he turned me away for quarrelling with the young man, not for stealing - I had one of his young man's books which I had bought of him; I remember I did pawn one which did not belong to me, that was the Mirror - I forgot that before; I pawned the Casket - I took 3s. 6d. from Mr. Wheeler, and 1s. before, and I robbed him of some medals, that is all to my knowledge - I robbed him of some paper, and sold it at 3d. a lb. by Smith's persuasion; Smith did not persuade me to the other robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever rob him of any ear-rings? A. If you will give me time I will tell you the truth; I have not robbed Mr. Wheeler of ear-rings - I do not think I robbed any body of ear-rings; I cannot remember every thing - I do not remember the ear-rings; if I did steal them I would own it directly - I might have stolen them, but do not remember; I have lived at Mr. Statham's, a tailor, Mr. Foot, a surgeon, and Mr. Boyd - I left Mr. Foot because I did not like the place; I took nothing from there, nor at any place except Wheeler's and Boyd's - I never picked a pocket in Smithfield; I left the prosecutor's door open for the party to go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea who 
               <persName id="t18330214-1-person127">drew</persName>
             the bolt inside? A. No, nor who put the stool by the door - there was no other boy in the house but my little brother, who is seven or eight years old; he slept with his mother - I can reach the bolt without a stool; Mr. Wheeler did not threaten to send me to gaol before I told of this - he advised me to make a confession: I suppose he suspected me by my being had before - I refused the impression of the key of the iron chest; they asked what was in the drawers - I said silver goods.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You was intimate with Smith, and told him from time to time what had been done? A. Yes; I do not recollect telling him I had taken 3s. 6d. from Mr. Wheeler.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutor. On the Monday morning after the robbery, about eleven o'clock, I was called from the kitchen, went into the passage, and saw the prisoner Smith- I asked him what his business was; he said he wished to see Josh, by which name Joshua James goes - I asked what he wanted to see him for; he said he had an appointment to go with him to look after a situation; I asked him when he saw Josh last - he said Saturday afternoon; on the following morning Smith was examined by Mr. Wheeler, and I heard him tell Mr. Wheeler that he had met Josh on the Sunday, near the pump in Aylesbury-street; I think he said it was between four and five o'clock - I reminded him that on the previous morning he had told me he had not seen him since the Saturday; he said it must have been a mistake; after the robbery was discovered young James was kept separate from every body, until he told his story I believe - he was not allowed to leave the house. On the Saturday previous to the robbery two men came to me in the warehouse, in the afternoon or evening - one of them was about Coney's sizeand appearance, but he had a great coat on; they came about getting a job done - no other person came about a job that day; they did not explain what the job was - I do not know what reply I made; the person said he had been recommended to us - I declined the job, and told them to go to some of the shops in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Smith said he had seen Josh last on Saturday afternoon? A. Yes, when he was talking to me - he said he came by appointment to go to look after a situation; he did not say he had been with him for the same purpose on Saturday.</p>

            - I think I know this Forget Me Not; I remember my son lending me such a book - I believe it to be the book he lent me; it had a cover to it like this - it is about a fortnight since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you where he got it? A. No, he said it was lent to him - I would depend on his word in such a case as that; he has occasionally taken little things from me.</p>
               <p>Coney's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I now stand before you charged with the commission of an offence which seriously aims at my life; but from the evidence you have heard this day, I hope you will be convinced that no reliance can be placed on the word of the boy James: Will you, Gentlemen of the Jury, doom me to forfeit this existence on the word of a boy who in connected with the worst of characters, and who has been away from his parents at all hours of the night? can it be doubted that he would not be guilty of asserting any thing, and screeming the actual perpretrators of this robbery, and place it on an innocent man's shoulders? Then Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will, by your verdict this day, restore my character unstained as you have heard this day it was, previous to this charge.</p>
               <p>Smith. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Seven witnesses gave Smith a good character, and three deposed the same for Coney.</p>

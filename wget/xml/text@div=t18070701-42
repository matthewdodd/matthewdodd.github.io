               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to feel in your pocket between Kingsland and St. Paul's church yard. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you felt in your pocket book, and perceived your pocket book safe in it. A. When I was rather beyond the church door in St. Paul's church yard I felt in my pocket, it was safe then. When I got rather beyond the print shop, the two elder ones of the prisoners they were very troublesome to me indeed; the tallest one was as close to me as she could; I had a young woman with me, she separated me from her; I do not say that they robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the shorter of the two elderly women. - A. She was before me; the taller of the two was very troublesome indeed with pushing me about.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many people very near to you. - A. Yes, but they were not troublesome, they appeared to be in company together, the tall one and the shorter. When I first went into St. Paul's church yard they seemed to select me out to push me about; they were one before me and the other behind me, and both of them were near enough to touch me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the tall woman then. - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pushing at all violent. - A. Particularly the tall one; I pushed her off from me as the crowd were about; I was a good deal pushed about; when I came to Ludgate Hill I went into a friend's; then I found I had lost my pocket book and the note. On the next day I saw my book before the lord mayor; the book and the note were together, and they all three were in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at all catch sight of Mrs. Winter at this time. - A. I did not; all at once they all three took a start, and went through London House yard into Pater-noster-row; I told Hart to come along, they had got something; in Pater-noster-row I laid hold of

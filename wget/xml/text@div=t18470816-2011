The prisoner was indicted, but not tried at the July Sessions—I took her into custody, on the 21st of July, on this charge, and I told her she was charged on an indictment, and a true bill had been returned at this Court for cutting and wounding George Trussell, at a house of ill fame in waterloo-road—she stated that she was in bed at the time, that she was tipsy, and heard Mary Ann Williams scream, "Murder!" and she ran down stair, and saw the prosecutor in the act of striking at Mary Ann with a poker; that she wrenched it from him, and took it away, but she never struck him with it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a labouring man, and live in Mint-street in the Borough. On Wednesday evening, the 9th of June, I was in St. Andrew's-terrace, near the Waterloo-road—I went to the house No.5, St. Andrew's-terrace, with Mary Ann Williams—she took a half-crown out of my pocket, and went up stair—I followed her—she came down again—I had a quarrel with her about it—the prisoner came down with her, and struck me over the head with poker—Williams tried to turn me out—I had not done anything to the prisoner before she struck me—the blow stunned me—I bled—when I recovered myself I was outside the house, on the povement—the doctor and two policemen were with me—I was taken to the hospital—it was about a fortnight before I was able to do any work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have made your appearance here twice before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I indicted Williams for stealing a half-crown; she was acquitted—I did not charged her with wounding me on the head—she struck me over the knees—she was found not guilty on both occasion—I swore she took the half-crown out of my pocket, and I saw it in her hand and tried to get it back and she would not give it me—I had been drinking a little before I went to the house—it was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—I had spent about a shilling in beer and spirit before I went—I then sent for sixpenny-worth of gin when I was in the house—I had then a half-crown, two shilling, and one sixpence—I did not break open the parlour-door—I did not my I would break all the crockery—they said the next day that I broken the image on the mental-piece, and they were broken—I was in danger of my life—when the prisoner came down I was not flourishing a poker in front of the pier-glass—I did not strike Williams with that poker—the prisoner did not wrest the poker out of my hand—I did not say one ward about the half<lb></lb>crown before they said I broke the image—this was in broad day-light, and in a street which the policeman pass up and down—I have not been to the prisoner's mother, and told her if she would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I would not appear, and if she did not I would try to transport her daughter—I did not offer to take 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—her mother did not say she was too poor to give it me—the parties who kept the house sent for me—I cannot say whether I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner mother—I might see several people—I did not offer to take 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman L</hi> 58.) On the afternoon of the 9th of June I was called to St. Andrew's-terrace, Waterloo-road, and saw Trussell outside No. 5, in a chain, and bleeding very much from a wound on his head—he was insensible—a surgeon was sent for, and after some time he came to himself—I brought some women from the house No.5—the prisoner was not one of them, she made her escape from the back of the house before I was let in—she was not produced before the prosecutor that day at all.</p>

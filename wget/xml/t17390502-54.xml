            . On the 8th of April, a little before Twelve at Night, I was robbed as I was coming through a Court near Knaves-acre, of a Silver Watch, a Pair of Silver Shoe-buckles, a Stock-buckle, and some Money, but I can't tell what it was, for I was pretty full of Liquor. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173905020019"></xptr> can't be positive who robb'd me, but I know I was assaulted by three or four Persons, and I believe the Prisoner was not one of them that robb'd me, - I believe he was the Man that came up to assist me; but the Thief-takers have told me, that if I would swear his Life away, I should have a Share of the Reward. Some of them deserve Hanging more by half than the Prisoner.</p>

Hanks said, yes; then d - mn my Blood, says the Prisoner, I have a good Mind to cut them off, and before I leave him I will have his Scout, (his Watch); then he asked me, whether I would consent for him to take it? I said, - No, don't take it here, it will bring the People of the Cellar into Trouble; take it when he goes up Stairs; so we went up with Hanks into a Court, and there a Man in a brown Coat quarrelled with him, and afterward left him: Then the Prisoner came up, and knock'd Hanks down; I took his Shoe-buckles, he took his Watch, and Martha Jones took his Stock-buckle, and 3 s. and 2 d. in Money. I happen'd to speak of this Robbery next Morning, and the Thief-takers got hold of it, and it run like a Hue and Cry through a Town. The Robbery was done on the Sunday, and I gave my Information on Monday.</p>

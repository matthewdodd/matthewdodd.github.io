                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Yates, and lodge in Artil<lb></lb>lery-terrace, Brewer's-green, Westminster, in the house of William Simons. The prisoner Thompson is my nephew—on the 8th of February he came there to see me, about half-past one o'clock in the day—he stopped, I suppose, half an hour or three quarters—I did net leave the room while he was there—I went to the door to clear the dinner things from the table after he had had his dinner—my back was then towards him for a minute or more—it was sufficient time for him to take the watch off the hook—I missed the watch five or ten minutes after he was gone—it hung up in a small recess by the side of the mantel-piece, within half a yard of where he was sitting—it was there when he came in, for I looked to see the time while he was eating his dinner—it then wanted a quarter to two—it was a gold watch, worth eight guineas, and was my husband's—I gave in<lb></lb>formation to Drake, the officer, and saw the prisoner in custody about half-past two or three o'clock the same day, with a boy named Forster—nothing was said to induce him to confess—he said that a boy who had</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Mrs. Yates spoke to me about three o'clock on the 8th of February—from her description I apprehended Thompson, and Forster, being in company with him at the time, I took him—I asked Thompson what he had done with his aunt's watch—he said Forster asked him to let him look at the watch, and when he showed it to him, Forster handed it to another boy, who ran away with it—Forster said in Thompson's hearing, that the other boy's name was Smith—I took them both to the station, searched them, and found on Thompson this small knife—the prosecutrix was there, and claimed it—I found nothing on Forster—before we went to the station, Forster said Thompson had told him he found the watch wrapped up in three or four pieces of paper—I went in search of Smith, and on the 18th, found him on board the Marine Society's ship at Deptford—I apprehended Cairncross in cones<lb></lb>quence of a description Smith gave me, and took him to the station-Smith was there at the time, and immediately said he was the man who went with him to sell the watch—he said be first met Cairncross near Westminster-abbey, and he told him he had got a watch that the boy had taken from his aunt—Cairncross told him he could sell it at the Blue Potts pub<lb></lb>lic-house in Monmouth-street—that they went there, and when they got to the door of the Blue Posts, Cairncross told him to stop outside—that Cairncross went into a back room behind the counter, and after he had been there a short time, he brought him something to drink at the door, and told him he could get but—I for the watch; and he saw the landlady of the public-house pay some money to Cairncross, and the landlord was standing by at the time—he said he brought him out 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said be should keep 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. himself for selling the watch—he said, they then went from there to a public-house at Westminster, and he had more drink there, and after that he did not recollect what happened; and when be got home, he himself had no money at all—Cairncross was present, and heard all this, and he denied all Smith stated—the landlord is not here—I have been to the Blue Posts several times to look for him, but have never found him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hyde-place, Vincent-square, Westminster. On the evening of the 7th of February, I was with Forster, at Lambeth-Thompson came up to us, and asked whether we could get a lodging for him—we could not, and we all three staid out of doors all night, together—next day we all three came to Westminster together—Thompson left us about half-past one o'clock, saying he was going to see his aunt, and be told us to stop outside—he came out of his aunt's house, and showed us a gold watch which he said he had picked up, wrapped in three or four pieces of paper—we then went to Catherine-street—Thompson gave the watch to Forster, who gave it to me, and I ran away with it when I got round into Dean-street—I afterwards looked for Forster, but could not find him—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030091"></xptr>
               <p>I went through Dean's yard, and just as I came by the tide of Westmin<lb></lb>ster-abbey, I taw Cairncross—I told him another boy had stolen a watch from a room, and I had run away from him with it, and I asked him if be could sell it—he told me he could, at the Blue Posts, in Monmouth-street—we went there—when we got to the door he told me to stop outside while he went in and sold it—he went into the back parlour—he came out, and said be could not get but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he went back, and said he would take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the landlady pay him, on the counter—he gave me some drink at first, and when he came out he gave me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he should keep 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for selling the watch—we then went to the Feathers, in Broadway, Westminster, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and had drink there—I went home to my mother's that night, and next morning, when I got up, I had no money—I knew Cairncross before—I had frequently seen him at the Westminster theatre—I first knew him there about two or three months ago.</p>

"No more"—Ellen Mara paid for the gin with 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and they went away—a biscuit baker came in. afterwards, and my wife went to the till; she gave me the bad shillings out—I went to the Castle, at Harrow, which is about a mile and three quarters from my house—I found the four prisoners there, and gave them into custody—I gave the shillings to the policeman.</p>

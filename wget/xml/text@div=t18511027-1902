               <p>was formerly in the medal-department of the Admiralty—at the latter end of Dec. I was in Hyde-park, near the Crystal-palace, and met the prisoner—I had known him some years before, at Cheltenham—he was one of the classical masters at the Proprietary College there, when I was a pupil—he asked me what I was doing—I told him I had a temporary situation in the Admiralty, at Whitehall, but that as the business I was engaged in would be very soon concluded I had some thoughts of going into a profession—he told me he was a barrister of the Middle Temple, that he had chambers in the Temple, and he lived in Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square—I said, "I have some thoughts of going to the bar, and perhaps, as you are a barrister, you will be good enough to give me some information about the expense, and so on"—he said if I would call on him in the course of a few days, at his lodging, he would give me every information—after a few days I called at his lodging—he then said that it would require a sum of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to enter me in the Temple—he also said that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be required as caution-money—I objected to that, because I said I had been educated at Oxford, and had left the University with my college testimonial, and I thought they ought not to require that caution-money—I said the matter required some consideration, and I would consider over it—some days afterwards I called on him again; that was on 10th Jan.—I told him I had made up my mind to become a student, and that I should be prepared with the money next day—I went on the 11th and sold out some stock, and on the 16th got the money—I gave the prisoner 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and went with him to the Temple—I waited for him at Prosser's oyster-shop, in Fleet-street, while he went to the treasurer's—he came back in about half an hour, and said he had paid—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I got from him some days afterwards, not then—he gave me a receipt then, which I returned to him, as I was not satisfied with it, because it was not stamped—he gave me this about ten days after—he said, "This is the receipt"—I said, "It is a very strange kind of receipt; they must do business in a very odd way in the Temple"—he said the treasurer was a very careless sort of fellow, and many complaints bad been made of him; "in fact," he said, "he indulges rather freely"—I did not make any inquiry at the Temple on this subject until Aug.—I was taken very ill, and went to Brighton, where I remained some time—then I went to stay with a friend—the receipt purports to be signed "W." or "H. Compton"—the prisoner told me that Mr. Compton was treasurer of the Middle Temple—I have looked at this receipt—I have seen the prisoner write on two occasions—my belief is that this is his writing—Messrs. Knight, Son, and Reeves, were the brokers from whom I received the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes.</p>

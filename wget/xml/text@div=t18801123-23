                  </hi>. I keep a public-house at 10, Swan Street, Minories—on the afternoon of Saturday, 13th November, the prisoner came into my house with four or five companions; I would not serve him—I said to them "You had better take him away, I don't want a bother, get him away quietly; I shall serve none of you any more"—they went out—a quarter of an hour afterwards two bricks came through Che window, breaking two panes of plate glass worth about 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the glass, including the door, having cost me 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 732). The prisoner was given into my custody—I charged him with breaking two glass panes of a window—two bricks were handed to me over the counter at the same time—the prisoner said "I did not do it"—he pretended to be drunk—on the way to the station he broke loose, but after a chase for a quarter of an hour we caught him again.</p>

I live at 112, Old Montagu Street, Whitechapel—I was in this public-house on 13th November—when I came out the prisoner was looking towards me, which caused me to look at him—I saw either two bricks or two stones in his hand—that was about 5.80 p.m—I went in the house again, and had not been there more than three or four minutes before two bricks came through the window—I ran out—I saw the prisoner going a few paces away, and the boy who is here said "That is the man who has done it"—I ran and got hold of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Somerset Court, Mansell Street—I saw the prisoner standing outside this public-house on 13th November—he pulled two bricks from under his coat that he had under his arm and dashed them through the window—he then ran away—when Harrison came out I said "There goes the man," and he ran and caught hold of him.</p>

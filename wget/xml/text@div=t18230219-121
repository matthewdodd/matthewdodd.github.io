            . On the 15th of February, I was going into Chafer's-place, Burton-street, and saw the prisoner with two quart pots under his apron - he went down the steps, took his apron off, and wrapped them up in it; I took him - he said he was going to take them home; he threw them down, and said, that was were he had them from. I secured him - he said, that he heard a man crying pots, and was going to see if they were his.</p>

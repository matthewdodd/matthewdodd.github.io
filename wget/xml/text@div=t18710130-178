                  </hi>. I live at 21, Lisle Street, and am a mason—I have known Machler three years—on 10th September I saw him at a coffee-shop in Little Newport Street—he offered me some tickets in a German lottery, and I took two, and paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said it was a lottery that would be drawn on 30th December, and that he disposed of the tickets on commission. (<hi rend="italic">Ticket read:</hi> "For the wounded German soldiers and relatives of the dead, the holder of this ticket to receive the prize that may fall on it; price 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The committee was here set out</hi>); the drawing includes about 500 splendid old paintings, about 100 clocks, and other works of art. The drawing will take place in public, in the presence of the whole committee, on 30th December. The smallest prize is worth more than the value of the ticket.") I asked him about the com<lb></lb>mittee, if he knew the names signed on the tickets, and the said "Yes, they are merchants in the City"—the next day he asked me If would like</p>

               <p>to take some more—that was at the same cafe, in Newport Street—I took four more, and paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards saw him again, and asked him for some more tickets, as several friends of mine wished to take tickets on behalf of the benefit—I took sixteen tickets, altogether—I paid him for them, and this is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him several times before the last payment, on 10th September—nearly every day at the same cafe—I said nothing to him with reference to the matter, till the month of December, when I asked him to show me the prospectus of the drawing—he said "You shall have a prospectus, but the committee intend to have the patronage of the royal family in Germany, and after that I will give you a prospectus "—I told him I should like to make inquiry about it, and speak to one of the gentlemen whose name was on the tickets; I said it was very suspicious to me that a short time before the drawing they should draw a prospectus; and if they had not the prospectus a long time before, how could they alter the tickets—I made some inquiries about some of the names, and I then told him I had been to the German newspaper office, and I had heard there the gentleman had left the place; and that I had been to see Mr. Felsenthall, but I could not find him at all; and I said I was not satisfied with the inquiries—I told him I had left a letter at Mr. Felsenthall's office, and I expected an answer—he said "Well, it will be all right," and the next day I saw Lewtner—when I told Machler I was not satisfied he said "You will have your money back; and if the committee will not give you back the money, I will"—that was about the 26th or 27th December—I told him I had been inquiring about these gentlemen, and I was not satisfied, because the day for the drawing would be in a few days, and I would be obliged to go to the Police Court to make a charge against the committee—he told me I could do what I liked—he said "I am not con<lb></lb>cerned, I only have the tickets, and sell them on commission; and if you are not satisfied, I will repay you, if the committee will not"—I did not know Lewtner when I first bought the tickets—I saw him the day after I had been to Mr. Felsenthall's office, in the beginning of December, at the cafe in Little Newport Street—he said to me "Are you Mr. Eberwein?" and I said "Yes "—he said he had come from Mr. Felsenthall, to make arrange<lb></lb>ments with me about the tickets I had—I told him I should like to have my money back—he said "Well, you can have your money back if you like; but the drawing will be in February; the committee intend to change the tickets, and have a portrait of Bismarck on one side, and the Crown Prince of Prussia on the other "—I refused to have the tickets, and he asked me to meet him on 22nd December, and he would bring me half the amount of the tickets—I did not see him then, he did not come, and he wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "To Edward Eberwein. 23rd December, 1870. I returned this morning about 11 o'clock, and found my little boy not very well. I could not call before Monday morning; perhaps I will call on Sunday." I saw him soon after that; but I never got my money—I saw him nearly every night, at the Queen's Theatre, where he came and annoyed me about it—this is the post-card, making the first appointment at the Queen's Theatre (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

Cattins'; it was not done with my authority—I never authorized them to advertise in any newspaper about this matter—I did not see Mr. Eberwein—Lewtner never gave me any money for the tickets.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I consider myself a respectable man—I was associated with Mr. De Haas, Mr. Gilbart, and Mr. Meyers, whose names were on the tickets—when Lewtner returned the fifty-six tickets, he said the others would be returned, but that he had given thirty-five or thirty-six to Dr. Machler, to sell on commission, and he was trying to get them back—I wrote a letter to Count Bismarck, and after the reply to my letter, I said I would have nothing to do with the lottery—I paid for the printing of the tickets—I sold fifteen tickets to different persons—when I saw Lewtner I said I would not sell any more tickets before we had permission and authority and answers to those letters from the Prussian Embassy.</p>

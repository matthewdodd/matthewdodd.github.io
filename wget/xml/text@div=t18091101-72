               <p>Q. I understand there is a benefit society held in your house. - A. Yes, of portable desk makers and cabinet small workers, it is called the Amicable Society: the club box was kept in a room adjoining the club room, the prisoner lodged on the same floor in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys were there to this box. - A.Three, they were kept by the two stewards and the president.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the club held for the last time previous to the loss. - A. October the 4th, the club was held. On Monday morning, about ten o'clock, I heard an alarm of the box being broken open. I went to the room where the box was and found this box broken open at the bottom. I informed the members of the society, they came and made a search. They found the box broken open at the bottom,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010042"></xptr>and twenty-seven pounds, four shillings, and eight-pence half-penny, were taken out, and a quantity of books; upon discovering the loss one of the members had the prisoner taken up. I was present he was taken in his own room. The drawer was found in his room. The prisoner said a man gave him the drawer in the back yard to mend, on Saturday night, and the same man had some books under his arm; and a partition of the box was found in the prisoner's tool chest. On Saturday night I could not get into the room where the club box was, I bursted the door open, about a quarter of an hour after that I went into the room again; I found the key in the door, then nobody else had gone up but one of my maids.</p>
               <p>Q. From the situation of the prisoner's room could he have gone into that room. - A. Yes, his door is not half a yard from the door of that room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not there company in the room on Saturday night. - A. Yes, that was after the key was lost.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PARE. I am one of the stewards of the Amicable Society of small workers and desk makers. The society was held at Mr. Pridley's, our club box was kept there. On Wednesday the 4th of October, I was officiating for my brother steward, I had two keys and Mr. Gaze, had the other, I locked two of the locks, and he or I locked the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing the matter with the box at that time. - A. No to the best of my knowledge there was not, if the bottom had been broken open at the bottom, the drawer would have fallen out. The contents of the box was twenty-one pound bank notes, and there were the books of the society, near forty, the notes were placed in one of the drawers on the Wednesday. On the Monday I was called upon by one of the members, the box was broken at the bottom and all the notes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. The money in that box was the property of all you members. - A. Yes, the stewards and president are answerable for it. When I came there on the Monday, I saw some books and bank notes taken out of the privy, the notes we have recovered as far as sixteen of the number of the notes.</p>

I assisted in finding the books in the necessary; we got sixteen of the notes out of the twenty, the notes were secreted in the books: not knowing the notes were in them they were throwed down the necessary. The hard cash to the amount of seven pound was all gone except the half-pence, these are the sixteen one pound notes.</p>

            . I am a constable. I searched the prisoner's apartment, I found this drawer; he said a man had given it him in the back yard to repair on the Saturday night before. I fitted it to the box, it corresponded. I took him in custody; he said the man that gave him the box had a number of books in his hand; he said that he would call for the drawer on Monday; the prisoner said he told the man he did not see it wanted any repair. I told him as a workman he must see it wanted repair. I took him to the watch-house and searched him. I found all these pieces they appear to be part of the bottom of the chest, the bottom of this chest was covered with green baize, here is a mark of green baize on this slip.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury, the evidence that has come before you, I hope you will not think fit to convict a man of felony. On Saturday night, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I went out at the back door to case myself, and on my going up again I met a man, who had a drawer in his hand and some books under his arm; the stair case being so dark I could not see what they were, it is a great misfortune to me gentlemen, as you are not able to see the stair-case; and there are several lodgers in the house as well as me, and the door is always open which makes the stair-case almost public to any one; that person asked me if I was a cabinet maker and lodged in the second floor? I said no, I was a cabinet maker and lodged in the first floor; he asked me to mend the drawer; I took it up in my room and found it did not want mending. My wife informed me on the Monday morning, that the club room box was broken open. They searched my room all over and found nothing there. They took me to the office and searched me, and my wife was at the office, they went and broke open my door and brought out boards, which I am sure were not in the room before</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Affidavit read:</hi> "In the Queen's Bench, between Samuel Kennard, plaintiff, and Frederick Johnson, defendant; Frederick Johnson, of No. 15, High-street, Bow, in the county of Middlesex, baker, maketh oath, and saith, that in the month of June, 1853, he was induced by the above named plaintiff to take the lease of the house, No. 15, High-street, Bow, aforesaid, from a Mr. Volkman, to be opened as a baker's shop, and as an inducement to this deponent to accede to his wishes, the deponent having represented to the said plaintiff that he was destitute of capital, the said plaintiff promised to advance money to enable him to take the said house and purchase stock for the purpose of commenc<lb></lb>ing business there, and that the deponent should pay interest at the rate of five per cent. per annum, upon such sum as he the said plaintiff should ad<lb></lb>vance; but that no interest should become payable until after this deponent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180010"></xptr>
               <p>had been in possession of the said house for twelve months, and that the amount of principal which he should ultimately advance should be paid by instalments. And this deponent, upon the faith of this promise, applied to the said Mr. Volkman to grant him a lease of the said premises, which he consented to do; and upon informing the said plaintiff thereof, he desired this deponent to request the said Mr. Volkman to let the draft of the said lease be sent to Messrs. Turner and Sons, of Mount-place, Whitechapel-road, the solicitors of the said plaintiff, for perusal on behalf of this depo<lb></lb>nent; and this deponent at that time believing the said plaintiff to be his friend, complied with his instructions in that respect, although the said Messrs. Turner and Sons were wholly unknown to this deponent. And this deponent further saith, that sometime in the same month of June, he was sent for by the said plaintiff to his house, and was then for the first time introduced to one of the said Mr. Turners, who produced the said lease, and counterpart, and proceeded to read over and explain the said lease, and requested this deponent to execute the said counterpart; and having so done, the said plaintiff took possession of the said lease, and has kept it ever since. And this deponent further saith, that on or about 16th Sept., in the year aforesaid, this deponent was suddenly sent for to the private residence of the said Messrs. Turner and Sons, Cockburn-road, Mile End-road, when he was informed that they had prepared a warrant of attorney between him, this deponent, and the said plaintiff, as a security to him for the sum of 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which it was then alleged that he had advanced to, and paid for this deponent. And this deponent was informed by the said Messrs. Tur<lb></lb>ner, that it was a mere matter of form between him, the deponent, and the said plaintiff. And this deponent further saith, that he had no attorney present attending on his behalf, to explain to him the nature of the warrant of attorney he was called upon to execute, and attest his execution thereof; nor did the said Mr. Turner, nor either of his sons, propose his calling in any professional gentleman for that purpose, or even ask this deponent if he was willing that either of them should act for him in that capacity; but Mr. Turner, jun., at once proceeded to read over the warrant of attorney, when this deponent discovered that by the defeasance to the said warrant of attorney, the money which the plaintiff had advanced to him was made pay<lb></lb>able on demand; and this deponent remarked, that was contrary to the arrangement between him and the said plaintiff, when the said Mr. Turner, jun., replied that it would be all right, and that it was a mere matter of form between him, this deponent, and the said plaintiff, to prevent any other creditors taking precedence of the said plaintiff, or words to that effect; and having done so, placed it before this deponent for execution, and having executed the same according to the direction of the said Mr. Turner, jun., he signed his name as a witness attesting the execution of the said warrant of attorney by this deponent, to which this deponent did not object, being at the time ignorant that it was improper and illegal for one of the plain<lb></lb>tiff's attorneys to act on this deponent's behalf. And this deponent further saith, that on Saturday, the 3rd day of June last, he was served by the same Mr. Turner, who attested the warrant of attorney, with a notice demanding immediate payment of the sum of 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a true copy whereof is hereunto annexed; upon receiving which this deponent went to the plaintiff, and remon<lb></lb>strated with him on his sending such a sudden demand, so entirely at vari<lb></lb>ance with the understanding between them; when the plaintiff replied, that he wanted his money, and if it was not immediately paid he, this deponent, would have an execution in his house within an hour; but this deponent at length</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180011"></xptr>
               <p>prevailed on the said plaintiff to wait until Monday, the 5th day of June, in order that he might try if he could raise the money to pay him; but this deponent was in the mean time privately informed that as soon as he opened his house on Monday morning, a Sheriff's officer would enter with an execu<lb></lb>tion; and this deponent, in consequence of such information, kept his house closed, and on Tuesday, the 6th day of June, the plaintiff, accompanied by two other persons, carrying a ladder, came to this deponent's house, and placing the ladder against it, attempted to get in at the windows of the first floor, but as they were fastened, one of the persons, named William Suffolk, broke a square of glass in one of the windows, and forced out the sash bead<lb></lb>ing, and three persons acting under the direction of the said plaintiff, entered the room, and finding the door of the said room, leading to the interior of the house, also fastened, they broke that open and descended to the lower part of the house, and let in the Sheriff's officer; and on the 8th day of June, the whole of this deponent's goods were sold in a most reckless man<lb></lb>ner by a broker employed by the Sheriff's officer, and were sacrificed at less than half their value. And this deponent further saith, that it was not until recently that he became aware that he had any ground for objecting to the said warrant of attorney, or he should have made an earlier applica<lb></lb>tion. Frederick Johnson. Sworn at the Judges' Chambers, in Rolls-gar<lb></lb>dens, Chancery-lane, this 19th of July, 1854, before me, W. G. Cooper, Com<lb></lb>missioner.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, carrying on business at No. 8. Mount-place, Whitechapel-road. I have two sons, who are attorneys—neither of them are in partnership with me; they are my clerks—I have a client named Samuel Kennard, the prosecutor of this indictment—in Sept. last I received instruction from him to prepare a warrant of attorney—I think I received them the latter part of the prior month, but the warrant was prepared on 16th Sept, 1853, to secure a sum of 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—on 16th Sept. this warrant was executed in my presence, at my pri<lb></lb>vate residence, about 7 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came to my house, and Mr. Kennard came with him—MR. Kennard came to complete a purchase of some freehold land, and he brought the prisoner with him at the same time to execute the warrant of attorney—when they came to my house I told Johnson that it was absolutely necessary that he should have an attorney present on his behalf to explain the nature of the instrument to him, and to attest his execution of it—he said that he did not know any attorney—I said, "There are attorneys in Bow; there will be no difficulty in procuring the attendance of a gentleman for you, and if you please my son George shall go with you to an attorney—he said he did not know any attorney in Bow—I said, "There is Mr. Ellis, the vestry clerk, and Mr. Goddard, living close by; there is no doubt we can get the attendance of one of those gentlemen"-—he said he had not employed any attorney, and he had rather not—I told him my son George was an attorney, and if he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180012"></xptr>
               <p>chose to employ him he might, but it was a matter of his own choice and will—he said he should be very glad for him to do so—my son was then sent for—he came into the room where Johnson, Mr. Kennard, and myself were present—I said, "George, Mr. Johnson wants you to attest a warrant of attorney for him"—I left the room—I afterwards returned, and the defendant executed the warrant in my presence—my son acted as his attorney on that occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true, as here stated in this affidavit, "And this deponent was informed by the said Messrs. Turner that it was a mere matter of form between him, the deponent, and the said plaintiff?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No such thing was said by my son in my presence, or by any one else.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this true, "Nor did the said Mr. Turner nor either of his sons pro<lb></lb>pose his calling in any professional gentleman for that purpose, or even ask this deponent if he was willing that either of them should act for him in that capacity?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not true; my son was called in at his request, and he did act for him—I have been in the profession very nearly forty years—since this act of Parliament has been passed, I should think I have been present at the attestation of nearly 100 warrants of attorney—I never allow any person to execute a warrant of attorney without having an attorney present—I cannot say that I know the hand writing of the defend<lb></lb>ant, except by comparison—I never saw him write, except on that occasion—execution was not issued on this warrant till June this year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and reside at Bow. I know the defendant—in the course of last year I advanced him 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the pur<lb></lb>pose of his entering into business as a baker—I did not grant him a lease of any shop—I went with him to my solicitor, the last witness, to execute a warrant of attorney—when we got there we saw Mr. Turner—we went into his back parlour, and he said it was necessary for Mr. Johnson to have an attorney to act on his behalf before this warrant of attorney could be com<lb></lb>pleted—I heard him say that, and Mr. Johnson said he knew no attorney—MR. Turner said there were attorneys living in Bow, and if he thought proper his son should accompany him to one of them—I do not recollect the names he mentioned—MR. Johnson said he knew no one, and he had no wish for anything of that kind—MR. Turner said his son was an attorney, and if Mr. Johnson thought proper to nominate him, he could act for him as his attorney—he used the words that it must be with his free will and consent—MR. Johnson was quite satisfied with George Turner's acting for him, and he was called into the room—MR. George Turner told him it was necessary for him to have an attorney, and he commenced reading the war<lb></lb>rant of attorney—he read over the whole of it—I am quite sure of that—and the defeasance was read also—there was something read about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180013"></xptr>
               <p>Mr. Johnson said he did not owe 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—MR. Turner explained to him that it was to secure me if I lent him more money—I saw him execute the war<lb></lb>rant—this is his signature to it, and this signature to the affidavit is his—I am quite sure that young Mr. Turner did explain the warrant to him, and Johnson made the observation that I could come and take every thing—I said yes, of course I ought, because I had advanced the money—he said, "After this the shop will be mine," and I said, "Yes"—I was present when this affidavit was used at the Judges' Chambers, when the discussion took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Turner or his son say it was a mere matter of form between you and Johnson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he had an attorney present on his behalf—when he states he had not an attorney it is untrue—when he states that neither Mr. Turner nor his sons proposed sending for any professional gentleman, that is not true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was your connection with this shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had taken the shop—Mrs. Brown had kept it—the prisoner had been in her employ—I took the shop for my brother, and then some circumstances arose that I did not wish my brother should take it, and I agreed that the defendant should take it—he did not take some time to consider whether he would take it or no—he was in a good situation before—I might say that I would rather pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than my brother should have it—the defendant did not take time to consider of it—I said, "I believe you had an idea of taking the shop of Mrs. Brown"—he said, "Yes; but I have no means"—I said, "We could get the means"—he said, "Could you lend me the money?"—it was the beginning of last year that the arrangement was made for me to advance the money—I think it must have been about June—it was in September that the application was made for the warrant of attorney—the money had then been advanced three or four months, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not a part of the stipulation between you and this man when the money was advanced that no interest should be paid till he had been twelve months in possession, to see how the business went on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said every pound would be of consequence to him, and I would not say anything about interest till he had been twelve months—I told him when the money was advanced that he might pay the principal by instalments, and in Sep<lb></lb>tember I took him to my own attorney's private house to get him to sign a warrant of attorney, and I believe it was in June I carried the warrant of attorney into effect, and seized on the man's property and effects—the argument I used when he said he did not owe so much money was, that I ought to be secured in preference to the other creditors because I advanced him the money—I think he has been carrying on business altogether about nine months—I believe the twelve months did not transpire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

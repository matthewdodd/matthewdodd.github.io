                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was there about Thornhill that divested you of all suspicion, if you knew nothing about him?—what benefit does Government get in taking a bond, if they get it from two people of straw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot help that—the Act of Parliament gives roe no option at all—I am bound to take them as the exporter and shipper—the person presents himself as the owner, and brings a bond-note and a warrant which he makes out himself—my clerk sees the bond executed, and I sign these bond-notes for delivery—the bond alone would not get the property out of the Custom-house—there must be a delivery order, and other documents—the bond-note states this brandy to be bonded by Howes—before the goods are actually released, a title must be traced from the original importer—I as<lb></lb>sume that the persons applying have that authority, and if it turned out otherwise, they would meet with their check at the Docks—we generally know the parties pretty well who come.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a provision-merchant in the Minories. I have seen Thornhill in company with Quinlan, not with Jennings—Quinlan and Jen<lb></lb>nings were my clerks—Jennings transacted my dock business—in Novem<lb></lb>ber last, I had a hogshead of brandy in the London Docks, number 10, and marked with a double triangle, which I purchased of W. H. Howes—I had a delivery order from them on making the purchase—I then went to the Docks and had it transferred—the brandy then stood in the Dock books in my name, and any person would receive it that had a delivery order signed by me—I was in the habit of leaving delivery orders in blank signed in my counting-house—this is one of them—I never authorized the filling up of it, or the delivery of the hogshead of brandy, to which it relates—it is filled up in Jennings's band-writing—it is written off in my books in a retail way, as if sent on board different vessels—I never had any deal<lb></lb>ings with Captain Small of the brig <hi rend="italic">James</hi>—I never saw him, and never supplied the ship with an article—the addresses to the names of Jennings and Thornhill in this bond are both false—I applied at No. 3, Mark-lane, myself, which is a baker's shop, and I sent my clerk to inquire at Trinity-square—I have seen Thornhill write, it was when he gave me an order to go to Mr. Montcfiore's clerk to get the bill of lading, without making it known to Mr. Montefiore—that was after this matter had become the sub<lb></lb>ject of a charge—here is the order—I saw him write it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"To Mr. Reeves, 147, Leadenhall-street.—Dear Sir,—Please give the bearer the bill of Jading for the hogshead of brandy.

               <p>upon him, and I wished my solicitor to be present—when I went to Thorn<lb></lb>hill I asked him to give me the bill of lading on which he had got my stolen hogshead of brandy—he hesitated at first, he then said yes, he would, and he took a sheet of paper in the station, and wrote that order—he begged I would take it to Mr. Montefiore's office, but by no means to let Mr. Montefiore know any thing at all about it; to see Mr. Reeves quietly, and he thought Mr. Reeves would give me up the bill of lading—the brandy is worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without the duty, which would be 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a merchant in the City of London. I received this bill of lading from Thornhill, about the 17th of November—it appears by this that the hogshead of brandy was to be shipped in the brig <hi rend="italic">James,</hi> to my house at Barbadoes—I advanced 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that to Thornhill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known him for any length of time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three years, in the employ of Howden and Ainslie, the ship-brokers, who are constantly sending vessels to my house at Barbadoes—he has been in the habit of calling at my counting-house frequently for three years—he bore an exceedingly good character.</p>

                  </hi>. After I had been to Taylor's house I went next morning, Nov. 26, with the sergeant to Millard's in Newgate-street—we waited till the shop was open, at nine o'clock—we went in—he was not there—I saw a great many of my books distributed in different parts, some of which had been recently delivered to the trade—I made myself acquainted with their position and went out—(it is a small crowded shop, very full of books; he sells new and old books, but virtually I should call it a second-hand book-shop)—I returned, saw Millard, and stated that Taylor had robbed me to a considerable extent; that I had creditable information that two parcels had been delivered to him the day before, about half-past one, and asked him to be so good as to produce them—he said some of them had been taken down to Clapham, and he produced one or two, which he said were part of that parcel—I think the first he produced was "Briant's Dictionary of Painters"—that was in the first parcel—I do not know the exact number he produced—I told him that that was only a small proportion of what was contained in the parcel, and I mentioned the names of some he had not produced, among others the "Book of Gems" which is in three volumes, in morocco—I cannot say that that was the first I mentioned—he then brought a few more forward—I think he said that about taking some to Clapham when he had shown me the first parcel, and I pressed him for more books—I do not know whether I had then mentioned the "Book of Gems"—I had taken a list of the books, a copy of which I have with me—I have got the original list in a little memorandum-book—this is not a list of all the books, only of a portion—when he said he had taken them down to Clapham I said, "No, I see them on the shelf"—he then preduced them, and said, "Oh I recollect, I did not take them"—I do not quite recollect what those par<lb></lb>ticular books were; they are here—he produced these nineteen volumes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he did not produce them all at once; I think he produced these thirteen first—I think he produced eight or ten when I first asked him about the parcels: he produced them by degrees—I cannot tell in what order they were produced—we were both very much excited, and I, not wishing to press anything hardly against him, did not notice accurately—I kept myself aloof as much as possible—I did not like to meddle with it—I know that these were the books which were contained in the first lot, which he produced by degrees—the morocco-bound books were in the second lot—I said, "Mr. Millard, these are not all; I have a list of others, which I must call on you to produce"—before that I had seen three volumes of the "Book of Gems," among others, formally fixed on the shelf, with books on each side of them; some were not—the trade price of this work is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a bookseller would have to pay that for them, to sell them again—he brought them forward, and said there they were, but he thought they belonged to a former parcel—they are quite new, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185012160009"></xptr>
               <p>bound in morocco—I asked him whether he kept any account of his purchases of books in the shop—he said, "No"—I asked him what he gave for the books—he told me at first 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and afterwards, seeing I stared at the price, because they are worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said he had made a mistake, it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he did not know there was anything wrong; he thought Mr. Taylor was a respectable young man—I cannot say the precise order in which these things were said—in a very early part of the conversation Mr. Millard said that the books he had bought were second-hand, and he had been employed the best part of the day in cleaning them up and putting them in order—he did not speak of any particular books; he said, the books he bought of Mr. Taylor—I cannot say the precise time at which that was said; we were both excited—I cannot recollect whether it was said before the books were produced or after; I should say before, because the production of the books would have shown that they were new—none of the books he produced were second-hand—the trade value of the books he produced, as bought of Taylor, was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the lowest possible value that could be put upon them would be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the nineteen volumes—the price of these three volumes of "Walpole's Painters" is 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the trade.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You remember being before Mr. Jardine, at Bow-street, at the second examination, when Mr. Millard was charged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not recollect Mr. Jardine asking me what I could put my finger on to show any guilty knowledge on the part of Mr. Millard—I dare say he did—I do not think Mr. Jardine was about to discharge him—he was allowed to go on his own recognizances—I had not, up to that time, stated anything about Mr. Millard saying the books were second-hand, and that he had spent part of the day in cleaning them—I did not know it was of any consequence—I said that he prevaricated and I thought that comprehended all these things—when I did state it I believe Mr. Jardine said it was important, and would not allow it to be added to my deposition—our conversation lasted an hour or more, and there are many things even now which I have not mentioned—scarcely any of these works that are produced are sent to the reviewers, I do not think six—the "Book of Gems" is one of my publishing; it has not my name on it—the paper is not bad, nor are the plates very much worn—it is property that cost me thousands of pounds—Sanders and Ottley were the original publishers of two volumes, and Whittaker of the third—mine is a reprint, the paper is beautiful—I do not think this is the first time I have stated that Mr. Millard said he gave something about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the books—I stated at the first examination that he prevaricated—I had been into the shop and examined it before he came in, in the presence of his servant, who offered no objection—I went out for a few minutes, and when I returned he was there—the books were on shelves behind the counter in different places—the shelves were all behind a screen—it is an open shop—they were placed in such a position as any one walking round the counter, which any one has a right to do in a bookseller's shop, might see them—I never knew it to be the habit for persons who go out with samples or parcels of books to sell on their own account: I should not employ any one that did so—I believe that reviewers do sometimes sell the copies sent to them to review, at a less price than they are pub<lb></lb>lished at; I should be sorry to say it was a habit with reviewers—I</p>

               <p>should not send books again to any reviewer that did so—I have trade sales myself once a year—my books are then sold at prices considerably below the price marked to a private purchaser—a work of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., value might sell from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a guinea—if a work is regularly sold off it is sold for whatever it will fetch—if I have bought books at one-tenth of the original price I have sold them at the same rate—I bought "Priestley" at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a volume from Mr. Millard, and had them done up in boards, which cost me 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sold them at half-a-crown a volume—I do not know the original published price of that work; it was printed before I was born—they were old books—there was no established price to them—there is an established price to the books which I sell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that your own works are to be found in the hands of second-hand booksellers at one-third, or little more than one third of their price? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, unless they are stolen they cannot be—every tradesman knows the price of my books to a penny—it may seem to you that nothing is so uncertain as the price of books, but it is not so in the trade; it is so certain, that if you go into any bookseller's he will tell you within 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. what my books may be supplied at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Millard, finding that he had omitted one book which you had desired him to get back for you, go to the man to whom he had sold it, and repurchase it, and inclose it to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After his second examination he came to me: no, I produced the book at the second examination; it must have been after the first examination—it happened in this way, I knew of that book being out of my stock unfairly; he knew it, and got it back again, and brought it to me—that was "Pugin's Floriated Ornaments"—I do not know that it is the practice with second-hand booksellers to keep no account of books bought over the counter; I have very great doubt about it; I should not like to do such a thing; I do not think any respectable man in the trade would buy books in his shop casually without keeping an account of them, and I always considered Mr. Millard a respectable man during the whole time I have known him—I think he said to me, when the books were taken down from the shelves, "Don't you consider it a little hard on me, Mr. Bohn, that I am to lose the price which I have paid to Taylor for these books?"—there is no private mark of mine on these books—my trade is very large in all the best literature of the age, from works of 500 guineas down to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know that works which I sell for three or six half-crowns are to be found in the smaller shops for half-a-crown; some may be got for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I charge the trade 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they sell for the odd 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they purchase them in quantities, and you may buy my books for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which, if they bought only a single volume, would be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each to the trade—a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. book of mine is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the trade—these works fetch 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the book sales; they are not sold at a farthing less; but if a man buys twelve volumes, he has one thrown in to make 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is my rule; it is not the universal rule, some give twenty-five for twenty-four—I believed Taylor to be a respectable man, or I should not have employed him—Bulwer's works are usually published at a guinea and a half the three volumes—new novels do not rank as established books—I do not sell them; but Bulwer's novels sell at a guinea and a half in large numbers, till they become printed in a cheaper form—they are sold off when he prints his shilling edition—the object of a reprint is to sell cheaper—the</p>

               <p>morocco copies of the "Book of Gems" would have cost six guineas at the first price—it is my particular province to make the books as cheap as possible, but when they have got to my cheapest price they cannot get any lower—I am not aware that the books which at the publisher's sell for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. are constantly to be met with at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my books second-hand would fetch 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the price of new, but they must be cut open, and be second-hand—a book is second-hand if the leaves are cut—books sent to reviewers are not returned; they dispose of them as they like—there are not large quantities of those in the market, not many hundreds—the best reviewers keep them for their own libraries—I send out from fifty to eighty copies to reviewers; it varies very much; that includes newspapers, town and provincial; it is not more than that—sometimes with very valuable books we do not send out so many—I have not found in many houses in the trade, books of mine which I have not sold; I have in two or three, that have bought books of Taylor—I have not been to those persons—they have told me that they bought a few copies of Taylor, but they were gone—one bought eight volumes, which he said were second-hand, cut up—two have told me so, but one I know who perhaps ought to be in the dock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are any of these reviewers' copies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor are any of them second-hand; they are not in a bad condition, and do not require cleaning up—reviewers' copies are invariably stamped with a stamp made for the purpose—none of these are stamped.</p>

I always thought him to be a respectable young man, I did buy some books of him yesterday; they were second-hand books, and very much soiled, and it took me very nearly the whole of the day to clean them"—Mr. Bohn said, "It is no use your denying it; I have seen them here, and you had better bring them forward"—Millard then brought forward these thirteen books, and said, "That is all; I gave him two guineas for them"—I am sure he said, "That is all"—Mr. Bohn said, "No, it is not all," and mentioned the title of some other book, which I do not remember—Millard said he had taken them home with him last night to Clapham—Mr. Bohn said he had not, for he had seen them there this morning—Millard then brought forward from the back-part of his shop three books, called the "Book of Gems;" this is one of them, and again said, "That is all"—Mr. Bohn said it was not all, and gave him into my custody—Millard then went with me to the back-part of the shop, and took three other books from the table; they were "Walpole's Anecdotes of Painters"—he said, "I did not pay for them (I do not know whether he meant for the three he produced or not) I did receive two parcels from Taylor yesterday, and placed them on the table at the back of the shop, but did not untie them till just before I went home last night and left them there"—I then took him to the station with the nineteen volumes—I now produce those volumes—I took Taylor in custody at Mr. Bohn's, the night previous.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the F division of police—the prisoner was a police-constable of that division—on the morning of the 13th of October he was on duty in the Strand, and about half-past four o'clock he brought in a female to the station-house accused of robbing a seaman—the prisoner took a purse from her containing five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, two sovereigns, and twenty-one shillings in silver—he produced it to me, and I kept possession of the purse and its contents till the case went before the Magistrate—in the course of the same morning he came to the station again—he did not say anything to me, but I gave him the same purse and money to produce</p>

               <p>before the Magistrate—I was present at the examination, and the prisoner produced the purse and money—the female who was in custody was re<lb></lb>manded, and the prosecutor applied for some part of the money—the Magistrate ordered 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be delivered up to him out of the purse—I directed the prisoner to take the remainder of the money and the purse to the station, and to deliver it to the inspector on duty—I never saw him again till he was taken into custody on the Thursday morning, which was three mornings afterwards—I inquired at the station-house and he was not there, and the money was gone—it having been delivered to me I became respon<lb></lb>sible for it till the case went to trial.</p>

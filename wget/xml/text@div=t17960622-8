               <p>They also stood charged on the Corner's Inquiquisition with the murder of John Brown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is my duty, as Counsel for the prosecution, to beg your most serious and anxious attention to the case which I have to lay before you in support of the indictment, which charges the four prisoners at the bar with the crime of murder, Against that crime the laws of God and of men have denounced the punishment of death; and the law of England holding it, and justly holding it, in especial abhorrence, has decreed that that punishment of death shall be inflicted without delay. It is therefore a case which calls upon you to do that which I am sure you will do, to apply your minds closely to the investigation of the facts which will be proved, because you will consider that upon your verdict will depend whether the four prisoners at the bar shall or not remain more than two days longer in this world.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, such is the nature of the crime of murder, that it is perhaps more than any other perpetrated in secret, and in the dark. It is therefore but seldom that the direct testimony of eye-witnesses can be obtained, another species of evidence is of course necessarily resorted to, in general, which is in many cases not less satisfactory, in some unquestionably still more satisfactory than the positive testimony of eye-witnesses. Evidence of a number of circumstances, which like so many links of a chain each in itself, perhaps but of little importance, yet when combined together forming such a regular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220023"></xptr> and unbroken series as conduct the human mind to an unerring conclusion. The case which I have to lay before you is certainly, in the first instance at least, a case entirely of circumstances, and you will have to consider whether the existence of those circumstances is or is not compatible with the innocence of all or any of the prisoners at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you must have perceived from the reading of the indictment, and from the statement of the Coroner's Inquisition by the officer of the Court, that the name of the deceased is described in one to be 
               <persName id="t17960622-8-person142">

            : That variation arose from a misapprehension at the time Coroner's Inquisition was taken, he was at that time conceived to be a person of the name of John Brown; however I shall establish by evidence that his name was George Hebner.</p>

               <p>The deceased was a native of Russia, had resided in this country some time, had married in this country, and carried on the business of a <rs id="t17960622-8-viclabel43" type="occupation">taylor</rs>

The next information we have of him is, that late on that night he was enquiring for a bed in East-Smithfield, and being unhappily recommended by a watchman to the house of the prisoner, Hughes, in <placeName id="t17960622-8-crimeloc44">Dean-street, East-Smithfield</placeName>

Two witness, whom I shall produce, of the names of Darby and Johnson, lived in the house adjoining; the persons who had inhabited that house before them had bored holes with a gimblet, in the wainscoat, by which their house is separated from the house of Hughes which holes were imperfecly stopped up with paper, and through which they could see what was passing in every part of Hughes's house; through those gimbles holes it was, that they saw this unfortunate man on the days I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday evening, one of these witnesses heard Mrs. Hughes say to some person, "Strike me, you dog, strike me, it is all I want;" upon which she removed the paper from one of the gimblet holes, and, looking through, saw the person of the deceased. Possibly, I shall not be able to lay before you direct proof of any thing else that passed that night; but the next morning between seven and eight, the attention of Mrs. Darby was called to some words which she heard from Mrs. Hughes in the adjoining house, which induced her to suspect that some mischief had been practised: upon this she got up, she called Mrs. Johnson, and they together listened, and looked through the holes. They saw the four prisoners at the bar, in evident confusion; they heard them talk in dark and ambiguous language, they heard one of them (which they cannot precisely ascertain) say, "At ten o'clock, we will take it and lay it down so," describing with their hands, the laying something upon the ground; they saw Mrs. Hughes and another go out, and heard Ludman cry out, "Mother Hughes, don't shut the door, and then they won't have any suspicion." This very naturally alarmed them, and one of them directly went to the house of a neighbour, informed him of what they had observed; and begged some assistance; upon this, several persons came to the house, one or two of them went up stairs, and there they found the body of the deceased hanging to the bed post; the corpse was stiff and cold, and, Gentlemen; you will particularly attend to the precise situation in which the body was found, the head was hanging, I understand, within about four or five inches of the top of the bed, the feet touched the ground, and the hands of the deceased were tied behind him in a very particular manner, the backs of the hands were close together, and the wrists tied as tight as they possibly could be; the stuff with which they were tied, was of the nature of window line, twisted with great care to make it strong enough, and what is most remarkable, it was tied in a sailor's knot, which is, I understand, a knot of a peculiar construction, partaking so much of the nature of a running knot, that the harder it is pulled, the tighter it draws. Gentlemen, (the prisoner Ludman is a 
sailor, the deceased was no sailor).</p>


               <p>As soon as the first person who discovered this, saw the body of the deceased in this position, he, with very commendable caution, ran down, secured the street door, and enquired who was the owner of that house. Ludman came towards him, and said, he slept there last night, then said Howell, the witness I shall produce-" You shall not go out, no man shall go out from here till the officers come;" upon which Ludman uttered these remarkable expressions,"Damn your eyes, you can but hang me," and down he sat; at this time, the other three prisoners were present, they were all four secured and taken to prison; in their way to prison, either on that or a subsequent day, some material conversation took place between them, of which I am not particularly informed, it will be stated to you, by the officer, in whose custody they were, and you will draw the conclusion which you ought to draw from that conversation.</p>


               <p>Gentlemen, these being the circumstances in which the body of the deceased was found, you will perceive that his death was unquestionably violent (there is no possibility of supposing it could be an accidental death), being violent, it could only have happened from his own hands, or from the hands of others; that he could not have come by it from his own hands, is evident, his head being so high, as to be near the top of the bed post, and his feet touching the ground; but what is most important is, his hands being tied behind him so tight as they were, with the backs of the hands together, and the line being tied in a knot of a peculiar description. These circumstances therefore called upon the prisoners, who were the only persons in the house (except a child), to explain their conduct, they called upon them to shew that all these facts, suspicious as they were, were never the less consistent with their innocence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, they did attempt this explanation in their examinations before the magistrate, which were calculated to impress a belief, that this unhappy man was the cause of his own death. I am not at liberty to state those examinations particularly, or to-offer them in evidence, because I am not intitled by law to give the declaration of one prisoner in evidence against another; but I think I ought not to omit stating some part of the examination of Ludman; Ludman first of all denied before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220024"></xptr> the Magistrate, having said that the deceased could not have hang himself, that he must have been hung, yet he afterwards admitted. in the hearing of the Magistrates, that he had so said; and in another part of Ludman's examination, he says, that the child which slept with Mrs. Hughes (a child of eight years old), upon being waked in the morning said, and they were the first words he uttered; "Mammy, is the man dead?"</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, what that child had seen, in the course of the preceding night, to lead to that question, I shall forbear to state, because I think I should transgress the duty I am now performing, if I were to raise any prejudice in your minds, by stating any circumstances, which, by posibility, might not come out in proof; the child is of but tender years, I shall present him to you, and if it appears that he has a sufficient knowledge of the sanction of the oath, under which he must speak, then, and not till then, you will hear his testimony. But without this, I fear, that the circumstances which I shall have to lay before you, will be found to be utterly irreconcilable with the innocence of any one of the prisoners at the bar. If upon the most patient investigation of this case, that should be your clear and decided opinion, however painful the duty will be to consign four of your fellow creatures to a speedy and ignominious death, it is a duty, nevertheless, which you owe to the oath you have taken, and to that country which you represent.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see him last? - A. On Tuesday morning the 17th of May, a little after eight in the morning; he said he should come back at ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever return? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen any of your husband's cloaths? - A. Yes; all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The cloaths he had on when he went away? - A. Yes; they were shewn to me by a constable the Thursday week after he went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Describe the cloaths? - A. The coat was a dark mixture, a buss marcella waistcoat, with blue pink and while stripes, and olive worsted stocking breeches; his stockings were grey cotton, and strings in his shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had his shirt any mark upon it? - A. It had not; he had two waistcoats on, the other was a buss jean waistcoat, with a brown spot; they were both outside waistcoats.</p>

               <p>Q. Had be a watch? - A. He had none when he went away from home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. That embarrassment of his affairs had produced a disorder in his mind I believe? - A. He was very low spirited, and when he was intoxicated and laid down to sleep, he slept so soundly that it was almost impossible to wake him.</p>
               <p>MR. KING sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon in Burr-street, East-Smithfield: I was called in on the Monday to inspect the body of the deceased, the day after the discovery; I found him lying on a bed with a cord tied round his neck; it had been cut from the bedstead; the cord was through the noose, and very tight; I proceeded to open the head by desire of the Magistrates, as I understood, and in moving him I found his hands tied behind him very firm indeed; they were tied, as near as I can tell, back to back; it appeared to be cotton-line twisted.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it tied in running knots? - A. A very particular kind of knot; it was not a common knot; there were no marks of business about the head at all, there was a slight bruise or two on the side given by something not very hard; I did not strip him then on account of leaving the hands in the state in which they were; the face was in an extreme turgid state; the brains were extremely full and turgid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as usual in a case of strangling? - A. Yes; the cord had been applied in a very tight manner to produce a very deep mark; we divided the scalp, and opened the head; the brains appeared in a very full state indeed, preternaturally so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say from your examination what was the cause of his death? - A. Undoubtedly from the cord having been applied so very tight round the neck, by preventing the return of blood from the brains to the heart.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in the same room that he had been in before? - A. Yes; he came down out of the one pair of stairs to light his pipe; we have gimblet-holes in the wainscoat up one pair of stairs, and in the two pair of stairs there is a great crack in the wainscoat through which we can see every thing that passes in Mrs. Hughes's house; the next time I saw him was when he lay dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing that attracted your attention on Sunday morning? - A. On Sunday morning between seven and eight, I was in bed, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220025"></xptr>heard Mrs. Hughes come down stairs, and say O Lord, I cannot go up no more; with that I got up and went to the hole that looks into the parlour; there was a piece of paper in it; I took out the paper, and there I saw Mrs. Hughes and

               <p>Q. Did you see or hear any thing more at that time? - A. No; I went into my own room, Mrs. Hughes went out by herself first, and then Mary Baker with her; and Richard Ludman said, mother Hughes don't shut the door, and then they will have no suspicion; then I went to Mr. Dibble's and gave an alarm; I went after he was cut down and saw the body of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the same person you had seen in Mrs. Hughes's house on the Thursday and on the Saturday? - A. Yes, the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. If any noise, or struggle, had taken place, she must have heard it? - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope she did not go out after twelve that night? - A. She supped at home, and went to see a gentlewoman a little way home, and I waited for her coming home; and she was in bed by twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never discovered the chink in the upper room till that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a narrow chink? - A. A crevice, with a splinter gone out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear, that through so narrow a chink as that, you could see what that person's complexion was through a chink only? - A. Yes; Mrs. Hughes was standing with her back to the window.</p>

               <p>Q. The light did not fall upon her face, and yet you could discern the alteration in her complexion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards, when you came down, these people appeared to be whispering? - A. Yes; their mouths were going very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet Ludman said, very loudly, mother Hughes, don't shut the door, and then they will have no suspicion; he made no secret of that at all? - A. I don't suppose he thought I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in? - A. A very good way of life; my husband is at sea, and I have nothing to support me but from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a person of the name of Dodd? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes; I am very sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. You were pretty intimate with him, were not you? - A. I was, one time back; when he was a young man, an apprentice, I suppose about twenty years back; we were children, and went to school together.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he die? - A. He died for the dollars.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the dollars choak him? - A. No; he suffered for that.</p>
               <p>Q. He was hanged, you mean? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband at home at that time? - A. No; he had been gone to sea about a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mrs. Johnson; an unfortunate woman, is not she? - A. No; I know nothing of that</p>
               <p>Q. Does not she pass in the neighbourhood as an unfortunate woman? - A. No, she does not as I know of; I never saw an indecent thing by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear she does not pass in the neighbourhood as an unfortunate woman? - A. Not that I know of; I never heard any thing of the kind.</p>

I heard that there was a man hanged, at No. 1, Dean-street; then I went into the house, and went up stairs, and I saw the man hanging.

No; I believe Mr. Dibble was the first person; and I asked who belonged to the house, and the prisoner Ludman said, I slept in the house last night; he was then standing by the inside door in the kitchen; he told me, says he, I slept in the house last night; says I, then you must stop till there are proper officers come to take care of you; and with that Mr. Dibble came down stairs, and desired me to take care of the door, and let nobody out nor in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Ludman say any thing more to you after that? - A. He wanted to go out by me just as Mr. Dibble came down; I told him he should not go, nor nobody else should go out of the house till there were proper officers to take care of them; upon that, he takes a stool and goes and sits himself down, and says, damn my eyes, I may as well sit down, for you can but hang me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the other prisoners at that time? - A. They were all in the same room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the hearing of that expression? - A. They were; and I desired of somebody to search Mrs. Hughes, to see if she had got any papers, or any thing that would lead to a discovery of who the man was; in about ten minutes after, I went up to see the dead body, he was then hanging to the foot-post of the bedstead, and his hands were tied behind him back to back.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have any tape with you, describe how his hands were tied? - (The witness ties a man's hands in the same way in which he found the hands of the deceased).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know if that is what is called a sailor's knot? - A. Some call it a sailor's knot, and some a timber hitch.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a sort of knot that sailors use? - A. Very often.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you acquainted with the sea yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the wrists close together? - A. Yes; rather strained.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it tied in a manner that a man could have tied his own hands in? - A. It is impossible; a man may tie his hands together, but I think it impossible for him to tie them in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the head of the body to the top of the bedstead? - A. About four inches; and he was on tip-toe.</p>
               <p>Q. With what were his hands tied? - A. Tape. twisted like that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. His wrists were not quite close, I think? - A. Not quite.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not tried the experiment, whether you could tie your hands behind you in that manner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The chest, I take it, was leaning forward? - A. No, quite upright.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the head leaning from the noose? - A. No, leaning to the bed-post; and the noose the same side, next the bed-post.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. There must have been some considerable struggle to have secured a man in that way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And must have taken some time? - A. It? must.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed at that time? - A. No; he had every thing on but his coat and hat; he had his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220028"></xptr>waistcoat and breeches, and stockings and shoes on; he had no handkerchief, I believe, upon his neck; he had a neck handkerchief round his face, tied upon the forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not appear as if he was at all undressed to go to bed? - A. No; his breeches knees were tight, and all tight.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not appear like a man disturbed in his sleep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how that handkerchief was placed? - A. Tied on the forehead, and hung down to cover his face just to the tip of his chin.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you see there first? - A. Dick Ludman and Nance Rhodes, and the two men that were stopped from going up stairs, one a sea-faring man, and the other that is at our house now, they were being stopped from going up stairs when I went in, they were a-head of me, and Dick Ludman and Nance Rhodes said, what do you want here, you have no business here; says Davis, I want to go up stairs to see our friends; and I said, likewise, I do; and then they stopped us from going up stairs, and Davis gave Ludman a shove on one side, he was next the door; says I, the devil won't stop me from going up stairs; Davis was rather a-head of me, and pushed the door open, and saw the body hanging up, with his hands tied behind him, and his fingers Black, and I just touched him on the arm; when I came down stairs, says Dick Ludman, a man has hung himself in this house last night; says I, you scoundrel, the more shame for you; and the first person I met was my landlord, Mr. Dibble; and I informed him of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you take notice enough of the manner in which it was tied, of the sort of knot, that if you should see two hands tied you should know it? - A. No; I was so frightened I did not take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It was Ludman and Rhodes endeavoured to prevent you from going up stairs? - A. There were nobody else in the house at that time that I saw.</p>

               <p>I keep the Black-horse, East-Smithfield: On Sunday morning, the 22d of May, between eight and nine o'clock, Mrs. Durby came to my bar for a, quartern of gin; in consequence of what she said, I sent my lodgers to her house, and I went there myself a little before nine; I went up one pair of stairs, and at the bed post I saw the man hanging; the cord he was hung by to the bed post, was about twelve inches, from the neck to the top of the bed post, and he had a white handkerchief tied very neatly over his face; I could not discern his face at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it tied round his head? - A. It was a long white handkerchief, tied two or three times. round his head, and then drawn over his face; his hands were tied behind him with a tape (produces a piece of it), it was twisted different times round; the backs of the hands were close together, drawn very tight; the cord had sunk very deep into his hand, the hand was swelled as much over the tape, as the neck was swelled over the rope; I first went and examined the body, and then called the officers; I got one Mr. Anderson; I thought it proper to secure the prisoners, and I saw three of the prisoners, not Mrs. Hughes, but the other three in the lower part of the house; I said to Ludman, did you sleep. here last night? he said, yes; I said to each of the girls likewise, did you, each of you, sleep here last night? and they said, yes; and do you know any thing about this man being hung? no, they did not know the man was hung.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said they did not know the man was hung? - A. Each of them; I asked them, do you know any thing at all about it? No; we know nothing at all about it; by that time Mrs. Hughes came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Mrs. Hughes came in, did Ludman say any thing about knowing whether he was dead or not? - A. He said, he knew nothing at all about his being hung, or being dead; when Mrs. Hughes came in, I asked her likewise, and she said, she did not know how it was, but she supposed the man hung himself; I said, Mrs. Hughes, that is impossible, and under that I must stop you all as prisoners; I stopped them all, and desired Mr. Howell to stand at the door, and see that none of them went out, and Ludman says, Mr. Dibble, can I have bail for this nonsense? no, Dick, says I, except you have King George for your bail; then, from that, the gentleman cut him down, and I went and saw him cut down, and a little after that, we searched Mrs. Hughes's pocket, she denied having any duplicates; we asked her where the duplicates of his cloaths were, and she said she did not know; we searched her and found a duplicate of a coat and waistcoat, and, I think, one or two handkerchiefs, I cannot be positive which, I only saw them in the officer's hands, it was by my desire that she was searched for them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220029"></xptr>Q. Do you know if Ludman had ever been at sea? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his way of life? - A. I cannot tell; I have been told he has been in that unfortunate way of kidnapping, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mrs. Hughes did not pretend to be ignorant that he was dead, but supposed that he had hanged himself? - A. She did not.</p>

               <p>Q. The other did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mrs. Hughes at that time recovered the intoxication she had been in over-night? - A. She appeared to be sober.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you see her child? - A. Yes; a little boy, about seven years old; she delivered me the child, she wanted the child herself at the office, and I said, no, Mrs. Hughes, you must not, children often tell truth, and I delivered the child to the parish officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know any thing of Darby? - A. I never saw Mrs. Darby in my life, till that morning she came for a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. She was not in the habit of coming to your house for gin? - A. No; she only came by way of informing me of the circumstance, I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Darby). Q. When Mrs. Johnson returned home, did you observe any thing particular to attract your attention? - A. No, not at all; I heard somebody going up stairs about twenty minutes past eleven, but I did not take any particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who slept in the garret? - A. I saw Ann Rhodes sitting in the garret, and I suppose she slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Baker slept? - A. In the same room as Mrs. Hughes; in the lower room there are two bureau bedsteads, both open, close together.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the last time you looked through the crevice, in the day time? - A. Between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the poor man come down to light his pipe.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time, how was he dressed? - A. He had no coat on.</p>

Yes; as we came along in the coach, Ludman asked me when he was to have another hearing before the Magistrates; I told him he was fully committed, he was to have no other hearing; he made answer to Mrs. Hughes, what a wicked woman you are, you brought us all into this murder, and why not tell the truth; she said, I have told all I knowed about it; he said, no you have not; you know you knocked the man twice on the head with a poker, as he lay asleep on the bed; she said they might all say as they pleased, the knowed nothing about it:

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; Mrs. Hughes pledged with me a coat, waistcoat, and two half muslin handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they pawned at different times, or at the same time? - A. On the 19th of May, one half handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. At what time of the day? - A. I don't recollect particularly, I know it was in the daytime; it might be about the middle of the day. On the 20th there was a waistcoat and another half handkerchief pledged in the morning together.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time do you shut up shop? - A. Ten in the evening; the waistcoat was pledged for 4s. 6d. and the half handkerchief for 9d. and on Saturday the 21st of May, the coat was pledged about four o'clock in the afternoon, for half a guinea,(produces them all.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have these things been shewn to Mrs. Hebner? - A. Yes; and they were sworn to before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Ludman's defence. On Saturday morning I got up between five and six o'clock to look for a job; I could not get any thing to do; I walked about in the middle of the day; my mother asked me to mend a wheelbarrow; I began to mend the wheelbarrow, and at three o'clock in the afternoon my mother and sister went to Bow-fair; she desired me to keep some fire till she came home at night; I went up to this public-house about ten at night, because they were not come home, and I sat down there; my mother came to me in the public-house, and asked, have you seen your father? I told her, no; and she gave me a clasp-knife; I sat in one box, and these girls sat in another; I offered this girl, Rhodes, a pint of beer; by that time the beer was out, she said, we will go to Mrs. Hughes's, and we did; Mrs. Hughes and Baker were there; Mrs. Hughes said, I must go up to bed in the dark; she had got no candle; I slept till between seven and eight in the morning; Mrs. Hughes came up to me and said, for God's sake come down, here is a man in the house hanged himself; she said, for God's sake do not make a noise; I came down, and the first word that Mrs. Hughes's little boy spoke was, mammy is the man dead? and she said, yes, my dear; when she found I would not stay in the lower apartment any longer, this woman kept me in talk till the mob came in; a man came in; says I, there is a man hanged himself; I had hardly spoke the word, when several more came in, and I went up stairs and saw the man hanging; I never saw the man before in my life to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Rhodes's defence. I went to Mrs. Hughes's on Saturday night, I asked her if she had a bed to let; she said there was only a garret; the gentleman was sitting smoking a pipe without a coat or hat; there was a pot of beer sent for, but I never saw the man eat or drink in my life; I went away and left them, and when I came back I asked for a light, and she said she had no light; if I had a light I could not have been off seeing the man hanging, as I went by the door; I went to bed, and in the morning Mrs. Hughes came up, and said the man had hanged himself; she said she would not have the house alarmed till she had had her breakfast.</p>
               <p>Hughes's defence. The gentleman came to lodge at my house on Wednesday night; he was recommended there by the watchman; he asked what he should give me to lie by himself in a good bed; I told him 1s. I went up on Thursday night, I asked him what he would have to eat or drink; he said he would have a pint of milk; he got up on Thursday morning, I went to fetch the hair-dresser to shave him; he washed his hands and was shaved, and went out; he came in again about ten o'clock; he waited for me some time, I was not at home; and when I came in he asked me if that bed was let; I told him it was not; I gave him a light, and he went up stairs; between nine and ten o'clock the next morning I asked him if he would choose any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220031"></xptr>thing to eat or drink; he said he had no money; says he, I have got three neck handkerchiefs, if you will pawn them for me; I said, they will not bring much; I went to Mr. Murray's and pawned one of them for 8d.; he took the 8d. that I pawned it for, and went out; he never paid me for the bed that morning, and he came back again on the Friday morning, and said he was very much distressed, and desired me to take his waistcoat and sell it to the Jews; I refused to do that, and then he asked me to pawn it for him, which I did on the Friday; I got 4s. 6d. upon it, and he gave me 1s. of it for the bed; he came again at night, and asked if the bed was engaged; I told him no; I went up in the morning, and asked if he would have any thing to eat; he said he would have nothing at all to eat or drink, and was very faint; he said he had been defrauded by one man of 40l. and another of 30l. and he was ashamed to go home; he wanted me to pawn his coat; he said he would take it as a great favour; I endeavoured to persuade him against it, but he begged I would, and said he would go home without his coat in the evening; I went on Saturday afternoon and pawned his coat for half a guinea; I went to the Black Horse and got this change for half a guinea and some beer and tobacco; he sat two or three hours, and desired me to get him another pot of beer, which I did; he took in some milk at four o'clock, and wanted to give the milk man a pint of ale; he went up with his beer and pipe, and came down at seven o'clock and asked me if he could have any thing hot; I said nothing but sheep's head, which I supposed would not be agreeable to him; he said it would, and I sent out for two or three, I am not certain which, and he had another pot of beer and sat smoking his pipe till about nine o'clock, and then he went up stairs with a candle and his pot of beer and pipe, and I saw no more of him till the next morning, when I went up to ask him if he would have any thing, and saw him hanging to the bed-post.</p>
               <p>Baker's defence. I was recommended to Mrs. Hughes's house on Friday night; I never was there before in my life; I went out, and as I was coming down Dean-street back again, Hughes asked me to fetch her some eggs; she was very drunk; I saw the deceased come down and light his pipe, and two more young women were in the house; she gave me one of the eggs, and carried the rest up stairs; I went out, and came in again about nine o'clock; Rhodes came in just-after me; I went out, and Rhodes went out, and left this gentleman drinking with Mrs. Hughes by the fire-side, I dare say it was very high twelve o'clock; I knocked against the door, she got up and opened the door; all three went to bed together, and about two o'clock the watchman called at the window and asked if she had a bed to let; and it was a Dutchman, and he made me a small compliment, and I went to bed with him; Mrs. Hughes came down stairs on the Sunday morning, and said, the gentleman has hung himself; I screamed out, Lord have mercy upon us; she begged I would not make any noise, that Mrs. Darby should not hear us; I desired her to call

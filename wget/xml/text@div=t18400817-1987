The prisoner lived in my service for five months—I am a coach-plater—I have a warehouse on the ground-floor of my premises, and have a till in my shop in the warehouse—on Sunday morning the 12th of July I counted the money in the till—I had fourteen sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and a bag of silver—I locked the till, leaving the money in it, and went out between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—my wife was ill in bed—I had one other servant there, who had come into the house the night before—I was absent about three-quarters of an hour—when I came back I found the till locked as I bad left it—I opened it, and missed five sovereigns—I cannot say how it had been opened—I called the prisoner, and accused her of taking the money—she denied it, and said she would go up stairs to her mistress—we went up to her mistress in bed, and I said, "She has taken five sovereigns out of the till in the little time that I have been out"—the prisoner said she had not—her mistress asked her if she had got any money—she said she had, but it was her own—that she had had money given her while she had been in my service, and I had paid her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she went to the bed-room in which she slept, and took five sovereigns wrapped in a bit of silver paper, out of her drawer—I took it out of her hand, and said, "These are the five sovereigns you took from me"—she said, "No, it is my own money"—I fetched a policeman, and when I came back I went up stairs, and met the prisoner—she said, "I am very sorry, I hope you will forgive me, I have taken four sovereigns"—I said, "You have taken five"—she said, "What I have taken is wrapped up in the bit of paper"—the paper had five sovereigns in it.</p>

I had a warehouse at 1, Bull and Mouth Street, where I carried on the business of a silk agent or merchant—I have since removed to 13, Worship Street—I was in Bull and Mouth Street for about two years—I was for a in England—I had my brother Adolphe as a partner in Bull and Mouth Street—I have known Painter about the City for about eight years, and have had business transactions with him for about two or</p>

               <p>three years—he carried on business as a tie manufacturer at 6,—Falcon Street, City, and required materials for his business, wholesale-in the beginning of the present year he owed my firm about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that knowledge is independent of my books—the debt was partly to my firm, and partly to the people I represent abroad, Messrs. Krabner &amp; Gobbers, and another firm—I cannot say exactly what the personal debt owing to me by Painter was—we were security for what was due to our manufacturers-taking all and deducting only from the amount that which was owing to our principals abroad, for which we had no liability, there was about 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to us, partly for cash and partly for goods, unsecured—I heard of Powell's failure January last—he owed some money to Painter, and about this' time application was made to me by Painter for further transactions to send him in some goods to the extent of about 1,000t., I think—I said I couldn't do so until I saw how he stood, and then I asked whether he would give me a statement, which he had formerly promised: to let me have; a balance-sheet—it was just after Powell's failure that he promised me a balance-sheet—I said "Would you object to an accountant going through your books"—he said." Oh no, not at all"—I said "I will bring round Mr. Boyes"—he said "Yes, all right"—he made no objection to Mr. Boyes' name when I first mentioned it and I said I would go the next day and Mr. Boyes and I went the next day accordingly to 6, Falcon Street and saw Painter—Mr. Boyes first came to our place and then Mr. Painter was called over and we went together to Falcon Street-l, Bull and Month, Street is very near Falcon Street—I said "Now, Mr. Painter, here is Mr; Boyes, if you will let him look-through the books"—he said "I don't see why I should disclose my books to people, I am perfectly solvent if your like I will go through the books and make out a statement with your brother"—I said "All right, I am satisfied with that," upon which Mr. Boyes and myself withdrew and came away—this took place about the end of January—I-saw. Painter once or twice before I received this document in German (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went over some days afterwards and found Painter; and my brother in a small private room making out this statement—Painter was looking over the-books and had a ship of paper—nothing particular took place then, I simply wanted to speak to my brother—two or three days afterwards he brought me the paper and I think the day after Painter came over—between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening when I was writing my letters I took the statement from my drawer and I said "Now, Mr. Painter, is this statement right?"—he said. "I wish I could read German"—I said "I will translate it for you, "and I translated it for line—on the debit side there is "To credit, 6,891<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., losses: and failures, 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" <hi rend="italic">and</hi> there is a balance of 1099<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to square the account—then on the credit side (the assets side) "To goods, 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; outstanding account, 3,990<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; cash in hand; 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; per bills, 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; fixtures and working tools, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., house property 1,000, making a total of 10,191<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the balance to the credit side is 1,099<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I said "Now, is this right? I am going to send this to my manufacturers"—he said "Yes, that is per<lb></lb>fectly right" then he tasked me about the goods—he came next morning and looked some out and asked me. to send them in and I sent them in at different times when he sent over—there is a memorandum book, which I have not got here, but I-have the receipt book which shows that he received the goods, from which I shall be able to give you what he did receive and the dates—Davis is his man, a porter—when the porter came to fetch the goods</p>

               <p>he signed that—there are nine receipts here commencing 11th February upon some of them are the initials of Painter himself—I sent in a memo<lb></lb>randum of the goods as well, and also invoices or statements for goods which Callenburg delivered—I don't remember any particular occasion on which I saw Painter, between the 11th and 18th, when these goods were sent in—I might have seen him several times—the statement which I received induced me to part with the goods—by the statement I knew he was solvent, and that is all I wanted to get at; without that statement I should never have parted with the goods—about 2nd March, I received a notice of liquidation; up to which time I had no idea that my brother Adolph, had become a partner of Painter's—I subsequently on the 22nd March, attended the first meeting of creditors, and a further meeting on 6th April—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Painter's writing—I first saw it yesterday week, when my mother showed it to me on my return from the country—it is addressed to my brother Adolph, who is here—I never received any letters from Painter, between 1st February, and the time of his committal for trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know that my brother was a partner of Painter's until I received the notice of liquidation—I bad dealt with Painter for two or three years—he called himself "A, A. Painter &amp; Co." the "Co." was put on—there was never any other partner I was told—I knew there was a company about four weeks before I received hat statement—when I went with Boyes I heard that Trouquet was a partner—he was mentioned as a partner in the notice of liquidation, so there were Painter, Adolph Berliner &amp; Trouquet—the firm is "Berliner Bros."—it consists of myself only at present—Adolph does not belong to it now—I was carrying on business at 1, Bull &amp; Mouth. Street, and Callenburg was in my employ as a sort of helpmate; he was a school friend of mine who assisted me in my business—I did not pay him—he did little things in the business, sometimes wrote letters, sometimes entering goods, and sometimes sent goods out—he came over to learn the English language, and was glad to assist me voluntarily, and make himself generally useful—he kept books in English as well—I subsequently went to 24, Castle Street, and still carried on business at Bull and Mouth Street—Callenburg went to Castle Street—I had not much stock there, and it belonged to my manufacturers, not to me—I went as Callenburg's assistant—the business was hosiery and gloves—the. business of general agent means hosiery and gloves, and any other things as well, and cigars when we get agencies for them—I carried on business as a general agent in Bull and Month Street—Callenburg was not acting as a general agent when I was there—he was when I was in Castle Street; he did not take to Castle Street the whole of the business I had at Bull and Mouth Street—he did not take the silk agency—I earned that on at 13, Worship Street, which was my private residence; he did all the rest—I was living with my parents at Worship Street, but I did not give up Bull and Mouth Street then—I kept it on to answer my letters, and received people who did not know that I was at Worship Street—I am not in liquidation—I have not called a meeting of my creditors—I have not been served with a demand in bankruptcy—when I assisted Callenburg at Castle Street, he received the monies and sent them to the manufacturers, and he paid the expenses—I transferred all that business to him because I was in such a state I could not attend to those agencies properly, and so I asked the</p>

               <p>manufacturers to give the agencies to Callcnburg—there were no liabilities attached to it—Callenburg did not pay me anything for doing this—the place in Castle Street is still open—I believe Callenburg is here as a witness—I still assist him—I am not in Bull and Mouth Street now—I have a book showing my ledger account against Painter, but I have not brought it here—I can send for it—the cash included in the amount due from Painter was something like 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which my brother gave him, and which I did not know of till afterwards—he owed me in January about 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides what he owed to my. manufacturers—I knew that 'at the end of January no interest was charged' for 'that money—I asked my brother for an explanation, and to my great surprise when I found the money was gone I understood it had gone to Painter—I believe Powell's failure was for something like 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know; I under<lb></lb>stood from Painter that he expected to have something like 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it, but afterwards ho told me more—I believe he told Mr. Boyes at the time that Powell's failure was for something like 16;000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the amount for which Powell failed to Painter—it was not so much as 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the manufacturers seized the goods at Bull and Mouth Street during the time of our changing places—they had been left there as security, and I charged them at the Police Court, in consequence—the document in German, which has been produced is in my brother's writing—I suppose he wrote it in German, intending that I should send it over to the manufac<lb></lb>turers, but I did not do so—I simply sent a statement of the balance; the result of it—I translated it to the prisoner—I spoke to my brother about it, and he said he was satisfied with the prisoner's position—I did not blame my brother for this at the Police Court—I did not call him, for I did not know where he was—Mr. Painter was keeping him out of the way at that time—he came in when the case came on, but afterwards could be found nowhere—he was placed before me—he was sitting before me on purpose to get me excited at the time—it was the first time I had Been him since Mr. Painter had sent him to the country—they brought my brother there on Painter's side, as if going to swear falsely to excite me—they were show<lb></lb>ing him the sheets, and doing everything to excite me—I do not accuse him of this—anybody can well see that he has been deceived also by this man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the time my brother was at the Courts I heard Mr. Straight say he would call my brother to contradict me, that was the cause of exciting me; they never called him—with regard to the goods which were seized at Bull and Mouth Street, one of my chief manufacturers who was also in this case with Painter's creditors had come over, and to aid him in meeting some bills it was arranged that certain" goods should be left there as security—he also promised to give a paper in writing, that when those bills became due he would meet them—instead of that he came the next day, and took away the goods—of course I didn't want that, they brought up a lot of men and took the goods out—they didn't succeed in getting them all, and what were left I gave to my father as security—the summons at the Police Court was for improperly obtaining the goods—it would amount to that—the goods were taken away with great violence—I was knocked back in my room and my arm was injured—my father's liability on the bills was about 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—'the amount of the goods he took as security taken altogether would be about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth was left—he received no consideration for having incurred that liability—Powell's matter was mentioned before Mr. Boyes—it is included in the statement of</p>

               <p>the amount of losses—that was a question I asked Painter at the time—I said "What are these losses for?' and he said "These losses include Powell and everything"—that was when I translated that item of losses 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "There will still be something more coming out of that"—that there was still something to recover to diminish that loss—I represented several foreign firms—the reason why I could not attend to the business of these foreign firms was on account of Painter's affairs which have brought me very heavy losses—there was a regular babble about it, and my credit became bad though there are some people who would give me goods to any amount—I had supplied Painter very recently with 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods—Callenburg taking the business at Castle Street, was simply to protect my manufacturers—the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was taken out of the assets of my business and given to Painter was since Christmas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am going on for twenty-two years of age—I have known Painter, since the end of 1868—I was partner with my brother Jacob Berliner in business at 1, Bull and Mouth Street, and there have been transactions between Painter and my brother in the present year—the account between them was at one time closed for three or four months—I remember hearing of Powell's failure—I went to see Painter as soon as I heard of it—he was not in, but I waited till he came, and I said I was very sorry to hear he had met with such a heavy loss, and asked him if it would effect him to such an extent as that he would have to pull up—he said "No"—I believe the account was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that there still remained in his business a surplus of about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we (Berliner Brothers) had delivered some goods which had been on order before that time, I do not remember his saying anything with reference to goods not then delivered—I went to his place for the purpose of making up a balance-sheet about the end of January—I was in and out constantly—I had not then entered into an agreement with him for a partnership—in making out this paper in the German, Mr. Painter gave me the figures—he could not write German and I wrote it for him—I went to his counting-house one afternoon, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I think it was about the end of January, I don't know exactly the day—I was there about an hour and I went again—I think it took us about three hours altogether—in giving the amounts of the outstanding accounts he took the ledger and gave them to me and I put them on paper—I took from him the figures he called out, and I gave him the figures to see if they were right—that was only done with outstanding accounts—the losses 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. included the bill which he had accepted to accommodate Powell-Painter said so—I believed he had a balance of 1,099<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or I should not have been his partner—he told me he had plenty of money to carry on the business and I said "If you can give me a balance-sheet to show that, I shall have no objection to join you," and accordingly when I got this balance-sheet I did—my becoming a partner was to be kept secret from everybody, because Painter suggested that it might injure us with the Tie people if they knew it, and I said "Yes, and moreover with other people, because they might have influence over other people in other trades"—the statement was given by me to my brother—I was not present afterwards when figures were dis<lb></lb>cussed between Painter and my brother—I continued with Painter up to the time of the liquidation proceedings on 3rd March, when he petitioned,</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mill Hill, Acton, in the county of Middlesex, and am a builder—I know the prisoner, and a person of the name of Hart—in December, 1867, I had a house and shop to let in Mill Hill—a Mr. Hart called—I ultimately let him the house for a term of three years, at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he referred me for reference to a certain firm from whom I received the letter produced—I could not swear it is in Meyer's handwrit<lb></lb>ing—the house was fitted up by Hart, and goods were brought there by a carman named Bailey—the house was not finished at the time, and I took care of the goods—about a fortnight or three weeks after the delivery of the goods, Meyer came with a horse and cart and took the goods away—he said that Fenianism being in action, he was afraid of the goods being there—they were the same goods brought by Bailey—on the day they were taken away another lot of goods were delivered, by a carrier I don't know—there was a label on, which Meyer took off.</p>

I was a clerk for five or six years in a firm of which the prisoner was manager—the thing terminated and we both left—I was after<lb></lb>wards employed in Wood Street, Cheapside—in November last I met the prisoner at 86, Hatton Garden, where he was carrying on business as Ladell and Co.—he told me if I was doing nothing he should be pleased to do anything for me—he told me of the house at Acton, and said I ought to write for particulars, which I did—I told him I had no means, and he said, "Never mind that, you find the gentlemen I will find that"—he told me to refer Mr. Stock to him as a reference—he gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I saw no merchandize of any kind at Hatton Garden—there were two rooms on the ground floor—I wrote to Mr. Stock and ultimately took the house—the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Meyer's—he sent it himself—he</p>

               <p>went to see if the house was a suitable one—the business he intended to carry on was that of a pawnbroker—when the house was taken he gave me a list of firms in the City from whom I was to purchase goods—I told him it was usual to pay cash in the first transaction, and he said I was to tell them I wanted to open a monthly account, and if they wanted a refer<lb></lb>ence I was to give them the name of Haines and Co., Carpet Works, Thames Ditton—there are no carpet works at Thames Ditton—I went to Parnall's and gave them the card and reference, and an order for goods amounting to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also gave them my own card—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"S. Hart, Dealer, Jeweller, and General Salesman, Mill Hill Road, Acton, W.——Money advanced to any amount. Fire-proof Safes for the security of valuable property"). The goods were delivered at Mr. Stock's house because the shop was not finished—the prisoner afterwards removed them, as he said, because of a Fenian affray which had occurred at Acton—they were then taken to 18, Shadwell Road, Holloway, and the next morning removed to Hatton Garden—I went away to Manchester, and he wrote to me to say that he would send the goods again to Acton—I saw some of them there—I have not kept any of the letters which I received from the prisoner—I also went to Messrs. Dawes', upholsterers, at Upper Street, Islington, by the prisoner's directions, and ordered a set of drawing-room furniture, asking for credit, which the prisoner said I should be able to get, owing to his knowing Mr. Dawe junior—he said, "Tell them you are going to get married, and give them one of my cards"—I had been married two and a half years previous—I went and acted as he told me—I had no intention of committing bigamy—the bill for the furniture came to about 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was taken to his house at Shadwell Road—I told Messrs. Dawe that was my house—these goods were removed to Clapham a few days before Christmas—that was another of Meyer's houses—I took it for him, under very similar circum<lb></lb>stances to the one at Acton—the letters produced are in the prisoner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">Two letters were read, one from the prisoner to the landlord of the house at Clapham, dated 5th December</hi>, 1867; <hi rend="italic">the other dated</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th De<lb></lb>cember</hi>, 1867, <hi rend="italic">was addressed to the landlord at the house at Acton. Both these letters recommended Mr. Hart as a tenant, and were signed "Ladell &amp; Co."—</hi> the house at Holloway was given up when the goods were removed to Clapham—I went to Birmingham and was given into custody there on account of Meyer, who was then assuming the name of Martin Dale Morris—he represented himself as a solicitor—there was a little business done at Acton, but not much—Meyer took what money was taken—I went to Battersea, and saw some of the goods there—Mr. Brown, the detective, told me where to go.</p>

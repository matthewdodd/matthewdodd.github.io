                  </hi>. I live at 9, Hemingford-terrace, Barnsbury-park—I am not in any business—my father has been dead some years; he did not leave me in very opulent circumstances—he was the discoverer of many improve<lb></lb>ments in the manufacture of iron—in 1856 it was proposed to raise a testimonial to my father—the first time I knew the prisoner was in 1856—I appointed him to collect subscriptions by a note which I wrote and handed to him—there was no other paper—this is the note, in my writing,</p>

               <p>I hereby undertake to pay to Mr. Robert Marks one half of any sub<lb></lb>scriptions received by me at the banking-house of Messrs. Lubbock and Co."—in the course of the same year I cancelled his authority—on 22d October I sent him a letter, which I sent by post—I saw him repeatedly afterwards in reference to it—I cannot recollect what passed, only that he thoroughly understood what I said—I saw him a very few days afterwards; I cannot say where—a proposal was made for a fresh agreement—I do not recollect that he said anything about having received a letter—he complained of the abrupt manner in which he was dismissed by the letter—I said the com<lb></lb>mission was much too liberal; and besides that I had discovered many acts that I disapproved of—I told him I very much disapproved of the circulars which he had dispersed, for it was without the banker's name, and seemed to imply that it was to be paid to him, and he altered that, and said he would have a fresh circular—the conversation which I had with him certainly contained the opinion that I had of his conduct—he complained to me of the abrupt way in which I had dismissed him—I never re<lb></lb>appointed him—I did not on that occasion, or any subsequent occasion appoint or authorise him to receive any money for the testimonial—never—I saw him several times in November and December, because I was endeavouring to get an account from him—I don't recollect whether I saw him in 1857—I did not on any occasion that I saw him between October and January authorise him to receive any money for me—he has never accounted to me for a farthing—he has not accounted to me for the receipt of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Boyd, nor for any money received from Mr. Boyd—he never accounted to me for two guineas received from Mr. Hooper, or for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Randall.</p>

               <p>cent. on those that were paid in after October, certainly not; because I gave him notice that I would not—he frequently requested an account—I had commenced to act for myself long before—perhaps I had received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bankers had received about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the result of his applications—in addition to what was paid into the bank, I received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner, and of course I received some from the contributors; perhaps 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to me when I was travelling about the county—in 1857 I went to Glasgow—in 1856 I received money paid by contributors and sent by post; perhaps 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was before August.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that from August 1856 to the end of the same year you received no money; I don't say from the hand of the prisoner, because you say he deducted his own commission, but did you yourself receive no money?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I received about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from August 1856 to the end of the same year—perhaps I had received half of it before October—I did not pay the prisoner his 50 per cent, on what I myself received; certainly not, because he was not entitled to it—I did not pay him any per centage at all on that sum of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not going to pay him per centage on what I received myself—the whole of the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the result of my own solicitation: I think I will swear that—I will swear that the money that I received individually that he was not entitled to, was the result of my own solicitation; Baron and Hall, for instance; I received from that house myself 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1856 or 1857—the prisoner had not given me their names that I recollect; certainly not; or I should not have called on them—it was not in consequence of information given me by the prisoner that I called on them—I don't know that he had sent them a circular—he has said that I am largely indebted to him for per centage on money received, the result of his solicitation, and he has made a claim on me, but it was false—I think altogether about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in the bank in 1856 and '57, the result of his solicitation—he has not been paid his 50 per cent. on that: certainly not; I disputed it—he has been paid some per centage—he has received 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was not to cover the per centage on all—Milner and Sons were solicited by the prisoner, and the sum paid to the bankers—there was an agreement between us of his own proposal, but I have not ex<lb></lb>ecuted it—I think that was on 4th November—he gave me a list of a thousand names that he had solicited or meant to solicit and hold me responsible for—that was in Nov. 1856—I swear that he never intimated to me that he would retain in his own hands the money that he received to liquidate what I was indebted to him—I promised to give him every facility to make out his own account—that was in December—I refused to give him an account of what had been paid into the bank certainly, because he had not furnished his own account—he called at the bankers to get it, but I desired them not to give it him—I have the original circulars here—one is printed and one is in writing—here is the bankers name on it—I don't know where these circulars have been circulated—I know he went to persons whom I desired him not to go to—39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was the only sum I paid him; he claimed more—he may claim 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I did not threaten to file a bill in Chancery, or instruct my solicitor to do it—I was in connexion with a solicitor—I cannot tell when that was; it might be in 1856—I was then pressing the prisoner to render his account—that was subsequent to his furnishing the account which I say was erroneous, and my refusing to give</p>

               <p>my account—I do not recollect that I threatened the prisoner with filing a bill in Chancery, but the letters speak for themselves—Mr. Williams paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a meeting at Dudley; I cannot say that the prisoner had not seen him before, because he went all over the country after my giving him instructions not to go to any of the iron districts in the country—I sent him instructions in writing not to canvass in the iron districts—I think that was in October, before I dismissed him—he had not authority to do so in August and September, certainly not, because I had verbally given him instructions not—but in October I gave it him in writing—I furnished him with the book containing the iron districts—I will swear positively that when I gave him the book I gave him those instructions that he was not to canvass in the country—that was sometime early in 1856, before I dismissed him—it was perhaps in September—I have received sums from the country but not through his solicitation—he had not sent them circulars to my knowledge—he furnished me with an account which I have here, and it is a disgrace to any man.</p>

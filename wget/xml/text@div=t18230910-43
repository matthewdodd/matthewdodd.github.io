On the 26th of July I went to the Opera, then went and supped with some friends, and about three o'clock in the morning I was returning home; I saw a man in the street following me; and when he saw me go up the steps he coughed in a peculiar manner. I took the key from my pocket and opened the door; the prisoner rushed out of the house, struck me in the face with his fist, pushed me back, and rushed by me - I immediately followed, and the watchman stopped him without my losing sight of him - I had gone out at seven o'clock, and left my father and mother at home. He ran towards Bloomsbury-square at first, but seeing the watchman he turned back towards me, crossed, turned down Bury-street, and while I was at the corner I saw him taken. I am certain of him, for I never lost sight of him. I went in doors; found nothing taken,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100026"></xptr>nor any of the inside doors opened; he had not got beyond the passage. He said I was mistaken in his person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you the housekeeper - A. Yes; I keep an academy. It was not daylight; there are gas lights in the street. Perhaps if I had met a friend I should have known him without the gas.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Without the assistance of the gas could you distinguish the features of a man - A. I think not.</p>

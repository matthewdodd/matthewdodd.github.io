            . I conduct the business at the Britannia public-house, Gray's Inn-lane-road, for John Andrews, the landlord. On Tuesday, the 15th of January, about half-past nine o'clock, Mr. Smith, Jun. came for half a pint of rum, and a pot of half and half; he tendered me a 5l. note - I gave him charge; I looked at the note - it appeared rather oily, which I made an observation on at the time: I asked him whose it was, and where he got it, and in consequence of what he said, I wrote on it."Richard Smith, Britannia-street, 15th of January, 1828." On the 18th, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at my house with Smith, Jun. - I cannot exactly say at what time; they had a pint of ale in the tap-room, and after drinking it, the prisoner came to the bar, and asked me the price of gin by the gallon - he ordered seven quarts, as that would not require a permit; I asked if he wanted any rum - he said Yes, I might send him a couple of bottles; he put me down a card, with "Lewis, No. 57, Lancaster-street, Burton-crescent on it;" the gin was to go the following day, which was Saturday, about eleven o'clock, as he said the hay-cart was coming; and the rum was to go on the Monday following; he said I might send that to Smith's, as Smith was going to work for him there, or I might send it to Lancaster-street if I thought proper - he gave me a 5l. note; I gave him 3l. 17s. in change, and asked him his address; he gave me No. 57, Lancester-street, Burton-crescent, and gave me the name of Mr. Shorter; I wrote that name and address on the note - this is it (looking at it) - he stood quite close to me at the time I wrote that; I gave him the change - he went into the tap-room, and, I think, drank one glass of ale, and then went out immediately - this was on Friday. After he was gone I looked at the note I had received from him - I had still in my possession the note I received on the 15th; I had put that into a bag - I compared them together, suspecting the other, and in consequence of the observation I made on them, I put on my hat, and went to Mr. Smith's, in Britannia-street; young Smith came out with me, and we went to Burton-crescent; we called at a public-house in Lancaster-street - we could gain no intelligence there, but in consequence of what young Smith told me, I procured Gower, an officer - I called for Mr. Hambrook, a publican, to inquire the sign of a house; we then went in a direction for the Henley Arms public-house, in the Hornsey-road, and about twenty yards before we got to the Henley Arms we overtook the prisoner - Smith, senior, was in his company; they both went into the Henley Arms together - Hambrook followed them- the officer went in, then I, and then Smith, junior. I called the prisoner out of the parlour, and went up stairs with him; I said, "Mr. Shorter, I think this is a bad 5l. note you have given me;" he said, "If it is I will change it for you;" I said I was very much obliged to him - he put his hand into his pocket, and could not find five sovereigns - he pulled out 3l. 18s.; I returned him 1s., saying I only wanted 3l. 17s., and that would settle the 5l. note, not having sent the spirits; I gave him the 5l. note back, saying that settled the 5l.: I then told him I had a 5l. note which I took on the Tuesday previous, of Mr. Smith, which I suspected to he bad; I then called up Smith, senior, and said to him, in the prisoner's presence, "Mr. Smith, this is a 5l. note I took of your son on Tuesday - it is a had one, and perhaps Mr. Shorter will change it; the prisoner could not find money to change it, and he called to another person named Smith to lend him four sovereigns - Smith came up, and said he had not got four sovereigns - the prisoner was searched by a constable the moment after, and I saw two 5l. notes produced from his great coat pocket, and the one I had returned him was found in his waistcoat pocket, where he had put it. I gave the second 5l. note which I had received from Smith's son, to Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember my calling on the 16th, and your coming in and lighting the fire? A. I cannot swear to that - I recollect lighting the fire one day, but cannot say when - the prisoner was there then; that was after I received the note from young Smith, and before I received the one from the prisoner; young Smith was with him - I cannot say how long they were there: my house is two doors from Smith's. I sat down and drank with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me you had the best gin 1s. lower than anybody else, if I wanted any for the country? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not say I should be that way in a few days, and would give you an order? A. He never mentioned a word of the kind; he called on the 18th - he came to the bar, and spoke to me first about the gin; I did not speak a word to him about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I told you I was going down to Sam Smith's, at Hornsey, the Archway House public-house? A. He did not tell me a word about that.</p>

            , a carpenter; we live near the Britannia in Gray's Inn-lane. On the 15th of January the prisoner came to my father's about three o'clock in the afternoon - I cannot say I did not know him; but it was between seven and eight years since I had seen him - my father and him went out together - I saw him again that evening between nine and ten o'clock - it was a snowy night - my father was gone to bed; my mother let the prisoner in; he said he wanted to see my father; my mother said he was gone to bed; he said he must see him, and went up stairs to him - he was sitting by the fire in my father's room wet. I was up there - I heard him say he must see my father - he said he was wet, and must have something to drink - he told me to get half a pint of rum, and a pot of half and half - he gave me a 5l. note to pay for it; I went to the Britannia, and gave Owers the 5l. note I had received from him; he gave me 4l. 18s. 7 1/2d. in change, and enquired where I had received the note - I told him, then returned; gave Shorter the change, and told him Mr. Owers, at the Britannia, looked at the note, and said it looked rather oily, and that Owers said he should not put his name on it, but mine - Shorter said that was all right; it made no difference whose name was put to it - he asked us to get him a lodging for the night - I went to Owers, but could not get him a bed there - he did not stay at our house that night; he came again on Wednesday, the 16th - nothing passed about any note then - he came again on the 18th, and asked my father to go out with him; my father said he must go and be shaved first; and while he was gone, Shorter asked me to go to the Britannia and have a pint of ale. I accompanied him there, and had the ale - while we sat drinking there, he went out of the tap-room;' he was gone some minutes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210064"></xptr>I got up and went to the door to see where he was - I opened the tap-room door, and saw him at the bar with some papers or cards in his hand, talking to Owers; he came into the tap-room after that, and drank a glass of ale I did not see any money pass between him and Owers - he took a drop of ale, and went out directly - I went out also, and instead of going to our house, he was going down the street; I said, I dare say my father was at home - he then turned, and went to my father's house; my father and he went out together - Owers came to our house in about ten minutes (this was about two o'clock), and in consequence of what passed, we went to Lancaster-street - we did not find the prisoner there; we got Gower, the constable, and went to Hambrook's; we then went to Hornsey-road - I saw him proceeding up to the Henley Arms - I followed, and was not present when he was called up stairs - I waited in the parlour, and went up just after they had searched him - he was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not first give you half-a-crown to fetch the gin, before I gave you the 5l. note, and I believe your sister went to fetch it? A. No; we had no gin before you went up to my father - my sister was not sent out that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I say I should go and sleep just by the turnpike? A. No; not a word of the sort, I did not persuade him a not to sleep there - he asked me to go and get him a lodging - we got him one at last; I went there with him - when we got there, he said he did not like to sleep at strange lodgings by himself, and I should stop with him - I did so - I cannot say how long we were at the Britannia on the 16th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. During that time, was any thing said about gin? A. We were drinking gin and water - he told Owers he could not get such gin as that, down in his country, and a few words passed between them, but I did not pay much attention to what they said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not Owers fetch me three different samples of rum, brandy, and gin? A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came and said you had got me a bed, I said I had no money, and must send for something to drink, and must change a 5l. note? A. Not a word of the sort was mentioned.</p>

            . I am the father of the last witness. On the 15th of January, I saw the prisoner at our house about four o'clock, when I came home - I went with him to the Britannia, and had part of a glass of gin and water with him, and went to Lancaster-street, and had some beer; he said he wanted me to do a job in Lancester-street. On the 18th, he came again - I went with him to the Henley Arms; he was taken into custody there - I had known him about fifteen years; but had not seen him for five or seven years before the 15th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you I was going to Sam Smith's? A. He said something on the 18th, about wanting to see Sam Smith who used to keep the Bluecoat-boy public-house - he promised me to be on the premises in Lancaster-street, where I was to do the work, by four o'clock - I heard nothing about his returning to my house to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. When the landlord came and said it was a forged note, did I not tell you I knew where I took them? A. He said he could make them all right - he knew where he had taken them. Hambrook went down stairs with the notes in his hand, to fetch a pen and ink to mark them - that was the two found in his coat pocket, and the one found in his waistcoat - I did not say, "They won't change them, will they?"</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him at four o'clock on the 15th, did he come to your house that night when you were in bed? A. yes, between nine and ten; he might stay there an hour; I was present when the gin was brought, and saw my son give him the change, which was 4l. 18s. 7 1/2d.; I did not see him give my son the note.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Pancras. On the 18th of January at the request of Owers I accompanied him to the Henley Arms and apprehended the prisoner; I searched him, found two 5l. notes in his coat pocket, and one 5l. note in his waistcoat pocket: I gave the two to Hambrook to mark for me; he took possession of them - he returned with them, and pen and ink; I afterwards gave him the third note which I found in the prisoner's waistcoat pocket; he marked that in my presence and returned me the three notes: I marked them myself afterwards, and gave them up at the office; (looking at three notes) these are the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not the two notes in a pocket-book in my pocket? A.

(Looking at a 5l. note, No. 20,725) I received this note from the prisoner on the 10th of January; he owed me some money which I had lent him four years ago: he called on me several times from the week before Christmas up to the 10th of January - I did not call on him to pay the debt; he came a little after five o'clock in the afternoon of the 10th of January; I was at tea, and asked him to take a cup - he asked what it was he owed me; I said I did not recollect the amount, and had no time to spare to go to see what it was, as I must be at the hall by six o'clock; he gave me this note; I went to Matthewson's and got change; he asked what it was - I said about 2l. 7s. or 8s.; he said "Well, take 2l. 10s., that will cover the debt" I said "Yes it will, and above it" he said "Well, give me the remainder" - which I did: he promised to call next day and we were to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210065"></xptr>put it to rights, and see what it was, but he never called again - I know this to be the note, by two names on the back," Ephraim Shorter, "and "John Goal, Tems-street;" knowit by that, and am certain it is the note.</p>

            . I keep the Feathers public-house, High Timber-street. On Saturday evening, the 5th of January, the prisoner came to my house (I had known him about twelve months as an occasional customer); he went away on Sunday morning - his bill came to 15s. 10d., including a former score; he tendered me a 5l. note on Sunday morning- (looking at one, No. 25,826) - this is it; I wrote on it,"Shorter from Chobham;" I always knew him by the name of Chobham before, but he told me to write "Shorter from Chobham" on it; I paid the note away next day.</p>

I wrote Chandler, having forgotten his name - I put on it the name of a person he was in the habit of meeting at my house - I am certain it is the note I received from him.</p>

On Tuesday, the 11th of September, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to my house - I had known him about twelve months; while he was there my attention was called to him by my wife; a 5l. note was changed for him, in my presence - I gave him the whole change myself, and was going to write a name on the note, but the prisoner said his name was on it - he said he had written it on the back; this is it - (looking at one, No. 56,731) - I pointed out the name to him; he said, I did not know he lived at Hammersmith; he said he did not live there, but had a person carrying on a shop there, and he was to be found there; he had ran a score of 7s. or 8s. that day, which he paid me out of the change; I think he said the shop was a potatoe warehouse; I tried to find him there afterwards, but could not; they said he had been there, but was gone.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes. (looking at the note uttered to Owers on the 18th of January,) This is forged in every respect, paper, plate, and signature; the one uttered to Owers on the 15th is also forged in every respect, and from the same plate, and is of a similar description; the two found in the prisoner's pocket are also forged, in all respects, and from the same plate; that uttered to Plowman is forged, in every respect, and from the same plate; so is that uttered to Northey, and from the same plate; also those uttered to Woodruff and Drew - they are forged in every respect, and all from one plate; the 10l. note uttered to Field is forged in every respect, paper, plate, and signature; and the one uttered to Jones - they are both from one plate, I have no doubt; they are coarse imitations, but would pass in ordinary circulation; the one uttered, on the 15th, to Owers, has a thick, greasy appearance, and so has the other one - it arises partly from the quality of the paper, and partly from an attempt to make a water-mark.</p>

            , of Gravesend; his private house is there, but he lived then in Manor-place, Walworth: I delivered him a cargo of tiles out of a French ship; also sixty loads of clover and meadow hay, and some bricks, from Burton-on-the Humber: when we balanced accounts, there was 175l. coming to me - I was paid in these notes: I was paid the chief part in notes, and William Oxley (I being no scholar) used to do my writing for me; when I went I took him with me there to make up the running account between us for twelve months, and a person named Salley was there with him. Oxley made the initials on all these notes - he is now a rider to a person at Bristol, in the wool trade. I sent down for him last Friday afternoon, when I found where he was: my uncle and friends went down, and have not returned - I am informed he is out, and expected back on Monday night, and, if he does return, he will come here by the first coach. I am not sure that he took them from him, because I do not know the names on the back of the notes. I expect him by every coach. I never should have paid them away if I had known them to be forged, but I am sure I took the chief part of them of Salley; I also took 60l. from Tucker, a cow-keeper, and some from Mr. Boddis, a timber-merchant, in the New Kent-road. Oxley generally put initials on the notes whenever I took them - I am waiting for him to bring the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210066"></xptr>accounts up, which he took down with him. I have been expecting to become a bankrupt, and have been keeping the money back - because I endorsed a bill, they threatened to strike a docket against me, and I thought to meet the bill by the first day of the Term in January, and saved some notes for that purpose. Plenty of people in the neighbourhood knew I delivered the goods; there was 41,000 tiles. [After his Lordship had summed up the case, the prisoner added] The reason I did not bring the people I had the notes from is, because I thought it not necessary till I brought the witness to prove I did take them from them: I dare say if the names on the notes were read over to me, I should recollect who I took them from - from June, 1816, to 1827, I turned 15,000l. or 16,000l. As to Smith's 4l., the landlord said, "Give me 3l. 16s." before he gave me back the note, and I did not think of offering him another note. I was going to the Archway House public-house to buy a stock of hay, and meant to give the 10l. as earnest. I took an outer shed of Mrs. Lewis, in Lancaster-street - her husband was coming home out of Whitecross-street Prison, and was then to assign me over the lease of the cow-house. I kept the house at Hammersmith about two months, and, finding it did not answer, gave it up - I let it for 1l. more than I gave for it. I should not have came unprepared with witnesses, but being no scholar, I can not tell what names are on the back of the notes.</p>

I keep an oyster and greengrocer's shop in Wool<lb></lb>wich—on Saturday night, 27th October, I was outside my shop, and saw the prisoner walk up and down once or twice—he was alone—he then came to my stall, and he asked me to open him some oysters—I opened two or three, and put them down—he had several coins, and threw a shilling down—after I had opened one or two more oysters I took the shilling up, and put it in my mouth—I said, "This is bad one"—he said, "Is it? here is another," and he gave another—I said, "This is worse than the other"—he said, "I cannot change that"—I said, "You have more money in your hand"—he said, "I can't spare that"—I took out of his hand a half-crown, and said, "This is a bad one too"—I asked him where he got this money—he first said in change for a half-sovereign, and after that he said that a girl gave it him—I told him if he did not pay me I would lock him up—he said the first man that kid a hand on him, he should kill him—he ran off, and I and several others ran after him—he was taken—I had the three pieces in my hand, and I gave them to the constable—the prisoner did not say whether he knew the person he had the money from—he said it was from a girl</p>

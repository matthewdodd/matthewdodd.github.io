                  </hi>. I live at 17, George Street, Marylebone, and am an unfortunate girl—I was in the prisoner's service about three months since—I was with him for four months—he talks English, and understands it well—I left his service of my own accord, because he kicked me and bruised me about—he did not dismiss me—I have seen him several times since, and he has requested me to return to his service, but I refused—on 20th December I was with Ada Davis in the Edgware Road, about a quarter past ten o'clock, and the prisoner came behind me and threw some fluid over me, which is called vitriol—it fell on my jacket, dress, petticoat, and stockings, and burnt them all off at the back (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I tore the back of the dress off and made the remains into a petticoat, but there are the holes in it now—I had said nothing to him—he ran away and a policeman ran after him—it went all over my right cheek and hurt ray eye, and affected my hair a little, and my hands—I gave a description of him to Inspector Simms at the station, but did not give his name and address—I next saw the prisoner on 24th December, by Praed Street, about a quarter past eight o'clock—Eliza Brooks was with me then—he again threw vitriol over me, and my dress, and jacket, and petticoat were burnt—I was not burnt, only my clothes—one or two nights after that I met the prisoner again in the Coach and Horses, Edgware Road, drinking with some girls—he asked me to have something to drink, but I refused, as I was afraid—he then said that if I did not go back he would do for me—I said that if he did for me I could get somebody to do for him—he said that it was no use to get anybody to take my part, for he had enough in his pocket to do for six—I met him several times before 4th January, but did not speak to him—on 4th January I saw him in the Edgware Road, about a quarter to seven o'clock—I was alone, and he came behind me, passed by me, threw some vitriol over me and then crossed the road—as he crossed I saw it on my clothes—he threw it all on my back, he did not put it over my shoulders or neck—it did not come over any part of my person—my dress, and jacket, and petticoat were all burnt with it—he did not throw it on my hands on the last occasion, but as I took up my clothes my hands became burnt with it—Hepburn came up and asked me what was the matter, and said, "That is the man that did it"—I said, "Yes,</p>

               <p>he has done it two or three times"—he asked me to go to the police station, but I said I would not, I would go home—the clothes I had on on the first occasion have been destroyed—I showed them to my landlady on all three occasions, and she took them off, and wanted me to go to a doctor, but I would not—I saw the prisoner several times between 20th December and 4th January, but was afraid to speak to him, because he had threatened me—he came up to my house and threatened me if I came to the door—I said that I would get somebody to move him away if he did not go away—I went to the police station on 6th January and applied for a warrant against him.</p>

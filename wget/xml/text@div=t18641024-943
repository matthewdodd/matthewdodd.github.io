                  </hi>. I am servant to my father, who is a horse-slaughterer—I reside at Hanworth, in Middlesex—on the night of 5th October I went to the Swan public house, at Hanworth, and stopped there till about 12 o'clock-Purday, Heim, Gatwell, and several more were then in the tap-room together—they all came out, and I went to the bar and had a drop of gin—I then counted my money and put it in this red bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I counted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.16<hi rend="italic">s.;</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and the other in silver—I put the red bag in my cash-pocket, wished the landlord "good night," and went on my road home—I saw five or six of them standing talking under a tree against the</p>

               <p>two men, one a little taller than the other—one was holding Mr. Benn down and the other was leaning over him—directly I tried to get him up, he tried to call "Murder!" and I hallooed also—he seemed as if he had got something in his mouth.</p>

On the night of Wednesday, 5th October, about 12 o'clock, I was on duty near the Swan Jnn at Han worth—it is a very scattered village—I saw the two prisoners come out of the Swan at that time, and six more with them; they stood talking on the Swan-green—I saw Benn come out and go towards his home—Heim had a horse and cart out<lb></lb>side the Swan, which he took to a pond, and left the pony drinking—seven of them followed the prosecutor on the road towards his home; one turned off towards Hampton—the prisoners and five others followed the prosecutor, and about two minutes afterwards I heard a peculiar noise, but could not exactly tell what it was—I recognised the voice of Benn, and heard Mrs. Heath call out almost immediately afterwards—I then saw the two prisoners come to the horse and cart; they drove up the village, and the prosecutor followed them saying, "I will have you both locked up"—he was some dis<lb></lb>tance from me then—the prisoners drove to the Half Moon beerhouse—I followed them, and saw Benn outside the Half Moon—he then told me what had occurred, and he gave the prisoners into ray custody—I went down the yard and told them they were charged with knocking Benn down and rob<lb></lb>bing him of his money—I searched them, and found no money on either of them—I afterwards took them to the place where the assault was committed, opposite Mrs. Heath's house—I looked on the ground and found a three penny-piece, two pence, and a comb—I saw Benn pick up a red bag and give it to another constable, who was with me—the pond is about twenty yards from the Swan—Benn was decidedly the worse for drink—he could walk straight and talk coherently, but he was decidedly the worse for liquor.</p>

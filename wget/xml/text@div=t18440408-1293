                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and live in Villiers-street, Strand. On the 9th of April I was in Mr. Clark's, the pawnbroker's shop, in Long-acre, in one of the tide boxes—the prisoner was behind me—there was a looking-glass opposite—I saw the prisoner get on a box, take a pair of boots, and place them under her shawl—I told Simons—she dropped the boots, I believe—I saw him take them—there was twenty minutes between her taking them down and her being taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Joseph William Clark. From information I received from Shepley, I called a constable—I told the prisoner she had stolen a pair of boots—she dropped them on the floor, from under her shawl—I picked them up, and gave them to the constable—when she was given into custody, she said, "You must be mistaken, young man"—they had hung on a line, about eight feet from the ground—the box on which it is represented she must have stepped is two feet high, and then they would be within her reach.</p>

Q.</hi> How do yon know them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By our private mark—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they were fastened to the line, swung over by a string—Shepley was about a yard and a half from the boots—a short person could see in the glass what passed—a tall person could not—there was no<lb></lb>thing to prevent a person in the shop from seeing the woman on the box.</p>

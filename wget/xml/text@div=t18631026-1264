                  </hi>. I keep a fancy repository in Evelyn-street, Deptford—on the morning of 2d October, about a quarter or twenty minutes to 5, I was awoke by hearing a crash of glass—my wife and I got up and en<lb></lb>deavoured to find what it was—I was putting on my clothes to come down stairs when I heard another crash—I looked out of my bedroom window and saw the prisoner struggling to get out of the glass door which forms the entrance to a private passage—he was in uniform, as he is now—the glass door leads to a passage, with a gate at the end—the prisoner en<lb></lb>deavoured to get through the passage, but he seemed strange to the place—I raised a cry of "Police!" and the prisoner was secured by some young men who came out of a coffee-house—I could not say that he was the worse for liquor, but his breath smelt, and indicated that he had been drinking—I believe he knew perfectly well what he was about—he wanted to make out that he had run in on hearing the cry of "Police;" but when I looked out of the window I saw him struggling to get out of the glass door, and I did not lose sight of him, till I saw him in the hands of the police—his hands were all over blood, from being cut with the glass, and were bleeding profusely—directly he was secured I made an examination, and missed three wedding rings and other articles—these gold plated vases I did not miss till. I saw them at the station—they are mine—this bag of coppers was kept in a drawer, which it had been wrenched open—here are two brooches and other things; I can swear they were all secure in my shop the night before—I believe the prisoner had managed to secrete himself in the house; he did not break in—the shop had been closed at a quarter to 10—there were two glass doors broken; one leading from the sitting room into the hall, at the back, and another from the hall into the passage—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man I saw breaking through the window; I never took my eyes off him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, at 6, Wellington-place, Deptford—on 2d October, about 4 or 5 in the morning, I was in a coffee-shop, next door but one to Mr. Pulley's—I heard cries of "Police!" and "Stop thief!"—I and three more ran out—we shoved open the passage door leading to Mr. Pulley's house, and saw the prisoner moving about—Mr. Pulley was looking out of the window—he said, "Secure him till I come down"—I and another man went to catch hold of him, and he struck one of us in the month—we caught hold of him—he said, "What do you want"—we said, we did not know"—he said, "Wait a minute; let me go," and he stooped down and dropped these articles—I picked up almost all of them—I am quite sure that he dropped them—he continued pulling things out of his pockets, and chucking them about—I saw this bag of half-pence lying on the step of the door—the window was broken all to pieces, and the prisoner's hands were bleeding—he said to me, "What did you cut my hand for?"—I had not done so; I had no knife—by this time a policeman came up, and he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 168). On 2d October, I was on duty about 100 yards from the prosecutor's house—in consequence of information I went there, and found the prisoner detained by four persons in the passage—I asked him how he came there—he said by hearing "Police" halloed; he went after the man—I asked how his hands came to be all over blood—he said one of the men had cut his hand with a knife—he was standing with his hand in his pocket—he pulled it out, and dropped three or four brooches out of his pocket—he then put his hand in his breast, and threw some of these other things away—I turned my light round the passage, and saw the rings and guards lying about—I took him to the station—he was searched in my presence, and this pair of spectacles was found on him, and some small tickets.</p>

I believe the spectacles, and a few tickets, were shoved into my pocket at the time; I have been a marine close upon seventeen years, and have borne a good character, and was in the Crimea, and all through the China war, and only came home last November; there are witnesses who know I was along with them at 12 o'clock that night.</p>

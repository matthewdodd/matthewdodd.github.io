I live in Butler's Buildings, Upper East Smithfield, and am carman to Mr. Thomas Fardell—on Monday, 8th July, I was with my master’s horse and cart outside Dakin's sugar refinery, in Hanbury Street, Mile End—I had five bags of sugar in the cart—I saw Sennet there—he was once in Mr. Fardell's employment—he said, "What are vow after?"—I said, "Five bags of sugar; where is your van?"—he said, "Just round the corner; I want five bags too, but I think I shall be too late"—he said, "Shall I go round and lodge the order for you? they know me better than hay know you"—I said, "I think you will be too late; it is no use trying"—he said, "They know me better than you"—I gave him the order, and he went round to the place to try and lodge it—he brought it back, and said it was too late—I then went round myself with my cart, and they said it was too late—Sennet said was I going to treat him—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he went away—about five minutes afterwards O'Shea came up; I had never seen him before—he said, "Your master wants you; you have got a boy with a cheesecutter cap there; he has got to mind the cart while you come along with me to the master at Hill and Johnson's in Commercial Road"—I went with him; I did not find my master there—I then went back, and my cart was gone.</p>

I am a porter, and live at Vine Cottages, Commercial Road East—on 8th July last J was gatekeeper at Dakin's sugar refined—Sennet came to me between 2 and 3 o'clock with an order from Mr. Fardell for five bags of sugar—the clerk sent him away to fetch his van, he would not take the order unless the van was there—he said it was round the corner—he came back about 10 minutes past 3 with the boy Batt—they would</p>

I occupy stables at Lyon's, and gave this saddle into his care on Sunday, the 6th of February, between one and two o'clock, and on the Tuesday evening following I was told it was gone; I saw it again on the Friday following, in Long-lane, in the possession of Duffield, exposed for sale at his door - I have no mark on it; it was an old one - I had had it a long time, and have not a doubt of its being mine; it is worth about 15s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I dare say if you saw it some distance off, and did not know your own was taken, you would not like to swear to it? A. No, because things are often alike, but I have not the least doubt of it - I knew it when I saw it; the prisoner had come on the Monday before, and I gave him a job to repair my harness, which he brought home, and I paid him- he mended it in the stable this saddle was stolen from; I have no servant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He mended some harness for you in the stable the saddle was kept in? A. Yes - that was the day before Lyon told me it was gone.</p>

I let a stable to Hart - I saw his saddle there on Sunday, the 6th; I had it in my possession the day before it was lost - it was in the hay-loft over the stable, where I keep property; I saw it safe at ten o'clock on Sunday night, and missed it on the Tuesday - I went and told Hart: I saw it on the Friday following hanging at Duffield's door - he deals in harness, and is a respectable tradesman; the prisoner had come to the stables on Monday, and said he had a job to do for Hart; I told him to take it home - he said he would rather do it in the stable, and I left him there, telling him to bring the key to me; he kept the key three or four hours, and next morning I found the saddle gone - I went day after day to Kent and Essex-yard. where he occupied premises, and never could see him, till one Friday he came there in liquor, and was apprehended; he had taken all his things away - he had a workshop there; I do not know where he slept.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been drinking yourself to night? A. No - never mind whether I have, or not. I am as sober as you are.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have you been at any public-house drinking this evening? A. No - I certainly have had half a pint of porter, that is all; I may have had two - I will not swear at all about it; I have not sworn I was not in a public-house - I have had some porter at a house over the way: I do not know the sign.</p>

            . I live in Long-lane, Smithfield. On Monday, the 7th of February, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner sold me, this saddle - I gave him 13s. for it; I am quite certain of him - he brought it to me; I knew him before; I asked how he became possessed of it - he said he had been at work for a person in Kent and Essex-yard, Whitechapel, who was not able to pay him in money, and gave him the saddle to sell for his trouble; he did not mention the person's name - I hung it at my door, and Lyon claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew him before? A. Yes, or I would not have bought it - I knew he was a harness-maker; I have known him two or three months - he has called to see if I had a job for him; I did not see him after he sold me the saddle.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner in Kent and Essex-yard, on Friday, the 9th - he might have been drinking, but was not in an advanced state of intoxication; I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing a saddle, and after a few minutes he said, "I admit I sold it" - I said, "Well, then, it becomes a question how you became possessed of it;" he made no answer to me - I took him to Lambeth-street; they sent him to the Mansion-house - what he said at Lambeth-street was not taken down; Mr. Wyatt asked what he had got to say - he said, "I bought this saddle of a Jew boy in Petticoat-lane - I am in the habit of buying there;" he told me next morning he thought he should know the boy again, and afterwards he said, "No. I shan't know him, I am sure; for I never saw him before."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he appear half-whitted? A. He looked curious - he might be a little deranged, but I do not think he was intoxicated; he had a wild stare about him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I confess I sold the saddle, but I bought it of a Jew lad in the way of trade - as to being drunk, I was never tipsy to my knowledge in my life; it is a great falsity - I am a harness-maker; I buy things. and make them up for sale - there are hundreds of mechanies in Petticoat-lane who do so.</p>

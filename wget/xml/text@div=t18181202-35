On the 25th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, and bought two pair of worsted stockings, which came to 4 s.; he tendered me a 1 l. note, I thought it was not good, and kept it in my hand, I sent a little boy, named Newman, with it, to ask the opinion of Mr. Frost, next door, he brought it back to me - I do not know whether the prisoner heard him tell me that Mr. Frost thought it was not good. I then asked the prisoner where he took the note? He said he had it from his master. I did not like to give him change, or let him have the goods, and sent Newman into Mr. Berrie's with it, to inquire his opinion - he lives six or seven doors from me. While the boy was gone the prisoner said it was detaining him strangely. He went towards the door, staid there a minute or two, and then went away, saying he would return in two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he left did Newman return - A. In about five minutes, with the note - Berrie and Gill, the officer, came in with him, or immediately after, Newman gave me the note. The prisoner was brought back to the shop. I then marked the note in his presence, before I parted with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any mark on it when it was given to you - A. Yes, I observed the names of</p>

               <p>"Glover, Bull-and-Mouth-street," on it, when he gave it to me, before I had parted with it (looks at one); I am sure it is the same note that he gave me, and the one Newman brought back. I marked D M 25-11-18, on it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the prisoner left was he brought back - A. In about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He waited till the boy returned from Frost's - A. Yes; he was at the counter, near enough to hear the boy say Frost thought it was bad - he did not speak very loud.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. After the note was first sent out, did you not return it to me, and asked if I wished it to be sent out again, and I said I did - A. Yes.</p>

About five minutes after I went to Macpherson's, the prisoner was there, leaning on the counter. I said to Mrs. Macpherson, that I hoped she had not taken the note, as in my opinion, it was forged. The prisoner could hear it - no other person was present, the boy was not in the shop - the prisoner said it was his note, and that he had it of his master. I told him my opinion was, that it was bad. I went home, leaving him and Mrs. Macpherson in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing - A. In a few minutes I went to the shop again, and found Gill and Berrie there, but not the prisoner.

            . I am a grocer, and live in Newgate-street. On the evening of the 25th of November, Newman came to my shop with a note, he handed it to my man, who handed it to me, to know if it was good. I gave my opinion that it was bad. I noticed</p>
               <p>"Glover, Bull-and-Mouth-street," and</p>
               <p>"Jones, Aldersgate-street," on it (looks at it), this is it. I returned it to Newman, and took him next door to Mr. Payne's, he sent for an officer. I left Newman at Payne's, and went myself to see if I could see the person who had offered the note - I saw nobody but Mrs. Macpherson in the shop, and returned to Payne's - Gill, the officer, came, and we went back with the boy to Macpherson's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the shop, did anybody look in at the window - A. A short time after we got in, Frost said</p>
               <p>"there is the man looking in at the door." I then saw the prisoner at the door, which was open - he ran off. I, Frost, and Gill, pursued him. He ran down Saint Martin's-le-grand, up Queen's Head-passage, and was there taken. On coming up to him, after he was taken, he said</p>
               <p>"What do you want with me?" I do not know who took him. I believe I came up to him as soon as any one. I took him to Macpherson's.

I then asked him to put his name and address on it, and I believe Mrs. Macpherson handed him a pen and ink for that purpose.

            . I am an inspector of bank notes, (looks at the note,) it is forged - it is not impressed on Bank paper - such paper is never used by the Bank. This has the appearance of a water-mark, which is produced after the paper is made, which is not the case with the Bank paper, the engraving is not off any plate used by the Bank. The line with London and the date, appears to be engraved; in a genuine note it is printed in stereotype. It purports to be signed by N. Stock, but it is not his signature, as I have been acquainted with it for years.</p>

            . I am Governor of the House of Correction for the City. The prisoner was in my custody two or three months ago on a charge of b - st - dy in the name of Howard, he was liberated on his own recognizance - he was liable to be taken up if he did not appear the following sessions.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKE produced the prisoner's recognizance, by which it appeared that if he did not appear at the sessions, held on the 26th of October, his recognizance would be forfeited.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Burton, he lost the things mentioned in the indictment; I saw them in the hen house on Thursday night; a night cap was missed off the green in the garden, and the iron key of the garden gate which was on the inside.</p>
               <p>Was this night cap laid in the garden on the grass? - Yes, I found nothing since but the key, which the constable gave me in the prisoner's lodgings, in Conway Court, Mary bone, No. 7; the prisoner was present; I never saw him tell he was brought before the magistrate; he directed us to his lodgings himself; the key was tried by the constable in my presence, it opened the gate as well as usual; it was a common wooden lock.</p>
               <p>Then perhaps more keys would open the lock than one? - I knew the key, I had it in my possession twenty two months; there is a particular mark goes across the inner ward; I described this mark to the constable.</p>

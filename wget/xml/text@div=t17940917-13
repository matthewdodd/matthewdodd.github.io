            Did she give any account how she came by it? Did she pawn it as her own? - I don't recollect, it is so long back.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my gown, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose it? - I am no scholar, it was the very week that I had her taken up.</p>
               <p>Was your drawer locked? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This woman took me to her house the same as her servant, and she sent me out with this property, because she was a house keeper, and would not be seen with it, and sent her own girl with me; she got jealous of me with her husband; her own child was the person that she made take the things out of the box and go with me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Was she your servant? - I did not want a servant; I can hardly keep myself.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you in the habit of sending things to the pawnbroker's? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Jury to Matthews. Was she in the habit of sending any other person to your house? - That I cannot tell you. These things being found with the ticket on them for forty shillings; I found out several other things, I went to Darkin to ask her whether she had pawned these things? She said she came along with a young person to put them in; but Barney would not take them in without they were in her own name.</p>
               <p>Court to Barney. Have you known other things come from Mrs. Curran's house? - Mrs. Curran has pawned things at our house.</p>

               <p>Curran. I did not know that I had lost the gown till Barney asked me if I had lost such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. To Curran. How came she at your house? - She had asked me to let her come in, because I had known her so many years; and she said she had not lain in a bed for so long; I told her she might lay there for the present, but I should want my bed the next week, to get a shillings, to help keep my children, and by that time she might provide herself; she thanked me, and said, she was very much obliged to me.</p>

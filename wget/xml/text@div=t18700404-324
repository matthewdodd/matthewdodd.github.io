                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Back Church Lane, St. George's in the East, assisting my father—on 15th March, about 12.30, I was returning home through Ship Alley into Wellclose Square, which is about 100 yards from where I reside—I had just turned out of Ship Alley when I was suddenly seized by the throat from behind—I turned partially round, and saw the prisoner Hurley holding me by the throat—I tried to get away, but was tripped up, and fell on my face—I was held there by my throat; he never relaxed his grasp; and I felt a man's hand in my trowsers-pocket, where I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in which three sove<lb></lb>reigns were wrapped; I also had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some coppers, in the same pocket—the hand was withdrawn, and I became partially insensible from the pressure, but when it was withdrawn I got up and ran after one man who ran away—it was neither of the prisoners—there were six or seven altogether—I was then hit and seized again, and knocked down, and I then lost my senses completely from pressure on my throat; and when I recovered I found I had lost my coat, waistcoat, boots, and the contents of my trowsers pockets—my lip was cut, and I felt very severe pain in my throat, and partial stupor, and I have still the greatest possible difficulty in swallowing solid food—I had a severe cut on my lower lip, and a bruise on my right temple—I did not thoroughly recover myself till twenty minutes after I got home, from the pressure on my brain—I went to, the station the next afternoon, Tuesday, and described Hurley as well as I cow, and on Thursday night I saw him, with many others, at the station, and picked him out—my impression is that Brian is one of them, but I will not swear to him—I value my stolen clothes at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen them since—I was perfectly sober.</p>

I am an unfortunate girl—on Tuesday morning, 15th March, I was with Fitzpatrick and another girl, in Ship Alley, and saw Dr. Budget pass along Ship Alley, and the two prisoners and two other men behind him—when he got into the square he happened to slip off the kerb and the four men pretended to pick him up, but they were picking his pockets—I saw the money fall out of his pocket in the road, and saw Brian pick it up and put it in his pocket—they caught him by the throat and threw him down several times, and I said "What a shame, do not knock the man down like that!"—Brian then turned round, and was going to strike me, but I got out of the way—there was no policeman near—I said that I would fetch a policeman—Dr. Budget got up and was followed by these two prisoners—I then left them and saw no more—the other two men went away after the first attack—I saw Brian nit night at the corner of Peach Street, and said "I will give you in charge"—he tried to strike me, and I fetched a policeman and gave him in charge—I knew both the prisoners by sight, but not by name—Dr. Budget seemed sober to me—he was about as far from me as I am from you, when I saw him trip off the pavement.</p>

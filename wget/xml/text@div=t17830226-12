               <p>I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner a month ago last Sunday morning, about four o'clock; I apprehended him for stealing of hoops, and he gave us an account before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Was you present before the magistrate? Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any thing taken down in writing? I do not know particularly whether it was or no, I heard him acknowledge carrying hoops belonging to King's-stairs into the stable, where the King's horses were, he brought them out of some store place in the victualling office, where the hoops were commonly kept, to the stable.</p>
               <p>What hoops did he acknowledge stealing? - Two or three parcels, but I cannot tell how many they contained.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises or threats to the man to make him confess this? - Not to my knowledge, we had been before, and searched three houses by his own confession, I never heard any body say any thing of that kind to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Pray, friend, did you see these hoops that he talked of? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all these hoops that you have been talking of, you never saw? - No.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure that there was no promise made him? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. What was the inducement for this man thus to make this confession without any kind of promise? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any hoops? - No.</p>

               <p>What is he? - He is employed as a <rs id="t17830226-12-deflabel71" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

               <p>Have you any knowledge at all how they came there? - Only by information.</p>
               <p>Who was it from? - From a man who absconded, who was also a watchman; I was present when the prisoner was examined; the prisoner was to have been sent on board a man of war, when he was taken up for the nails; the Board understanding that one of their labourers and watchmen were taken up, desired me to go and look at them, but I could not swear to them; they threatened that he should be sent on board a man of war, he desired to make some discoveries, provided they would not let him go on board a man of war; they promised him, he then said, he had seen Garden and Bowyer take hoops, that he met them at a house in Spitalfields, and that the nails were given him by this Garden, and he was to be paid nine pence for carrying them: the Board discharged him, and sent him to the cooperage as usual. Garden, came two days afterwards to clear up his character, and in consequence of Garden's information, I searched the horse pond, and there I found two bundles of hoops.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the prisoner say any thing about these hoops that were found in the horse pond? - No.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner taken up the second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260032"></xptr> time for? - On the evidence of Bowyer who was an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise made him the second time that you know of? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Bell. Was it before or after he was examined before the Board? - It was after.</p>
               <p>I believe he was first of all discharged by the commissioners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he was not in custody? - He was not in custody but of the press-gang.</p>
               <p>What day was it he was discharged? - The fifteenth.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was that? - I do not know what day of the week.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it when you took him last time? - I never had any conversation after we took him up again.</p>
               <p>Court. The evidence of an accomplice cannot be let in this case.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, the candour of the law will not permit any man to be led into a confession against himself, under the expectation of receiving favour by it; Bell has given us a very fair and candid account of what passed before the commissioners, from whence it appears, that this man made the discoveries that have been mentioned, under a promise that he should not be sent to sea; after that it would be improper for us to convict the man, whatever opinion we may form in our own minds.</p>

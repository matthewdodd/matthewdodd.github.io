               <p>Court. With respect to Watkins, he has asserted no facts which can be contradicted; he must take warning, but let Kelly be committed to Newgate to take his trial for perjury.</p>
               <p>Kelly. I beg for mercy, my Lord, I am a poor old man, consider a poor old man sixty years of age.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible, consistent with publick justice, to pass over so gross and impudent a perjury. It is the most impudent I ever remember committed in a court of justice; you have ventured upon oath to deny a fact, which is known to several persons.</p>

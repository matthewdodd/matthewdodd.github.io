             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. On Thursday, the 27th of August, I was employed in a field belonging to the Duke of Clarence, where there were some Mazzaghan beans tied in sheaves with a pitched string; I left the field about six o'clock, they were then all right; I went again the next morning at six o'clock, and missed four shocks, containing sixteen sheaves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say they were all safe the night before - did you untie them to see if they were all safe? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not unusual to tie up sheaves with a string of that sort? - A. It is in that parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps in the parish of Kingston, Sunbury, and round about there, you may have seen such a thing? - A. No; I have not.</p>
               <p>ROBERT GODEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a bailiff to his Royal Highness, William Henry, Duke of Clarence, he is Ranger of Bushy-park: On Friday the 28th of August, I got a warrant, and went with the constable, Mr. Scurr, about half-past four in the afternoon to the premises of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the bean-field? - A.About half a mile upon Hampton-Common; we searched all over the gardens and house, but could not find them; at last I saw some furze, and a great-coat over it; I pulled away part of the furze, and there were the beans; there was a hog-stye just by, the hogs were eating part of them; I found twelve sheaves and a half, and one loose; the prisoner was taken at Sunbury; I know them to be the same beans that were in his Highness's field, I know them by the soil; I asked the prisoner whose great-coat that was that I had found upon the furze, and he said it was his, he had bought it at Twickenham; two sheaves of the beans are here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you mean to swear to beans by the soil? - A. By the herbage; this was a bit of land that had not been ploughed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160024"></xptr>for three hundred years before; about four years ago, timber was growing upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. You saw old grass at the roots of the beans? - A. Yes.</p>

On the 30th of March the prisoner and two others came to sweep the chimnies - they were sent by the regular sweep, and swept every chimney - I attended them, but some gentlemen came - I then left them down in the house-keeper's room - I was not away above three minutes- there was a bag of feathers in the room, and some bottles of mine, also the sugar nippers and a knife - they were all put into the stove that they might not get damp; as soon as the men were gone I missed the property; I wrote a letter, and the prisoner was taken in about three days.</p>

            . I am a master sweep. I had met the prisoner this morning near Aldgate pump - he asked where I was going, and he went with us - when I got to the prosecutor's house I thought he was going to wait outside, but he came in - and while we were doing the chimneys, he ran up and down the stairs; he saw the feathers in the stove, took them out and put them into his bag - he then took up the soot and put it into the dust-hole while we swept another chimney - he then took seven bottles, and put them into the dust hole - we all came away; when we got to Aldgate pump he sat the bag down; my boy took the bottles and feathers out of the sack; the prisoner bid us good bye; we went out to Mr. Munday, who had employed us, he paid us for our job; I saw Groves when I went in, but not when I left. I did not tell Groves of it.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of a letter written by Collins and his mother, I took him with me to find the prisoner - we took him at a gambling-house near Wentworth-street. I said, "You go to sweep chimnies at the west end of the town?" he said No; I said, "Did you not last Friday?" he said No; I said, "Did you not go with this lad?" "Oh, yes (said he) he was my fellow apprentice;" he said the feathers were at his lodging. I found them there - he said he never saw the other things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Collins, and went with him as he asked me; the soot went down the stove chimney - I put my hand in, not knowing what was there, and put the feathers in with the soot. I saw some bottles in the dust-hole and took some, which I had forgotten when the officer came.</p>

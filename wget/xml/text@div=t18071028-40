               <p>Q. Did you lose any of your clothes on the 29th of September. - A. I did; I was very ill and obliged to go to the hospital. I left my clothes at my master' house in the box.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you return and miss your articles. - A. My doctor told me I wanted necessary things. I sent my key to my mistress for the things I wanted; when my mistress went to get the things I wanted she found my box open; I went from the hospital to my master's, I perceived all the things were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you left all your things locked up in your box when you went to the hospital. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live at your master's house. - A. Yes, she came there after I left it; I left my box in the same room that the prisoner came to sleep in. I saw my things taken out of the prisoner's trunk at Bow-street office; I know them to be mine; there were three gowns, a petticoat, two pair of stockings and an apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Are you sure that you did not leave them about the room. - A. I can take my oath I left them in my box.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you this young woman's master. - A. Yes. On Michaelmas night the prosecutrix sent her key to me from the hospital; I gave it to my wife, she went up stairs, she came down and called me into the passage, and the two servants; we all went up stairs and saw the box open, and the things gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the prisoner up with you. - A. Yes; my wife said in the presence of the prisoner, that this poor girl in the hospital had been robbed; I asked the prisoner if she knew any thing of the transaction, or where the clothes were gone to; she said no. I insisted upon opening the box. The prisoner put the key in the key hole of her box and I unlocked it, and the first thing I discovered was three of

The next morning Cummings came to the office and claimed them. The prisoner then said they were loose about, and she put them by to take care of them for the girl.</p>

When I went to live with Mr. Gould there was no things about the room; the day before Mr. Gould took me up I found them things rolled under the bed on the bedstead; I put them in my box, because there are lodgers in the next room, and the door is never shut; the other servant had told me that Cummings had gone away ill and they thought she never would come back; I put them in my box, I meant to tell my mistress of them, but master frightened me so in taking me up.</p>

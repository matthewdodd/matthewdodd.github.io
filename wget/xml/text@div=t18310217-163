            . I am a constable. I was going through Smithfield on Thursday evening, about a quarter to seven o'clock - the prisoner passed me with a keg on his back; I suspected something wrong, and followed him; he crossed from Crease' shop, and was about seventy yards from it; I followed him into Bartholomew-close, and while I was watching where he was going, Welch came running up with Whitaker, and in consequence of what he said I secured the prisoner, without losing sight of him - Welch claimed the keg as his master's I am sure I never lost sight of him.</p>

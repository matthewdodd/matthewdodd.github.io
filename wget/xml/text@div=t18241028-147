            . I live at Barton, near Manchester. On the 28th of October, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner and another girl in Fleet-street, and went with them to a house in <placeName id="t18241028-147-crimeloc787">Shire-lane</placeName>

I then locked the door, and remained all night with the prisoner. I put the key of the door into my trowsers pocket; at that time I had my watch safe; I put it into my trowsers pocket - my trowsers hung over a chair. I got up about nine o'clock, and found the door unlocked, but bolted inside. I went near the door, and the prisoner said the key was in the window, I replied</p>
               <p>"No, it is in my pocket, I put it there last night." I found one key in the window, and one still in my pocket. I missed my watch and handkerchief. I went to the bed and told the prisoner she had stolen my watch - she denied it, and said</p>
               <p>"I do not believe you had a watch," and insisted upon sending for the officers to search the house, and was very violent about it. I said if she would give it me back I did not mind giving her a few pounds; she said if I gave her one thousand pounds she had not got it;' and if I had lost it, the other girl must have taken it. I said as she knew the other girl, she had better look after her; she said she had never seen her before; but afterwards that she believed her name was Arnold, and that she lived in James-street, Blackfriars-road, but it was useless looking for her, for by that time she had either pawned or sold it. I said if it was pawned, she could get me the duplicate; she went out about ten o'clock with the landlady, to look for her, and about four o'clock brought me the duplicate of the watch, pawned at Wassell's, in Picket-street; the pawnbroker at first denied having it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you perfectly sober - A. I dined out and was rather fresh, but certainly not tipsy; we had only drank two bottles of wine among four of us. I did not bolt the door myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you awoke at all by her getting out of bed - A. No; there is a key hole outside the door.</p>
               <p>STANDLEY CROWDER. I am an apprentice to Mr. Wassell, pawnbroker, Picket-street. On Friday last about two o'clock in the afternoon, I received a gold watch, two gold seals, a key, and a ring in pawn, from a man in the name of H. Palmer, No. 22, Lincoln's Inn; I did not see the prisoner.</p>

             B - . I am conductor of the Bow-street patrol. On the 29th of October, between six and seven o'clock, I took the prisoner into custody at this house, she denied knowing anything about the watch; but when she found I was going to take her, she said she met Arnold on Waterloo-bridge, and received the duplicate from her.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After taking some refreshment, I came down stairs, leaving him and the girl together, and as I came up I met her on the stairs with an ivory card case - I said I would not stop if she took it away; she gave it back to me; I put it on the table; she came back, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280058"></xptr>was in the room for a quarter of an hour after he went to bed, and in the morning, he said he was almost as drunk as he was the night before, for he could scarcely see a hole through a ladder. I met the girl on Waterloo-bridge, with a man who was intoxicated - I said I would give her in charge if she did not give me the duplicate, and she gave it to me.</p>

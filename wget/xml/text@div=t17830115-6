               <p>Court. Can you be sure of the person of the man, never having seen him before? - I swore to the man before he was searched, before the buckles my property were found upon him.</p>
               <p>In what way did he rob you? - I had been out a little while in the evening, and as I was returning home, just as I came by Mr. Turner's stable door, one man passed me and stopped, I then suspected my danger, seeing this man and another appear at the same time, there were three men in the whole; I was going to pass them, they offered to give me the wall; I saw the prisoner jog the other man with his elbow just as he was a-breast of me, and the other man jumped behind me, and this man before me, each of them put a knife to my neck, saying, you bugger if you speak a word, your head is off that minute; I told them, says I, gentlemen I will not; with that, this man asked me what money I had, I told him I had but one six-pence, and one crooked farthing, he asked me where it was, I went to put my hand into my pocket to take it out for him, and he pushed my hand away and took it himself; then he spoke another word that I really did not understand then, but I soon understood that it was to see if I had a watch; I told him, the 31st of July last I lost a watch, and I had never a one; he asked me what I had got here: I had a pair of buck skin breeches with leather strings; then he went down to my shoes, and says, what are these? I said they are a pair of plate, in my fright that I was in; says the prisoner that is what we want, I recovered myself from my fright, and says I, gentlemen they are only plated; nevertheless he took them out of my shoes; then he arose from my feet, and clapped his knife to my neck; the other man every now and then jogging his hand to appear to be in earnest: after that says the prisoner at the bar, now says he if you do not swear by the bible, that you will not speak a word about it for half an hour, I will cut your head off now; I said I would not; the other man said to him give him the six-pence, he said he would not: after the prisoner with

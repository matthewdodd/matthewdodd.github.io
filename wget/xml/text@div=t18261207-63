This clock was safe at half-past eleven o'clock on the 12th of October - I do not recollect seeing the prisoner there, not to be positive of his person: it was missed about twelve o'clock - there was a person in the house similar to the prisoner in dress, but I cannot speak to his person. On the 17th I found the clock at Munting's, a broker, in the New Cut, Lambeth - it is worth 5l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it an old clock? A. Yes; but it had a new case - I had had it twelve years, and the case cost me 50s.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in the New Cut, Lambeth. On a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday in October, I bought this clock of the prisoner for 2l. - he brought it to me about the middle of the day; I think he was alone - he told me it did not belong to him, but to a clockmaker who lived in Clerkenwell, and who was obliged to part with it - he expected to receive 5s. for his trouble in selling it. Mr. Fiske claimed it in about four days - I met the prisoner, three weeks or a month afterwards, in Fleet-street; I had been told by an officer that I was to take him up when I saw him, but it was not in my power to lay hold of him; I only spoke civilly to him, and said nothing about the clock - I think we only said,"How do you do?" I did not give any alarm; it would have been a folly to do so, as no officer was near - he came to sell something at my house about a fortnight afterwards, and was taken - there had been a plan laid to take him - I am certain of his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect the day of the month? A. No; I only know it was Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday; I thought it best to take him when I had an officer handy - when he sold me the clock, he told me there was a person waiting outside for the money, but I did not see that person, nor did he point him out; I did not go to the door; I had known the prisoner twelve months, or I should have been more particular - he might have said it belonged to a man who was waiting at the door, but I do not recollect it - I only recollect that he said it belonged to the maker in Clerkenwell. I thought 2l. as much as it was worth, to sell again; but I am not a competent judge - there was a person hanging a bell at my house at the time; I do not know his name.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of October I went with Mr. Fiske, and got the clock from Munting's.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a long written defence, stating that he had met an acquaintance, named Conway, in St. John-street, whom he understood to be a clockmaker, and whom he had been in the habit of meeting for the last four years, at the Cherry Tree public-house, in Clerkenwell. Conway had the clock, which he stated to be worth 4l. 10s., but, being in distress, that he would give the prisoner all he could get above 2l. for it; that they went together over to Lambeth, and Conway waited outside while he went in and sold the clock; that he told Munting, that all he got above 2l. he was to have, and, after walking from Clerkenwell, it was natural that he should wish to get something - that Munting pointed to the door, and said, "Is that the person it belongs to;" he said, Yes; he met Munting in Fleet-street afterwards, and went and drank with him at a public-house in Shoe-lane, but he said nothing about the clock.</p>
               <p>JAMES MUNTING re-examined. I did drink with him when I met him in Fleet-street, and stopped with him about an hour; my reasons for so doing were, that if an officer had come in I should have given him in charge; I did not desire the landlord to send for one. I was entirely guided by the officer's directions; Sinderby is the man who was hanging the bell.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18261207-63-person496">- SINDERBY</persName>
            . I was hanging a bell in Munting's passage in October, when the prisoner came there - the shop door was open, and there was a man out at the door - Jones said he had the clock to sell for a person, who was waiting at the door - he told Munting the person who belonged to the clock, said it was a very good one, and worth at least 3l., but he should have it for 2l. 10s., and then he should get 10s. for his trouble; he agreed at last to give 2l. for it. When I had finished my job I went into the public-house; he paid the prisoner for the clock within five minutes after he paid me - they were nearly an hour bargaining about the clock; it was then five minutes after three. I, the prisoner, and the person who was waiting for him, went into the public-house together, and had a pot of beer - I saw him give the man the 2l., and he gave him 5s. for his trouble; the man complained that the clock was worth more, and then went away. The public-house is two or three doors from Munting's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this a short or a tall man? A. He was rather tall, and pitted with the small-pox - I have not seen him since; I did not go before the Magistrate: I heard of the prisoner being taken up about a fortnight ago - I think his wife called on me; I did not mention what I knew to anybody; I have known the prisoner a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. When, for the first time, did you tell anybody what you have stated to-day? A. I suppose a day or two afterwards - I told it to a person whom I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person? A. Why, I do not know; I might tell it - there is no doubt but I mentioned it to people, but I cannot say who.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, who did you tell it to? A. I told it to a person named Gibson, who lives in Bear-lane, directly I heard he was taken about the clock, and I told it to one Butler, and Wilson; I dare say I told it to half a dozen or a dozen people; none of them are here; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070044"></xptr>saw the other man before; there was no conversation between us, except his giving him the 5s. I did not say a word; we were not ten minutes in the public-house - the man was dressed like a working man, with a white apron on - he went away before the prisoner.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Douglas, who lives in Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell. On the 30th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, my master sent me to fetch nine silver castor-tops and a silver desk-plate from Goldsmiths' Hall - I had taken them to be stamped. I was returning with them through <placeName id="t18200217-2-crimeloc9">Eagle-court, St. John-lane</placeName>

He cut the bag in half, and ran away with the bottom half, which contained the silver - it lasted a very short time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the prisoner held you by the throat were you frightened - A. Yes, my Lord. I called out at first, and he then held me tighter. As soon as the other ran off with the bag the prisoner let go, and walked away very fast on the other side of the way - I could not halloo directly, for he hurt my throat. I followed him a little way, and then called Stop thief - Mr. Malcolm stopped him a little way up St. John-street, without my losing sight of him. I was not above a yard from him, and am certain he is the man. I did not see the other man afterwards.</p>

            . About half-past five o'clock in the evening I was coming down St. John-street, and heard Start call Stop thief! I crossed over and stopped the prisoner - it was dark. A mob gathered, and I left him in charge of two young men while I fetched an officer. I did not lay hold of him, but told him to stop, and he did so. Start pointed him out to me.</p>

            . I am keeper of St. Sepulchre's watch-house. Malcolm fetched me to St. John-street, and I took the prisoner in charge. The boy said he had been robbed, and shewed me the bag - he charged the prisoner with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I conceive there is nothing against me. I am not the person, and there is nothing to support the boy's evidence. Is it to be supposed that a man with a wooden leg could commit a highway robbery? he was asked at the office by what he knew me? - he was mute. A person whispered in his ear,</p>

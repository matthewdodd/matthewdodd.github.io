            . I saw the prisoner go out of my father's shop at about one o'clock on the 16th of March, with something, round which he was wrapping his handkerchief; I was in the parlour behind the shop; I immediately followed him out, and called to him until he got to Queen-street, to know what he had taken out of our shop; he said, nothing. I came back to our house, and then by my mother's request, I returned again to the stable-yard, into which the prisoner had gone; he had gone up stairs into a room, where I found him, and the books in question on a chair. He then went out, and ran away, and I followed him, and took him to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>JOHN WESTON. The prisoner came down the stable-yard with the books, and brought them up stairs into our room.</p>

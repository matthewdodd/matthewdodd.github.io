No. On the 11th, he offered me two half-crowns, one I did take, and the other I should have taken, if it had not by accident fell out of my hand, and I did not like the sound of it; he said he would change it, and then he gave me a good half-crown for it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into Mr. Bangy's, and sometime after I had been there, a little man came in, and drank with me; I changed a shilling with him to pay for the beer, it was a remarkable shilling, marked with an S; I never changed a half-crown with him at all; the next morning I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110057"></xptr>into Mr. Bangy's house, and had a pennyworth of gin; there was a man there who had change for half-a-crown, who is, I believe, out of doors; I went again in about half an hour, and had a glass of gin, and gave him a half-crown, which I had taken from my master.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Bangy.) Q. He says, the first time he gave you a shilling? - A. I never saw a shilling of his.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't work for any master? - A. Not particular, our trade is very dead.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a master, and work for yourself? - - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you come here to prove? - A. On the 10th of October, I think it was on a Monday, I went to Mr. Heathcote's, in Featherstone-street, for some wood; I have a rupture, and was taken very ill in my bowels; I went into the Castle, in Quaker-street, and asked for half a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the Monday? - A. I will not be sure, I believe it was; the landlord served me; I gave him a half-crown piece to change.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was this? - A. Between nine and ten o'clock, I believe very little after nine; he founded it two or three times upon the bar; he said it sounded dull; he had not change sufficient to give me, and he called to a child or servant in the back room, and sent her up to his wife for a shilling; the shilling was sent down; he tendered me two sixpences, a shilling, four-pennyworth of halfpence, and a bad farthing; I did not take the bad farthing, I refused it; he gave me another, and then I went away about my business.</p>

               <p>Q. She said, my son is to be tried for passing bad money, and I want you to swear what - what fact were you to prove? - A. She said I had been at this public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she find that out? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to prove? - A. She said, the publican had swore he never changed a half-crown piece for any body but her son.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you were to come to swear that he did change a half-crown for you? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have no female relation of your name? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No sister? - A. No.</p>

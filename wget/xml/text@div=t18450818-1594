                  </hi>. I am in the service of James Schoolbred and others. The prisoner came into their service in April—it was his duty to take goods out to various customers, receive the money for what he sold and account for it the same day—he was to show me the goods he took before he went out—on the 18th of July, he brought certain goods to me before he went out on his journey—I took an account of the pieces, and advanced him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he might require for change—among other places he was to go to Mrs. Duncan's, in Torrington-square—on his return he gave an ac<lb></lb>count to me of what he had sold to Mrs. Duncan, which I took down—(reading) "7 1/2 yards of long cloth, at 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 2 pairs of gloves, at 21<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;—1 pair of gloves, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and one, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 3 handkerchiefs, at 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and two at 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" six items amounting to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not appear to be drunk when he came back—I did not remark any<lb></lb>thing—I had a settlement at the time about the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had advanced as change—I found out some mistake, and he was dismissed that night—he accounted to me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I spoke to him afterwards about having given him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said there was some mistake, he would see—he went up stairs and got some other money and tried to make it out as well as he could—he did not make it out—when I advanced him the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he gave me an I. O. U.—he tore that between his teeth—I saw him do so—it was afterwards found—this produced is it—it has "30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." on it—it was in consequence of this he was dismissed—on the following day he came for his things—I heard Mr. Schoolbred ask him whether he had been to Torrington-square—he said he had—he asked him to give him an account of the goods he had sold—he did so, and it precisely corresponded with those which I have sold—he was asked how he was paid—he said the lady put down two sovereigns, that there was a little boy in the room who said, "Oh mamma, I have got 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of halfpence," upon which he took up the one sovereign and the lady the other—I heard that said several times.</p>

               <p>was something of that sort—I am not aware that he waited there all Saturday to have an explanation with Messrs. Schoolbred and Cook—he came about nine o'clock in the morning—it was about four in the after<lb></lb>noon that a policeman was sent for—he came for his clothes partly, and he said he was writing letters, or something of that sort—I do not know that he said he came to have an explanation with Messrs. School-bred and Cook, and that he should not go away without his character—he had a very long interview with them in the counting-house about four o'clock—I do not know whether he was waiting there all that time—I did not see him at all in the morning that I recollect—it was about ten o'clock on the Friday morning that I gave him the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., just before he went out, ind he gave me the I O U—it was about six in the evening that I spoke to him about the mistake—I went up to him and said, "I wish you would look at your money that I have given you, for I think I have made some mistake as I cannot make my money right by 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he looked over his money, and in his purse found a half-sovereign on the silver side, and laid" I find I have half-a-sovereign that according to the day's business does not belong to me, and in all probability there must have been some mis<lb></lb>take, and you must have given me more than belongs to me"—I do not remember that his appearance was very odd when he came back that day—I do not think it was—I do not think he appeared as if his head was swimming—I did not say so—he made some remark about it—my business is in the counting-house—if I had examined the goods he returned with I might probably have discovered what the mistake was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to Messrs. Schoolbred and Cook. It is not usual to measure the goods which young men bring back—that was well known to the prisoner—he was discharged on the Friday night—I saw him about ten o'clock on the following morning—he wanted to explain away to me the impression that I had on my mind about the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the previous evening—I told him I had nothing to do with the matter, if he be<lb></lb>longed to my department I should have sent him away without allowing him to reply at all, I was so satisfied that he had cheated the boy out of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was all the explanation I thought he wanted—I heard Mr. Schoolbred ask him if he had been to Torrington-square, and to give an account of the goods—he wrote this account in my presence, and it precisely tallies with that in Chaldecot's book—I have heard his account of what took place—it is sub<lb></lb>stantially correct—at the end of the interview Mr. Schoolbred said, "</p>

               <p>must give you into custody," and he asked him, "Arc you certain you have made no mistake?" and I asked him the question myself repeatedly—he said there was no mistake, he had given to the best of his knowledge all that he knew of the transaction, or words to that effect—I think he said, "Drink has done it all."</p>

Q.</hi> You do not mean to swear to those expressions in those terms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I will swear the words he made use of were, "It is drink that has done this"—it was not, "If there is any mistake it is through drink"—I will swear he said no such thing—he did not come there and apply to have an opportunity of seeing one of the partners—I saw no more of him after ten o'clock till six—I presumed he was gone—hecame at six o'clock of his own accord—he came into the room out of the shop with me and Mr. Schoolbred.</p>

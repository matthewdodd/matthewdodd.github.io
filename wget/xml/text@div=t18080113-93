               <p>Q. Where does this lady live that sent the five pound note. - A. In Palace-street, Westminster, near Pimlico; she was to take that change to the lady; she left my house for that purpose, and to fetch the empty pots; she left my house about a quarter before five o'clock, and never returned again. In less than an hour afterwards the change was asked for; I never saw the prisoner till she was taken in custody. I was obliged to make the money good to the lady; when the lady came I went up stairs to see if her things were gone. I found them all gone.</p>

The prisoner lived in the same house as me, and slept on the same floor, but not in the same room—on 16th Aug., between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I missed a coat from a box in my room—I had seen it safe that morning—my box was Dot locked—this is the coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worth 25<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">proceeded to argue the question, as he was not aware that there had been any decision of the Judges on the point; he referred to an ancient definition of larceny, and contended that any intention of restoring the property, or even the most visionary hope of being able to do to, was inconsistent with the animus furandi necessary to constitute a felonious taking; if the prisoner, instead of pledging the coat, had merely worn it, the prosecutor would have been equally deprived of his property for the time, although under such circumstances no Jury would convict.</hi>

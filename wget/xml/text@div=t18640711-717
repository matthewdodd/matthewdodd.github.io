                  </hi>. I am acquainted with the prisoner—we were in a public-house on 15th June with my sister and several others—we drank several glasses of brandy and water, and then left the public-house—the prisoner and I left together—I turned to look after my sister, and I think my foot slipped somehow, and I said, "I think a knife has gone in my side"—I felt a prick—the prisoner said, "Oh, nonsense!"—my sister afterwards, saw blood on my side—the prisoner and I were proposing to go to Hampton Races next morning; that I should meet him at 9 o'clock to go with him—I walked along and saw my sister—I said, "I have got such a pain in my side"—she lifted my frock, and found the blood—I do not know whether I had been struck by the prisoner—we had been eating bread and cheese in the public-house—nothing had passed between him and me—we had only been joking—I mean to say that I do not know how I got the prick in my side.</p>

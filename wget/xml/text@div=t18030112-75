The scarlet cloak I value at ten shillings, and two of the shifts at six shillings I went to the office and got a warrant, for I suspected the prisoner, because she always begrudged me the things when I had them on my back.</p>

On the 14th of November, I went with Nowlan to the prisoner's room, I searched every thing in the room but an oak chest, and asked her what was in that; she said, nothing but her own; I asked her where the key was; she said, she had not got it; I told he then, I most break it open immediately; she set down upon it, and said, I had got no authority to break it open, and I should not do it; I pushed her off the box, upon which she said, some strange man had put something in it; I immediately broke it open, and found the things stated in the indictment in a bag. (Produces them.)</p>

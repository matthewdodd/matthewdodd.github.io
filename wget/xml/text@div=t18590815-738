                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Post Office—in consequence of information I received, I made up a test letter on 12th July—I enclosed in it 2 half sovereigns, having previously marked them; I enclosed them in a paper and fastened that in a piece of gum paper—it was addressed to Mary Slade, at Mrs. Grimway's, the Priory, Leyton, Essex; I fastened the envelope with an adhesive seal—I gave that letter to Mr. Clare—if it were posted at the General Post-office it would go through the district where the prisoner was employed—I gave some directions to Mr. Bennett, at the North-Eastern Office—I subsequently went and met Mr. Bennett—I went to the office in Green-street, Bethnal-green, and the prisoner was brought to me just before 9 o'clock in the morning of the 13th, I asked him if he was on duty at the North-Eastern department that morning—he said he was—I asked him if he assisted at the sorting; he said he did not—I said, "Do you know any<lb></lb>thing of a money letter addressed to Mary Slade, Leyton?"—he said he did not—I then directed Bingham, the officer, to search him, and saw him take</p>

I am an inspector of letter-carriers—the prisoner has been about two years a letter carrier attached to the office—on 12th July I received a letter from Mr. Gardner, addressed to Mary Slade, Leyton—I saw that it contained something inside—I posted that letter the next morning at St. Martin's-le-grand, at 5 o'clock in the morning—it would be transmitted from there about a quarter past five—I went about 10 o'clock the same morning to the City of Paris Tavern, in Old Ford-road, kept by Mr. Keymer—he produced three half sovereigns to me, and amongst them I found one which Mr. Gardner identified.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the principal charge taker at the North-Eastern district, Bethnal-green; the prisoner was employed at that office as a letter carrier—he also assisted in sorting the letters—I received the mail-bag from the chief officer about half-past five in the morning of 13th July, and in that bag I found a letter addressed, "Mary Slade, Mrs. Grimway's, the Priory, Leyton, Essex"—Mr. Gardner said something which called my attention to that letter—I handled it, and found it contained coin—about twenty minutes before 7 o'clock I placed that letter on the table amongst the letters which the prisoner had to sort—I saw him sorting the letters amongst which that letter laid—the prisoner was there when I placed that letter there—I saw him sort all the letters—no person was sorting at that table but him—he left the table about ten minutes before 7 o'clock, about ten minutes after I had given him the letter—he then brought the letters for the Loughton-road, where the Leyton letters are taken out, and amongst them this letter ought to have been—he then returned to his seat and remained there till five minutes before 7 o'clock—he then went down, apparently with a view of going to the water-closet—he went in that direction—he was away about ten minutes—when he came back he went to his seat and remained there till twenty-five minutes past 7, when I dispatched the letter carriers, and he went away—after he was gone I looked over the letters in the Leyton box, the one addressed to Mary Slade was not amongst them—I communicated that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder. I had a diamond for cutting glass—I am a glazier occasionally—the prisoner was in my service for a short time before Christmas—I do not think he was in my service for a week altogether—I missed a diamond about a fortnight or three weeks ago—the last time I saw it safe was about two months before that—when I missed it I gave information to the constable—this is my diamond (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by <hi rend="italic">my</hi> son's initials on it, G.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in Essex. About three weeks before Christmas I offered to sell a coat to the prisoner—he afterwards came to my lodgings and took the coat away while I was at home, ill—on Christmas morning I went to a beer house where he was—he said he could not pay for the coat then, but he would as soon as he could—a short time afterwards I received this diamond from him—I was to keep it till he paid for the coat—I gave the diamond to my father, to keep for me—this is the same diamond.</p>

I received information from the prosecutor about this diamond; I made inquiries, and searched—I got some information from William Parish, and went after the prisoner—I apprehended him; I told him what he was charged with—he said, "I hope you won't tell my master that I stole it; I was going to take it back to him again—he said he found it amongst some shavings, outside the shed; and after that he stated that he found it amongst some glass in the yard—I got the diamond from old Parish—this is it.</p>

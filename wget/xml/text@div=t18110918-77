                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180032"></xptr>Q. Who has the lease of that house. - A. I believe Mr. Topham, I never saw the lease, Mr. Topham is in the house constantly. I believe it is in the parish of St. Stephen, Coleman Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner at the bar been in your service some time. - A. The prisoner was in the service when I went to Mr. Topham's house, which is between four and five years, Mr. Durant keeps an office there. We are not partners in business, only joint occupiers of this house, the wages of the servants are paid by us all three, and the house keeping. Suspecting this man's dishonest practises, I examined the chest in which I kept this plate. It was my own.</p>
               <p>Q. What plate did you miss from that chest. - A. Three waiters, some table spoons, some desert spoons, and some forks. When Lavender came the prisoner was in my room, Mr. Durant and myself charged the prisoner with having defrauded us, that is the term I used, Mr. Durant said,</p>
               <p>"no, he has robbed us." He denied having done so, expressed great surprize, and could not tell what we meaned; I told the prisoner I was confident that he had robbed us, and the best course that he could take was to tell us of it.</p>

               <p>Q. You went to the house of Mr. Rowlatt on the evening that we are speaking of. - A. Yes, I went with the prisoner into the pantry, he produced these duplicates from the recess in the pantry, from thence we proceeded into the cellar, he there took some mortar out of a hole in the wall, and produced a quantity of duplicates of different plate belonging to different gentlemen in the house, he was then taken into custody. I have two duplicates which were taken out of the recess in the pantry, of the 5th of November, 1810. One of these duplicates relates to one waiter pawned for twelve pound, and the other to two small ones for five pound, I took these two duplicates to the house of Mrs. Reeve and son. The waiters were delivered to me at Guildhall. These are them.</p>

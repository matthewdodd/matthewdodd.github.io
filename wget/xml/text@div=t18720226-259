                  </hi>. I live at Stephen's Road, South Bow—on the 6th of January I had a horse and van to sell, and was going to Islington—I met the prisoner and gave him a ride, and Hill and Lowe went with us—I sold the horse and van for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which, I believe, the prisoner saw me receive—he said that I had promised him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was false, but I gave him a half-crown—and I thought he would go away, but he did not—he said he wanted a half-crown for the two companions, fifteenpence a-piece—and he struck me in the mouth and knocked me down, and two others who I have not seen since fell on top of me—my money was loose in my right hand trowsers' pocket—the prisoner kicked me in the back and went away.</p>

On the 10th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into the shop - Edwards asked for some childrens' shoes, she bought a pair for 4 s. 9 d. - Smeed was with her. The prisoner, Edwards, gave me two half-crowns and three-pence, I gave her 6 d. Edwards sported some frivolous conversation, which I noticed - they went away together. About nine o'clock the same evening, Gook, the constable, brought the children's shoes to me which Edwards had bought - I knew them to be those which I had sold her. About twenty minutes after ten o'clock, Gook came again with a basket, which contained three other pair of shoes, which I knew to be ours by the private mark - they were on a shelf at the back of the shop; I had dusted them that morning - I had not sold them; they were worth 1 l. Edwards was quite away from that part of the shop, but Smeed was not. No person was in the shop but the prisoners and myself. They did not appear to be intoxicated.</p>

            . I found a pair of children's boots in the prisoner, Edwards's, pocket, when I took her on the other charge. I asked Edwards where she lived? she said, at No. 18, New-street, St. James's - she did not say she lived in the Minories. I went there to inquire, and found she did not live there. I knew her before, and was certain she did not live there. I found the basket at the watch-house in her possession - there were three pairs of shoes in it. Smeed had been committed before this.

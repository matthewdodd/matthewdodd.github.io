            . I was in the employ of John Yates. On the 10th of January, I was in his yard about five o'clock; when the prisoner came in - a waggon was at the gate, and he inquired for one of the carmen - he left a message with me, which I told him I would deliver; I had seen him about the gate with another man - before he came into the yard again I went into the lobby, and then came out, and saw no one about; he then went into a place under the deal piles, where the quarterings were - and I saw him going out of the yard, with these two quarterings on his shoulder; I secured him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner, and have the quarterings which Burke gave me; the prisoner said he had done wrong, but was sure Mr. Yates would forgive him - he was in great distress, and he did not care whether he lived or died.</p>

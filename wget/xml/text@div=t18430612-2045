I was at the Coburg Arms on the morning of the 22nd of March, and saw the prisoner there—I saw him and Luxton fighting for some minutes, from one end of the bar to the other—I went to the bar, hear<lb></lb>ing the noise, and Bennett and I were together, within two or three paces of the prisoner and Luxton—Bennett went to part them—they were standing fighting, but when Bennett got to them through the crowd, the prisoner had slipped down, or been hit down—I saw Bennett in the act of parting Luxton and the prisoner—a quarter of a minute had scarcely elapsed before Bennett joined me again, and said, "They have done it for me," or, "It is done for me," or, "I am hurt"—something to the effect of having his leg hurt—I said, "Nonsense, you can't have had anything done to it more than from the kegs in the bar"—he said, "It is worse than that"—he put his arm on my shoulder, came into the tap-room, pulled up his trowsers, and a stream of blood issued from his left leg, just below the knee—I went in pursuit of</p>

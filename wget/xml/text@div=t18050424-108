               <p>Q. Did any transaction take place on the 29th which induced you to mention that as a date? - A. Upon the 20th of February he sent me six dozen.</p>

               <p>Q. You were not there when they came? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the private passage separated from the shop by a partition? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long afterwards? - A. I think it was about a week afterwards; I had them at two separate times.</p>

               <p>Q. In your other dealings with the prisoner for cards, were the aces delivered in the packs, or were they delivered to you in separate parcels? - A. Always delivered in separate parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon any occasion give orders for cards, and not have them so soon as you expected or wished? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he assign any other reason at any other time when you applied after the 20th of February for aces to make good your packs - did he give you any reason for his not sending the whole packs? - A. He said he had not them by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any the first time you applied for aces for the packs you had received on the 20th? - A. I think I had some on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. To those that were delivered to you on the 20th? - A. I had a few.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had found packs without the aces, in the course of that day you applied to the prisoner? - A. I was gone out at the time they were delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you think you got a few on that day they were delivered to you? - A. I think I had a few.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner assign to you any reason for not furnishing you with all the aces of these packs? - A. He said he had not them by him.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. What difference do you observe in those you bought of the prisoner from others that you bought at other places? - A. There was an additional duty stamped upon what I had seen before.</p>
               <p>Q. You had observed an additional duty upon others? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time state the account as it was between you and the prisoner in payment? - A. I did; as I had wrote it myself I delivered it to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. At Mrs. Spalding's, in Coventry-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find there? - A. I found a great quantity of cards in paper, and aces.</p>

               <p>Q. Open them - they are all marked? - A. Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. State to my Lord and the Jury what they are? - A. Here is one parcel contains fifty-nine aces of spades, another parcel contains seventy-two aces of spades, another parcel contains seventy-two more, another parcel contains sixty-six, and another parcel contains fifty-four.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any packs of cards besides these aces? - A. A great many; they are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many dozens there were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were made up in dozens? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards searched the house of the prisoner, Blacklin, in Queen-street, Cheapside? - A. I did; on the 6th of March, I searched Boddington's apartment, and I searched the prisoner's house on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. These cards you now produce were found at Boddington's house? - A. They were; this parcel contains just a dozen packs, found at Boddington's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me one pack; this pack appears to contain fifty-one cards, and no ace of spades; this is one of the packs that you found at Boddington's; you found, you say, a great many; you do not know how many there are, but they are apparently put up in dozens, which you now produce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the same day you went to the house of the prisoner Blacklin? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from him that that house in Queen-street was his residence? - A. We understood so from himself.</p>

               <p>Q. State to my Lord and the Jury what you found in his house? - A. In the one pair of stairs room, on the left-hand side, apparently used for the kitchen, the prisoner was, and in that room were three boxes which contained cards; in another box there was a few loose packs of cards.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by containing cards, as distinct from loose cards? - A. The boxes that contained cards were quite full, and in the other box was a few loose packs of cards; there were three boxes regularly packed and nailed down.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you know the quantity of dozens contained in each of the boxes? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you these cards here? - A. Yes; this is one of the boxes, and these are the others; they are sealed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Take off the cover of one of them to see how they have been packed? - A. This has been opened.</p>
               <p>Q. That box is made to contain that quantity apparently for the purpose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined any of them to see whether they are perfect packs, or no? - A. Yes, I have examined some of them which are loose in the box; I found them to be packs of cards without any aces of spades.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is one of the sheets of duty aces stamps which he used to work up at Lee's. These that were worked up at Lee's contained only ten on each sheet, and the other, the legal sheet of duty aces stamps, contained twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. These aces were delivered to the prisoner in number to correspond with the packs of cards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You worked from the sheets resembling these which are now produced? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. These two sheets came from Lee's, there is the name of

             upon these two sheets? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that these two sheets were taken from Lee's shop? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. And the aces delivered to the prisoner were made from the sheets corresponding with these? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Lee, I believe, has absconded? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner apply occasionally for cards that he had ordered? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it sometimes happen that you could not execute his orders so early as he wished? - A. Yes, at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that occasioned by the want of cards generally or the want of duty aces? - A. Sometimes the demand was so large that we had not got the cards generally, and sometimes, when we had got the rest of the cards, the aces were wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner on that subject? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then between him and you? - A. I have told him that the aces were out, we had got none in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there ever an occasion happened when you stood still till the plate was engraved? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether at that time the prisoner's orders were unexecuted for want of the aces? - A. He told me so; that he wanted aces of spades, and he could not execute the orders because he had not the aces to put to them; and the orders he had delivered they would not give him the money for them till he had furnished the aces of spades; I told him not to blame my master for it, as the man who had the doing of it had disappointed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us your very expression as you used in your conversation with him at that time, or any other time about a plate? - A. I do not recollect that I told him any thing about a plate; no more than what I have observed to the man that had the doing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The aces that are furnished when the duties are regularly paid are obtained at the Stamp-Office, are they not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that no man, except the person employed by the Stamp-Office, have any thing to do with them till they are delivered to the card-maker? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these regularly and immediately furnished upon application at the Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The duty aces which are delivered from the Stamp-Office, do not they always contain the card-maker's name? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore any that had been issued from the Stamp-Office, your master would have had his name upon them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe that these you have produced, as manufactured at Lee's, have the name of Hart upon them - Was there any maker at the time you were employed by Lee, of the name of Hart, that you were acquainted with? - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you pretty well acquainted with the makers in town? - A. Yes, I know them.</p>
               <p>Q. And I suppose you have worked for many of them - Did you know Hart when he was in the trade? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long ago it is since he left off? - A. I believe about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if he had been in the trade, it is probable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240087"></xptr>you should have known it? - A. I certainly should.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner visited Lee's house occasionally, did he come where you passed? - A. We pasted backwards, he very seldom came there, he was sometimes there.</p>
               <p>Q. He came sometimes there, while you were actually pasting these plates, which are half the size of the legal plates? - A. I do not recollect seeing him there while we were in the act of doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. What price did he pay Lee for the cards he had bought of him? - A. I do not rightly know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Blacklin about it? - A. I have heard Blacklin say that my master charged him too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know from Blacklin himself what his selling price was, when he was stating to you that your master charged him too much for them - Do you know what he sold them at himself? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he a customer of Lee's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deal to a large amount? - A. Yes, he used to be one of Mr. Lee's principal customers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gross a month did Lee make? - A. I suppose about thirteen or fourteen gross per month.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you happen to know what the duty would be, if they were bought at the Stamp-Office? - A. Half a crown a pack.</p>
               <p>Q. And he would make about thirteen gross per month. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbs. Three thousand two hundred and forty-two pounds a year, and more than that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Did Mr. Lee use some legal stamps? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use some that were not legal stamps? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What proportion did one bear to another? - A. He very seldom used more than one hundred and forty packs per month.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner was his principal customer? - A. Latterly he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they upon the footing of intimacy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon some occasion you supped together with him? - A. I did, in Christmas week.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Lee supped at Blacklin's house with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those sheets in the name of Hart, the sheets that you used to work up for the greatest part of your trade? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. This is from the same impression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all sold to the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Blacklin, made with these aces? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What we call, at the present, forged aces? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From your own knowledge of aces do you know whether these are legal or forged? - A. They are not legal, they are forged.</p>
               <p>Q. And all that Lee sold to Blacklin were of that manufactory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not the cards, with the card denoting the stamp-duty of the card-maker, generally issued in this form, with the paper stamp on the wrapper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is bound to do it under a penalty, and indeed a man buying them, without that, subjects himself to a penalty - Were any of these cards that were sold by Lee to Blacklin issued in this form? - A. I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these - Is that the form in which they were always delivered? - A. Yes, in a white wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the aces of spades delivered in that wrapper, or in separate parcels? - A. Always in separate parcels by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner complain at any time, either in, or not in, Lee's presence, that his orders were not executed speedy enough? - A. Never before me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the Inspector of the Stamp-Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you, sir? - A. Seventy-two.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that thirty-six dozen and the corresponding aces (Lee's aces) that were found at Boddington's? - A. There are seventy-two, and each corresponds to the thirty-six dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. For what number of years have you been an Inspector? - A. About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. From inspecting these aces, are you able to say whether they are from any instrument issued at the Stamp-Office? - A. They certainly did not come from the Stamp-Office.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What aces are they? - A.(Mr. Fielding.) Part of the parcel marked B. containing seventy-two aces, being part of what was found at Boddington's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look them all over, Mr. Merchant; are you enabled to say what they are? - A. They are all of them forged, Mr. Hart has not gone beyond the number 80; I mean, there has been, I believe, no aces issued from the Stamp-Office, in the name of Hart, beyond the number of 80; these are 112, 113, 114, 115, and 116.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. Genuine ones, in the name of Hart, never exceeded the number 80.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the other seven aces found at Boddington's? - A. They are all a forgery, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240088"></xptr>are from the same plate, and the same numbers, from 112 to 116.</p>
               <p>Q. The paper 8, containing 59 aces of spades, what are they? - A. These are the same, and appear from the same impression, and contain the same number; the paper marked B contains six aces, they are forged; and the plate E is a forgery, containing fifty-four aces: they appear to be from the same plate.</p>
               <p>Q. The one that was in the pocket-book of the prisoner, the ace of spades which the officer took out of the pocket-book, which was in his pocket and on his person, look at that, and tell me whether that is a forgery; it is in the name of Hart? - A. It is the same, and marked 112, a higher number than Hart ever had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. We now shew him the two papers marked

            , which Wright said he brought from Mr. Lee's manufactory - Do these appear to you to be a forgery, and to resemble those you have already looked at in these cards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they imitations, and do they bear resemblance to those which were issued by the Stamp-Office? - A. Certainly they are an imitation of those which were issued by the Stamp-Office while Hart was in the trade, but the numbers do not agree.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Were you engraver at the Stamp-Office at that time? - A. No, I have examined the books, I find none higher than 80, and I have heard from my predecessor.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that of your own knowledge; your only reason for believing these are forgeries is there are higher numbers, which somebody has told you are higher than Hart ever had? - A. Certainly these numbers do not correspond with the numbers belonging to Hart at the Stamp-Office.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know, you not being engraver at the Stamp-Office at that time; there may be other plates besides those which you have seen. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. I now shew him a genuine plate, a sheet containing twenty impressions, with the name of Hart on them; look at that and look at the ten; and look whether those of the ten, found at Lee's with the name of Hart - Do they appear to be made with a view to imitate them? - A. They are done to imitate.</p>
               <p>Q. From your inspection of the legal one of twenty, and the other of ten impressions on Lee's paper, do they appear to be done with imitation of the genuine plates issued by the Stamp-Office? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are Secretary to the Stamp-Office, you have been so sometime? - A. From the year 1801.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that time you were Deputy Secretary? - A. Yes, and I was First Clerk for a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are conversant with the business I take it for granted? - A. Yes; the aces are issued from the plates in sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. How many in a sheet? - A. There are twenty in a sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when Hart was card-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this sheet, and tell me whether this sheet is from the plate engraved for Hart? - A. It is the same as was used by Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you searched the office books, to see how high Hart's numbers went? - A. I have, I do not find that they went higher than 80.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had gone higher than 80, must not you have found it in your search? - A. From the search I do not find any above 80, and I have searched with all the diligence I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the person who was engraver at the time Hart was a maker living or dead? - A. Dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Merchant succeeded him? - A. Mr. Merchant was his assistant for some time, and afterwards succeeded him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You say probably there may be numbers above 80? - A. I cannot say whether there are or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have said you searched? - A. Yes, I cannot find any above 80; I cannot say any thing respecting the cards.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you searched the Stamp-Office with your best diligence, to find whether there are any above 80? - A. I find none beyond 80, there is no record beyond 80.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you searched any of the warrants? - A. I have only searched the books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. They are regularly entered in the book? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. You find no entry beyond 80? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been must not you have found them in your searching? - A. I think so; I have gone from 1765 up to 1800; I have searched all that period, and there are none higher than 80.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not believe there are any higher than 80? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to believe or suspect there are any beyond 80? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You said you had not got the warrants of the Commissioners of the Office, to see if there were any plates ordered beyond 80; you have not been furnished with these warrants? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Would not those warrants have enabled you to make a better search; what do you mean by not having the warrants? - A. I have only examined the entry of the order-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240089"></xptr>Q. The entry in the order-book is a transcript of the warrants? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. What book have you examined? - A. Only the order-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear that there are no higher numbers? - A. To the best of my belief there are no higher numbers than 80.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. The person to whom the warrants were delivered was the engraver you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever there is a warrant of that sort made, there is an entry made of the order, and a specimen of the stamp afterwards taken; you have seen no entry beyond 80? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The person to whom this warrant is given is the engraver, and the order of that engraving is entered in the book, and you have searched that book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the engraving is made there is an impression taken from it and kept? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you find no order of the engraving, nor any impression? - A. There is no order of engraving, nor any impression in that book.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Whose book is this? - A.(Mr. Garrow.) The prisoner's, which Rivett has spoken of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetham. I found this accompt in the green book, in the ledger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is the accompt which Boddington said he wrote, stating the transaction between him and the prisoner, and found in the ledger.</p>
               <p>(Read in Court.) Dtr. Mr. Blacklin with T. Boddington. - On the debtor side is cash, 5 l. - 26 draft, 24 l. 16 s. - 8 pans - 17 draft, Mr. Seck, 21 l. On creditor side, Jan. 16, ban, one cants. of Co. - February 3d, 10 compts, 4 yellows, 28 l. 13 s. one pans, 2 l. 2 s. - 36 dozen, W. P. in red ink - 14 with a stroke, 25 l. 4 s. - and two books, 5 s. The whole of that 36 dozen is in red ink, except the sum, the 14 with a stroke is with red ink, and all this carried out with a stroke in common ink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will just shew one of the forged cards; you will see the forged card has not the additional duty at the bottom; at the bottom of the forged card there is nothing but the word Hart; on the legal one there is the word additional duty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. At the time that I received these cards, I did not know that there were any aces of spades that were forged, I understood that they were foreign cards brought from abroad; I shortly after was informed that a large quantity of waste paper had been sold to the Neckinger Mill Company about two years ago, and which I have always since understood; the Neckinger Mill Company purchased at Somerset-house these aces amongst the quantities of waste paper which they purchased at Somerset-house.</p>

            , on the 26th of February, in the 45th year aforesaid, did feloniously vend and sell divers playing cards, liable to a stamp duty, with counterfeited marks on the spotted side of the said cards, counterfeiting an impression of certain marks directed to be used by a certain Act of Parliament, made at Westminster, in the 29th year of his Majesty's reign, entitled an Act for granting to his Majesty several additional stamp duties on cards and dice, and several former Acts of Parliament, relating to cards made fit for sale in Great Britain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. I take this to be the most convenient time to state my objections, and to make an arrest of judgment, if the case should require it, as it does not appear to me that this offence is particularly described by either of these Counts.</p>
               <p>The evidence that we have heard does not prove any offence within this Act of Parliament upon which this indictment is framed, the 29th of 
               <persName id="t18050424-108-person1030">George</persName>
             the Third; the words are, that if any person shall counterfeit, or forge, or procure to be forged or counterfeited, or vend and sell any stamp or mark to be used relating to cards, dice, or newspapers, or shall counterfeit or resemble the same, with such counterfeit marks thereon, knowing the same to be counterfeited, shall be guilty of felony.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship will see that they are, by another Act of Parliament, directed to apply this stamp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240090"></xptr>not upon any of the cards, but upon the wrapper; the statute I allude to is the 9th of Ann, chap. 28, sect. 41, there the Commissioners are directed to put this stamp on the wrapper of these cards. I submit to your Lordship, it may be said that subsequent Acts of Parliament have added additional duties, still if the original statute of Ann is not repealed, whatever number of duties may be added, the stamp must be in the same place, and in the same manner, as it is pointed out by the said Act of Parliament; and any stamp put in any other manner, is a stamp which the Commissioners are not authorized to put on. I submit to your Lordship, as it appears to me, this man did not vend any of these stamps upon wrappers, nor any stamp upon cards, and if the Commissioners are authorized, by any subsequent Act of Parliament, to put the stamp upon a particular card, then this indictment has not made out the case, because this indictment is not for the offence of putting the stamp upon a particular card. I desired these two Counts to be read, and your Lordship will find that it is both uttering and vending stamps, not upon a particular card, but stamps upon playing cards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. If I understand the meaning of the word cards right, it must be a perfect pack of cards; the uttering of any one card would not be a felony within the meaning of this Act of Parliament, but by making use of the word playing cards. We must likewise see what the Legislature thought proper to impose upon selling such cards. The duty has been imposed upon a pack of playing cards, it is so stated upon the face of this indictment to be playing cards, and the evidence has been, in this case, of uttering cards without the aces of spades. The cards, without the aces of spades, cannot be considered as playing cards, nor can the ace of spades sold by itself at any time be said to be playing cards. In all cases of forgery, it is necessary that the forged instrument should be in all parts the similitude of the true; in this case there arises an objection, namely, it does not appear to be a pack of cards within the meaning of the words in this Act of Parliament, nor is it that which upon the face of the indictment it charges the prisoner with. It charges the prisoner with uttering, vending, and selling playing cards, when, in point of fact, the only evidence that has been introduced on the part of the prosecution have only supported the sale of a parcel of fifty-one cards, and not a pack of cards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. It has been stated to your Lordship, that we cannot possibly support this indictment that charges the prisoner with having sold cards with counterfeit stamps, which must mean a counterfeit stamp on the wrapper; for the learned Serjeant says there is no Act justifies any stamp upon these cards. The 9th of Ann, which directs stamps to be put on the wrapper, which is true, but my answer is a positive denial on the fact, from subsequent Acts of Parliament on the case, which he had either forgotten or omitted. The 10th of Ann, chap. 19, sect. 162, it is enacted, that on one card in each pack shall be marked on the spotted side thereof. Your Lordship will go to the 5th of 
               <persName id="t18050424-108-person1031">George</persName>
             the Third, chap. 46, sect. 9, which I do not find to be repealed, it there directs the Commissioners to provide a new stamp for the wrapper. No, for the ace of spades, and to make distinction between those meant for home consumption and those for exportation, and then it directs that which has always been observed by the Stamp Office, and which they have been studiously attentive to, that one of the sixpenny duties shall be denoted on the wrapper, and another also is directed to be put on the wrapper, and one of these sixpenny duties is also directed to be denoted on the ace of spades. I am not sure that any former Act mentions the ace of spades, but the 10th of Ann having directed it to be on the spotted side of one of the cards, and practice has continued it on the ace of spades. The next argument that fell from a learned friend of mine was, that the Act which prohibits the selling of playing cards with counterfeit stamps, must mean to prohibit vending packs of cards with counterfeit stamps, and that there is no evidence in this case of the vending a pack of cards, only a parcel of fifty-one, and that therefore this case is not within the Act. Certainly, without deviating from the indulgence which is permitted to the Counsel of a prisoner, I might have interrupted him when he was addressing your Lordship, though in fact he was addressing the Jury, when he was stating that there was not sufficient evidence to go to a Jury. Your Lordship will see there is not only evidence, but decisive evidence, and the fact is most certain, that the packs are sold in this way: - If I was to sell a dozen, containing each fifty-one in one parcel, and I sell another parcel containing twelve aces of spades, which two parcels together make twelve packs, if it was necessary to prove his selling these cards, and delivering them in this way, there is no doubt from the evidence. In the first place, do they bargain for cards containing each fifty-one? No; they bargain for a gross, or packs of cards; what or how much a dozen, for what is a dozen parcels of cards without the aces of spades? No, they include the aces of spades, there is no additional price for the aces of spades that these people were to pay, I will prove it by Boddington, who bought thirty-six dozen, and the evidence has said they would not pay for the cards, they would not pay the man till he had sent out the aces of spades. It is beyond all possibility of a doubt that the prisoner not only sold, but actually delivered packs of cards, and that it is proved beyond<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240091"></xptr>all possibility of a doubt or hesitation, that there were all these packs of cards not only sold, but a specific price to be given for each pack.</p>
               <p>Court. I consider it as an offence undoubtedly upon which the Revenue has been defrauded in the strictest sense of the words of the Act of Parliament, that is on record, because there are fifty-one in one parcel, and one in another, which made up the pack of cards.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To the Secretary of the Stamp Office.) Whether you know of any cards being sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. There were some sold, but I do not know to whom.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Mr. Solicitor of the Stamp Office.) Do you know of any being sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. A society of gentlemen proposed to convert old paper into new, they applied to Government for authority to purchase the waste paper at the Stamp Office, and Government conceiving it was for the benefit of the public, the Commissioners were directed to sell their waste paper for the purpose of being converted into new paper, consequently the Commissioners did dispose of a great quantity of waste paper, amongst which there were cancelled aces of spades, which were brought from the card-makers, with the corners cut off; the Company, at the same time, giving this most positive assurance, that the paper would be immediately plunged into the caldron, and at once destroyed; this Company and manufactory failed, they did not perform their engagement by destroying this waste paper, they afterwards advertised their stock to be sold, and amongst the other things the aces of spades were sold cancelled, and with the corners cut off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that all the aces of spades that they sold the corners were cut off? - A. Mr. Lee applied with a feigned name, they were not sold in sheets, I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Robey, the auctioneer, sold these goods for the Neckinger Mill Company; I gave my attorney yesterday evening some aces of spades which Mr. Lee had purchased of the Neckinger Mill Company, he purchased vast quantities, and my attorney has some of the aces without the corners being cut off; I have been informed that they sold a vast quantity which originally came from Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, you are to understand that they waited for the aces of spades while they were engraving the plate, therefore this could not be from that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

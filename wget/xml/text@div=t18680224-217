On Thursday, 23rd January, I received a key from a constable—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it is the key of my wine cellar—I had not missed it—I last saw it in my wife's davenport; that was where it was ordinarily kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Charlotte Street, Portland Place, and am porter at Shoolbred's, the linen drapers—the prisoner came to me on Sunday night, 28th December—he asked me to get him a lodging at the same part; where I was living, because he wanted to come up that way, as he was going to leave his situation at Mr. Sterry's—I had known him previously by seeing him and passing the morning—I got him a lodging at 22, Grafton Street, Tottenham Court Road, and on Wednesday, 22nd January, I went there to him—he asked me if I would spend an hour with him; I said I did not mind, and in the course of conversation he said he had a key belonging to Mr. Sterry's wine cellar, which he had in his pocket—he spoke about a secret, about, another key, the key of the davenport where Mrs. Sterry</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240005"></xptr>
               <p>kept her money—he said he had not got it in his possession now, but pro<lb></lb>vided I could get the cook to fetch out some wine with the key he had, and which he would give me, he would let me know where he had the secret key of the davenport hid in the house—Howard is the cook's name, he knew the name and so did I—he asked me if she could be trusted—I said I did not think she would do such a thing—he gave me the key; this is it—he told me the way she could use it, that it was to be put in the lock upside down and reverse it, and to be sure not to take it out until such time as the door was shut—I put the key in my pocket—I invited the prisoner home to dinner, and detained him all day, expecting to find out where thekey of the davenport was; I could not do so—and I left him about twelve o'clock and went straight to Albany Street Police Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On the morning of 23rd January, about half-an hour after midnight, Cartwright came and gave information to the acting inspector on duty, and from his instructions I went down to Leman Street station, and from instructions I received there I apprehended the prisoner about seven o'clock that same evening, at the corner of Devon<lb></lb>shire Street and Charlotte Street—I told him I wanted him for the unlawful possession of a key belonging to Mr. Sterry—he said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in service at 1, Hanover Terrace, Notting Hill—I was fellow servant with the prisoner at Mr. Sterry's—in July I was helping him clean the pantry—a black, dirty board that was used to stand the hot water cans on was moved, and the prisoner picked up a key; this is it—I had not heard of any key being missed while I was there—neither of us knew to what lock it belonged—I know Sarah Howard, the cook—Cartwright was paying his addresses to her—I was in the kitchen when he threatened to give the prisoner a sound thrashing, and do him some harm if he possibly could, because he and the cook could not agree.</p>

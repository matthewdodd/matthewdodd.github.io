               <p>WILLIAM BEAMS. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Tebbs and Sons, proctors, Doctors' Commons. I produce a paper, purporting to be the will of George Friend, which I received from the prisoner Morgan, in the office of Messrs. Tebbs and Sons, about the 23rd or 24th of March; their office is in the City - nobody was with him when he brought it; it was brought for the purpose of obtaining probate - I put several questions to him - he described himself as the executor named in the will, and a relative of the deceased; he brought it to me to be proved- I asked him about the amount of the property; he said he was not prepared to say what it was - he called on me several times on the subject of the will; a few days after his first calling I received intimation from Mr. Hughes, solicitor for the prosecution, and from two persons calling themselves next of kin, that the will was supposed to be a forgery, in consequence of which I told Morgan it would be necessary for me to see the witnesses, and he brought the prisoner Dalton; I had a conversation about it, principally with Dalton - when they came in Morgan said the man with him was Dalton; I produced the will, pointed to his name on it, and asked if that was his name and hand-writing - he said, "Yes, that is my name and handwriting;" this is the will (looking at it) - Dalton said the will was made at a public-house in Whitechapel, and that it was written by Teighe; that Morgan had asked him(Dalton) if he could make the will for his relative, Mr. Friend - that he said he was not in the habit of doing such things, but that his friend, Mr. Teighe, he thought would make it, which he consented to, and paper and pens being procured. Teighe proceeded to make it; he said this was done at the Seven Stars public-house - that after the will had been made it was read over to Friend, the deceased, at the Seven Stars, and the deceased then made his mark to it, in the presence of the witnesses, and then he (Dalton) and the other witnesses signed their names to it; I told him it had been stated that the will was forged, and it would be necessary to be particular in what he stated - I told Morgan at that interview, that it would be necessary I should see the otherwitnesses, and any witnesses who could prove that he was a relative of the deceased: I think I told him this after Dalton's statement - they then left, Morgan promising to bring the other witnesses; a day or two afterwards Morgan brought me a woman, calling herself Mary Mason - I have since heard her called Brannan; I could not swear to her if I saw her; she stated that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170004"></xptr>her name was Mary Mason, in the presence of Morgan - he said he had brought that woman up, who could say something about his relationship to Friend, the deceased, and she said she had been in the company of the deceased and Morgan several times, and upon those occasions had heard Friend, the deceased, call Morgan his nephew, and Morgan call him his uncle, and I think she added that she had heard Friend say he wished to do something for his nephew, Morgan - I think she said she did not know any thing about the will: Morgan introduced Teighe to me three or four days after this; he said that was Mr. Teighe, the writer of the will, or the witness to the will, I cannot say which; I produced the will to Teighe - he took it in his hands: I said, "I believe you are the writer of this will, Mr. Teighe, are you not?" having looked at it attentively, and read a great part of it, he said it was his handwriting - I called his attention to the name purporting to be his signature, and asked him if the name 
               <persName id="t18320517-1-person116">
                  Robert

             was his hand-writing; he said it was - I asked him when and where it was made, and under what circumstances; he stated, in Morgan's hearing, that he and Dalton were walking along Whitechapel together, they went into a public-house opposite Red Lion-street, Whitechapel - they went into a room where there was an old man with 
               <persName id="t18320517-1-person117">
                  Andrew 
                  Morgan

             and a woman - that Dalton asked him (Teighe) if he would make a will for the old man; he said he would- that pen, ink, and paper were then brought to him, and he inquired of the old man his name, and how he wished to dispose of his property - that Friend, the deceased, then stated the names of the several persons to whom he would leave his property, and the amounts he wished to leave them (I am not quite positive whether he called him Friend or the deceased) - that having completed writing the will, he then read it all over to the deceased, that the deceased appeared to understand it, and then said he would make his mark to it - that the deceased did make his mark to it, in the presence of himself and the other witnesses - that the witnesses then signed their names to the will, and I think he added that he then gave the will to the deceased, and the deceased gave it to Morgan; I then told Morgan he must bring up the other witness, Mary Pringle - he said he had already been in search of her, but could not find her, and he had heard that she was gone into the country - Pringle was never produced to me; I told Morgan that as there were other persons who asserted themselves as next of kin, and he having 'said he was next of kin, and the nephew, it was necessary he should bring forward persons to prove his relationship - he said he was the nephew, that the deceased was born at Ayr, in Scotland, and that he was the brother of his (Morgan's) mother - that he had been sent for by his uncle, the deceased, from Liverpool; I think he said it was in December last, being at Liverpool, he met a man named Burns, whom he knew, and Burns told him he had lately come from London, that previous to his leaving London he had seen his uncle, the deceased, Friend, and that he had requested him to tell Morgan he wished to see him, and in consequence of that he came to London in a short time after: a day or two after this conversation be brought me a letter - (looking at a letter produced by Lea) this is it: he was alone then - he said that was a letter he had written when at Shields, to a Mrs. Teighson, in answer to a message which she had sent by a woman to him, when at Shields; it has the North Shields post-mark on it - (read.)</p>

               <p>MRS. TRIGHSON, North Shields, 6th of March, 1832.</p>
               <p>I return you my most sincere thanks for your informing the bearer to let me know that my uncle, George Friend, of No. 31, Glasshouse-yard, Minories, desires me to return to London as soon as possible, and when you receive this letter I hope you can make it convenient to call and inform him I do not think I shall be able to be in town before the latter end. of March or the beginning of April; so no more at present, from your's &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A.MORGAN.</p>
               <p>This letter was directed to Mrs. Teighson, at No. 12, White Horse-place, Vinegar-lane, Commercial-road, London, but the letters son had been evidently added to the name Teighe, in a different coloured ink.</p>
               <p>MR. BEAMS. I said to Morgan "Why did not Mrs. Teighson bring that letter up with her;" he replied that she was engaged that day, and could not come, but he would bring her on the following day, and on the following day Morgan came, and a woman with him - I asked the woman if her name was Teighson, in his presence; she said it was -I then requested Morgan to leave the office, as I wished to speak to her privately on the subject of the letter, and he left; I had a conversation with her about the letter - nothing more passed between us in Morgan's presence; I called him in, and they went away together - I said nothing to him about what had passed between me and the woman; Morgan afterwards produced a man named Corbold to me, as a person who had known him and Friend to be related; Corbold merely stated that he had heard Friend call Morgan his nephew, and Morgan call Friend his uncle; the will has never been proved.</p>

             PRINGLE. I am single - I have been married. About March last I lived at No. 6, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel - Mr. and Mrs. Fallon lived in the same house with me, and Morgan lived in the same room; Mrs. Fallon was called Paternoster also - she is the prisoner at the bar; I never saw the deceased, Friend, in my life - in March last, three or four days after the Fast-day, I saw the prisoner Morgan write a paper in Fallon's room; Fallon, Paternoster, and I were there at the time, and Fallon's little boy, who is seven or eight years old; a sheet of paper was sent for - they did not at that time say what was going to be done with it; Morgan read it to me after it was done, and said it was a will.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose will? A.Mr. Friend's - I recollect his reading that Thomas Fallon was to have 50l., Paternoster 40l., Mrs. Pringle 10l., and the poor of the parish 10l.; Morgan said Mr. Friend was his uncle, and he was to have the rest of the property after the legacies were paid.</p>
               <p>Q. On another day after that, or the next day, was another paper, different to that, produced by Morgan? A. Yes - it was on the next day; this is the paper (looking at the will) - Morgan read it over to me; Fallon and Paternoster were in the room - the legacies were less than they were before; I do not recollect that Morgan said any thing about the legacies, nor who had written that paper; Morgan said several times that he would give all the legatees coffee - I had not heard the word legatee before; the

             on a bill for an assault, at Hicks'-hall; that was the name of a man I had lived with for eleven years, and who I had buried - I thought more of him than I did of my husband, as he used me better than my husband; I never swore in the name of Francis - I went by that name, as I lived with a man of that name two years; I was sent from Lambeth-street to the House of Correction, just after Christmas, about a cloak, which I had pawned for 1s. - I was fined 20s., and, as I could not pay it, was sent there for a month- I was never in any other prison in my life; I get my living chiefly by slop-work - I work early and late; I live in the same house as Mr. Notman, but he does not assist me - I pay rent: I sometimes borrow a few shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you rather surprised at finding a legacy left you by a gentleman you never knew? A. Yes - I said I wished I had the money then; I did not go to the proctor's, because they thought I was not staunch enough.</p>
               <p>Q. If your memory had been good enough you would have gone? A. I do not know whether I should - (here the witness wrote her name) - there was never any charge against me except about the cloak; Mr. Coard, of Lucas-street, made no charge against me - he said he wished I would try and get the tickets of some things which had been pawned by Mrs. Fallon, and a woman who worked for her and a girl; I was with a girl when she pawned some things in the Minories - I did not pawn them; I have pawned many things on my own account - I wanted to give my own name; the girl said, "Don't give that name, because it is your own;" I cannot swear what name I gave - I never had any thing for making affidavits, nor was any thing promised me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. If they had given you the 10l., would you have taken it? A. I do not know, for I always said they would not get it - if I had thought I had a right to it, I should have taken it; I did not sign the paper - I cannot write the name of Elliot; I cannot write all the letters of the alphabet - I can write Carnell and Pringle, that is all; when I signed the name Carnell, I was representing that a man was present who was not - I was not aware that I was doing wrong then, though I have found that out now; when I used the name of Elliot, I stated that I was aunt to a man named Johnson, which was false - the second paper, which is this will, was brought up ready written; I do not know where it was written.</p>
               <p>Q. Read these names, and tell me which is first? A. Robert Teighe. John Dalton, and Mary Pringle, as witnesses; that is just the way in which they were read to me- I cannot read them here, but I recollect them, as they were read to me; I do not know what word stands before Robert Teighe; they said witness was put under my name here - it was read to me at the time; I have seen this paper a good many times since it was written - I know this word is witnesses, because I was told so: Morgan brought it in this state, and read it to me - he said, "Do you think you can write like that?" I said No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You made the affidavit in the name of Elliot, to oblige Morgan and Fallon? A. Yes -I received no money for it, nor was I promised any; they wanted money very bad at that time, to pay their rent, and I did it to oblige them; I used to work in the house with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170006"></xptr>them, and what money we earned we shared alike, but I never had money only by board and lodging - (looking at a paper) I wrote this at Mr. Hughes'; I have written in short Mary for Mary Ann - it is written the best way I can.</p>

            , who lived in Glasshouse-yard, Minories. On the morning of the 17th of March he was found dead in his room in Glasshouse-yard - I always wrote his name for him Frind; he was no scholar - his wife was my husband's aunt- she had been dead about fourteen years; I have been in the habit of going to see him once a week or once a fortnight for the last forty years, either my husband or me - I always kept his accounts for him; I always understood he had a trifle of property - he told me the night before he died that he was nearly seventy-seven years old, but he was only seventy-six.</p>

               <p>Q. What state of strength was he in for the last two or three months? A. He walked with two sticks, his knees lapped one over the other, and he was very heavily rupturned - he was an hour and a half going to the bottom of the Minories; he told me so - his legs went across one another: he could scarcely drag one foot after the other; I have seen him walk - he walked with very great pain and difficulty, and very slow - that was his state in January, and for months before; I am very confident he had no acquaintance with any of the prisoners, or he would have told me - he had no acquaintance at all, he kept none; he was so very near, he would not let any body know he had money; he had been a shoemaker, but latterly had been employed opening and shutting shops, and carrying heavy loads - he was never a seafaring man; he was born at Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of any relative of his besides yourself and husband? A. yes, two second cousins, Mrs. Collins and Mrs. Lewis - they are married; he had no nephew at the time of his death, nor any other relative; he told me he had no relation but a brother, who was dead, and these two women - I was with him on Saturday, and went on Tuesday; he was then poorly - I was there daily four days before he died, and was with him the evening before he died; in the afternoon as he died at night he was up, and perfectly sensible (he never kept his bed) I said, "Mr. Frind, you are very ill, as life is uncertain, and you have got some money, have you settled who you will leave it to?" or words to that effect, "And where would you like to be buried if you should die;" he made no will - he never mentioned such a thing as a will to me; he never mentioned either of the prisoners to me; his two female cousins had been to see him two days before he died; I had never seen them myself till then - they attended his funeral.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Perhaps you expected a legacy yourself? A. I did not - I thought he might think I wanted his money, and never mentioned it till then, as I thought he might live many years after me; he was very infirm in his limbs; I know he used to shut up Mr. Mills' shop, but cannot say how long that was before he died; I was ill in bed for about five weeks, and did not see him all January - I do not exactly know whether I saw him before the 15th of February; my husband attended him when I was ill - Mills' shop is forty or fifty houses from where he lived; he lived on the ground floor, and let out the two upper rooms - he had kept the house for twenty-five years; Mills is a stay-maker - it is not a very large shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Have you made any claim to the property? A. We had no claim; we stated it to the broker, and he told us we had no claim - I told Mr. Lake, the landlord of Frind's house, there were two nearer relations than me, and he said I was not entitled to any thing - we never claimed his property; we only went to the broker to be satisfied what property he had.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew this man for forty years? A. Nearly so; he could not write nor read - I saw him last before I was ill two or three days before New-year's day; he was very lame then, but had a good appetite - he could eat the round of a quartern loaf, but was very infirm in his legs and body, and had been so for three months before I was taken ill - he went regularly twice every Sunday to Dr. Povah's church, in Duke's-place; I have been there with him - he was a long time walking: I used to meet him there, and go home with him, and have been three quarters of an hour or more going; I never heard of his doing business on Sundays - he was very strict; I never knew him go to a public-house on Sunday - I think I once heard him say he went and had half a pint of porter, because he was very ill, and could scarcely reach home - that was twelve months ago; it was because he was poorly.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he still go to church when you saw him after your illness? A. I do not know; it is nearly twelve months since I went with him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARDING. I am a Greenwich pensioner. Frind married my sister; I have been in the habit of going to his place in Glasshouse-yard for the last fourteen years, since I have been home - I went to see him about Christmas last; I saw him while my wife was ill - he had been an ailing man for years; he was very infirm indeed, and badly ruptured - he had no wounds on his legs, but was lame; he walked very had with two sticks - one knee went over the other, and he could scarcely make a walk of it; he was in that state last Christmas, and for some time before; I went to see him every time I came to town, which was once a month - I saw him last on the Friday before he died; he had no nephew - he had two cousins; their names were Silk before marriage, now one is Collins, and the other I do not remember - my mother's maiden name was Cumber; I know of no other relations which he had - I never saw the prisoners till they were at Lambeth-street; Frind was a very eccentric man, and never kept any company at all- I never had any conversation with him about his property; if I mentioned any thing of the kind to him be always waved the subject - he never told me he had made a will.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Perhaps you thought he would leave you something? A. I did not expect but what he would, for nobody ever went to him, except me or my wife; he was ill for a number of years, but he used to crawl out to shut up Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170007"></xptr>Mills' shop, at the bottom of the Minories, sixty or seventy houses from where he lived - I have gone with him, and put the shutters up for him; they are very light - he never frequented a public-house, but always had his beer at home; I suppose he shut up Mills' shop till within the last six or seven months - he might have done it a few days before he died, for all I know; I may have seen him twice while my wife was ill - I called on Lake, the landlord, after Frind's death, with my wife; I did not claim any thing; I only went to know about burying him - I did not claim his property; I told Lake what Frind told me I should have, which was his watch - I asked for nothing else; I asked a pensioner if I could make any claim on the property - I went to Mr. Johnson, the broker, to know what he died worth, as I thought he might know - he might have acquaintances which I knew nothing about.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What was Johnson? A. A stockbroker; it was a year and a half ago that I helped Frind to shut up the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him in January, and he was very infirm, do you think he could walk to Whitechapel-church? A. I do not think he could; he kept lodgers - my wife can tell their names, as she kept his books; I think there were lodgers in one floor in January, but am not aware whether there were any on the other.</p>
               <p>MRS. HARDING. He let two rooms to separate lodgers; I believe he had only one in January - it was a man and woman named Steward; they did not pay, and he turned them away, but he had other lodgers at the time of his death.</p>

I said Yes; Bishop's is a wine-vaults just round the corner from where Frind died - they asked me what property it was; I said I did not know, for it was advertised, and I may have said in the newspaper, and after that Morgan asked Smith, the landlord, to let him have a newspaper - I did not know the name of the person whose property my husband was taking care of; I did not see a newspaper brought - they wished me to have something to drink, but I declined; this was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and about twelve I took my husband's dinner to Glasshouse-yard, and found Morgan and Fallon standing by the door outside, and my husband standing outside with his back against the door, with a pot of porter - Morgan said,"Here she comes;" they offered me the pot to drink - I said No, and said I was very much astonished to find them there with my husband; they said if I did not like to have that, I might have ale, or any thing else; I said No, I would have nothing - Morgan said to my husband, "Open the door and let us go in," and said he belonged to the property, for he had got a will and power; he put his hand to his coat, as if to take out some papers - my husband said, if he had he had better go to Mr. Lake, his master: Fallon afterwards said to Morgan, "Come away, it won't do" - he took him by the arm, and took him away from the door; my husband said he had not got the key of the door, as they said they wanted to go in - I had been in the house with my husband's meals, but did not stay many minutes, and did not notice what was in it; I was not asked what sort of property was in the house, nor what property Frind bad left.</p>
               <p>Morgan. Q.How long was it from the time you saw us at the Seven Stars, till we were at the house? A. I was at the public-house between nine and ten o'clock, and took my husband's dinner at ten minutes past twelve.</p>

I remember Morgan and Fallon coming; I was outside the door at the time - it might be a week or a fortnight after the funeral, I cannot remember; Fallon came up to me first- I did not observe them before, and cannot say whether they had been together; Fallon came up alone, and said he had an old friend coming to see me - he did not say who it was; (I had seen Fallon before) - Morgan came up a few minutes afterwards, and asked if I had possession of the house; I said Yes - he asked if I would let him in to see what things there were in the house; I told him No, that I had not got the key of the place; that my master had it (I had got it) - Morgan then asked if I would have any beer; I said I did not care - I had never seen him before; he fetched a pot - Fallon gave Morgan the money to pay for it; Morgan then told me he was executor; that he had got the will and power in his own possession.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose will and power? A. Mr. Frind's; he did not say so - nothing had been said about any body; I told him if he had be had better go to my master, who could give him a better account than I could; my wife was then standing close by - she had brought my dinner - it might be a little after twelve o'clock; they said nothing else, but went away.</p>
               <p>Morgan. Q. Is your wife deranged at times, or insensible? A. No - I cannot deny but that she takes a drop now and then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was she drunk that day? A. No.</p>

            . I keep the Redcrosspublic-house, Upper East Smithfield; I had known Frind twenty-five years. Morgan called on me on or about the 27th of March, and asked if I knew the deceased, Frind, (I did not know Morgan before) - I said I had known him about twenty-five years; he asked if he had got any property - I told him he had, and that all I knew of was the first 20l. which he bought into the 5 per cents, as I was present at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170008"></xptr>the time, but I could not exactly recollect the year; I referred him to Mr. Johnson, the broker, and told him it was most likely he could get information of the sum there; he did not say why he made the inquiry - there was another person with him, I believe one of the male prisoners, but cannot swear who - I had seen Frind before Christmas, and many times since, I should think within a week of his decease.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, was he in a state of health to walk from Glasshouse-yard to Whitechapel church? A. I should think not, according to outward appearance; I do not know what his feelings were - the Seven Stars is five or six hundred yards from Whitechapel church: it is opposite Red Lion-street - it is better than a quarter of a mile from Frind's house; I do not think it likely that he could walk there; my house is three quarters of a mile from there, and perhaps half a quarter of a mile from his house - he never called at my house in his life; when I saw him it was at his own house - I was intimately acquainted with him; I have lived where I now do two years next October, before that I lived at Mile-end; he did not visit me there - it is nearly seven years since he was at my house; I have often seen him out since Christmas - I met him in the Minories I should think about a week before his death; he used to walk with a kimbo walk, with his knees almost down to the ground, quite stooping, with two sticks - the last time I met him he was about one hundred and fifty yards from his own house; I have not seen him further from his home since Christmas; he could scarcely walk - he would walk a few yards, and then stand up to rest; he wanted me to make a will for him about sixteen years back, but I refused.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was rather an eccentric man? A. He was; he had always a small defect in his knees, but not equal to what it was a few months before he died - I think I saw him last about the latter end of February, but cannot be positive when it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You had been intimate with him twenty-five years? A. Yes; he was chiefly a porter - I was then a gun-maker, and lived seven or eight doors from him for nineteen years; we were very intimate - I never heard of his having any relations; I never heard of a nephew named Morgan - he never spoke to me of his having any brothers or sisters.</p>
               <p>JAMES NOTMAN. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 4, Anthony-street, St. George's, I have seen all the prisoners; I know Fallon particularly - he called on the 21st of April, at my house: I was at home at work - he said he called to know if I was one of the relations of Frind; I told him I was, by my wife's side - he said he could prove the will which Morgan had presented at Tebbs' was a forgery; I asked him how - he said he saw it before the ink was dry, that it was written on the 24th of March, and Morgan had no more right to the money than that boy, pointing to one of my boys, who was at work; he said that Morgan had been tried for forgery before, with a person named Driscol - he said he (Fallon) did not know the deceased, and had never seen him, nor had any of the parties- he said they were going that day (21st of April) to prove the will at Doctors'-commons; I told him they would have to prove it somewhere else first, and said I meant at a public office - he said he was surprised we had not done it before, and when we did I was to leave him till the last; he said he did not wish to come forward voluntarily, and if the parties knew that he had come to tell me any thing about it, they would not mind sticking a knife into him or me either, for if they would run their necks into the halter for one thing they would for another - he then said, "Supposing I could bring forward a witness who never signed the will:" I asked him if that was not Mrs. Pringle - (I had not seen the will, but knew there was that name as an attesting witness:) I told him I understood Mrs. Pringle was a witness to the will - he then said if I would call on him next morning, perhaps I should see Mrs. Pringle; I called next morning at his house, then went to a public-house, and in the course of the day he introduced Pringle and Paternoster; he went out for the purpose of bringing them - I do not think he introduced them by name; he brought them in - I do not think he said any thing: Paternoster staid about two hours - we were drinking porter and talking about the will all the time - he went out to bring Pringle in, and brought her and Paternoster: I was sitting by the fire-place in the back parlour - several other persons were there; my uncle was there, and after a few moments Pringle called my uncle out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said while you were there? A. After Fallon brought them in he asked me to get a bit of paper, and told me to write on it something which he would tell me, which I did; this is it (looking at a paper) - he said what is written here, in the presence of Paternoster, quite lond; I wrote it from his mouth - (reads) - "

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Pringle wrote this in your presence, to show how unlike it was to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170009"></xptr>writing in the will? A. Yes; that was her observation - this is as well as she could write, as she had a very bad pen, and she could hardly write at all; it is not easy to make out what it is - (looking at the name written by Pringle in Court) - I should almost swear this is her hand-writing, but what she wrote at the public-house was with a very bad pen: I expect to get some of the property if the will is set aside, as my wife was a third cousin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You had not mentioned your name and address when Teighe asked where you lived? A. No, but I told him I was a relation of the deceased; he was a stranger to me - I told him it was rather strange he should say the deceased was born in Scotland, and I had a certificate of his being born at Deptford: he made no answer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say your wife is a third cousin? A. yes; she is very distantly related - Mrs. Collins and Lewis are my wife's aunts; I have known them ever since I married my wife - Lewis' husband's name is George; I only saw Frind twice - I never heard Friend had a nephew; quite the contrary - I never heard he had a nephew at all; I have heard my wife's grandfather say that Frind had a brother who died when he was a young man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Was the paper you and Pringle wrote on, in this state at that time? A. Yes, and it merely laid on the table - it is very soft paper; my own writing on it is not so good as usual - allowing for the difference in the paper and the accommodation I believe this other to be Pringle's writing; I do not believe the signature to the will to be her writing.</p>
               <p>Morgan. Q. Did I not give information both to you and Lewis respecting my proctor? A. I never saw you till you were at Mr. Tebbs', and that was the only time I saw you till you were apprehended; I know nothing of Mr. Tebbs giving you a letter to Mr. Lake.</p>
               <p>Fallon. Q.After having three or four pots of beer at the public-house, and a glass or two of rum, did you not say it was a shame to sit there and not send for the women who worked in my house? A. I never said so - I cannot say how much we drank; he went out to dinner, and on returning brought the females - Fallon sat there three or four hours after that, but Paternoster did not; I was certainly the worse for what I had drank, because I had had no-dinner - I did not take Pringle out, and give her rum; Mr. Lewis went out with her while I talked to you.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Where have you seen Pringle write? A. I have seen her write at my house six, eight, or twelve times since this transaction.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BRANNAN. I am a widow, and live in Fashion-street, Spitalfields - I am acquainted with Paternoster, Dalton, and Morgan.

            . I keep the Seven Stars public-house, High-street, Whitechapel, and have kept it between four and five years. I have seen all the prisoners, except Teighe, at my house frequently; I cannot be positive that I have seen Teighe there, but the other four I have frequently seen there together, and have seen Morgan there frequently by himself alone - Morgan came to my house some time since Christmas; I cannot say the exact time, and I said, "Well old chap, where have you been? I have not seen you for a long time past - you used to be a customer of mine; I think I have not seen you these twelve months, have I?" - he mentioned the number of months; whether it was more or less than twelve I cannot say, but I think it was more - I should think this conversation was at least five or six weeks after Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was later than the 15th of January? A.Indeed I cannot say the time; he said he was come about some property that he was likely to get; that he was sent for from somewhere a good way off - whether it was Ireland or Scotland, I cannot say; I saw him again a few days after, and said to him, "Well, old chap, are you likely to get the property you were talking about?" he said Yes, that it was willed to him, and all the world could not hinder him of it; I asked him if it was any con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170010"></xptr>siderable property, and I think he told me it was about 500l. or 600l.; I am sure it was as much as 500l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his being at any time supplied with a sheet of paper at your house? A. A party was supplied with a sheet of paper; I have not the least doubt of his being one of them - I think it was before the conversation about the property being willed to him, but I am not sure; I think he was one of the party who had the paper, I also think the female prisoner was one and Fallon - I am not quite sure of the other: there were four or five there - I know the other two have been at my house, but whether they were there on that occasion I cannot say; I think it was most likely foolscap paper.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say you think, do you mean that you doubt about it? A. We use two sorts of paper, but I think it was large; I believe the paper was about the size that this will is upon - I have seen the old gentleman, Frind; I think I saw him at my house about twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he at your house at the time these people were writing? A. That I cannot answer; I do not recollect seeing him, and should not think he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see an infirm old man who could not stand upright, but walked with two sticks, and his knees knocking together? A. I think not - I do not recollect it; he might, or might not be there - I cannot recollect that I saw him; I do not think that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect that you did not? A. If I could recollect one, I might the other - I only saw the old gentleman who was at my house twelve months ago once; I was not aware that was Frind then, but have been told so since by my customers, not by the prisoners; he was an oldish man, and walked stooping, with a stick or sticks- I do not recollect about his legs; I know he stooped: my house is licensed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long has your house been licensed? A. I have kept a licensed house for thirteen or fourteen years, and have been in that house four years.</p>

               <p>JOHN COWDEROY. I live at No. 12, Whitehorse-place, Commercial-road; I was formerly a publican, but am now out of business. I know Dalton - he called on me about March last, but I do not remember whether it was before or after the Fast-day; he asked if I would take a letter in for him, which I consented to do - he said his wife had robbed him, and he had found out that she had sent the money down to North Shields by her son; that he had written a letter, as if his wife wrote it, and I was to take a letter in if it came for him - I knew his name at that time; the letter did not come in his name, but in some other - he said it would come in some other name, but in but did not mention what; a letter came in about a week, ten days, or a fortnight - this is very much like the letter(looking at one) - it was very much like this, and had a yellow seal and figures like this on it; here is 1l. written on it; I gave him the letter myself when he called - he opened it in my place, and I saw it was blank; it had no writing at all in it; my wife took the letter in - we often have letters come for other people; I took this letter off the mantel-piece, and said, "Is this your letter, Dalton?" he said Yes - it was directed to Mr. Teighson, No.12, White Horse-place, Commercial-road; nobody of that name lodged at my house - I did not notice the post-mark; I am not in the habit of taking in letters for other people - I believe this letter to be the one I gave him, from the direction, the seal, and the mark on it altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was blank when it was opened? A. The letter had no writing in it; he had said a letter would come, not in his own name, and as I had nobody in the house of that name, and it having my address on it; my wife took it in - eight or nine persons live in my house - it is a lodging-house for sailors; I may sometimes have twenty sailors - I know their names when they come; I have known Dalton three or four years, and never knew any harm of him; I was never in trouble myself, and was never in a criminal Court, except to give evidence here some years ago; I was never charged with felony in any Court - I was once charged with an assault; I knew a man named Oliver; he was transported from here - my name was never brought in question; I have been in Whitecross-street prison, and in the Fleet - I was in Clerkenwell prison for eleven months, under a fine for having a private still - I was sent there from Lambeth-street office; I was never bail for a man in my life - I swear positively I was never tried on any charge of felony, or for any thing except about the still; I was fined 30l. for that, and had not the money to pay - I was never tried for an assault; I was once fined.</p>
               <p>MARGARET COWDEROY. I am the wife of the last witness, I remember taking in a letter of the General Postman, who comes regularly - I paid 1s. for it; I received no other letter for which I paid 1s. - this is something like the letter; I remember it had a yellow seal - I kept it two or three days, till Dalton called; it laid about in the room -I was present when my husband gave it to Dalton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember Dalton calling on you on Good Friday, Easter Sunday, or Easter Monday? A. No - I borrowed 5s. of him once, and he named something about expecting a letter and an enclosure of 5l. from his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago is it that Dalton lent you 5s.? A. Not six months ago; I think it was before I received this letter; I saw Dalton open the letter - it had no writing in it; I was going past him in the room as he opened it, I saw him turn the leaf over, and am positive it had no writing in it - he did not seem at all surprised at it.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW PLACE. In March last I was the General Postman for White Horse-place, Commercial-road. I delivered this letter according to the direction, on the 8th of March; it has the North Shields post-mark on it - I have been sixteen years in the Post-office; it has the genuine post-mark stamp of North Shields - the delivery mark is the 8th of March: the postage was 1s.; I do not recollect delivering any other letter there about that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect leaving one directed to Mrs. Dalton at that house about that time? A. I do not; I have been so long on that walk that I have a good recollection of what happens - I deliver very few<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170011"></xptr>there; I knew Cowderoys before they lived there - I cannot recollect every letter, but I remember delivering this; I may have delivered letters there which I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. If there had been an enclosure in this letter, what would have been the postage? A. Two shillings - here is 1l. written on the back; that is done by the post-master at Shields - letters are calculated by 1l. postages, and then put aside.</p>
               <p>JOHN COWDEROY. When I gave him the letter my wife told him the postage was 1s. - I do not recollect whether he paid it.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On Tuesday, the 24th of April, I apprehended Teighe at No. l 17, Eastfield-street, Limehouse; I asked if his name was Jones - he said it was Teighe - I told him I took him on a charge of forging a will: he said "Very good:" I asked him on the road to the office if he knew Dalton - he said he did; I asked if he knew Morgan: he said Yes, but he did not know much of him - I asked if he knew Fallon; he said he did not: I apprehended Fallon and Paternoster the same morning, at No. 6, Lambeth-street - Paternoster said her name was Peacock; they were both in the room: I told them I apprehended them on a charge of forging a will; Fallon said the man who made it ought to suffer for it - he said it was very odd a person he knew nothing of should leave him a legacy in a will; Paternoster made the same remark, and said she wished she had it, as it was left to her; I asked Fallon if he knew Morgan - he said he did: I asked if he knew Dalton - he said he did; I afterwards went in search of Dalton, and found him in Church-lane, Whitechapel, in the street - he lived at No. 11, Princes-street, Princes-square, Ratcliff-highway, at the house of Mr. Frazer - I could not find him there; I told him I had been looking for him, and took him respecting a forged will - there were two persons with him; one of them said, "What is this about? what is the matter?" Dalton said, "Oh, it is nothing, it is all right;" he said he had been signing a document for a person whom he knew - he did not name him then; I took him to the office, searched him, and found in his pocket this paper - he then said the person's name he had signed the document for was

            . I am married, and live at No. 18, Green Dragon-yard, Whitechapel. I saw Morgan at my house, in London, on the 6th, 7th, or 8th of March; he came without either hat or handkerchief on - he came to borrow a hat and handkerchief; I had no hat, but lent him a handkerchief off my neck; I have not had it again- I know it was very early in March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is that your only reason for fixing the date? A. Yes; it was very early in the month - I think it was on a Tuesday he came; I know it was a market morning, as my husband had brought me home some things from market; market mornings are Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays - I know it was on a Tuesday; I should not like to swear that, but I know it was early in the week, on a market morning.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you lately had a child? A. Yes; it was born on the 7th of March - I was confined in a room down stairs; it was two or three days after my baby was born that I saw Morgan; I live on the ground floor, and a person coming there would come into my room.(The will was here put in and read, see indictment.)</p>
               <p>Morgan. I wish Mr. Lake to be called.</p>
               <p>Morgan to MR. LAKE. Q. Did not Mr. and Mrs. Harding claim the property, and others besides? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Morgan's Defence. The document in question is genuine, and the decision I leave to the Judge and Jury.</p>
               <p>Dalton's Defence I have kept a sailor's lodging-house for many years; I and Teighe were walking together on the 17th of January; we went into the Seven Stars-Morgan, and old gentleman, and a woman sat there, having beer, and shortly after we were there, Morgan, who knew me, spoke to me; the question was put by the old gentleman to Morgan, "Probably your friend, Mr. Dalton, will draw up the paper I was speaking to you about?" I said I was not capable of doing it, but no doubt my friend Teighe could do it, and by Frind's wish it was drawn out by Teighe.</p>
               <p>Teighe's Defence. I have only to corroborate the statement of Dalton; what he has said is true - I never saw Frind before nor since, nor do I know whether he is living or dead; I am not interested in the will, and do not see that it has been proved against me in any way.</p>
               <p>Fallon's Defence. I neither prisoner con saw the will wrote or drawn out; I know nothing about the concern -I was not present.</p>
               <p>Paternoster's Defence. I know nothing of the old gentleman, nor did I ever see him - I know nothing of any money being left to me. (The following letter, found in Dalton's box, was here read, at his request).</p>
               <p>North Shields, March 23, 1832.</p>
               <p>DEAR MOTHER, - I embrace the opportunity of writing to you, hoping to find you in good health, as it leaves me at present, thank God for it - I wrote to you on the 14th of this month and expected an answer by return of post, but no answer has ever been; I am going to America, and will endeavour to leave the monthly money at London or Shields, but hoping to receive an answer, before I sail from here, I will write to you again as soon as I receive an answer to this letter - by return of post.</p>
               <p>Your dutiful son,</p>
               <p>

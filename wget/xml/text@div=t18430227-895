On the 24th of Jan., there were two casks of white lead lying outside in front of my shop—in consequence of what I heard I missed one—on the 27th I went to Union-street, Borough, to the house of a person named Chambers—I saw Chambers standing behind the counter, and my cask standing in front of the shop—I did not identify it then, but from the appearance of the cask I went over again in company with Foay and Argent, two policemen, and</p>

I was called in by Mr. Pattrick, in consequence of this lead being stolen—I accompanied him to Cham<lb></lb>bers's house, where some conversation was held about it—I afterwards went up to Islington, and inquired for a person named Potts—I could not find any one of that name—I subsequently found out the prisoner, living at St. George's-terrace, White Conduit-fields—he was carrying on the trade of a corn-chandler there—we had Chambers with us—on going into the shop, Chambers said, "That is the man I bought the lead of," pointing to the prisoner—he made no answer to that—I asked him if he had sold a cask of white lead to Chambers to Thursday (this was on Saturday—I had previously told him I was an officer, and I had not my uniform on) he said "Yes, I did"—I asked him what Chambers paid him for it—he said that made no difference to me, he supposed Chambers had told me—he did not tell me the price—I asked him who he bought it of—he said he never bought it at all, he was employed to sell it for a man living at Spitalfields—I asked him where he lived—he said, he could not tell me, he could show me—he told me his name was Harriss—I then desired him to accompany me to show me this place—he took me to Turville-street, Bethnal-green—I found there a man named Harriss, keeping a beer-shop—the prisoner said in Harriss's hearing, "That is the man who employed me to sell it"—I told Harriss I was an officer, and asked him if he employed Lone-to sell any white lead for him—he said, "I don't know the man; as for white lead, I know nothing about it"—I told him he had better go to the station, and hear what the inspector said—he said, "I will go with you any where willingly; I know nothing about the man, or anything about the white lead"—he asked me to allow him to get his coat and hat—he went into the parlour, went off another way, and I lost him (I have been an officer seven years) when I tried to get into the parlour, I could not do so, and when I did, Harriss was gone—I have never seen him since—the lid of the cask is here.</p>

               <p>heavy—I saw them try a second time—I then went up to them and said, "Do you want a lift?"—neither answered—we were in the act of lifting it on, and the hat of the man at the handle of the truck fell off and went in the kennel—he took it up and put it on his head—he never shook the wet or dirt off—he was anxious to get the lead on—we at last succeeded in getting the lead into the truck, and very unkind they were, they never spoke afterwards—I noticed the person whose hat fell off—the prisoner is the man—he had the handle of the truck—to the best of my belief he is the person—he was under my observation some time, and there was plenty of light—we have two very large lights burning—they drew the truck away, one at the handle, and the other pushing behind.</p>

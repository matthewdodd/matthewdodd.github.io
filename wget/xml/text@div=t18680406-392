                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Graham, of 6, Frenly Place, St. Paul's, Deptford, a store-keeper—on 13th March, about 8.45, I was sitting in my back parlour—my daughter spoke to me—I went into my front parlour and found the window drawn up as high as it could be—I missed a globe of artificial fruit which had been standing on a small table in the centre of the room, a quarter of an hour before—I had closed the shutters on the outside, but had not fastened them—the fruit was brought to me next morning—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it is my husband's.</p>

On the night of 13th March, about 10 o'clock, I was on duty in Lower Road, Deptford, and saw the prisoner by the side of a costermonger's barrow at Stanley Tavern, with the globe of fruit in his hand—I asked him whether he had it for sale, he said no, his master had got it for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Middle Lane, Deptford—I asked his master's name, he said he did not know, but it was either Williams or Searle—he was about a mile and a quarter from tho prisoner's house—I asked where his master was—he said that he had just stopped behind to speak to a man, but he would overtake him presently—a man came up in a few minutes, who the prisoner addressed as his master—I asked him if he knew anything of the case of fruit—he said that he bought it in Middle Lane, Deptford, for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner told him I had stopped him—he said, "That is all right, he is only doing his duty, if he likes to go to the station, I can soon convince him that it is all right"—on the way to the station the other man escaped.</p>

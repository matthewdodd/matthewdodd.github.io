                  </hi>. I now live at Maidstone, but at the time of this transaction I lived at Eltham. On the 6th of June last year, I was going home down Wellhall-lane, leading to Eltham, out of the Dover-road—it was about half-past ten o'clock by the time I got to where I was robbed—the lane is a mile and a half long—before I got to the spot I passed the witness Leopard, who is lame—I got considerably ahead of him before any thing happened—when I got about two hundred yards up the lane I was met by two soldiers, who separated in such a manner as to oblige me to go between them—the one on my right-hand said, "Good night," and the other at the same moment, or nearly so, struck me with some heavy weapon which I did not see, on the left side of my head—I was stunned by the blow and knocked down—I remained insensible for some time, and on coming to myself I found the two men over me, one rifling my pockets and the other holding me—they had turned out one of my pockets, and were proceeding to rifle the other—I attempted to cry out, but the one who held me down put sand into my mouth, and pressed my mouth to prevent my calling out—they took from me money to the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, in six sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, and some shillings—I had no opportunity of noticing the features of either of them—I was lying on the ground at the moment they left me—they ran off as hard as they could towards Wool<lb></lb>wich—on recovering a little I got up and walked towards Eltham, but thinking they might have left something on the spot I went back and looked about for my things, and while I was looking Leopard came up—I was bleeding very much—with his assistance I proceeded to Eltham—the clock struck eleven just as I entered Eltham—when I was lying in the lane I laid along the road, in the same direction as the road—it was rather a wide part of the lane—it was a moonlight night, but the moon was behind the' men as they came up—there is a pathway there—I was in the pathway when struck, but when I was lying down I was in the road—the path is on the level of the road.</p>

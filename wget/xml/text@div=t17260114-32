I was going to give him my Money, but he cut the String that tied my Pockets, took 'em both from me, and ran away. I scream'd out, and in a Minutes time ran to the Cook, and told several there of my loss, and describ'd the Person that rob'd me, and they pursued and took him; here the Prisoner pray'd the Court to ask her, if she did not say (when he was brought to her at the Cock) that she did not know him? And whether the Person that rob'd her had a Gun or not; she answered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172601140006"></xptr> that when he first came into that House, his Hair hung over his Face, and she did indeed say, that she was not sure that he was the Person, but that she was positive to him as soon as his Hair was put back. And that she saw no Gun that he had when he rob'd her.</p>

I presently got to the Cock, and hearing of the Robbery, I return'd with several others in the Pursuit of him, he got over 2 Banks and a Stile just by his Fathers House and there I lost the fight of him. I enquir'd of his Father and Mother if they saw such a Person, his Mother answer'd no, but his Father said he did see such a Person go by the Door. I searched the House, and at last found him in a back Place behind a Curtain with with a Book in his Hand. I brought him down without his Hat, and he put on a Hat below. His Father said Jack, is that the Hat that you had out with you? He answered no. His Father than bad him put the same Hat on, that the Woman might see him in the same Dress he was in before. I asked him why he run a way, and he said for fear of losing his Gun.</p>

             thus depos'd. I and some others were at the Cock when the Woman came in and complained of her loss; she describ'd the Person, and directed us which way he took. We immediately went out, and quickly saw the Prisoner running with a Gun in his Hand, we pursued him over 3 Fields, and he ran into his Father's Garden. - When we had taken him, he said that he ran upon seeing us, for fear we should take away his Gun; several others spoke to the same Effect.</p>

             (a Boy) thus depos'd. I was in our Field, when the Woman cry'd out, and by the Account that she has given, I guess she was got not above 20 Yards from the place where she says she was robb'd; and that very time of her Screaming, the Prisoner came into our Field with a Gun, and was then about 3 or 4 hundred Yards from her, for I could see 'em both at once, and could have seen if he or any Body else had rob'd her, but I saw no body near her. He did not run, but laid his Gun down up on the Bank, and walked backwards and forwards and look'd up in the Trees after a Thrush, as I suppose, for I heard a Thrush sing, I call'd him Peter Gunner, and bid him get out of my Masters field, or else I'd set the Dog at him, and then the Men came up and he run away; but from the time that the Woman cry'd out, to the time that they follow'd him, he might have got out of their Sight if he would.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his defence. I was not near the Pond when the Woman (as she says) was robb'd there. My Father had order'd me to fetch some Grains; but seeing some Sparrows in the Garden, I took the Gun and went after 'em, but they quickly flew away, and then I spy'd a Thrush and follow'd it, till I came to the Field where the Boy call'd me Peter Gunner. I saw my Father not far off, and ran home, and went in the back-way for fear he should see me, with the Gun, because if he had he would have bear me; two or three Witnesses depos'd, that when the Boy was brought back to the Cock, the Woman was asked if she knew him, and she said, No, the Person that robb'd me, wore a Wig, but this Lad has his own Hair. Her Husband being present clapt her on the Back, and said you shall Swear that this is he. A great Number of Witnesses (among whom were some Gentlemen on the Bench) gave the Prisoner a very fair Character and the Jury <rs id="t17260114-32-verdict198" type="verdictDescription">

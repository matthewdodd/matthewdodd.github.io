                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Cantlin, and live in Harcourt-street, Portland-market. Last Saturday night, the 1st of April, about eleven o'clock, I went to buy some potatoes and greens in the market—I went to the prisoner, who used to sell greens—he asked 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a bunch—I offered him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I reached him over half-a-crown, to take 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out for the greens—he would not take 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took the half-crown again, and went away—I had two half-crowns in my hand, and 7lbs. of potatoes in my apron—I left him, and went a little way from him—he followed, and knocked me down with a blow on my head—I know it was him—I knew him before, and there was nobody else near but him, I am quite sure—he struck me from behind—he then leaned down on my side, and when he was hurting my side I hallooed out—he gave me a blow in the mouth, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> his thumb into my hand, took the money, and ran away—I got up, and went to look for a policeman, but could not see one-I went to the station—the sergeant told me to go on, and I should meet a po<lb></lb>liceman—I met one at the corner of the street, and took him to a house where my little boy told me the prisoner lodged, but he was not there—I was fright<lb></lb>ened when he struck me—I was afraid he would kill me—I gave a description of him to the policeman—I afterwards met him in the market on Sunday morning—I had not been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information from the prosecutrix, and went after the prisoner—I found him in Portland-market, and said, "Young man, I want you"—he said, "Want me? oh, I suppose it is about them two half-crowns on Saturday night; you are mistaken, it was not me, it was my mate"—I had said nothing to him about half-crowns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker at 193, Kingsland Road—on Tuesday morning the 5th January I was awakened about 6 or 7 o'clock—I went down to the door, and found it had been broken open—the chain was broken; I had fastened it up myself the night before—I found two policemen at the door, and I missed about 100 pairs of boots, nearly all the best that I had in my stock—I had seen them safe the night before—about a fortnight after the robbery I was shown two odd boots which had been amongst my stock; I have never sold any of that size—they had been worn; not very much, but they had been in the mud a good deal.</p>

On the morning of 20th January I saw three men walking along St. John's Road, Hoxton; the prisoner was one of them—I was with another constable—I suspected and followed them, and saw them go to a corner house, and two of them stood in a doorway while one of them went and looked over a low wall—they remained there a few minutes, and then went towards Weymouth Terrace, Hackney Road—they went round the corner, and the prisoner and another one turned from the corner again and came back and met me near the corner—I directly seized the prisoner, and the other one too, but be got away from me—I held the prisoner—he stooped down, and dropped this jemmy on the pavement behind him—I picked it up, and told him I should take him into custody for loitering for the purpose of committing a felony and having housebreaking implements in his possession—I took him to the station and searched him—he was wearing these boots; I said they looked very much like some boots that Mr. Claydon had lost up, the road—I took them off his feet—he said "I bought them in Kingsland Road at Christmas"—I sent for Mr. Claydon, and when he came the prisoner said "That is the man I bought them of; I bought them on Christmas Eve"—Mr. Clay<lb></lb>don identified the boots.</p>

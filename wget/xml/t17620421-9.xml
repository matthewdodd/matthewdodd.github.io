I felt my watch stir in my fob. I was greatly surprized, and put my hand down, and it came into my hand without any assistance of mine; and the same person that pulled it out, twisted it out of my hand. It was the prisoner at the bar. I took him by his collar. and charged him with taking of it. He denied it with very bad language. He then had it in his hand. He threw it down upon the stones. While I stooped for it he ran away. I called stop thief. He ran down the Fleet-market, but was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176204210008"></xptr> soon taken.

                  </hi>I am superintendent of the manufactory, in Mary<lb></lb>le-bone workhouse. On the 2nd of June I delivered 21lbs. weight of hone<lb></lb>hair to Withers, who was a pauper in that workhouse, to take to the Horse Bazaar; it had been picked by the paupers, and he was to take it back—I had sent him with 271bs. weight before, which was taken safe—in conse<lb></lb>quence of some suspicion, I watched him with the last load—he went to No. 8, Upper Dorset-street, Bryanston-square, where Evans lives, in' the back kitchen (that is quite out of the road from the workhouse to the ba<lb></lb>zaar)—he went in, and stopped there two or three minutes, then came out without either the bag or hair—he went to a beer-shop in Seymour<lb></lb>place, stopped there about half-an-hour, and when he came out he had the empty bag with him—I had kept at the corner, and had seen one other person go into the beer-shop, but I do not know who it was—when</p>

               <p>Withers came out, be went through the iron railings towards Bryantson<lb></lb>squere—I overtook him at Windham-place—I said, " What have you done with the bag of hair I sent you with to the bazaar? "—I repeated the ques<lb></lb>tion, and he said, " I left it at the bazaar"—I gave him into custody—I and the policeman then went to the house in Dorset-street—Evans was not at home—I left the policeman at the house while I went to the beer-shop in Seymour-place—I found Evans there, and told him I wanted to speak to him—we came out, and I said, " What has become of that hair that I saw a man take into your house half-an-hour ago? "—he said, " What hair? "—I said, " You need not make yourself strange, you know all about if,—he said, " Oh, the bag of hair the man brought, and requested leave to leave it there while he went further"—I said, " Did he leave bag and all? —he said, " No, he took the bag with him"—I said, "That is not the case, " I watched him with the hair and bag, and he came out without either—he said, " Oh, I forgot, the man requested me to empty the hair, and bring the bag with me to the beer-shop",—that the man was an old acquaintance of his—we went to his lodging—he unlocked the kitchen door, and when we got in, I saw the hair emptied out loose in the kitchen—I said, "That is the hair"—he replied, " Yes, it is, " and I gave him into custody.</p>

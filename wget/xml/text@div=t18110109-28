Yes, at eight o'clock in the evening I took a candle and went to where my books were deposited, I saw a light and heard a rustling noise; I saw at the landing at the bottom of the stairs, near the gallery door, a man, which proved to be the prisoner Saunders, and close to him was a bag about two thirds filled with something, which I found afterwards to be books; I seized him by the collar, I called for assistance; Humphreys and another officer immediately came, one of them took Saunders, and the other went and took Knapp in the place where my books was.</p>

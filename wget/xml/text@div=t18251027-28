            . I am a Bow-street patrole. On the 15th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at Hyde-park-corner, with a basket, which I thought appeared very heavy: I went and asked what he had got; he said a few nails, which he had bought of two men down the road for two pots of beer; he said there was about 20 lbs.; I said there must be more than that; I afterwards got them weighed, and there were 40 lbs. - they are worth about 1 l. He said it was a bad job, and what should he give me to make it up.</p>

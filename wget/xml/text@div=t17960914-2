               <p>I am turnkey to Mr. Kirby, the keeper of Newgate, (produces the record of the correction.) In April, 1794, the prisoner was tried and convicted here; I am sure as to the man; afterwards I delivered him at Southampton, on the 28th of October, 1795, to go to the West-Indies to the officer appointed to receive him, and 43 others to be put on board the transport to go as a soldier in the 60th regiment.[The record of conviction was read.]</p>

               <p>In consequence of an information, on Thursday the 1st of this month, I went to a lodging in St. Giles's, and took the prisoner in bed; I took him to a Magistrate, and sent for Owen, and he identified him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence delivered in a paper, which was send by the clerk of the Court, stated, that if he had erred, it was through ignorance, as he had used no means to prevent himself being taken; that he received a conditional pardon to serve as a soldier, and in October was taken from Newgate to Southampton, and put on board the Jonah transport; that he afterwards sailed in the convoy with captain Christian's sleet, and was carried to Martinique; that be again embarked on board a schooner for St. Domingo, to join the 60th regiment; that after he had been there three days, he was ordered to Tobago; that he went on shore to fetch some wine on board, and that while he was gone, the wine was brought to the boat by some other persons, and before his return the boat put off and left him; that he got on board a ship belonging to captain Dickson, and came to England, and that when he was taken, he was on shore by leave of the captain; that it was not his intention not to fulfil the condition; that it was not in his power to fulfil it; that he hoped he was not criminal, and threw himself on the Court for mercy; that he expected captain Dickson to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Miller.) Have you seen the captain - A. I went on board, but did not see him; he behaved remarkably well at the time I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I only came on shore the night before.</p>

On the 18th of August, between twelve and one in the morning, as I was going home, I had occasion to make water in the street; the two prisoners came up to me; Cummins laid hold of my left arm, the other stood close to me on my right side; very few words passed between us. I had no kind of connexion with them. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150064"></xptr> went away from me, and in a minute or two I missed my watch. I was fully satisfied it must be taken from me by Percy, who was on my right side, while the other woman held my left arm.</p>
               <p>Did you feel her take it? - I did not. I ran after them; they were then in fight, but they got away from me. The next day I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found my seal pawned at one place, and my watch at another. I found out who the prisoners were, and had them taken up. I saw them very distinctly, and being so near I am certain as to their persons; it was a moon light night. When they were taken up they owned they had taken the watch, and said it was pawned with Mr. Burroughs for 18 s. I found the watch at Burroughs's.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

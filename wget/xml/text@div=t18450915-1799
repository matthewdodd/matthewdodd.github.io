                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Coulling, who is shopman to John Newman, a baker, in Goswell-street. The prisoner was employed by Mr. Newman to carry out bread—if the customers paid him, it was his duty to account for it to me or my husband, when he returned to the shop—on the Thursday and Friday previous to 5th of Sept. he took out bread to Mrs. Sparkhall—on his return he told me the bread was not paid for—he never accounted to me for money received for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Sometimes I paid for eight or ten loaves together from Mr. Sparkhall. I was sometimes paid every morning, and sometimes every third morning. I was short of money, and kept this back, and before I could return it I was taken for stealing the flour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Sometimes he paid for three or four days' bread at a time from Mrs. Sparkhall; on the Wednesday morning he paid for the Monday's, Tuesday's, and Wednesday's bread, but I believe he received the money each morning—when the bread is booked, I always ask "Did So-and-so pay?" and he told me "No," both on the Thursday and Friday.</p>

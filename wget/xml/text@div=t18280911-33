               <p>Q. Where did you see him when this happened? A. On Friday morning, the 1st of August, the street-keeper said something to me, in consequence of which I went and saw the prisoner in Mr. Sweetman's public-house, Berwick-street - Williams, the street-keeper, was with me; I asked the prisoner if it was true that he was looking for me; he said he was - I asked him for what purpose; he said, to kill me, and then swore - he said,"By the Almighty God I will kill you the first opportunity;" I then instantly left the house - this was about two o'clock in the day; I went as far as <placeName id="t18280911-33-crimeloc163">Walker's-court</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to the public-house to seek this man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that when he has drunk a little he is almost in a state of insanity? A. No, I do not - I do not know where he lived - his shop is in Walker's-court - I had been told by several people that morning that he had been looking for me with a knife to kill me, and not being able to find a constable to go with me, for they were afraid -</p>
               <p>Q. What constable did you go to who refused to give you assistance? A. Webb for one; he belongs to the parish - I went in search of a Police officer, and could not find one - I have been in London four or five months - I lived at Chelsea before that; I knew the police office, and applied at Marlborough-street that day, but was refused a warrant; I applied to Bishop, the clerk, who refused it, and not being satisfied, I applied to Mr. Roe, the magistrate; he said, if I brought any person forward who would swear they heard him he say he would kill me, he would grant the warrant, and I went for a street-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, never mind that - was not this man drunk? A. I cannot swear he was drunk - he spoke to me sensibly enough, as I thought; he might have been drinking - but to say he was drunk, I could not; I only asked him the question, and as soon as he gave me the answer I came out - there were some people round him in the public-house; they appeared to be tussling, or holding him, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. He was behind you when he struck you - if he intended to put an end to you, was there anything to prevent his running the knife through your back? A. That I cannot say - he might have stabbed me in the back if he had chosen; I cannot say where he thought it best to stick me; I am informed if he had made the blow a quarter of an inch further back, I should have died in two minutes - I cannot swear that he was drunk, nor that he was sober; I was not in the public-house above two or three minutes - when he told me his determination, I left; he spoke seriously and determined - he did not stutter as a drunken man would: the landlord was there, and could see what state he was in.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he was drunk, had you any hand in making him so? A. No; I merely went and asked him a question, with a witness, that if necessary I might make an affidavit before a Justice - I did not say a word to him more than I have mentioned, nor do anything to him - nor did I ever in my life abuse or threaten him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any knife in his hand in the public-house? A. No, my Lord; he stood at a table in front of the bar - just as I went in, I saw people about him, and I thought they were pulling him; I had not then spoken to him - I do not know whether he had dined; I did not see any liquor before him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you left the public-house, where did he go? A. I suppose he left the house after me - I did not see him come out, but he came to me in three minutes - I went as far as Walker's-court; that was my way home; I leaned my elbow on the post, considering what I had best do - the court was not in my way to Marlborough-street; it is in the way to his shop, and very near it - I generally go home that way.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of St. James. I was in company with the prosecutor when he went to the Black Lion public-house; I saw the prisoner there - he was called out of the room; the prosecutor asked if he was there, and somebody else called him out of the tap-room; he came and stood against the bar - the prosecutor asked if he had been seeking for him, as he had been told so, and asked what he wanted with him; I did not distinctly hear what answer Higgins made, as a person happened to speak to me - the first I heard him say was,"I will kill him if I can;" I then came away with the prosecutor - he did not use any words to him at all, except asking him if he was seeking for him, and spoke quite civil to him; he did not touch him - there were two or three more men between them; I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand; we walked along to Walker's-court, and stood there about two minutes, between thirty and forty yards from the public-house - the prisoner's shop is about two doors from where we stood; his shed was shut up, and the shutters put too - it was on a Fri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110032"></xptr>day; I happened to turn my face that way, and saw Higgins two or three steps from the prosecutor - I saw the knife glitter in his hand, as if it was fresh ground; I turned and said, "Oh, Lord! he is coming with a knife"- the sun shone bright on the knife; he came up, made a stroke at the prosecutor, and cut him on the cheek; the prosecutor stood with his back towards him - he came up behind him, rather on the right-hand side, and made a blow at him with the knife - it struck him on the cheek; he made a hit as if he chopped, not a thrust - I immediately seized the arm that held the knife, and got it down, so that he could not raise it up to make a second blow; one of my hands held his wrist, and the other the small of his arm - the prosecutor got hold of him about the same time; nobody assisted us; we struggled together till we got his back against the sheep's head shop, and then I found my coat confined by the blade of the knife; I disengaged it, then caught hold of the small of his arm again, and called out, "Take the knife from his hand"- somebody came up and took it from him; he called out, "Higgins, loose the knife - he loosened it," and the person took it; Lindley, the constable, came up, and just then the prisoner said, "Ah! the b-gg-r, I have done him" - that was just as he loosened the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he in a great passion when you first went to the public-house? A. He did not seem in a passion when he came out - he seemed rather exasperated when he said he would kill the prosecutor; he seemed angry when he spoke the last words in the public-house - we instantly left the house, and I saw him in the street in about two minutes; I saw him again between thirty and forty yards from the house, two or three doors from his shed - we might have gone along any other street; his shed was shut up, and his neighbours said it had been shut all that morning, and he had been going about for the inspector, to kill him; I do not think he was drunk at the public-house, nor did I think him sober - I think he was rather mothered in drink, like a person that had been intoxicated, half sober and half drunk; he was called out of the tap-room to the bar - I did not see anybody tussling with him, but I was further back than the prosecutor - I stood behind him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether he was angry or exasperated, had the prosecutor done anything to make him so? A. Not that day - I had not the least idea of his intending to follow us; he struggled with me after I got hold of his arm - we all struggled together.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James'. I was called in the street, and saw the prosecutor pass my shop; I immediately went to the corner of Walker's-court, and saw the prisoner standing with his back to the sheep's-head shop; I said, "Higgins, you have done the business" - he immediately said he was sorry he had not killed the b-gg-r, and would go with me wherever I pleased; I had not said he was my prisoner, or anything - he knew I was a constable; he went very quietly up Berwick-street to the office, and said nothing more to me about it; he seemed much agitated at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you mean that he was violent and outrageous in his manner at times as he went along? A. Yes - I certainly considered that he had drunk considerably, or else he never could have used much expressions; I think he had been drinking - I do not mean to say he was drunk exactly, but much flurried and agitated - I have known him twenty years; he has a wife and one daughter, who is married.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe when he drinks he gets very violent and outrageous? A. Yes, he does; I have seen him very outrageous, and supposed him drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When he has drunk for two or three days together, has he not been violently agitated, and almost mad? A. Yes, he certainly is; when he is not excited by drink he is quiet - he certainly had the appearance of being much excited by liquor; I have not the least doubt of it myself - I can see it in no other light; I form that opinion from his manner and conduct, and through no other means.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I beg you to forget your twenty years acquaintance, and mind what you are saying - you say you thought him drunk, or he would not have used such expressions, what expressions were they? A. He said several times going up to the office, "I am sorry I have not killed the b-gg-r; he said so two or three times - it was that that made me think him drunk; he had no coat nor hat on; he did not stagger particularly in going to the office, but went in and out like a man that was agitated - I should think the drink might have occasioned the passion, because I heard he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in a quarrel when he was drunk before? A. No, not particularly.</p>

An inch from the mortal part; the throat is known to common people to be a mortal part; but that particular part, the carrotid artery, is not known to them; the wound is above the throat - it was a transverse cut across the chin, within an inch of the carrotid artery; the best part of it was within half an inch of the back of the neck, but three or four inches above the throat.</p>

            . I keep the Black Lion. The prisoner was at my house on the 1st of August, shortly before two o'clock, in a very high state of inebriation - I have known him twenty years; in his sober moments he is as humane and kind as any man - when excited by liquor, he is literally insane.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was he before this occurrence took place? A. As much like a madman as ever I saw, and he was so all the week - I refused to serve him with drink immediately before this.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see him come into your house that day? A. Yes; he was in and out three or four times; he was there about eleven o'clock in the morning - in short, he was from my house to the other opposite all the morning - I cannot say how much he drank in my house - a good many people gave him drink, but I would not serve him - I did not serve him after I found he was intoxicated - he was not drunk at eleven o'clock, not that I could discern, but he was bordering on drunkenness; I only saw him at eleven and two o'clock myself, but am informed he was there three or four times - he was as drunk as he could be between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he walk? A. He has a very strong constitution, and can keep on his legs very well, but his mind is quite different - I saw him go out of my house at two o'clock - he had no coat or hat on; he had no knife in his hand, I am perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he express any intention what he would do, or what he was going to do? A. I did not hear anything of the kind - he sleeps in Walker's-court; two men went out of the door with him - I do not know whether they had given him drink; I do not think they followed him - I requested them to take care of him, and they saw him to the door, and stood talking at the door with him a minute or two; I saw nothing further of him.</p>
               <p>Sixteen witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character for humanity and kindness.</p>

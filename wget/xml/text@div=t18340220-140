               <p>COURT to CHARLES WALLER. Q. Had you received information that at any particular time you would find persons there? A. No: I had received information a week before, but I went that day by chance - I found two sixpences and 4d. in copper on him, which were good.</p>

I must acknowledge the case against me is very black; but I most solemnly protest my innocence - I went to have half a pint of beer, and had occasion to go backwards; I saw this glove on the seat, and put it into my pocket, not knowing what it contained - I mentioned to a person that I had found it, and the officer came in and took me.</p>

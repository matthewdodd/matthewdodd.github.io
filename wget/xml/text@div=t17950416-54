             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to these forty-two yards of fustian. This man was your <rs id="t17950416-54-deflabel312" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950416-54-defend578 t17950416-54-deflabel312"></join>? - Yes. The second day of this month, on Thursday, a constable, Wainwright, brought him into my house, a little before eight o'clock; he had got the piece of goods wrapped up in a great coat; he opened the great coat, the constable did, and asked me whether that was my goods? I said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How much fustian was this? - Forty two yards. He said he caught him in Little Bush-lane, Cannon street, about the door of one Jones; when Langdon went into the house, Wainwright, the constable, followed him into the house.</p>

               <p>Q. What is it worth? - About six pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. This man was your porter? - Yes, about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sell goods in the warehouse? - He did sell goods.</p>
               <p>Q. And he has carried out goods? - Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he carried out goods, and sold them by your desire? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he sold goods and carried them out by your approbation? - No, never; our customers come to the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he still a servant at your house when this happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>-WAINWRIGHT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. The prisoner at the bar, about seven in the morning, on Thursday, was standing at Jones's door, in Little Bush-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Jones? - I don't know; he is a man that deals in dry saltery and a druggist. He had this piece of fustian when at the warehouse door, under his arm; he went into the shop. I followed him in, and very soon the parcel was put down on the cask or table that is in the warehouse, and a great coat; he had a knife in his hand, pointing to the parcel, as though he was going to cut the string; I asked him what that was he brought in? he rather hesitated about the matter; I said, what are you going to do with it? he gave me no particular answer; I said, where have you brought it from? he said, he had brought it from Old Fish-street, from Mr. Gouty, or some such name.</p>
               <p>Q. Not from Mr. Swan? - No, I asked him what he was going to do with it? he said, he was going to carry it into the Borough; I asked him whether he had got a bill of parcels? he said, no; I asked Mr. Jones whether he knew any thing of this man, whether he knew he lived with Mr. Gouty? he said, he believed he did; I asked him if he knew any thing respecting the goods? he would not give any satisfactory answer, Mr. Jones would not. I then said, I would go back to Mr. Gouty, to Old Fish-street; he begged I would not take him back to his master, but that he would give me the piece of goods, and he would call the next day, or the day after, and make me every satisfaction I could wish; I then told him I was a constable, and all the satisfaction I wanted was, to carry it to his master where he lived; and then I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160124"></xptr>carried him to Mr. Gouty, and asked them if he was their servant? they told me he was not, (I had hold of the prisoner all the time) they told me he had been a porter, and had left them, and lived with Mr. Swan, in Bread-street. I then took him to Mr. Swan, and knocked at the door, and the maid said, Mr. Swan was in bed; I desired he might be called up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - I did, and shewed him the goods; and he said, they were his property, they had his private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you to follow him to Jones's? - I saw him at the door, with this under his arm; I knew the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know it?</p>
               <p>Court. Constables generally know where bad houses are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I am desired to ask you this question; did you not tell him it he would give you the goods, you would let him go? - No, he offered the goods over and over again.</p>
               <p>Court to Swan. Look at the goods. Where were they kept? - In the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it last? - I cannot tell when I see it last, having a quantity of these goods; if I had looked for it I should have missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there your private mark on it? - Yes, there is, it is an R. and dash, my own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It may happen you sell goods with these marks on? - I am very clear I had not, because of the number of the cloths.</p>
               <p>Jury. You take stock regularly, I suppose? - Yes, about once a year; we took this stock about three months ago, and whatever is sold we mark off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this number was missing from your books? - Yes, there are more numbers missing besides this; here is a gentleman here that took stock with me.</p>
               <p>-GREY sworn.</p>
               <p>I took this account of the stock the second day before the prisoner was taken to the Compter, after he was apprehended, the second day after he was taken. The book is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Swan. Is that private mark peculiar to yourself? - No; other people may have the same mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know other people make the same mark; does not Mr. Grey? - No, he does not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grey. I do, but Mr. Swan don't know it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Swan. The knowledge you acquired, whether you had not sold these goods, arose from your books from inspecting them? - No, more than that; we found that number missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it entirely to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called Mr. Gouty, Mr. Grey, and two other witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Court to Swan. Is the warehouse at all connected with the building? - Entirely, but we live up stairs, entirely one building.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of Wilkes Jones: a month before Christmas I was brewing, I left this woman in the care of my place in my absence; I went up stairs to my tea as soon as the brewing was over; after we had done tea, she came up and said that a shift was gone; the yard was full of linen, which she and I had put out; when we began to take the linen in, the first thing that we hung out she said was gone, which was a shift; I desired her not to be in a hurry, and to wait till we had looked the things over, and when we looked them over the shift was gone; she said she knew nothing of it, nobody had been in the yard but the landlady and herself: I found it afterwards at a pawnbroker's, the corner of Long-alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards? - A. A great time afterwards.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On Monday, the 25th of March, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; I searched her, and found a duplicate, dated the 2d of February, for a shift, 2 s. 6 d. pledged in the name of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The day that she said the shift was lost in the evening, she asked me to get on as fast as I could with the ironing; I was never out of the house from the morning to the evening; Mrs. Jones said, there were four shifts, and you have taken in only three; she has sworn to that shift which I had last July, when I had a bad leg; I saw only three.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pawn it? - A. I bought that shift above ten weeks before I left Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know it by the stain; I had it to wash for a woman who had a bad leg and died; and the stain would not come out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Jones agreed to settle the business with me for a pound, for her husband's loss of time and her's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) Is that true? - A. No such thing; there never was a word of that kind mentioned.</p>

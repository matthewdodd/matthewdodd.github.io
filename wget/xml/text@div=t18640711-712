                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, C</hi> 24). At 11 o'clock, on the evening of the 21st June, I was on duty in Clifford-square, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor—the prisoner first came out of a doorway, and the prosecutor came out of the same doorway directly afterwards—he said, "She has got my watch"—I laid hold of her, and he did also—I produce a watch—I saw her pass something into the prosecutor's hand, and I got the Watch from him—the prisoner said, "For God's sake do not lock me up, for the sake of my children; I have not got the watch"—I said, "No, I saw you give it to him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier, carrying on business at No. 131, New Bond-street—between 10 and half-past, on the night of the 21st of June, I was in that street—I was perfectly sober—I was walking from Piccadilly towards Oxford-street—I saw the prisoner at Long's Hotel—she asked me if I would lend her a light coat which I had on—I turned round, and walked back—at the corner of Burlington-street she asked me to treat her—I said I should do nothing of the kind—we walked on beyond Burlington-gardens—I did not notice any other persons—when I got to the corner of Cork-street, some men came behind, and pinioned my arms—the prisoner pushed aside, and I saw my watch-chain drop; she was then in front, close to me—she then ran away—I ran after her to the corner of the next street, about a dozen yards—I then laid hold of her, and the police-sergeant came up—I did not see my watch until I got to the police-station—I had had it in my hand, but had not seen it—the prisoner put it into my hand—she said at first she had not got my watch; then she handed it back, and asked me not to lock her up—the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch.</p>

Q.</hi> When you met the prisoner, were you going home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was going that way—I do not know how far I walked with her—we walked before I lost my watch some six or seven minutes—she did not say anything besides asking for a glass of wine, nor did I—I did not stand still a short time—I did not see the prisoner's face distinctly; she had her veil down—I did not lift it—when I met the prisoner she was not walking; she was loitering about, and I turned back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Benjamin Foreman, and keep some refreshment rooms at No. 138, Holborn Bars. On the 22nd of Nov., shortly after eight o'clock, the prisoner and another came into our place, and had some refreshment—they bespoke a bed for the night, and mentioned the names of my friends, to induce us to take them in—they went up to bed between half-past nine and ten, on the upper floor—my room and the ser<lb></lb>vant's are also on the same floor—when I went to bed, at twenty minutes after eleven, I found one of my drawers had been forced open, and missed from it a half-crown and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was no more money in the drawer—I afterwards saw a half-crown taken from the prisoner's hands by the police<lb></lb>man, and am sure it was the one I had lost, because it was new, and was marked on the edge—eight persons besides the prisoner slept in the house that night—I had more valuable things in the drawer—there was a small jewel<lb></lb>box, which was not opened, and clothes—I valued the half-crown because it was given me—I cannot swear to the shilling—I can swear decidedly to the half-crown—this now produced is it.</p>

               <p>their bed-room—I went up stairs afterwards, and heard one of them going across the passage towards their own room-door, from towards mistress's bed-room—he closed the door—he had either boots or shoes on—we generally shut up about eleven—no one had been up stairs from the time they went up till I heard one of them cross from my mistress's room—the house was closed when I went up—no fresh person had come in since they went up.</p>

On Thursday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 23rd of Nov., about one o'clock I was on duty in Holborn, and was called to the prosecutor's—I went to the prisoner's room, and desired the parties to get up—when the prisoner was pulling on his trowsers I observed that he bad a deal of money in his pocket—I desired him to produce it, which he did—I picked out this half-crown from it—there was no other half-crown among it—I showed it to Mr. Foreman, and she owned it directly—before I found it she said it was marked, and was a new one—she could not well de<lb></lb>scribe it, but said she should know it again directly if she was to see it—I found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the prisoner—on Gardiner, his companion, I found two six<lb></lb>pences, and a knife—I examined the drawers in Mr. Foreman's room, and the dent in them corresponds exactly with the point of that knife—the veneer was chipped off as if by the point of the knife.</p>

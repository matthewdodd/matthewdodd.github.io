            . I am a City officer. On Saturday, the 8th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, I was in the City-road; I observed several persons following a cart - I followed them across Finsbury-square on to Union-street, and down <placeName id="t18310217-95-crimeloc579">Bethnal-green-road</placeName>

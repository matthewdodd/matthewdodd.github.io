                  </hi>. I am the widow of Robert Cole, and on 27th February lived at 10, Buckingham Street, Fitzroy Square—we rented two rooms on the first floor, communicating with each other by a door—the prisoner lodged with us in the back room—he and my husband were fellow workmen at the same hair dressers—on Friday 23rd February a woman named Ruth Wilding came to see us for the first time—she was not lodging with us at all—she slept at our house on Monday, 26th—she was barmaid at the George and Dragon public house opposite us—she left her situation on the Monday—on Tuesday the 27th, my husband stopped away from his work, not being well—after dinner he and I and Ruth Wilding went out together—after going to a public-house and having drink we went to my sister's and took tea—then after leaving her house we went to another public-house; all three of us and my sister also—we had some drink there—after calling on another friend I looked in at the George and Dragon and saw the prisoner there—I went in and gave him the key of his room, leaving my husband and Wilding outside—when I came out they had gone away—I went back to the public house to the prisoner—I don't think I had anything to drink—here—after some time my husband came back alone—I asked where he had been—he said what was that to do with me—he stayed there a short time—I had something to drink with him and then Ruth Wilding came in—I gave her a good scolding for going away with my husband—I had had more drink then I had any business to have—we then left the public-house Wilding said she did not know where to go to sleep that night—I said after hat had occured she should not come in my place—my husband said she should and she did and we all four went home, the prisoner my husband and I and Wilding—when we got upstairs I commenced to scold my hus<lb></lb>band for going away with Wilding after I knew what had occured between them—he had cohabited with her on the Monday morning—I saw it, in by own bed room—I had given her a blanket and pillow to sleep on the couch, and in the morning I found her in bed with my husband and me—when I scolded him he struck me in the eye—he had struck me before we</p>

               <p>got home, in Soho Square, and when I cried Wilding said "If he had hit you twice as hard I am sure he would not have hurt you"—the prisoner was not present then—he was when my husband struck me in the room, and he left the room—he did not say anything before he left—I called him back and said "Don't you go out nor go to bed, if any one goes out let this girl go out"—he then came back—my husband gave me another blow because I said she should not stop there, which sent me spinning round the room—the prisoner then said "If you hit her again like that I will hit you, it is something scandalous the manner you have knocking her about lately"—my husband said "Oh, will you"—he said "Yes, that I will"—my husband went to the fire place to get the pocker to strike the prisoner and the prisoner stepped to the head of my bed and got his gun—he belongs to a Volunteer Corps—I had stood the gun there because there was no room for it in the back room—my husband was coming towards him with the poker like this (<hi rend="italic">raised</hi>) in his right hand, and the prisoner stood like that with the gun (<hi rend="italic">detailing</hi>) holding it by the muzzle with both hands as if to ward off the blow; not pointing it; the butt end was towards my husband—I said to the prisoner "Don't hit him Andrew, hit me instead"—I got between them and got the blow on my head I imagine from the gun and I remember no more—when I became conscious again I felt my husband's forehead was growing cold—he was on the floor—I then became unconscious again—and when I came to again my husband was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My husband and the prisoner had been the best of friends—my husband was unable to go to work on the Tuesday because he had been drinking, and the prisoner went and begged him off after dinner—there had been perpetual quarrels between my husband and me ever since the Friday night; he had been beating me—the prisoner did not interfere—I always said to him "If you hear us quarrel, never interfere;" I beg par<lb></lb>don, he did interfere on the Sunday night to protect me, but he only said very few words—my husband, I, and the prisoner had been over at the George and Dragon on the Sunday night and my husband and I had words there in consequence of his familiarities with Wilding—she said "I shall be over to-morrow"—I said "Oh, will you, you won't"—my husband told me to hold my noise and I said I should not—she said "I hope you are not quarrelling about me"—I said "That is just what I am doing"—after this we went home and had supper and we had words then, and my husband took up a razor from the mantlepiece and said he was sure he should not be hung for putting such as me out of the way, he said if he could not be master of his own place he would show me, I should either go out or he would do for me; he came very close to me with the razor, and the prisoner fastened him from behind with his hands and pinioned him—he took the razor away from him and told him not to be a fool—seeing my husband coming to strike me I buried my face in the couch and he kicked me most unmercifully at the bottom part of my stomach, he hurt me very much and I cried—he then went to bed, I did not, I was afraid to go—I very likely said to the pri<lb></lb>soner that I had had so many narrow escapes I thought he would murder me in the night; I don't know whether I asked him to leave his door open—I laid down in the arm-chair and the prisoner gave me his overcoat to cover me; I stayed in the chair all night—on the Monday morning before my husband went to business he said "If that girl comes here and you refuse her, I am off with her"—she did come to ray place at 6 o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing and I knew I dared not refuse her—I told her how my husband had</p>

               <p>illtreated me—she said she was very sorry, it should not occur again—I told her I was going to meet my husband at 8.30, and she said "I am going that way," and we both went out and met my husband—we went to a public-house at the corner, not the George and Dragon, and the prisoner came in—we got home about 12 o'clock that night, Wilding with us—the prisoner went into his room—I gave Wilding a blanket and pillow to sleep on the conch—I got into bed and went to sleep and I was awoke by my husband and Wilding having connection in my bed; I tried to push, her out, but they laughed at me, and they did it again in my presence in the morning—I saw the prisoner in the morning before he went to work, I was crying and I told him how my husband had treated me—the prisoner went: to: work on the Tuesday, but my husband remained at home with this woman—on the Tuesday night I went to the public-house opposite and saw the prisoner there, I was crying then; I had just had a <hi rend="italic">smack in</hi> the face—I told him that my husband had been beating me in Soho Square, and very likely I said that a policeman bad interfered and that Wilding prevented the police<lb></lb>man locking him up—I can't say whether a policeman had interfered in Soho Square, or that I had threatened to lock him up—I showed him the marks of the hands on my face—I don't remember my husband swearing that he would take my life on the Tuesday night—I did not see him with a decanter in his hand—he had been bound over twice for illtreating me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and have been barmaid at the George and Dragon—on Monday night, 26th February, I was in Mr. and and Mrs. Cole's room on the Tuesday morning I saw the prisoner in the hack room—I saw, him again at 10 o'clock on Tuesday night with Mr. and Mrs. Cole at the George and Dragon; Mrs. Cole and the prisoner were drinking together there, they stopped there till closing time, 12.30; I was not with them, I was waiting for Mr. Cole to come and fetch his wife—I got there just past 12 o'clock, I left there about 12.30, turning out time and went to Cole's, lodging—when we got there Mr. and Mrs. Cole and the prisoner had angry words—Mr. Cole slapped his wife's face, and the prisoner aid if he slapped her again he would knock him down; from that they had nigh words, and the prisoner ran to fetch his gun from the head of Mrs. Cole's bed, he was swinging the gun about with the butt end towards Cole—he had hold of the muzzle, I suppose he meant to hit some one with it—Cole had nothing in his hand then; instead of hitting Cole he hit Mrs. Cole, and she fell down with her head cut—the gun dropped and I picked up and went and put it under the prisoner's bed—Cole ran to get the fireirons, but he did not do anything with them—he got the poker and tongs both, but I put them away under the bed—he laid them down after the prisoner had hit his wife, and I put them down again—he had not got them in his hand when the prisoner hit his wife, it was after the prisoner this wife—he took them up after she was hit and then put them down am, and I put them under Cole's bed—Cole then ran downstairs and said he would fetch a constable to lock the prisoner up—a constable came with him, and Mrs. Cole said "Don't lock him up, I could not hurt him—Cole said Very well"—the prisoner said he was very sorry for at he had done, and they forgave him—Mrs. Cole got the blow on the head with the gun which the prisoner had, and she said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, he has given me my death blow"—and Cole said "I will give him something," he ran to the fireplace to get the fireirons, but they were put away, he could not get them—the prisoner came out of his room and asked me for a</p>

               <p>light, I gave it him and said "Are you going to bed"—he said "Yes," and then he came out of his room a minute or two after and asked me where his gun was—I said I did not know—I asked what be wanted it for—he said "Never mind what I want it for, where is it"—I said I would give it him in the morning if he wanted it—he did net say anything so I thought he was going to bed, and I shut the door and put the couch against the door ready to make up the bed to lie on—in a minute or two after that the prisoner turned the handle of the door, and as he found he could not get in easily, he smashed the panel in with the butt-end of the gun—when Mr. Cole heard that he ran and got a glass decanter and stood behind the door with it up like that (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>), ready to strike the prisoner—he held the neck of the decanter—the prisoner forced the door open and broke two legs off the couch—Cole was standing behind the door, and the prisoner had got the gun pointing through the open door; the door was standing part of the way open—I said "Pray put the gun down, don't use such things as them in a quarrel—he said "You get away"—I said "I will, if you put the gun down," and I got hold of the gun and gave it a twist, thinking it would fall out of his hand—he said "You get away, if not I will shoot you," and I drawed back, and as I drew back he fired at Mr. Cole through the door—he could see the position in which Cole stood through the hole that he broke in the panel—he then fired through another different place in the panel, which made two holes—he did not fire two shots, only one, and Mr. Cole fell down on his face from being shot—as soon as I saw him fall I ran downstairs—there were no angry words at the George and Dragon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said to him "Mind the gun; is it loaded?" and he said "Loaded, no; it should not stand there if it was"—that was when he took the gun, before he struck Mrs. Cole—I will swear that Cole had not the poker or anything in his hand at the time the prisoner struck Mrs. Cole with the gun—Mrs. Cole stepped in between them and said "Don't hit him, hit me"—it was when Mr. Cole said "We will give you something" that he seized the decanter and went towards the door—I suppose he seized it to strike the prisoner with—the prisoner could see and hear him through the hole he had broken through the door—there was no struggle at the door—Cole stood there with the decanter in his hand, he did not use it at all—Cole was not very violent, he was only scuffling about the room before he was shot—he tried to prevent the prisoner from coming into the room—he was not trying to prevent him forcing the door open—the couch was there to prevent him coming in—Cole was trying to prevent his coming in, he stood with his toe against the door—the door was forced open—I did not try to take the gun from the prisoner, I tried to turn it away—at that time Cole was standing behind the door with the decanter in his hand, held up—it was immediately after that the gun went off—I did not see Cole kick his wife in the stomach not in my presence, and I was there all the time—I did not get into their bed on the Monday night—I can swear that—I only knew Cole as a customer at the George and Dragon—Mrs. Cole asked me to come down to their house—I swear that I went there at her solicita<lb></lb>tion—I don't know that she was jealous of me and her husband—she never complained to me—she never quarrelled with me—I don't know what she and her husband were quarrelling about—it was with the prisoner they were quarrelling—Cole said he should not be there, and Mrs. Cole said he should—I suppose Cole was jealous of his wife and the prisoner—I never knew that Mrs. Cole was jealous of me, if she was why should she ask me over—I</p>

About 1.30 on the morning of this occurence hearing cries of "Police "I went to 10, Buckingham Street—I saw Wilding and the prisoner in the passage—I asked him what was the matter—he said "All right policeman, I am not going to run away, I done it, I fired the gun"—Wilding had said "There is a man shot up in the first floor"—I took the prisoner into custody and when Farey came I went up-stairs and found the gun—the deceased was lying on the floor in a pool of blood—I found an empty cartridge in the gun which I gave to Inspector Aunger.</p>

From what I heard I went to 10, Buckingham Street, about 1.45 on this morning—T there found the prisoner in custody and saw the body of the deceased—I examined the room and found two holes in the pannel of the door and I had the pannel removed and brought here—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards examined the window frame of the room opposite the place from which I took the pannel, and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "I wish that no blame or shame should be attached to Mrs. Cole in any way. I believe it is the general feeling that she is to blame. I did not wilfully shoot him, it was done accidently, the gun exploded while I had it in my hand. I cannot tell what caused it to go off. I had the rifle in my right hand, the butt was on the ground. It could be easily accounted for by the hole in the door. I held the gun in a slanting position. As regards loading the rifle I know nothing about it.</p>

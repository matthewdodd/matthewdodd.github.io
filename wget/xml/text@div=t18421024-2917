                  </hi>. On the 8th of October I happened to go into the house where the prisoner was—I gave her half-a-crown, and we were going to bed—as soon as I went to bed she got my trowsers and robbed me of two sovereigns and four half-crowns—I know I had that money in my trowsers when they were taken off—she took the money out and left the trowsers.</p>

I received information, and found the prisoner in a house in Twine-court—I said I had come to take her for robbing Patrick Stanley of two sovereigns and four half-crowns—she said she was willing to go with me, and she had not a farthing about her—I took her to the station, and had to wait some time for the searcher—the prisoner said if a person had taken any money it was better to di<lb></lb>vide it than go to prison, and she said, "Take this"—I opened her hand and took one sovereign out, which she took from under her clothes—no more was found.</p>

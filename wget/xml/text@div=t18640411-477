I am ostler at the Red Lion, Barnes—on Thursday even<lb></lb>ing, 17th March, between 7 and 8 o'clock, the prisoner came in and had a glass of stout—he went out, came in again, and had half-quartern of gin—I saw he was fresh, and watched him—I saw him shifting money from his pocket, put it in paper, and put it in his purse—nobody was with him—he stayed about ten minutes—he seemed the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman,</hi> 372 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). On Thursday evening, 17th March, I saw the prisoner outside the Red Lion, rolling up some money in tissue paper—I was in uniform—he looked up, saw me, and then went round to the right-hand corner of the Red Lion—he was gone about a minute, and when he came back I asked him whether he was waiting for an omni<lb></lb>bus—he said, "No"—he appeared sober—I was within a yard and a half or two yards of him; he was able to walk—I took him to the station half an hour afterwards—he gave his name "George Mark"—I asked him what he bad been drinking—he said, "Stout"—I asked him where he lived, but he was so stupid in his speech I could not make out what he said—I hired a horse and cart, and took him to Wandsworth station, where I found loose, in his right trousers'-pocket, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—four of the shillings were bad—in the right-hand pocket of his Inverness-cape I found a purse containing seven shillings, two florins, and one half-crown, all counter<lb></lb>feit, and all wrapped separately in tissue paper—I gave it to Sergeant Keenan, and by his orders I searched the court, and found the bad shilling—the pri<lb></lb>soner gave his name at the police-court, "George Smith, 244, Gray's-inn-road"—I went there and found that it was his right address.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, V</hi> 41). On Thursday night, 17th March, the prisoner was brought to Southwark police-station by Whitehead—I searched him, and found four shillings, four sixpences, and a threepenny<lb></lb>piece—I said, "Is that all the money you have got?"—he began to move himself about, and pulled out his purse, which he handed to me—the con<lb></lb>stable opened it—I saw the tissue-paper, looked at the money, and said, "This is all bad"—there were seven shillings, a florin, and a half-crown, all bad—on examining the other money I found four bad shillings—I directed the court to be examined, and the constable brought in a bad shilling—I asked the prisoner his name—he said, "Marsh," or "Mark"—he gave his right address—I showed him the purse next morning, and he said, "That is not my purse"—I said, What about this money?"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You had it last night"—he said, "I do not know what I had"—I said, "What money had you when you left home yesterday morn<lb></lb>ing?"—he said, "A sovereign and some change," and that he went to Lam<lb></lb>beth to see some friends, and went down by the train to Barnes with two friends, who gave him something to drink, and after he got out of the town he recollected nothing more.</p>

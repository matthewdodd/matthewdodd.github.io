                  </hi>I live in Church-street, Woolwich, and am a shoemaker. On the 15th of May, the prisoner came to my house with this basket, which I produce—he asked if I had a pair of cossacks that would fit him—he wanted them with hob nails—I had a pair with spara<lb></lb>bles—he said they would not do, that he would try to get a pair, and if he could not he would come back—when he was gone I missed a pair of boots off a nail over where his basket had stood—I went and overtook him—I said I missed a pair of boots, and wished to look into his basket—he said, "Very well, there is nothing like being sure, I will go back with you"—when we got to my door, he dropped the basket with the boots in it, and a coat which he was carrying, and ran off—I pursued, and he was taken—these are my boots—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer, carrying on business at Bradford, in Yorkshire—some time last year I had business transaction with a person named Richard Pearson—the first was on 3d June, and they continued till the middle of July; at that time he was indebted to me, for goods supplied, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or: there more—I received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him; he owed me 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the middle of July, I saw Pearson and the prisoner at the Bowling Green hotel, at Bradford—I went there expecting to see Pearson, and Newman was there when I arrived, in the large chamber, along the Pearson—Pearson took me into a small room, and afterwards went out and called Newman into the room—he said to him, "Come here, if you please, I have been telling this gentleman about your owing we this 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Newman said, "It is so; I am a man that ships a good deal, and I am expecting some money in the course of two or three weeks, or it perhaps may be rather longer, and you shall be paid every penny"—he then went out—I saw him once or twice after that, on the same day—I saw him three times that day at the Bowling Green hotel—Pearson was present twice when I saw him—Pearson said, in Newman's presence, the second time I saw him, that Newman was a man that shipped a good deal, and he was likely to do a tradesman a deal of good, that he was a man of great wealth—I said they might go and look some goods over—I next saw Newman, somewhere about the middle of August, at the Bowling Green hotel—I said to him, it would not do; the payments not having been made in an honourable sort of way, and I was surprised—he made a statement, that the accounts had not come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050119"></xptr>
               <p>from abroad, as they ought to have done; I had no occasion to be at all frightened, and he showed a telegram he had got—he had it in his hand, and he said there were both money and goods coming to a large extent—he mentioned Russia and other places; I did not particularly notice—he said I need not be frightened, for all would be paid in a very short time—that is chiefly what he said—the whole amount of goods I supplied after the middle of July, was somewhere about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—after I first saw Newman, about 28th or 29th of August, I supplied 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, I think—it was after the middle of August—it was in consequence of what Newman said, that I allowed the further credit, from the middle of July, from his conventions with Pearson; but for Pearson's representing Newman to be a rich man, I should not have supplied more goods, because be bad missed his payments—I next saw Newman, in September, about the 11th, I believe, at the same hotel, at Bradford—Pearson was with him—there was some conversation about a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on that occasion—it was owing to Mr. Newman that I got that cheque—I have not got it now; I destroyed it—Newman said that he had got a notice from abroad that there was a large sum of money coming, he thought he would have it in a day or two, but he was certain within a week, so that it would be certain to be there before the cheque was due—I am not certain whether the cheque was given to me on the 11th, or whether it was due on the 11th—I got no money on account of it—it was dated a week forward—before I destroyed it, I presented it; not myself, it was sent up. and I had it back again, and destroyed it, perhaps it might be a fortnight afterwards—it was made payable to me, from Pearson, on the London and Westminster Bank, I believe—at the Utter end of October, I received six bills of exchange, from Pearson, at the Great Northern hotel, at Leeds—Newman was not present then—I afterwards saw him at the Junction inn, at Bradford, and had some conversation with him about those bills,—as soon as I went in, I pat two bills down on the table and said to Mr. Newman, "Those bills ought to be endorsed by you; will you endorse them now"—I said, "Here is Mr. Pearson here, says you ought to endorse them"—Pearson was there the whole time—I let them stop on the table half an hour or forty minutes, and Newman walked about and never said a word—Pearson said they belonged to him, and he ought to endorse them—there was no pen and ink there, and I thought I would go out and get some—just as I came in, Pearson and Newman were talking about these bills, and Pearson said, "You ought to endorse them, for you know they are bills that I got from you"—Newman said, "I should have endorsed them, but for his (meaning me) stopping the 625<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills from being discounted"—he said nothing more—I let them stop about twenty minutes longer, but he did not endorse them—those bills were three of the six I had received from Pearson—they were not in part payment of my account—they were not given to me—they were given to another party—I received the six bills at Leeds, at payment towards my account—I never saw the 625<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills, to which New<lb></lb>man adverted—these are the six bills I received (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can't exactly tell you when I received these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was previous to getting the six bills at Leeds—I got these two from Pearson—I never had any conversation with Newman in respect of these two bills; they were paid away directly—I never got any money on those two bills, or upon the six—they are all due—after I saw Newman in the middle of July, I got a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him, which was dishonoured—I believe I got that about 17th September—that is the only sum I received at all, except 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after this</p>

I am a woollen manufacturer at Dewsbury, about nine miles from Bradford, in Yorkshire—I made the acquaintance of the prisoner in last August, I believe the latter part of August—he was with a person named Richard Pearson, and a man they call Johnson—Johnson came first before the others—I saw them at my warehouse at Dewsbury—they there picked out a parcel of goods to the amount of 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Johnson, in New<lb></lb>man's presence, spoke about Mr. Newman's wife having a farm in her own right at Dorking; inducing me to give him credit, and that he was a man of money, that some of his relations on his wife's side were very rich, and his friends abroad were wealthy—Newman told me himself that he wanted the goods to ship off to Naples—he said the blankets were for Garibaldi—I asked them for references, and amongst others they gave me references to Demas Ellis, and Co. and Jeremiah Walton—I wrote to them, found them satisfac<lb></lb>tory, and sent the goods to Richard Pearson, 6, Noble-street—I was to send them there, because Mr. Newman stated that he had not a warehouse in Fenchurch-street, but Mr. Pearson had one—at that time I received an acceptance from Mr. Pearson—it was laid in London several weeks; it was due yesterday, and I have sent it to my bankers; I have not got it now—it has been several times to the office of Mr. Holmes, the prisoner's solicitor—it has been there for them to pay us the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance—I have not been able to get the money—Newman called on me in Dewsbury by himself after the first lot of goods were obtained and bought a lot of goods—I cannot speak to the amount—I did not send them—I looked them out and marked them—they were woollen goods—he gave us an order for some blankets—we got the material spun ready, but in consequence of what we heard we did not complete the order, and are using it for something else—that was about September—I cannot speak exactly to the amount of that order—he said He</p>

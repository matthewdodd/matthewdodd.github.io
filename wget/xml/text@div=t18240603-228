            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. I met the prisoner on the 20th of May, coming down King-street, Westminster, carrying something weighty in a white cloth under his arm. I asked him where he got it - he said, it was a cistern; I took him to a public-house, and he there said,</p>
               <p>"I will tell you the truth; I am employed as a mason's labourer at Poet's-corner, Westminster-abbey, and this was thrown down to me to go and sell it." I left the lead in the house, and took him into custody.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030083"></xptr>ALEXANDER MITCHEL. I unrolled the lead; it was measured; and we went to the top of the abbey - it corresponded exactly - there was a piece of solder which was cut from the abbey by Scott, and compared with the other which was taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were pulling the whole wall down; this was hanging down; I found it, and took it away.</p>

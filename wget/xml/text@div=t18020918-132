             sworn. - I am a watchman: About one o'clock, on the 30th of August, I was called by the prosecutor, who said, he had been drawn of his watch by the prisoner, which she denied; in the space of a minute, the lamp-lighter came by with his torch, and saw the watch laying behind the woman; I took it up, and have it here. (The watch was produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met that man, and he would go with me; I said, he could not; he tore my petticoats out of the plaits, and behaved in such a a manner, as was shameful, in the street; he dropped his watch from his breeches, and then said I had robbed him. <rs id="t18020918-132-verdict702" type="verdictDescription">

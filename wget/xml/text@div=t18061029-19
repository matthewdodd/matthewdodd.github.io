             sworn. Examined by Mr. Reynolds. You live in Spring street, St. Mary-le-bone. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23 of August last had you a horse to dispose of. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner. - A. At the back of my own house in the mews, he came to me at the stable, he said he heard that I had a horse to sell, he bought a person with him whom I had some little knowledge of, who lived in the neighbourhood. He likewise recommended him to buy the horse, he agreed to give seven pounds for the horse, the horse was shewn him, I asked him for a shilling earnest, he borrowed a shilling of the person that was with him and gave it me; he told me he was about taking some stables in the neighbourhood, it would not be convenient to take him away then, if I would keep it two or three days he would satisfy me for the keep of it; I told him I would, he went away.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand from you that you had absolutely sold the horse. - A. Yes, when he had paid me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that you agreed with him for the price of seven pounds, and you desired a shilling earnest, which you had, and then you had stipulated for two or three days that you were to keep the horse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have taken it away immediately if he pleased. - A. If he paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said then about his paying for it. - A. I do not know that there was, I considered the horse as sold, though I had not the money, and I considered that he would pay me the money when he took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. You considered the shilling as binding the bargain. - A. Yes, he said he would fetch it away on the Monday, or Tuesday following, and pay me for it, this was on Saturday; on Tuesday he came and trimmed the horse, and took it away; he said he was going as far as Paddington, he thought he had got a customer for the horse, he would go and shew it to a gentleman, and he would bring it back, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he have sold it to that gentleman. A. I expected he would either bring me the horse or the money back. He brought the horse back at five o'clock, he said it would not suit the gentleman. On Thursday he came into my own shop about one o'clock in the day and asked me to lend him the horse, he had been and sold a horse for sixty guineas, and he wanted to go to Cornhill to get change for a check, he should not be gone above an hour, he would then return and pay for the horse and take it away; on that ground I went out with him and delivered him the horse to go into the city on the ground of him coming back.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean, on the ground of supposing him to come back. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Q. Do you mean to come back with the horse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what necessity there was for him riding to Cornhill. - A. He said if I would lend him the horse he might as well ride as walk.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you not say he might as well walk as ride. - A. I did not say that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Did he ever return the horse. - A. He did not. About a quarter of an hour after he had been with me that day my boy saw a boy riding the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. That we shall hear from him, when did you see the horse again. - A. I saw the horse the next day, I saw a boy riding it about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw nothing of the prisoner then. - A. No, sir, I saw the prisoner about three or four days afterwards I saw him pass where I live, I followed him into a public house in the the neighbourhood, I asked him where my horse was, I told him I heard he had sold it, I told him I would go and take him away from the man that had got it, he said I could not do that, he said he would put another horse into my custody till such times he had paid me for the other; I told him it was very well, I hoped he would bring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290017"></xptr>me another horse or pay me the money; I told him I thought he wanted to swindle me out of the horse, he made some fair promises, and I expected to see him again the same day; he never came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I ask you upon your oath did you never part with this horse as a sale. - A. No, I never should have parted with the horse, except I had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thursday when he came, your apprentice was present in the shop. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the horse afterwards. - A. I went to the man that had bought the horse, and I asked him if he had bought such a horse, he is here, his name is Henderson; I saw the horse last night.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Reynolds. I am a fishmonger, I live in Paddington-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes. On the 27th of August, about one o'clock in the day, he called at my house, I bought the horse of him, he said, Henderson, I see you were looking at this poney when I was buying it of Mr. Curtis (I was at Mr. Curtis's stables); he said I have bought him for a customer of mine, it does not suit him, and if you like to have him, I will sell him to you for seven guinear and a small dish of fish, whatever you like to give me; I bought the poney of him, I gave him seven guineas on that day, I have got the receipt in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the horse again. - A. I have seen him; I disposed of him afterwards, the next day after Mr. Purveiss was taken before Mr. Conant; the horse was of no use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask Mr. Henderson whether he did not go to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18061029-19-person252">Curtis</persName>
             the day after I had bought the poney, and Mr. Curtis told him he had sold it to Mr. Purveiss - A. I did. On Monday before the 27th I went into Mr. Curtis's stable yard, he says to me, what, Henderson, you are come niggling, or something like that, after my horse again; I said, Curtis, I think the horse will suit me, I should wish to buy him, his reply to me was you are too late, for I have sold him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to that gentleman, meaning the prisoner at the bar, I made answer and said it is of no use of my saying any more about him; I went home and left them together.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you sold this horse the day after the prisoner was taken before a magistrate. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to dispose of him when you knew this enquiry was before a magistrate. - A. I went down to Marlborough-street when I heard Purveiss was taken up, to hear if Mr. Conant said any thing about horse stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. That was at the examination of the prisoner. - A. Yes, and I did not hear any thing that inclined me to keep it, and I was tired of it, it was not worth a guinea instead of seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You say this horse was not worth a guinea to you, what did you sell him for. - A. He was restive and would not turn without backing him; I sold him for eight guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold this restive horse for eight guineas. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing at all said to you at Mr. Conant's office. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not told not to sell this horse. - A. Not at the office, there was a man came to me and said you must not part with this horse before we find Purveiss.</p>
               <p>Q. Directly Mr. Purveiss was taken up you parted with it. - A. Yes, because I thought I might do what I liked with it then, I am not used to any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 22d of August I was accompanied by Mr. Warral, a broker, in East-street, in order to purchase a poney he had for sale.</p>
               <p>Court. Who had. - A. Mr. Curtis; Mr. Curtis was not at home, we retired to a public house and waited till he came in. He then took me to the stable and shewed me the poney; I saw the poney out, then I requested him to let me ride it to Chapel-street, Lisson Green; he asked me how long I should be gone, I said ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; the person I went to see was not at home. I returned immediately, he asked me on my return<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290018"></xptr>how I liked the poney, I told him not at all for its riding part, as to its drawing part I did not know; I wanted one to do both; he told me it been accustomed to ride a very little, but it was a very good one in harness; he asked me whether I would make a purchase of it or not; I told him as he had let it till Monday, that would be time enough to decide about it; he said if I thought it would suit me, I might as well decide then, as on Monday; I asked him the lowest price he would take for it, he said seven guineas; I told him I never bought for guineas, I would give him seven pounds for it on Monday if it came back safe; he requested me to give him earnest, I asked him whether he wished for a shilling or a guinea, he said a shilling would do; I having no silver, I borrowed a shilling of the person that took me to him, which I gave him; I called on the Monday at one o'clock, which was the time limited for the poney's return, but it was not returned till the evening; I then called on the Tuesday, the poney was in a very rough state, I trimmed it and made it look in the best state I could, to shew it to another person; I shewed it to the person that I intended to sell it at the time I made the first purchase; I had two or three places to go on business, and after I had gone I returned the poney, I requested him to keep the poney till the end of the week, and I would allow him any thing reasonable for the livery of it, he agreed that it should stand till the end of the week. On Thursday I had occasion to go to two or three places on business, I went to Curtis and asked him to lend me his saddle and bridle, which he did, he put the bridle on and led the poney out, he desired me to take care that he did not kick me and throw me down, he wished that I might not bring it back again; when I got into the adjoining street there was a green grocer wished to look at it, he tried to buy it of me, I let him ride it up and down the street; Mr. Henderson, whom I had previously promised the poney to, provided that he did not suit the person whom I had purchased it for in the first instance, he met me in the same street, he told me that he had got the money for the poney in his pocket if I would take it to his house, which I did, he paid me the money and I gave him a receipt, I requested him to take care of the saddle and the bridle till my return, which might be about five or six o'clock, I did not return that evening; the next morning I went down to Mr. Curtis's, who I saw at his door, I called him to me, we went to a public house to drink a pint of porter, I told him that I had sold the poney, and that I should call and pay him in the course of two or three days, he said he wished to have the money, as he wanted to go to Barnet fair, I told him I should endeavour in the course of the day to get the money, and I was sorry to disappoint him; when I got to the stables where I had two horses that stood at livery, there was a direction left at the stables for me, to a gentleman in the New Road; on my way I called on Curtis, to say that if I was lucky in selling that horse I should call and pay him, but I did not sell it; I told him rather than he should be afraid of his money I would leave him a mare that was worth forty guineas, instead of his poney he requested me to go to his stable to look at his horse's eye; I went to several places to raise the money, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him to look at the horse's eye. - A. I did go with him to the stable to look at the horse's eye; on the following day I went to two places in the country a little way, for money, when I returned I called in the adjoining street to the stables I had taken, where I was told that Mr. Curtis had been to look for me with three officers, to take me up for horse stealing, I said if that was the case I had got the principal part of the money to pay him, but I would not go near him, I turned my horses's head and went to Bayswater, where I live, and about nine o'clock in the evening he came down to my house with three or four men, I did not see him, I was apprised of it, I went out of the way; I was three weeks about the neighbourhood, I met with a friend of Curtis's, I desired him to send for him in order to settle the business, when he came he brought a constable along with him in order to take me into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did. - A. Mr. Curtis; I went before Mr. Conant in Marlborough-street, and Mr. Conant asked Curtis how long he had lost his horse, he said I had not stole it, he had taken earnest, a shilling earnest, he had sold it to me; Mr. Conant thought proper to commit me for it; I have another witness that I should be glad for your lordship to hear.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) I thought you said the agreement was made on the Saturday. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse engaged to go any where - A. A neighbour of mine wanted me to lend him the horse, to go a little way on Saturday, and he would be home on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend him. - A. I did, it did not return till the Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say a word about that before; when Henderson was down there on the Monday the horse was not come back. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner on the Saturday following. - A. Yes, I was coming down the street where I live, he beckoned me and I followed him into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you there that he had sold the poney. - A. He did, I knew to whom he had sold it; I told him, as I had before, I would go and take it away, he said I could not, he would leave another horse in my custody, in case he did notpay me that afternoon; he never brought the horse. I certainly should have taken it if he had, till he paid me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did he accompany you with his advice about any horse's eye in your stable. - A. Yes, I asked him to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Then during this time you had an opportunity of securing him. - A. I had if I had choosed to do it. I did not think that he would have used me as he had.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood that he had sold your horse, and you understood that he had deceived you in getting possession of it. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no thought of prosecuting him then for stealing it. - A. I had not; it was above a fortnight after that, he never came near me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see him again, you say this was on the Saturday. - A. I think it was the Tuesday following he came and saw the horse's eye, or the Wednesday, I am not sure which; it was in the following week he came, and rid up to the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290019"></xptr>and said he would call and pay me for the horse in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this happened that you actually took him up. - A. It was three weeks.</p>

             sworn. I am a cooper, I live at No. 3, East street, Manchester square. Mr. Curtis told me he had a horse to sell, he asked me if I wanted to buy one, I told him no, but I could recommend him to one that I bought mine of; I recommended him to Mr. Purveiss, he went with me and bought him; Mr. Curtis asked him seven guineas, he agreed to take seven pounds, he asked me to lend him a shilling to give earnest for the horse, as he had no silver, I did, he gave the earnest for the horse; he agreed to take him away in a few days. I heard no more of it till Mr. Curtis told me he had taken the horse away and had not paid him for the horse; I told him he did wrong to let him have it without the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he come to take the horse away. - A. No, he only expressed that he had let him have him away according to agreement.</p>

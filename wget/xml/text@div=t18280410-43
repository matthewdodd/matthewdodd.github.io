            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of March, in Catherine-street, Strand; I found one duplicate on him; I told him I took him for stealing the pistols; he said, "If he gets them back again, I suppose it will be all right?" I said I could not answer him, but what he said to me I must give in evidence - he said nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain of what he said? A. Yes - those were his words.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday, when I was taken into custody, I was going to Bow-street to get a warrant to take my prosecutor up; I saw him going into a public-house, and thinking he was looking after me I followed him in, and he gave me in charge; the officer said he had lost his pistols - I said, "I suppose if he has lost any, and finds them, it will be all right." I have seen his pistols laying about very carelessly. Each of the witnesses are perjured.</p>

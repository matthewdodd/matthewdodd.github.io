No; my nephew and neice act as cashiers; they are not here; they could not give him authority - I had the shoes in my hand, the day after they were made, and complained of the work; we had not above a dozen pairs of boys shoes in the house.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in North Audley-street. The prisoner came to me about a pair of shoes, which I ordered of him, and he sent, or brought them home - I was making clothes for him, and did not pay him for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know who brought them? A. No - they were never worn, as they were too large for my son - I kept them for about eleven months - I never settled with him; my son may have worn them in the house; but never went out in them.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you see him after they came? A. Yes, and told him they were too large, but thought they would fit him bye and bye; the prisoner saw them then.</p>

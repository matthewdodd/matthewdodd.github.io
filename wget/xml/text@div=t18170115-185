On the 17th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I parted with a friend in Long-lane, my watch was safe then, the chain hung out; I had been drinking, but knew what I was about. I had just come out of a public-house; two persons came up to me, the prisoner was one of them; I enquired the way to Gray's-inn-lane; they said, they were going that way, and walked part of the way with me, I had my son with me; he walked before, when we got to <placeName id="t18170115-185-crimeloc1013">Cow-cross</placeName>

I called out watch, and the prisoner was taken in half a minute.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had been drinking. I only fell down once. The two prisoners came up to me.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN MOORE. I was with my father, on the 17th of December; he was not very drunk. When we came out of the public-house in Long-lane, the prisoner offered his assistance; I am sure he is one of them; they laid hold of his arm. I put my father's watch in his fob for him, and put the chain inside. When we came to Cow-cross, the prisoner and another man had hold of his arm, there were two men behind; the prisoner gave me a shove, and told me to go on; he pushed the bundle out my hand, I picked it up, my father said I was his son, and he begged his pardon; I heard my father cry out watch! I turned round, and found they had left him. Thompson took one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My father had been drinking at two or three different public-houses; he fell down, and the prisoner offered his assistance.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prosecutor coming from Smithfield; the prisoner had hold of his arm, the other man following. I was in a dark corner, and watched them, I followed them down Cow-cross, one of the three took hold of the prosecutor's arm; I heard the prosecutor call watch, one of the prisoners run down Bowling-street; the prisoner crossed the street; I took him, and told him, he had robbed the man; he said, he had nothing about him; he said, one of those two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150073"></xptr>have got his watch, and I should overtake him; the prosecutor had his senses.</p>

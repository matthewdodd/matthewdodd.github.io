               <p>Tilbury.

            . I went with Mr. Tilbury to the prisoner's house in St. George's in the East; we found five of his sheep, (they had his mark upon them) in a back room of the prisoner's house; they were alive, there was one killed in his shop, he is a butcher; he said he bought them about half a mile out of the Borough for 25 s. each, they were very fat sheep; I think he said the man came from Dartford or Deptford, I cannot tell which, he did not name his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when he bought them?</p>
               <p>Ward. I do not remember that he did.</p>

               <p>I bought the sheep on the Friday night, near eight o'clock, there were eight of them, about half a mile beyond the bridge in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What are you?</p>
               <p>Tilbury. I am a butcher by trade, and hold a little land.</p>

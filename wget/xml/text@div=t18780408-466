                  </hi>. I live at 58, Alderminster Road, Bermondsey—the deceased was my husband—the prisoner lodged in the same house—on 1st March, about 8 or 8.30 a.m., the prisoner came to our room—my husband heard his name mentioned and went out and said "Pay me what you owe me"—the prisoner said "Pay me and I will pay you. If I hear my name mentioned again I will come up again," but he did not come up—my husband afterwards went into the street—the prisoner works in the kitchen close to the window—as he went out he said "Pay me what you owe me"—I did not hear any more—between 12 and 1 o'clock I saw my husband talking to a policeman and thought he was coming up to get his dinner—he came back several times but did not come upstairs—I went downstairs and saw him lying on the pavement and the prisoner was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner is a shoemaker and had been mending some boots for my husband—there was a dispute about the account owing between them—when my husband came back in the morning I suppose it was to insult the prisoner—I heard him calling out several times to the prisoner, but did not hear what he said—I heard him making a great deal of noise—he came back three or four times, and the last time he stood outside the area railing some time, abusing the prisoner—they were very good friends before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 50, Alderminster Road—on 1st March I was sitting at my window, which is about 30 yards from the prisoner's place—I heard some one speaking in a loud voice between 11.30 and 12 o'clock—I opened the window and saw Mr. Duncan looking down the area—he said "Get out of this neighbourhood"—he then went into the house, waited five minutes, and then went across the road and spoke to two policemen—he then re-crossed the road and Steel went up and struck him—Steel was then at the bottom of the steps leading to the door—the prisoner then struck Steel in face with his left fist—he struck him three times, and at the second blow Duncan was holding the railings—after the third blow he fell heavily to the pavement—before giving him the second blow the prisoner said "Stand up like a man."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was leaning out at my window—Duncan said "Get out of the neighbourhood," in an abusive way—the prisoner's fist was clenched when he struck him; I could see quite plain—Duncan put up</p>

I live at 62, Alderminster Road—on 1st March, about noon, I saw Duncan standing on the opposite side of the way talking to two policemen—he then crossed the road to his dinner—I was going up my steps and heard some words, turned round, and saw the prisoner strike Duncan with his fist two or three times—I did not see whether Duncan put his hands up—Duncan fell and I went over and picked his hat up.</p>

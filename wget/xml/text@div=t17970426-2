               <p>ROBERT JONES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an Excise-officer: On the 7th of December, I was stationed at Robert's bridge, near Battle, in Sussex; between one and two o'clock on that day, I was at a public-house, called the Royal-Oak, at Warlington; I saw a cart with two horses going by, which I suspected was loaded with smuggled goods, and I took my horse out of the stable, and went towards Battle; I met Mr. Pilcher, and a serjeant in the Lanark and Dumbarton sencibles, we overtook the cart.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was with the cart? - A. One Thomas Johnson; and another man, whose name I did not know, in another cart; I told

             I had an information, that he had smuggled goods in his cart; he said, I was mistaken; Mr. George Pilcher came to the tail part of the cart, and he examined the goods; he cut one bag, and pulled part of the contents out, and it turned out to be unmanufactured tobacco, which I put in my great coat pocket; we seized the cart, and went on with it to a place called <placeName id="t17970426-2-crimeloc7">Vine-hall</placeName>

             was in the cart at that time, then Johnson called to them to turn the cart round, which several persons did, and the prisoner was one of them, he said hold of the reins after the cart was turned round; Johnson said, he would shoot the first man that offered to follow them, I told him, I would follow him, because that was my way home to my residence; then he went into the cart, and Kingsmore gave him the reins and went up the hill, I think, about forty yards, when he returned with other; Mr. Pilcher said, Kingsmore, have you any thing to do with it? Kingsmore said, do you know me? yes, says he, I know you very well; d-n you, I wish you did not; or, I know how it would be, he said to Johnson, d-n them, do not let them have it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might you be detained on the road before you got to the public-house; you and Johnson had been scuffling? - A. No, we had no scuffling, only some words.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fieling. I am an officer in the Excise; I was in company with the last witness, we followed this cart; I went to the backside of the cart and saw some bags of tobacco, I cut one of them up; and, as soon as we saw what it was, we seized the cart and brought it back to Vine-hall before we came to Vine-hall, after we had seized it, Johnson begged for one horse, and I told him I could not do it; when we got to Vine-hall he begged for his great coat, I was then in the cart, I threw out the great coat; and then he said, I will give any body ten guineas to help me sight them; there were many people out at that time, and I believe the prisoner was out at that time; upon that the prisoner at the bar whispered something to Johnson, what I cannot tell; I said to him, Kingsmore, have you any thing to do with this business? I knew him before; says he d-n you, you know me, do not you? yes, says I; says he, I with you did not, and I Know how it would be soon; then, after that, Johnson produced his pistols, and said, some of our lives must be lost, for I would sooner lose my life than my goods; I then came out of the cart, and went to the public-house; he then presented a double barrelled pistol at me, he called out to the people to turn the cart, which they did, and Johnson stood then with his pistol in his hand, and threatened to shoot me; I thought then it was time to give it up; he went with Johnson a little way, and some others, and then he came back, and told me he had endeavoured to persuade Johnson to run away and leave us the cart; I told him he had better have had no business with it, as he might smart for it here after.</p>

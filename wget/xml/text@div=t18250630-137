            . My maiden name was Bunning - when I was single I had 1380 l. in the Navy 5 per cents. - the late Mr. Hippuff was my broker; he died about the end of 1815: the defendant represented to me that he had succeeded him, and became my broker; I lived at Leicester. I authorized him to receive my dividends; 20 l. was afterwards added to my stock, which made it 1400 l.; he continued regularly to receive my dividends. In January, 1817, I paid 130 l. into the hands of Messrs. Pares and Co., bankers, of Leicester, and wrote to inform him of it.</p>
               <p>This letter was here produced by the Defendant, and was as follows: -</p>
               <p>SIR, - Having been favoured with your favour of the 4th instant, I beg to inform you there is 130 l. paid into the hands of the bankers, Messrs. Pares and Padget, of this town, in favour of you; therefore you will please to call for it, any day this week - I think Saturday will be the best day, as then you will be sure to have it paid to you, and after paying yourself for your trouble, and the expences of my letters, please to receive the dividend due on my former stock, and add that and the above 130 l. to the whole, and when convenient send me the receipt.</p>
               <p>Yours, &amp;c. H. Bunning.</p>
               <p>Bankers, Messrs. Pares and Heygate, No. 25, New Bridge-street, Blackfriars.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Pares and Heygate, of New Bridge-street, who correspond with Messrs. Pares and Padget, of Leicester. (Looking at a cheque;) this was paid at our house, in one Bank note of 100 l., and another of 30 l.; it is drawn by S. Pawsey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you pay it yourself? A. Yes; the entry is in my writing: I cannot tell to whom I paid it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you pay the money to the person who signed the cheque? A. Yes. It is dated January, 1817.</p>
               <p>MRS. KEITH. The signature to this cheque is in the defendant's hand-writing. I came to town about the 10th of July, 1818, and spoke to him about having bought my money into the 5 per cents.; he informed me that he had laid out 165 l. for me in the Navy 5 per cents. I told him I was coming to town to reside, and should not have occasion to trouble him to receive the dividends in future, and begged him to go to the Bank with me to see that all was right, and receive the dividend then due; he said if I would call in a few days he would go, as he was very busy, and I might depend upon it that all was right. I had received my dividends from him regularly as they became due; the half yearly dividend had increased from 35 l. to 39 l. odd. I had no other stock but Navy 5 per cents. I went to him in a few days, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Pawsey, will you go with me to the Bank, to receive my dividend on my 1570 l. odd?" which was the sum I understood I had; he said he had been and received the dividend, and that I had nothing to do in future but to go to the Bank next January, and receive it myself, and that would cancel the power of attorney; I asked for the dividend which he had received - he seemed confused, said he had not got the money about him, but would call or send it next day, or the day after; his uncle, Downes, called and left 39 l. odd at my house - I believe it came at two different times. This letter is in his hand-writing;</p>
               <p>(looking at it.)</p>
               <p>This letter was here read, stating that 4 l. 6 s. 9 d. was enclosed, being the balance of the July dividend, and apologising for not having sent it before.</p>
               <p>MRS. KEITH. These two sums made up the dividend. Soon after this I went to the Bank alone, and inquired at the Navy 5 per cent. office. I afterwards saw Pawsey, and said to him,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Pawsey, I have something against you;" he said,</p>
               <p>"What is it? I hope you received your July dividend right?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you have never made the purchase of the 165 l., which you told me you had in the letter you sent me;" he appeared very much confused, and said,</p>
               <p>"Did you look over the books yourself?" I said,</p>
               <p>"I did, and the clerk also, which was much better;" he then said,</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry, but through distressing circumstances I was obliged to apply the money to my own use;" I said,</p>
               <p>"I could not have thought it possible that you would have disgraced so highly respectable a gentleman as your friend and mine, Mr. Hippuff:" he said he was extremely sorry for it, and if I would give him fourteen days from that time, he would assuredly make the purchase - I left him, and at the expiration of the fourteen days went to the Bank, and not being satisfied I went to his office, where I saw a man, named Eaton, but I could not find him. I did not see him till the latter end of September, or October; I had related the circumstance to my friends, and had him arrested - he gave some paper to my attorney, and was liberated. I have never received a shilling, nor was it ever invested for my use. All my stock was transferred at my marriage into the hands of trustees. I received the dividends myself afterwards. I married in February, 1822. I have never received more than 35 l. a half year. I saw him in the Insolvent Debtors' Court in 1819, and have seen him two or three times since; he has made an apology for the injury he has done me, and promised I should not lose a shilling of the money, for if I would give him time he would make it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300046"></xptr>good, and prove his honest intention; but I have not received a shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Has he not since last Session, offered you security for the money? A. He said he would make the purchase good if I would give him more time. He was imprisoned about two months after I saw him in the Insolvent Court - I opposed his discharge. I have heard him say that it was through Eaton's misconduct that he had been obliged to use the money. - I do not know what has become of Eaton.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever hear of Eaton before you came to town? A. I had received a letter signed Eaton, enclosing a 10 l. note, in part payment of a dividend, and stating that Pawsey was out of town, and that the remainder should be paid into the banker's for me to receive, which was done - this was in July, 1817. I never considered Eaton as his partner.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's brother, and have applied to the defendant on many occasions, respecting this money, up to July, 1824, and always received a promise - he never offered any security.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know how many years he has been in prison since your sister lost her money? A. I know he was there from November 1819, to March 1820, when he gave bail. I have been one hundred miles after him since - I never found him in prison. On the 14th of January, 1824, he gave me a promissory note of 5 l., as part of the interest. I took it without my sister's knowledge; it was not paid.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant, and called three witnesses, who deposed to his good character.</p>

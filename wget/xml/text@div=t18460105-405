                  </hi>. I am in the service of John and Frederick Tallis; they are publishers; their premises are in St. John-street; the prisoner was in their service as errand-boy. On the 15th of Nov. I gave him four parcels to take to different inns, to be forwarded to the country, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay the car<lb></lb>riage and booking—Joseph Folks is in our employ—I shut up at eight o'clock that night—I did not expect the prisoner to return that night, but on Monday morning—the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was more than sufficient to pay all that he had to pay, and the remainder he was to return to me on Monday morning—he had a truck to take away the parcels, and Folks went with him—the prisoner did not appear again on the Monday—he did not come afterwards at all—I did not see him again till he was taken into custody, which was on the 19th of Dec—he did not come to his work—Folks brought the truck back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Tallis as an errand-boy. On Saturday, the 15th of Nov., I was present when the money was given to the prisoner, but I do not know what it was—there was a parcel-book, which I took with me to the inns, and had the parcels booked—I paid the money, and the prisoner minded the truck—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said, "I suppose that will be enough"—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for booking a parcel at the Swan with Two Necks, and I paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the Belle Sauvage—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in all, and gave him a sixpence and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back—he would have to pay 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the truck; that would make 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. spent—I parted with him just by the Post-office—I did not see him again till he was at the police-office.</p>

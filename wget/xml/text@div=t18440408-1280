                  </hi>. I carry on business as a wholesale warehouse-man in Ave-Maria-lane, Ludgate-street, in partnership with my brother John. I know the prisoner; he calls himself a wine-merchant, and does a sort of agency business—he was indebted to us—he came, on the 20th of Dec., and offered me this bill of exchange—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said he would take part goods and part cash for it—I told him if he would leave the bill, and call again, we would make inquiries about it—he said it was a very good bill, a bill as good as Rothschild's, as good as the Bank of England's—I saw him again on the 22nd of Dec—we had then made inquiries, and said we would take it—we gave him part goods, and a cheque for the remainder, which was 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw him put his name on the back of the cheque when he received it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and have lived at the Due de Orleans, at Paris, for two years; I am a native of Bremen, and did live there; I do business in Paris for the house of Bolte and Co., at Bremen. On the 1 1th of Nov. last I bought four bills of exchange, on Hamburg, for them—on the next day I enclosed those bills in a letter, which I sealed with my seal, and addressed it to Messrs. Bolte and Co., Bremen, and, being indisposed, I sent my boy with the letter to the post-office—this was on Sunday, the 12th of Nov.—I have had communications since from Bremen on the subject of these bills—this is one of the bills (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) that I enclosed in the letter—I am very well acquainted with the houses of business in Paris, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080210"></xptr>
               <p>I have inquired; there is no such firm as Bolte and Co., at Paris—this bill is not in the same state as when I sent it; a false indorsement has been added to it, which follows my indorsement to "Bolte and Co., Bremen"—"Pay to the order of Mr. H. W. Albert, value in account. Paris, 30 Nov. 1843. Bolte and Co."—I indorsed it "In account," because I had an ac<lb></lb>count with Bolte and Co.; and now this false indorsement is "Value in ac<lb></lb>count," as if Bolte and Co. had some account with Mr. Albert; that is very wrong—these other two bills (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) are part of the same purchase, and have my indorsement the same as the other—here is on one of them, "H. W. Albert," and on the other, "J. H. Albert."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of the firm of Bolte and Co., living at Bremen, and carrying on business there—they have no house of business or establishment at Paris, or anywhere except at Bremen—Jo<lb></lb>hanna Rosing is their agent at Paris—we expected a remittance of some bills from him in Nov. last—the bills did not arrive, and, not receiving them, we drew on him on account, on the 1st of Dec., for part of the sum—this bill would have been worth about 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money last Nov.—this indorse<lb></lb>ment of "Bolte and Co." on it is not my writing, nor the writing of either of my partners—no person has any authority to draw or to indorse bills of ex<lb></lb>change for the firm but my two partners and myself—this indorsement of Mr. Rosing to us, "Value in account," means that he stands in account with us, and so he makes us remittances for it—it is a transaction of account, not a cash transaction—that is always the way of doing business amongst mer<lb></lb>chants—these other two bills were never received by our house, nor is there any indorsement of ours, or by authority from us, upon them—the name of "H. W. Albert" was never known to us—we never had any transaction with him—we know nothing of "J. W. Albert," which is on the other bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. John's Wood-road, and am clerk to Konigswater Brothers, of London. We bought this bill of exchange of the prisoner about the 12th of Dec. last—it is worth about 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money—he asked if we would buy it of him—we had previously refused to buy a bill of him, as he was a stranger; and when he brought this be brought a person to introduce him, whom we had known in business—here is on this bill the supposed indorsement of "Bolte and Co., pay to order of H. W. Albert, value in account"—that imports that there had been transactions between the house of Bolte and Co. and the indorsee—a person in the prisoner's situation would know enough of the language and practice of bills, to be aware of what it meant—when the bill was at maturity it was not paid.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you speaking of-what the prisoner said to you, or did he speak to anybody else in the firm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He spoke to Mr. Konigswater—I can undertake to say that I heard all that passed—I had no other employ<lb></lb>ment at that moment, and was listening to what was spoken—the name of Frederick was not mentioned to us by the prisoner when we bought this bill—I cannot say whether we saw the prisoner at any other time about this bill; but in speaking of another bill he named Frederick, and gave his address in Paris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the attornies for this prosecution. I am concerned for Mr. M'Rae, and also for Bolte and Co.—in consequence of what was learnt on the subject of this bill, I went several times to the prisoner's lodg<lb></lb>ings—I at last saw him the day before he was taken up—he spoke English—I told him that this bill was returned to my clients, with the statement that the indorsement, "Bolte and Co.," was a forgery—he said it was perfectly right, and he could refer me to Mr. Johnson, of Cecil-street, Strand, who would tell me it was all right, and would be paid—I went immediately to Mr. Johnson, who told me he knew nothing at all about it—I communicated that to the prisoner on the following day, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say he spoke English; does he not speak it very imperfectly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He spoke it as well as either of the witnesses we have heard to-day, in my opinion—he spoke English fluently for a foreigner—he came to my office, and I spoke to him about this bill—he referred me to Mr. Johnson, and then he left, and the next day the officer took him, near my office—he lodged near my office—I went to endeavour to see him on the day he was taken—I did not expect to see him—I did not understand, when I parted with him the day before, that I was to meet him again the next day—my belief is that I was not to meet him—he gave me a card; but I think if he had said he would meet me again I should have recollected it—I put down the name and address of Mr. Johnson—I gave directions to take the prisoner—I had been several times to his lodging, and was told he was not at home—I then went another time, and as I was knocking at the private door he ran out of the shop—I believe he ran out to avoid me—I followed, and begged him to go to my office, and when there he referred me to Mr. Johnson—I knew then that this indorsement was forged, but I thought it better to see Johnson before I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

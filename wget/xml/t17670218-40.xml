            . I came from Scotland lately; I had been out of place, and I went to be at Mr. Anderson's at Execution-dock, Wapping. On Saturday last, in the evening, I left my things mentioned in the indictment, and went out a little way, and when I came back they were gone; I went and enquired about, and at Mr. Thompson's, a pawnbroker, I found them; when I was at his shop the prisoner came in; he said, that is the woman that brought them here; the things were produced in her presence; she seemed to deny the pawning of them, but he was positive to her.</p>

I am a pawnbroker; I took in a silk cardinal, a linen apron, and two linen handkerchiefs of the prisoner at the bar, on Saturday last; she wanted half a guinea on the cloak; I said, I could not let her have half a guinea upon that; then she produced the other things, and I let her have half a guinea upon them; the Monday following, Mrs. Allen came and asked me, if I had a sattin cardinal in the name of

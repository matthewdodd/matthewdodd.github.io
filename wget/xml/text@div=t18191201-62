On Saturday night, the 27th of November, I went to bed with my wife about half-past nine o'clock, I made the house perfectly secure, and about a quarter after ten I heard the latch of the middle-room door move, as if some one attempted to open it. The house is all on one floor; my shop is behind the two rooms, before which is the parlour and sleeping-room. I laid still, and heard a noise, as if some one was feeling their way in the passage - I whispered to my wife, but she was asleep. A chair stood in the middle of the room adjoining the bed-room; this obstructed his passage, and knocked against the door, which awoke my wife. She said,</p>
               <p>"What is that! get up." Any one must have heard us. I got off the bedstead, and at that time the person knocked down a three-legged stool, on which laid some iron and steel, that awoke one of the children. I opened the door, got the poker, and as soon as I got into the workshop he was gone. I found the window and door open, and the lathe broken down. He must have trod on the lathe to get out of the window. I went to the front door, but saw no one. I went in again, struck a light in the bed-room, and heard some persons talking in front. I went to the door and saw Birch - the prisoner was in custody of a watchman. I dressed myself, and went to the watch-house with them. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You have lost nothing, have you?" I said No. He said,</p>
               <p>"You did not see me in your house" - I said No, and asked him how he could have entered the house? he said</p>
               <p>"I was in the garden, I acknowledge, but I was not in your house." I said if he had been in the garden he had been in the house. I went into a field by the side of the gardens; Birch pointed to a place in the fence - we traced footmarks from there to where he escaped. It was a frosty night - one footmark was black and the other white. I knew what made the black one, because in getting out over the lathe he had put his foot on some charcoal dust. I am positive the person in the gardens must have been in the house, as the footmarks were directly from the fence to the window, and back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe whether they were the footmarks of more than one person - A. Only one person, from and to the window - it appeared he had got in at the window. It is a casement window, and I am certain it was shut, and quite safe when I went to bed. I tried to open it myself without any thing, and could not.</p>

            . I am Sergeant at Mace of the City, and live within three doors of Read - my house is down a passage behind his. About ten o'clock at night I was going home, and saw three men, whom I suspected, close to Read's premises. I went home then, returned to fetch some porter, and saw them again standing by his premises. They saw me, and turned to the railings, as if for a necessary purpose. As I returned with my porter, two of them came towards me, and went swiftly by me. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are after no good; if the watchman was here I would give you in charge." I turned my head, and saw the prisoner jump out of the prosecutor's garden into a field, then into a gentleman's garden, and into the passage where I took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010043"></xptr>Q. How near was he to Read's window when you first saw him - A. About six yards. I saw him get over the palings, which are seven feet high. I lost sight of him, and found him secreted under a corner. My dog barked, my wife opened the door, called me, and I took him. He said he had mistaken his way, and he thought it was a thoroughfare. I told him he must have known it was not, for my gate was locked when I went out, and I found it locked when I returned. At the watch-house he said to Read,</p>
               <p>"When you go home examine if you have lost any thing." He said the other two had been playing with him, and had thrown his hat over. I saw the footsteps, and traced a person plainly to and from the house. It was a moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I and two lads had been to see the Canal - I stopped for a necessary purpose - one of them threw my hat over the pales; they called out</p>
               <p>"Stop him!" as I got over the pales - the man knocked me down for it, and said he would knock his pistol down my throat if he had it; I said I came with no bad intent.</p>

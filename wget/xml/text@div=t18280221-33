            . I am servant to Mr. Wilson. On Monday night, the 28th of January, my master went to bed before me; I saw all the places perfectly safe; my master keeps a potatoe-warehouse; I was called up about half-past two o'clock, to make my master a cup of warm tea, as he was taken dangerously ill; I went into a lodger's room to get a light, and then came down stairs; I opened the parlour door, and saw the back parlour window open; also the cupboard and the shop doors open, and the shop shutter was down - that shutter opens inside; I ran up directly, and alarmed my master - I did not assist in searching the premises myself; I found a pair of stockings under the parlour grate - they were both lying together, wet and dirty, as if they had been pulled off the feet; I found the victuals on the table, which I had put away before I went to bed; the roast-beef was on the table, that is, the hones were - none of the beef was left; I had heard a rustling in the parlour while I was knocking at the lodger's door for a light- it was a noise as if a person was moving about; the window of that parlour was open - it looks into the yard; you go through there to the shop - I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You left the parlour window shut down? A. Yes; the catch was not fastened, but it was shut close down; I found the cupboard door open, and the shop shutter; they must have come in at the parlour window, and then into the shop, as the shutter opens inside.</p>

            . I am servant at the Three Cranes public-house, Queen-street, Cheapside. The prisoners came in together there about half-past nine o'clock in the morning of the 29th of January; I did not see them bring anything in, but William came to the bar, and said,"Landlord, have the goodness to take care of this bag for me" - he said he had come out of the country, and wanted me to take care of the bag till he came back, which would be in about an hour and a half; they left it there, and did not return till about half-past ten o'clock at night - they came together, called for a pint of beer, and sat some time in the bar - they then moved into the tap-room, and I heard them at high words, but what passed I do not know- I was sitting in the bar; George came up and said,"Landlord, don't deliver that bag up, for it is stolen property;" Reece, the patrol, was in the tap-room - I delivered it to him; he said as it was stolen property, he insisted upon taking them to the watch-house - he took the bag, and the prisoners followed him; they were both rather intoxicated, and were taken into custody at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a constable of the night, and received the prisoners in charge with the bag; I was not in the watch-house when they first came in: I asked their names - William said his name was John Wilson, that he came from Yorkshire, and had come that day from East Barnet, and brought the bag with him. I found the bag contained sheets and other things; I searched, and found on him 11s. in silver, and 2s. 5d. in copper; and on George I found 5s. 6d. in silver, a cigartube, a wafer-seal, a scent-bottle, a tobacco-stopper, and a knife; George said the other man was his brother, and that his name was Mitchell, but denied all knowledge of the bag.</p>

            . (Examining the property in the bag) This pair of sheets is mine - here are also two table-cloths, twenty-one books, two pillow-cases, a candlestick, and a tea-cannister, which are mine; the cigar-tube and other things found on George Mitchell are mine - I cannot swear to the knife; they were all in my house the night I was robbed: I found my account-books thrown into my cistern, and all my receipts for money paid were torn up, and thrown about; some fifth was left behind. The prisoner William was once in my service, and left about twelve months ago - he has two club-feet; the robbery appeared to me to have been done by a man who knew the way of the house - the servant gave me a pair of stockings found in the house; (looking at them) - they appear to belong to a very short foot, and that raised my suspicious; I found the prisoners in custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner WILLIAM MITCHELL. Q. Is there any difference in those stockings from common ones? A. They appear to have been worn by a man having a short thick foot; not that they have been made on purpose, but they have been worn with such a foot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GEORGE MITCHELL. Q. Do you claim every thing there? A. All but the knife and stockings; here are a pair of razors, which I have not examined yet - one is mine, but the other is not.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MITCHELL's Defence. I came from the country, where I had been hawking china; a friend wrote to say I had a brother laying dead; I came to town on Monday, and found he had been dead some time - I was to re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210048"></xptr>turn to my master in Yorkshire that day fortnight; I stopped with a friend in Clerkenwell all day, till near ten o'clock, and then went to get lodgings at a friend's in Tottenham-court-road - they were gone to bed; I at last got lodgings at a court in the New-road: I got up in the morning, and went to see my brother, and just by the new church I saw some things laying, which I picked up and put into my pocket - I then went further, and found this bag - I took it up and went to my brother, and after breakfast I was taking it to a friend, to know what to do with them - a shirt came out, and I saw it looked like stolen property. I went part of the way to Billingsgate with my brother, who was going to get some fish; and in Queen-street I said, "I won't take the bag all the way - I will leave it in this public-house till we come back;" he could not buy any fish that day, and we stopped and had some beer, and went to a public-house; we stopped there almost all day, till evening - I was very much in liquor: we called at this public-house for the parcel; he was more drunk than I was; I did not know what I did: we fell out about family affairs, and hinted about the bag being stolen; the officer, being in the house, took the bag up - we followed him; I had no objection, as I knew myself innocent.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MITCHELL's Defence. My brother gave me the things that were in my pocket - I did not know what they were for; I was rather in liquor: I said I would keep them in remembrance of him. We fell out at the public-house - he said I was a rogue; I said I did not know I was more one than him, and perhaps the things in the bag were stolen - I said it out of aggravation: the officer came to the bar, and said, "Do you say they are stolen?" I said, "They are likely enough to be - I can't say:" he said, "Then I shall take charge of the bag and the person it belongs to:" he took my brother, and said, I must go to the watch-house, but he should not want me to stop.</p>

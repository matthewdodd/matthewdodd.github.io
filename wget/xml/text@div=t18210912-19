She had worked for me at times. The shirts and handkerchiefs were in a box, up three pair of stairs; the other things were on the second floor. She was in the house five days. On Tuesday, as I suspected her, I looked in her basket, found a gentleman's shirt, and silk handkerchief. I called her down, and asked what she had been at; she said</p>
               <p>"Pray do not say anything about it." I told her to leave my house, and on the Sunday following I missed these things; I went to her lodgings, and gave her in charge. They belong to my lodgers, but I am accountable for them.</p>

I searched her room, and in the bed I found a night shirt, with the sleeves cut out, and a duplicate of a shirt and a book. I took it out of pawn at Cameron and Co's.</p>

She said she was embarrased, and asked me to assist in moving her furniture; I agreed, but in a few days, I thought it improper, and told her I declined it, but took an oath not to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120010"></xptr>divulge it. She said she would serve me out. I said I depended on my needle, and hoped she would not injure my character. I saw no more of her till she took me in custody.</p>

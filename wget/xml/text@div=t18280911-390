On the 8th of July, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I was at the door putting some goods into the cart, and when I returned I missed a piece of bacon - I saw it again in ten minutes under the prisoner's coat; I knew him before, but he was not in my employ; he had not left the shop; I took it from him; when I first asked him, he said he had not got it - I asked him again, he denied it; I opened his coat and took it from there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he not say anything about it? A. No; he said he wanted 1 oz. of tea, and he put down a shilling to pay for the tea - the bacon was not in his hand; his coat was buttoned, and his hand against it; he did not put the bacon on the counter and the money to pay for it - I did not put it under his coat again, and call my man to see where it was, and say,"Now you can swear you saw it under his coat;" my man came before the bacon was put down at all; I served him with the tea, and then charged him with the bacon - he did not say he had no notion of taking it without paying for it - but he said afterwards, he would do anything if I would forgive him, he did not offer to pay for it till I found it on him - he then said he did it for want.</p>

            , I am in the prosecutor's employ. I saw the prisoner come into the shop as I was putting some bacon into the cart; I went into the shop just after he was served with the tea - my master said, "What have you got under your coat?" he said, Nothing; my master said, "You must have something, let me see what;" I forced his coat open, and there was this piece of bacon; my master told us to fetch a constable - he said he would do anything if he would forgive him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the shop, and saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's parlour - I knew him, and said, "I am very sorry to see you here Lane;" he denied his name several times, but I knew him very well; I said to the prosecutor, "What is your intention;" he said, "I give you charge of him, take him to a Magistrate;" the prisoner then went on his knees and begged for mercy, and said, "You don't know my circumstances;" I found near 16l. on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a piece of bacon which I thought would suit my family; I took it up and put it under my arm; I then had some tea, and paid for it; the prosecutor said, "What have you got here?" I said, "A piece of bacon, which I intend to pay you for;" I put it on the counter and half a crown to pay for it - he then took it up, put it under my coat, and called the man, and said,"Now you can swear."</p>
               <p>MR. HENRY HAINES. I am an auctioneer and appraiser,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110179"></xptr>and live in Fore-street. I have known the prisoner more than twenty years - I have had several transactions with him to a considerable amount, and during that time he has always conducted himself in an honest and proper manner; he has seven children, and his wife is now pregnant.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN to MR. SOFTLEY. Q. Did you say to Mr. Haines that it would be a great injury if you did not convict this man? A. No; I said it would be a great injury if I did not appear against him; he wrote to me, wanting me to make a flaw in the indictment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say, that in consequence of some letter written by somebody? A. Yes, because they wanted me not to appear; Mr. Haines came to my place, and began a conversation on the subject of this prosecution - the letter came by post from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN to MR. HAINES. Q. Do you remember going to the prosecutor's? A. Yes, and he said to me, that it would be a great injury, if he did not succeed in convicting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure those were the words he used? A. Yes; I went to him and he said, it was his duty to prosecute, but in consequence of his family, I hoped he would be as lenient as he could; I was very cautious in my expression - this was about ten days ago.</p>

             - I took her to a public-house, and gave her 1d. worth of beer; the prisoner came in, and said I was spending all my money upon that Kit, and swore he would beat her; I said, "Don't beat her - I will give you 1d. worth of gin;" he said he would have 11/2d. worth, and I gave it him; I took out 1s. 6d. for the landlady's daughter to give me change, and he snatched it out of my hand; about an hour afterwards, as I stood in the yard of the house, he took my shawl off my arm; I ran out after him, but he got away, and I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give you 6d. back, and say,"You are the worse for the liquor, and you shan't have the rest till the afternoon?" A. He did give me 6d. back.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE SOLESBRIDGE. The prosecutrix was treating me about half-past seven o'clock; I saw the prisoner take 1s. 6d. out of her hand; she had a light shawl on - she followed him into the tap-room. I afterwards saw her without the shawl; he returned her 6d., and said he should keep the shilling till he thought proper to give it her - she was sober.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix is out of her mind; she was three months confined for cutting her throat - there is the mark round her neck now. I took the money because she was drunk, and said the shilling would do her more good in the afternoon. I went into the house afterwards; she came and said, "Where is my shawl?" I said I had not got it; the landlord and his daughter said, "We can clear Wheelhouse, for you was in the yard with four men."</p>

            . I am a brush-maker, and live in Sun-court, Grub-street. I met the prosecutrix in Worship-street, and asked what she did there; she said Mr. Wheelhouse was there, for he had a shawl of hers and a shilling, but said she, "I only want 3s. 6d., then I shall have nothing to do with it, for I was drunk;" I went, as a man would do for any poor unfortunate man, and found his son, who lives in Rose-alley - I got the 3s. 6d., and gave it to her - I understand she did not appear at the Justice-room that evening; she received the 3s. 6d. not to prosecute. I never saw the shawl - she was perfectly satisfied till Walton thought proper so fetch her to the office again; she is one of the most despicable characters that ever breathed. I was not acquainted with her.</p>

            . About one o'clock on Sunday I saw the prosecutrix, intoxicated, by the dust-hole in the public-house yard; I lodge there. The prisoner was in the passage; the prosecutrix asked me where she could pledge her shawl - I said I did not know. I and the prisoner went home; I went to my mother's to dinner, and left the prisoner at the corner of the street; he said he was going home to dine with his children.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN TURPIN. I know these witnesses; they are all bad men who frequent the house; what they have said, I declare, before God and man, is lies. I never wanted to pledge the shawl; I was as sober as I am now. Why should I pledge the shawl when I had 1s. 6d.?</p>

I took Wilson to the watch-house, and told the constable what had happened; he searched her, but found no watch upon her. I described the other prisoner, and Ashmore, Martin, and I went after her; we could not find her, but got intelligence of her name. While we were gone, she came with another woman to the watch-house, and Roberts the constable, from the description I had given of her, suspected her, and stopped them both. When I came back to the watch-house, I saw her and knew her. She had changed her hat and cloak with the other woman; but when she stood up, and I saw her face, I was positive to her. I never found my watch again. I am positive to the persons of the prisoners, I had seen them several times before in the street, and know them. I was an apprentice on Snow-hill, and often saw them.</p>

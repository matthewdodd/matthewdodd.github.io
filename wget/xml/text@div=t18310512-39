               <p>JOHN SHEPHERD. I am a Police-constable. On the 24th of April I fell in with the prisoners in the City-road, coming towards Finsbury-square; Baker had a bundle under his arm - they were above a mile from the prosecutor's; it was then about half-past two o'clock - I asked him what he had there; he said a blankets, and that his sister, who was servant to Mr. Newbury, at <placeName id="t18310512-39-crimeloc248">Islington</placeName>

               <p>Comerford. Q. Did I tell you his sister gave it him? A. Yes.</p>

This blanket belonged to there, but it is my own property- the two prisoners had been there about six weeks; they were there on the 24th of April, and dined there - I believe Baker to be a good young man, and led into this by others.</p>
               <p>Comerford's Defence. On the 23rd of April Baker was talking to a man in the out place - I saw him give the man 2s., and the man gave him this blanket, tied up in this handkerchief - he took it up stairs, and the next day he took it out, and asked me to go with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable of the Great Western Railway Company. On the 21st of Aug. I saw Watkins loading his cart, at a quarter before eight in the morning—he was covering something over in the cart—I went and asked him what he was concealing in the cart—he said, "Nothing"—I stepped up and looked in the cart, and found a bag containing a quantity of rope, which I have here; some of it is new and some old—I asked How he came by it—he said one of the porters gave it him—I asked him to point out the man—in a few minutes Wright came up—Watkins said, "That is the man that gave it me"—he afterwards said he had purchased the rope of Wright at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt., and paid him half-a-crown earnest—I asked Wright, and he said he thought they were his perquisites—Watkins knew that Wright was servant to the company—I weighed the rope, it was 70lbs.</p>

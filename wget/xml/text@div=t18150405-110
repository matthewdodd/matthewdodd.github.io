In consequence of suspicion, on the 14th of February, I marked three pounds in silver, and put it in the till. I went to the Police office, and desired an officer to come to my shop; about three o'clock Freeman came; I marked some more money, and gave it to Freeman, four three shilling tokens, which I marked under the head; I desired Freeman to come and lay it out while I was at tea, to see if my servant would account for it, and at the time I was at tea, Freeman sent a woman to make a purchase, and after tea I came in the shop, and said, Edward go to your tea; I then examined the till; the marked money was not to be found, there was one dollar deficient and a three shilling token. On Freeman searching the prisoner, he found the marked dollar and three shilling token.</p>

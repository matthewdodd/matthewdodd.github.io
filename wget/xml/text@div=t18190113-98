            . On the 3d of December I came to town, and went to the Black Horse, George-street, and saw the prisoner there, who had been a play-mate of mine, I asked him if I could leave my things at the bar till to-morrow? he said they never took things in, but I might leave them at his lodgings. He took me there, and gave my things in care of

The prisoner took it from me, said he would go and get change if I would stop there ten minutes - he did not return. I went to Rose, and found he had fetched my clothes away. Next morning, I found him at Westminster with part of them on his back.</p>

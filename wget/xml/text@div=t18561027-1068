On Sunday, 12th Oct., in consequence of the note being returned, I went to the address on the note, to No. 11, Acorn-street, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner was in bed—I stood outside for a minute or two, and the pri<lb></lb>soner came out—I asked him to walk to our house with me—he had no jacket or boots on—he went back and put them on, and came out with them—he came to our bar parlour—the note laid on the table in such a position that he could see it—I told him that the note that my sister had changed for him had come back from the bankers, and they believed it was forged—he said, "Is it? I was not aware of it; I suppose I must get you the money"—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "I don't think I am bound to tell you"—I told him he had better, or it would be a very bad job for us both, and cause a great deal of trouble—he said, "I will tell you then; I found two of them in a brass-bound <hi rend="italic">ports monnaie</hi>, in the Borough, and I gave the other to my landlord"—I said, "Did you?"—I then said I would go to the Bank in the morning, and if it was a forgery I would come down to his house—he said, "Very well"—I went to his home the next day, about half-past 2 o'clock—I had then been to the Bank, and found the note was forged—when I got to the house the door was shut—I did not see the prisoner—I saw the lodger—I believe the prisoner has a wife; I did not see her—I went to the Peckham police station, and gave information to sergeant Bond—on Thursday, 16th Oct, I went with ser<lb></lb>geant Bond to No. 9, York-terrace, Peckham, and found the prisoner there with two children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a laundryman, and live in Lark-row, Cam<lb></lb>bridge-heath, Bethnal-green. The prisoner came into my service about the 21st of March last—she did not sleep in the house—she lodged at No. 3, Globe-street—she was in my service before that, in February, 1835, for three or four months—on Friday, the 14th of May, I went with her to her room—I had missed a great number of articles at that time—a shirt was the last thing I missed belonging to a customer—that led to the discovery—it was a new shirt—when I got to her room showed me a great many duplicates—I then told her I did not see any thing which appeared to be my property among them, and asked her if she would allow me to fetch an officer to search her room—she said yes—on turning round I saw a towel at my elbow which I took hold of—I saw the name of James Anderson on it, who is a customer of mine—I then said I should fetch an officer and give her in charge—in going down stairs she followed me and said, "Master if you will let me have the money I will get the property again which I have taken."—I then asked her what she had taken, if she had take the</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 20th of May—I did not search her—she gave me four duplicates, after some conversation—I have three of them here—she said she had sold the shirt to a woman who was a mantua-maker, and kept a green-grocer's shop, which she described—I went and found Mrs. Prior, who gave me the shirt—I have a napkin, which I found on searching her room.</p>

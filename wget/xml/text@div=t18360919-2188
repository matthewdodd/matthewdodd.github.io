The prisoner's husband was in my employ—I went to her house and found this pair of soles there—she said, "They are not Mr. Emsley's—I have had them three years"—the officer had the shoes in his hand—the soles were mine—there was a private mark of mine on them—I recognised them—she then said, "They are Mr. Emsley's."</p>

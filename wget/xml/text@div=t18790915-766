                  </hi>. I keep the Queen's Head public-house, Acton Street, Gray's Inn Road—on Wednesday evening, 25th June, about 6.30, the two prisoners were in my house—Hill said to me in the presence of Jary, "Will you cash me this cheque?" at the same time handing me this cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be drawn by George Thomas on the Regent Street branch of the London and South-Western Bank, dated June 24, 1879, in favour of G. Hill or order, and endorsed by G. Hill—he had had a bottle of whisky about 3 or 4 o'clock that afternoon, and when I cashed the cheque I deducted the price of that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and handed him the change, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I hid known Hill before simply by lodging opposite, and Jary by coming into the house along with him—I have never seen Hill without Jary—they usually came in of a night, and sometimes the first thing in the morning, extending over about three weeks—I used to see them mostly daily—I hesitated about the cheque, and asked who this Mr. Thomas was, and Jary drew some papers out of his pocket and said, "We have been doing some business for this Mr. Thomas, who is supposed to be living in Regent Street; it is all right, governor; it is as safe as the Bank"—next morning I took the cheque to the Bank, and a clerk wrote on it, "Fraudulent cheque"—Hill took the money and endorsed the cheque in my presence; I asked him to do so.</p>

Will call in the course of to-morrow, or by 11 on Tuesday, to take it up and explain; in the meanwhile please not do anything with reference to it, and greatly oblige yours truly, R. M.

I am a clerk in the Regent Street branch of the London and South-Western Bank—these four cheques are on the forms that we issue to customers—they are all out of the same book, which was given put to a customer named Thomas Sidney Raven—his account stopped working on 16th March, 1867, with something less than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance, and has never been operated upon since—a cheque of his was paid on 16th March, and nothing occurred since—I don't know the amount of the cheque—we have no customers named George Henry Cole, James Melmoth, George Thomas, W.

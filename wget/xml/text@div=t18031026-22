               <p>Q. Are you sure you had never delivered them to her to be bound, or for any other purpose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>PHILIP GREEN sworn. - I am a constable; I had been to the prisoner's lodgings before Mr. Pedder, and found the property; Mrs. Pedder was with me. - (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PEDDER sworn. - I went with the constable to the prisoner's lodgings; I went up stairs, and found three bonnets and some caps, I cannot say how many, and a man's hat, laying upon the table, and two more in a ban-box; they had our shop marks upon them; I knew them to be my husband's property, I can swear to the marks; I cannot say when they were taken; we never sell hats in this state; I cannot swear that the men's hats had not been put out; there are six children's hats that never were put out; when I found them I sent for my husband.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of them? - A.About 2l.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are not worth so much, my Lord; they are my property; some of them I had not had in from the country above three weeks; the prisoner used to come two or three times a day to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you use to deposit them? - A. They used to lie open on the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that she had received the hats from the prosecutor's shopman, who was his brother-in-law; that she bought one of them; that he gave her the children's hats, telling her they were old shopkeepers; that she had the others to line and bind, as would appear from the book in which the shopman entered every thing, and which she had to produce.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pedder.) Where is your shopman now? - A. He is gone for a soldier; he enlisted into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260012"></xptr>first regiment of Surrey militia, and is now at camp near Ashford, in Kent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part with him for any dishonesty? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the children's hats old shopkeepers? - A. No, some of them had not been in three weeks.(The prisoner produced a book.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is an entry in the book of a child's white had lined.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pedder.) Then you see the prisoner had had one child's white hat to line? - A. It appears so from this entry; it is a book that she herself keeps, and upon the return of the goods they are entered in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these hats might have been delivered to her, and there would be no entry of them in the book, because they have not found their way back again? - A. They were not put out with my knowledge. <rs id="t18031026-22-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

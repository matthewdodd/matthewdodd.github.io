The prisoner is my son-in-law, and lives at home with us—I have seven children, and my husband has two by a former wife—I hive been married nine years—we have sent the prisoner to school, but I do not believe he knows his alphabet—I have got him into three schools myself, but he will not stop—he plays truant three weeks or a month at a time—on the 13th of October he went out of the shop, and I followed him into the parlour—he had his sister's pinafore in his hand—I took it from him, and shook it, and out fell two duplicates—an officer lodges with us—my husband went up to him and asked what he had bet<lb></lb>ter do, as he would be ruined if he was not stopped, and we gave him in charge—he is thirteen years old—there is not a cleverer boy than him any where—his inclination was always for, the sea, and we want to get him into the Marine Society—I did not know his mother.</p>

On the 16th of October I took him into custody, and received the duplicates from his mother—he is a very bad boy—I have taken him into my room, and talked to him, and told him the consequence of these things, and what he would be done to—his father has beat him and shut him up, and has used good means to him—he says he would do well if he went to sea—I never could find any money on him—he goes and buys sweetmeats, and pastry, and oysters.</p>

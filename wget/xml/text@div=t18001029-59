             sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Simpson and Houghton, in Holborn: On Monday the 29th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Dawes's shop, with a bag in his hand, and put two paintings into it; I met him in the middle of the street, with the bag and the paintings in it; I took him back to the shop, and delivered him, and the bag with the paintings, to Mrs. Dawes; these are the same paintings that he had in the bag.(The paintings were deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Is Mrs. Dawes here? - </p>

               <p>Prosecutor. No; she told me, in the hearing of the prisoner, that these were the paintings that Berryman had brought back with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was just come out of the workhouse, and could scarce get work enough to supply my need; it was necessity made me do it.</p>

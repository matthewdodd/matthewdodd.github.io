                  </hi>. I am master and part owner of the brig <hi rend="italic">Beeswing</hi>, she was lying in the London Docks tobacco-basin. We had some wine in the fore-cabin—on the 8th of November, I missed six bottles of red port, and on the 9th, I missed ten more, and three of white—the mate kept the keys of the place where the wine was—the prisoner, who is the apprentice, was left on board during the night—it was my orders that he should always sleep on board—when I missed this wine, I went to the mate's drawer, and found the key of the wine was broken—I found the lock had been taken off, and put on with small copper tacks—I went for<lb></lb>ward, and searched the prisoner's berth—I found a small bottle, with a portion of white wine, about a table-spoonfull, quite enough to say it was mine—I went further, to his locker, where no one went but him, and found some more wine in a tea-kettle—I asked the prisoner how it came there—he said it was given him—I then said there was some white wine in a bottle, in the small room—he said "No, it had gin in it"—I sent for an officer, and gave the prisoner into custody—I believe this to be part of my wine.</p>

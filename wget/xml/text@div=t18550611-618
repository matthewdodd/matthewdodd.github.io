                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and have a farm at Enfield of 198 acres. I reside at Laycock's-dairy, Islington. The prisoner was my farm bailiff—he had 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, house rent, firing, and vegetables—I grow a great many potatoes, and have been in the habit of selling them at Spitalfields and Covent Garden markets—he was not allowed to sell any for me in the</p>

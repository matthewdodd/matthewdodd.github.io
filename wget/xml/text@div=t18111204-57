On the 3d of this month, between seven and eight in the evening, the prisoner came into my house, she called for a pint of beer, she sat drinking it a considerable time, I was busy in the bar, a soldier who is quartered on me saw her go into the kitchen, when she came out he asked her what business she had there, she said that she had dropped an eighteen-penny piece, and the servant had given it her, she went and sat down in the tap-room, the soldier told me that she had got something, I asked the prisoner what she had got, she said nothing, I went and looked in the kitchen, I missed a large china disk, I found the dish in a child's frock, pinned under her petticoats. This is the dish, I put the dish on the tap-room table, I asked her whose it was, she said it was hers. I swear it is my own.</p>

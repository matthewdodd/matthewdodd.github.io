Sometimes boys get into the cupboard and sleep; I thought would take them up stairs and see if any body enquired after them. When I came from market, I mentioned them to the woman in the next room; nobody enquired after them till Mr. M'Donald came.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that woman here? - No, I said I would throw this stuff away, it was of no use to me, and I will try and clear the bottles: I said, perhaps, it was some painters stuff or other.</p>

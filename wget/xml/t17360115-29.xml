The Prisoner must take it, because she and I had been in Company together, not in the Street but in a Room up one pair of Stairs in a House in a Court: She made a Bargain that I should give her 6d. to be great with her, and after we had been about 10 Minutes together, she made an Excuse to go down Stairs. - There was one Bed in the Room, and two or three Chairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the Room?</p>
               <p>Headley. Yes, my Lord, I had a Friend with me, and he had a Woman at the other end of the Room; the Prisoner and I were by ourselves, and he and his Woman by themselves: 'Tis a middling sort of a Room; I believe we were as far assunder, as from hence to the Bottom of this Court. - Yes - I and the Prisoner had the Bed, my Lord, - the other Company was at the other end of the Room, and the very Minute she went down Stairs, I mist my Watch. I had it about 5 Minutes before she left me, for I had felt for it. When I found it was gone, I looked for it upon the Bed, but there was no Watch. I asked the People of the House after my Girl, and they told me they knew nothing of her. <rs id="t17360115-29-verdict172" type="verdictDescription">

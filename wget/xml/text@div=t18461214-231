                  </hi>. I am assistant to a printer in Cornhill. On the 29th of Nov. I was at Levy's elothes exchange—I had a watch with me—I saw the prisoner's hand move from my pocket—I instantly took hold of him, and a witness saw the watch in his hand—there were half a doeen people about that he might have passed it to.</p>

About twelve o'clock on the 29th of Nov., I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner with a watch in his hand—there was a bit of string or a guard of some sort attached to it—the prosecutor was close behind me—the prisoner ran past me, and I saw him show this watch to some lads—the prosecutor rushed past me and said, <hi rend="italic">"</hi> I am after my property"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "That is the person that has got my watch."</p>

I stood just by the gate, and saw the prisoner come along with a baker's barrow, a basket, and bread; he stopped at my basket, then went up to it, uncovered the flannel, and took two loaves out, which he put into his own basket - he could see me; he saw me advancing towards him, took them out, and put them back again. I asked him what business he had to take my bread? He said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Barham, I have got none of your bread." I said,</p>
               <p>"You returned it when you saw me coming." Another baker came up, said the prisoner was out of place, and he had employed him to take care of his barrow. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, if you say I took your bread I will give you a punch of the head;" which he immediately did, and knocked me down. I got up, and he put himself in an attitude of fighting - the other man got between us. I told him if he would give me his name, I would stand against him in another way; he knocked me down again. The baker told me where his master lived.</p>

            . I am waiter to these gentlemen. On the third of November the prisoner came into the bar. He ordered a rump-steak and sauce. I missed a spoon. On the 4th the prisoner came; he ordered a lunch; he had it; he came in again at four o'clock, and had liver and bacon. I handed him a spoon. After dinner the prisoner ordered half a pint of porter; I cleared the dishes away, and took it directly. I took the spoon away from the plate, and put it into the tub that we wash the plates, glasses, and spoons. The prisoner had the half pint of beer which he had not paid me for. I was called down stairs to bring up a steak. On my returning up, I met the prisoner on the stairs. I told him he had not paid for the porter. He took some halfpence out of his pocket, and paid me; he let some of the halfpence drop on the stairs; I took the steak up stairs; I looked in the tub, and missed the spoon. I followed the prisoner, and caught him in Bartholomew-lane. He asked me what I wanted with him. I told him I suspected he had got a spoon. He said he had not got any thing of the kind. was welcome to search him. I told him to come back to my master; he came back with me; he then took the spoon out of his pocket, and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the one that was lost on the third - A. Yes; this is the one that was taken on the fourth; know it to be my master's property.</p>

             and two others; Smith was the man that stopped me and struck me with a stick, not a very great stick, a short stick, they said nothing to me, they pushed me against the watch-box, one stood over me, and the other took my money, and two silk handkerchiefs, and a pair of shoes, I lost seven shillings in money, and the other things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Were they new shoes? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was not a dark night, nor it was not a very light night.</p>
               <p>Could you discern the features of the prisoner's face, so as to know him again? - Yes, I saw him again the Thursday after at Bow-street, I knew him there, and charged him with having robbed me.</p>

               <p>I stopped the prisoner at the top of Portland road, and took from him two silk handkerchiefs, about two minutes after twelve, on the 7th of June, I took from him two silk handkerchiefs, but no shoes; the handkerchiefs are here, and have been in my possession ever since, Churchill looked at the handkerchiefs and said, his was a cross barred handkerchiefs, but not like this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time of night was it, when you was robbed? - About half after eleven, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>What can you swear to me by, it was a very dark night? - I took particular notice of him when he first came up to me, and another thing, he stood by me on the left hand side, and they held a hat before my face, and I took notice of him the whole time.</p>

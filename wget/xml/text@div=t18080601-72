On the 24th of May, about one o'clock at noon, my back was toward the door; I saw my apprentice run by me out of the door; on looking out I saw him hold the prisoner with one hand, and take a hat from him with the other; I ran out and brought the prisoner into the shop, I sent for a constable and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>JAMES SPENCER. I am an apprentice to Mr. Pedder. On the day the prisoner stole the hat I was at work; I saw him pass the window with a hat in his hand, I saw the ticket on the crown, I thought it was one of ours; I ran after him, I catched him about three doors from the public house; I took the hat away from him; he said he picked it up, or found it, I do not know which. Mr. Pedder came and brought the man into the shop.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met with an acquaintance; we had been drinking a little, I got myself too far in liquor, more than I ought to have done; I passed by the prosecutor's door about twelve o'clock in the forenoon, I saw this hat, I thought I would purchase it; I saw the apprentice at work, the apprentice saw me; I took this hat, I put my foot on the door, I saw another acquaintance going by. I called to him, he did not see me; I being in liquor I went a yard with the hat in my hand, when I found somebody came behind me and give me a kick; I had a knock on the pole of my neck, I had a second and a third kick; I was knocked against a woman; I could have got away, but I stopped; I did not like to knock the woman down.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner was very forward in liquor I believe.</p>

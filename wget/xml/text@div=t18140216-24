On Thursday the 10th of February, about eight o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to go into the cellar; I saw a piece of butter in the tub in the cellar. The prisoner was Mr. Wood's porter. When I saw the butter I was going to breakfast, and as I hardly got out of the door the prisoner was brought back by the officer. I went down into the cellar; I found the butter had been cut. The officer that brought back the prisoner, produced the butter in the shop; it appeared to be cut from the same piece in the cellar, which I had before seen. There was about twelve ounces of butter, worth nine-pence.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SHEPHARD. I am an officer. In consequence of information that Mr. Wood's porter was robbing him, I watched for the prisoner. On Thursday I met the prisoner and let him pass me some way, and seeing him walk rather awkward I followed him and stopped him; I asked him what he had about him; he said, nothing but broken victuals which the cook had given him by the order of Mr. Wood. I searched him; in his breeches I found three quarters of a pound of butter. I took him back to Mr. Wood; he then said he had the butter given to him in the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been trusted with various sums of money, I never made any mistake with the money; and on last Saturday night Mr. Wood's cook gave me some soup, and when I turned it into a dish I saw a silver spoon; I took it back on Monday morning. I throw myself on your lordship's mercy, and beg Mr. Wood's pardon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Angel-lane, Stratford. On the 27th of Dec. I went to bed about seven o'clock—the prisoner slept in the same room——he had been in bed about half an hour—he afterwards got up, came to my bed, and took my breeches—I heard my silver rattle as he took it from my pocket—he took it and went to his own bed again—I was awake, and had not been asleep—after he got into his own bed I again heard the money rattle—he then got up in his bed, and looked towards me—I said, "You seem very restless"—! then awoke an other man who was asleep there, and said, "This man has been robbing me"—the prisoner said, "Do you say that?"—I said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "There is your money"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "In the bed"—I said, "You took it"—he went to his own bed and got it, and brought it me—it was four half-crowns, four shillings, and a bent sixpence—they were apart from the purse then, but I had had such in my purse—I mentioned the money before it was delivered to me.</p>

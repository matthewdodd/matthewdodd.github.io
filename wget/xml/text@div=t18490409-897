                  </hi>. I have one partner. We carry on the business of cheese-mongers at Chelsea—the prisoner was in my service about two months—I marked some sixpences, and gave them to two parties to spend in my shop, and I retained two of them—next morning I left the prisoner in my shop, about half-past eight o'clock—I think there was a little boy in the shop with him, but he had nothing to do with the receipt of money—I examined the tills little before nine that morning, the 6th—I missed one of the marked sixpences which I had not given out—in the middle of that day I gave four other marked sixpences to spend—I examined the till about two o'clock; there should have been four sixpences in it—I gave the prisoner into custody in the evening—he maintained that he was innocent.</p>

               <p>to the young man—on the same day I took two more sixpences, and bought a pound of butter with them—I paid the money down to the prisoner—I do not recollect whether he took it in his hand or not—I did not have any change.</p>

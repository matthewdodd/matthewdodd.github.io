                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, of 6, Britannia-terrace, in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell—it is my dwelling-house. About half-past five o'clock in the morning of the 10th Jan. I was alarmed by a noise down-stairs, as though some one was moving about—I heard per<lb></lb>stairs sons coming up-stairs—I opened the door, and saw two persons on the—I went to the back-room window and gave an alarm—I then saw three persons escape from the back-kitchen window—they went directly down the garden—the other two made their escape to the right to our neighbour's premises—when I got down I found two pairs of shoes at the bottom of the stairs—I went to the kitchen window, there was no sash in the frame, but to prevent any one getting in, the inner door had been secured—any one could get in and out of the window—the door was between that window and the staircase—that door was screwed up the night previous, and in the morning it was broken open—it had been forced from the outside—I had been the last up in the house, and saw that door perfectly secured—I missed two coats, a hat, table cover, waistcoat, and other things—they were my property, and had been in the two parlours the night before—the policeman came, and a hat, two coats, and some other things were found in the garden—I saw the prisoner afterwards in custody.</p>

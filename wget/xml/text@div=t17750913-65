What business he follows, I don't know. Upon the 30th of June, about nine in the morning, I went to the Cock alehouse for a pint of beer; a person informed me, that he knew of some coiners; and if I would call upon him at two or three in the afternoon, he would shew me the house they were at work at. I went accordingly about half after two; Files and Symmonds went with me; we went to this house; the street-door was open; we went up two pair of stairs; I peeped in at a little crack under the door, and saw a soldier sitting on the bed, with a jacket on; and then with an iron crow we burst the door open. The prisoner immediately jumped out of the window, and the soldier after him. I immediately jumped out after them, on to a lead at the one pair of stairs, and from thence into the street. The prisoner ran away, but I pursued him, and called stop thief. After he had ran about a quarter of a mile, he was stopped, and brought to me. The soldier was taken in a smith's shop he had broke into through the tiles. I searched Yardley, and found in his pocket eleven good shillings (producing them); I have had them ever since; they are what they call the paterns.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner two or three years. I went with Gregory and Files, upon the 30th of June, between three and four in the afternoon, to this house. We called to them to open the door; but they refused; so we broke it open. I saw the prisoner and Taylor jump out of the window, and Gregory go after them. I staid in the room: I saw a crucible on the fire with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130043"></xptr> some metal in it. I took it off with the tongs, and cooled it in water. I cannot say whether it was metal or drugs; but it was in a liquid state. I found some bad shillings on a table in the right-hand-side of the room; and we found a quantity of instruments and boxes in the room, (producing them). Before we broke the door open, I looked under, and saw the prisoner come from behind a rugg which hung before the fire; the prisoner was in his waistcoat, with his shirt sleeves tucked up; and Taylor was upon the bed, without his coat.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner and the evidence before Justice Sherwood, I believe the morning after they were taken. The things found in the house were produced before the justice. I think I can swear this Dutch stove and drawer were produced there. I cannot swear to the rest of the things, because I have not had them in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who produced them?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Files, Symmonds, and Gregory.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the instruments, and tell my lord and the jury for what use they are designed?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Here are what they call in the trade flasks. They fill them with sand; and whatever is meant to be cast, they make the impression of it with the patterns in the sand; and the metal is poured through the pipes at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain how the impression is made upon the sand, and how retained?</p>
               <p>Clarke. The sand is made damp, and becomes hard, and of a solid body; then they put what they call facing over it, which is a kind of finer sand, which closes the pores of the sand, and prevents it leaving any marks upon the metal.</p>
               <p>Q. How do they make the impression of the shilling in the sand after it is faced?</p>
               <p>Clarke. They put a shilling in, and force it down; when they take it away, it leaves the impression; it is pressed down with screws; the moulds are put together, and the metal is poured in at the iron pipes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they make more than one at a time?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; a hundred, if the moulds are big enough. This mould, if full, would make thirty-six.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner. Whether these things are not fit for any founders business, or any thing of that kind?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; they are not fit for a founder's business; they may be used to cast small gold and silver things, as buttons, stay-hooks, earrings, and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. To Symmonds. Where did you find the counterfeit shillings?</p>
               <p>Symmonds. On the table in the prisoner's room. There were two tables in the room. They were on the table on the right-hand-side.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner half a year and better; he lived in Castle-street, Whitechapel, I was apprehended on the 30th of June, I was in the prisoner's room up two pair of stairs; the prisoner took the room by the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the prisoner did in that room?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He cast this counterfeit money, (that is produced in court) in that room with these tools.</p>

               <p>Q. What was to have been done with them next, in case you had not been interrupted?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what metal they are made of?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Silver and copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Will the putting them in this liquid make them white, fit to put off?</p>

               <p>Taylor. Half silver and half copper.</p>

               <p>Q. to Clarke. Have you ever seen that experiment tried?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes, I have tried it, by taking one of these counterfeit shillings, or any metal that is part silver, put it in the fire and make it a dark red, and then put it in aqua fortis and water it forces the silver it on the outside; one might do 500 in an hour, put a quantity on a red hot iron and when they begin to be red, put them into the vitriol and water, or aqua fortis, and in less then half a minute it has that effect. I suppose if there is an ounce of copper and but three quarters of an ounce of silver it will do it, but it will not wear so long before it becomes brassy, as when there is half and half.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with this money?</p>

               <p>I was going along Whitechapel road, I heard a noise; I went down a passage, I saw the gentleman; he cried out, stop thief, I ran away from him, because I had given a note for four pounds, and was afraid of being arrested. I have not brought any witnesses; I did not think I should have any need of them.</p>

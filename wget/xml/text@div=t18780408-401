                  </hi>. I am manager and shareholder in the works of the Mambré Saccharine Company—I produce the certificate of registration—we are manufacturers of malt saccharine—we have a wharf in the Fulham Road, on the River Thames—we have been in the habit for some time past of buying coals from the prisoner Johnson—with reference to the purchase of those coals I have had interviews with Burton—the coals bought from Johnson were delivered at our wharf in his barges—we were to be supplied by him with coal from the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company—before a barge load of coals was delivered to us we should receive an advice note from Johnson stating the quantity—latterly I desired that the numbers of the trucks should be stated on the back of the advice note, and the width of each truck—that would be towards the end of December—Harrison was in our employment—it was part of his duty on the wharf to count the number of skips that were taken from the barges—sometimes three, and sometimes two skips are unloaded at a time—each skip weighs 7 1/2 cwt.—it would be Harrison's duty to give in to me the number of skips delivered—he would have no means of knowing from me the quantity that a barge would contain—he always reported to me the number of skips from the barge—I compared the number of skips with the quantity of coal in the advice note—I found that the number of skips he returned corresponded with the quantity of coal advised by Johnson—I always found they agreed with the quantity advised by Johnson—I sometimes found them over weight—I never found that Harrison's weights were less than Johnson's—early in January when I was making up my books I found that the coal account was rather heavy, that the coal was going very fast—in consequence of that</p>

               <p>I employed Ryan to check Harrison's quantities—on 5th Jan. I received an advice note from Johnson—they generally came by post—I don't know in whose handwriting they were—I took them to be Burton's—this (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>) seems to me like Burton's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated Jan</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, 1378, <hi rend="italic">from Johnson, and advised</hi> 54 <hi rend="italic">tons</hi> 7 <hi rend="italic">cwt. of Welsh coal ex barge Henry</hi>.) On the back of the invoice the numbers of the trucks are given—Harrison as usual counted the number of skips by the Henry, and re<lb></lb>turned them as 145 1/2—he made the return verbally—that would amount to 54 tons 7 cwt.—the last three skips were actually weighed, they averaged about 7 3/4 cwt.—Harrison weighed them—as a rule I was not present—I had instructed Ryan to watch the numbers of the skips in the barge; he made a return to me—in consequence of that return I in<lb></lb>structed him to watch the next barge—I received this invoice (<hi rend="italic">B</hi>) with reference to the 54 tons.

On 10th of January I received this invoice (<hi rend="italic">C</hi>) referring to the barge Joe—the quantity of coals mentioned in the ad<lb></lb>vice note was 53 tons 10 cwt.—the last three skips were weighed by Harri<lb></lb>son—the numbers of the trucks were on the back of the advice note—Ryan made a return with reference to that barge—a little before 12th of January I received this advice note with reference to a barge called the Jack—I weighed the barge on the 12th—the quantity of coal appearing on the advice note is 61 tons 6 cwt.—the numbers of the trucks appear on the back of the advice note—one is No. 1742 represented as containing 10 tons 1 cwt.—I had the contents of the Jack weighed; Ryan weighed them—I was there a part of the time, not the whole—Harrison was present—I afterwards went to the Chelsea station of the North-Western Railway, and endeavoured to trace the truck 1742, but was not able to—I then went to Johnson's office, and there saw a clerk—he read some<lb></lb>thing to me from a book—I was not able to trace the truck there—I saw Burton with reference to these purchases of coal—I imagined that the invoices were not written by a clerk, from the handwriting, and I asked Burton if he did not employ a clerk to write them, because they seemed to be written in such a loose slovenly manner—he said they were all written either by himself or Mr. Johnson at Johnson's house, as they did not wish the clerk to know the price they were selling at—the con<lb></lb>versation related both to the advice notes and the invoices—I had agreed to pay 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this coal delivered at the wharf—that was the price charged in all the invoices—on 15th January Burton called at my office and wanted me to give him the number of the last truck on the advice note, referring to the Jack—he said he had been sent from Johnson, for he had heard from a customer that he had received too much coal, and if some one had received too much, some one else must have received too little—I did not give him the number—it was about 5 o'clock in the evening that he called—I had spoken to Harrison that morning—he said there were rumours in the factory that the coal was wrong, and that his name was mentioned in connection with it, and he asked me for an explanation—I told him I did not desire to have anything to say to him then, that an opportunity would be given him to clear himself if he had nothing to do with it—he seemed satisfied with that and went away—this was after I had been to the railway station and to Johnson's office about the number of the truck—about 10th January I received this advice note referring to the barge Hetty, advising 56 tons—the numbers of the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I did not know Johnson—I had never seen him previous to this inquiry—I went to the coal depôt but not to his office—I did not communicate with him about this business—I employ a man named Tisdale—I did not inquire of him about this matter—I do not remember asking Harrison to speak to Tisdale about it—I was not aware that Tisdale was going to see Harrison about these coals and their weights—I did not know that Tisdale was lodging at the same place as Harrison—Tisdale made a communication to me—he is a painter, and is now employed by me on the same terms as he was before this inquiry—I did not tell Ryan why I wanted the countings—he is a weight clerk—I did not know of Harrison receiving plug-money from Johnson or others till after this inquiry—I do not remember seeing Harrison plugging a barge on Sunday morning, or saying that he ought to be paid—I would not say it did not occur—our men sometimes plug barges, but it is done in our own time—this is Welsh coal—I dealt with other merchants besides Johnson for eighteen months or two years—I never heard of any complaints as to the weights before this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR HARRIS</hi>. Harrison has been in our service about three years—he came as a hammer-man, and was promoted to drive an engine as soon as we got a crane in the summer of 1875—the engine works the crane—he would also have to count the skips and report how many were made, and the entries were made in a book—he would also have to unload thousands of bags of sago—the clerk who weighed it would make the entries of the sago—coals were sometimes unloaded in the evening—there was sometimes a break in the unloading—the barge Jack was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080004"></xptr>
               <p>begun on the 12th and finished on the 14th—I do not remember Harrison coming to borrow my water-boots, to plug a barge, before Christmas, 1876—I would not say I did not lend them to him, but I do not remember it—I do not remember his saying he got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and my saying it was plenty—there were two skips when Harrison unloaded the barge—there are sometimes three—two are of the same size, the third is a little larger—I have not measured the skips—oh, yes I have, but I cannot re<lb></lb>member their dimensions—the third skip holds half a cwt. more than the others—a bushel of large coal would weigh heavier than a bushel of small—the difference in the weight of a skip of small and a skip of large would be nearly 1/2 cwt.—a skip averages 7 1/2 or 8 cwt., if piled up to the top, but it never holds 10 cwt.—I never knew it to hold 9—I never weighed it—Ryan can tell you more about the weight—we have two sets of scales, one of iron and the other partly of wood—7 or 8 lb. of lead was not put to make the scales balance—there is a receptacle for adjusting the scales—Pierce was timekeeper as well as weight clerk occasionally, but taking weights was not his duty, but Ryan's—I do not remember complaining to Harrison about a year ago with regard to his being short—I know Ellmore and Scott's barges, but do not remember their being short by 9 tons and Harrison speaking about it, or saying "I will do the best I can"—I asked Harrison how many tons there would be in the Jack, when he said about 60—I do not remember his saying he could tell by her length and width—after Burton called on me on 15th January. I sent for Harrison and said "Now, Harrison, you have got a wife and children, and I do not see why they should suffer. I have sent for you to give you an opportunity of confessing"—I do not remember using the word "repent" or "foolishness"—he said he had nothing to be afraid of—I said "I took you to be an honest man;" I do not remem<lb></lb>ber his replying"I am one yet"—I do not believe he did say it—he had no more to say and went away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRINDLEY</hi>. Burton called on me as Johnson's agent for orders—the quantities would only be known of a barge of coals when the notes were supplied—I was not aware of Burton being agent for anybody else but Johnson—I am giving my evidence from memory—I understood Burton to ask for the number of a particular truck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Some of the small coals were brought in carts, and some in barges—Harrison raised the skips by a steam crane—he counted them as they came up, and put them down on a slate provided for the purpose—I have seen him mark them—I obtained the weights of the skips from Harrison himself, and I find they average about 7 1/2 cwt.—I have assumed they were full—the sago was weighed after it had been unloaded, and in the top story of the building—I had been advised from Johnson's office the day before Burton called what the Nos. of the trucks were—Harri<lb></lb>son has been employed by the company about three years—he was a hard<lb></lb>working industrous man—my object in sending for him was to give him an opportunity of confessing if he had done anything wrong.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weigher to the Mambré Saccharine Company—on 5th and 7th January last, in consequence of instructions from Mr. Francis, I checked the unloading of the barge Henry—I counted the number of skips that were taken out of that barge; it was 133 1/2—I am quite sure as to that—on 10th January my attention was called to the barge Joe, and I counted the number of skips that came out of that; it was 131—I did not count the skips in any other barge—I had to weigh the next—the paper I am looking at contains the number of skips—I merely made it as a memorandum for myself about a month ago—I have the original paper that I made at the time (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I was desired by Mr. Francis to weight the barge Jack—I found it contained 49 tons 12 cwt.—I also, under Mr. Francis's instructions, weighed the barge Hetty; that weighed 47 tons 8 cwt.—I got the weights in this way: the skips were filled in the barge, they were then taken up by a steam crane out of the barge and lowered on to iron scales, and I then ascer<lb></lb>tained the weight from the scales, the gross weight of the skips; and at the end, when I had finished all the skips, I deducted the tare of the skips, which I had previously ascertained, and that gave the net weight—I made an entry of the weight of each skip as it came out of the barge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I counted the skips of two barges; one barge, the Henry, occupied two days, the 5th and the 7th, and the other, the Joe, one day, the 18th; the Jack and the Hetty I weighed—I have weighed others since this inquiry—Mr. Francis directed me to tally these barges and to weigh them to check Harrison—he did not tell me that was the object; he told me to do it—I knew afterwards that it was to check Harrison, not at first—Harrison was numbering the skips and taking the coals out of the barges—I believe he put the weights on a slate, the number of skips—the barges were drawn up at the side of the wharf—I stood in the laboratory while I was doing this; that is a room—I was concealed from Harrison—Mr. Francis told me to go into the labo<lb></lb>ratory and tally the skips as they came out of the barge—he told me to conceal myself from Harrison—I don't believe Harrison could see me—the laboratory is just at the top of the building—I could see down on the wharf from the window—the laboratory is about four stories up—I com<lb></lb>menced to tally out the Henry about 10 minutes to 1 in the day and was at work till 4 that evening—I started again on Monday morning to finish the Henry—Harrison was working on the wharf at the same time—the house is on the wharf—I was about as far from the barge as across part of this Court—no one was with me—the skips are let down by a steam crane into a truck and then into a stokehole—I marked the skips as they were turned into the truck—I gave these papers to Mr. Francis after I had made them—no one was with me when I weighed the barges—Harri<lb></lb>son was on the engine of the crane.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. I had nothing to do but to take a note of the skips as I saw them—I had not to work any crane or engine—Harrison had to work the engine, and had to make a mark on the slate when he stopped the engine—I had pen and ink, and desk and paper—I had no book, this is the paper on which I put the weights—I peeped out of; he window—I had to keep my eye upon the thing the whole time—the skips are all put down here in two's because the truck they were turned into held two—I counted the skips and put them down at once—it occupied my attention all day—I left off counting on Saturday at 4,</p>

               <p>they had finished then—I began again on Monday morning about 7.30 and went on until 6 p.m.—I actually weighed the coal out of the barge—Harrison did not do that—I was directed to weigh them—one skip was not full—some might come up with 6 cwt. of coal in it and some with 8 cwt., none 10 or 9 cwt., the average is about 7 1/2 cwt.—the skip and coal together might weigh 12 cwt. 2 qrs. 2 lb.—a skip's weight is 3 cwt. and some pounds.,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The largest skip would hold about 8 1/2 cwt.—I should think that would be the maximum, they might hold more—in weighing the Jack and the Hetty I weighed the contents of those two barges in skips—I took down the quantity in each skip, that is what I entered on this paper—the largest quantity was 12cwt. 3qrs. 24lb., taking the skip and coal together—I could perfectly see the crane from the laboratory—there was no difficulty in seeing the skips as they came up—Harrison had nothing to do with the filling of the skips in the barge or tipping them into the trucks—he would have the opportunity of taking the number of each skip—he would stop the engine every time the skip came up and then make the mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector to the Watermen's Company—these entries in this book are the prisoner Johnson's—the barge Jack carries 50 tons—there are many barges of this same name—this is the declaration of ownership of the Jack signed by Johnson, declaring it to carry 50 tons—the Grace is registered to carry 45 tons, the Elm 49 tons, the Henry 50, the Doe 49, and the Hetty 50.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. Barges are registered below their actual tonnage, sometimes five, six, or even seven tons below—a Conservancy bye-law requires that a barge of over fifty tons should have two hands—it is a mooted question whether one is enough or not—I should not like to say that the tonnage is sometimes understated.</p>

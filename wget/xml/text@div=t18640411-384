I assist at this bazaar—I saw the prisoner come in on the first occasion—he was served by Groom—about a fortnight after that he came in again—I knew him again, and went up purposely to serve him—he asked me for four shillings' worth of postage stamps—I said to Miss Groom, "This is the man who passed the two-shilling piece before"—he gave me a two-shilling piece and four sixpences—I took the money and held the stamps in my hand—I then asked him if he had not been there a fortnight before for three shillings' worth of stamps—he put his hand up to his ear, and said, "What?"—I then repeated the question louder, and he said, "No"—I passed the florin to Miss Luke, who was at the desk, and said, "Try that; I think it is a bad one"—the prisoner stood there, but did not make any observation—Miss Luke left her desk to go to a detector to try the money—the prisoner could see her, and he went quickly out of the shop, leaving the four sixpences and the stamps with me—I went to the door, but could see nothing of him.</p>

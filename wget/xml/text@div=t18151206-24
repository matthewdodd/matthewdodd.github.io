I went out between seven and eight on the night of Saturday, the 14th of October; I left my dwelling house without anybody in it, it was then dark. I fastened the yard door with two bolts, and double locked the front door, and put the key in my pocket; all the windows were fastened; the back windows were nailed down; the wall of my back yard was down, so that any body could get into the yard. I returned home at about a quarter before twelve, and went to put the key to the key hole to open the door, and found it was open, it went from me; I found the back door wide open. I immediately ran up stairs, and found drawers open, and on putting my hand I found they were empty. I suppose the value of all the property we lost was at least thirty pounds; besides the notes; there were eight one pound notes, and two two pound notes, besides a one pound note which I did not know of, and which my wife had in one of her gloves. We then got a light, and I proceeded down stairs; on the wooden cover of a water jarr I found some matches, and a pipe with some tobacco in it. On the following morning in the yard I found this piece of candle broken.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I went out with him between seven and eight o'clock on the night of the 14th of October; it was dark; we were obliged to light candles before we went out of the house. I returned with my husband at about a quarter before twelve; all the property was gone. I had seen that the drawers were full in the morning. I had a one pound note which my husband know nothing of, in a pair of gloves, in one of the drawers where my clothes were; I had taken it from a Dutch Jew, a young man who had sold me a Dutch tablecloth; I had had it three or four weeks; he wrote the persons name from whom he had received it in Dutch or Hebrew; I could not read the writing he put upon it; but I have seen a similar note since, and to all appearence it is the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger. On Sunday morning, the 16th of December, about ten o'clock, I was applied to by Mrs. Tilley, to lock up her husband's warehouse, as he was in the hospital at the time—the warehouse is about a hundred and fifty yards from Tilley's house—it is a sort of broker's warehouse—there was a copper on the first-floor then—next morning (Monday) I went and found the street-door a-jar, the lock broken off, and put behind the door, and the copper gone—I went in per<lb></lb>suit of the prisoner in consequence of suspicions, and found him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner,</hi> I want to know what purpose the warehouse was taken for—it is my house—I rented it at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I have the key of it in my hand—I have witnesses to prove he gave me possession of it. <hi rend="italic">Witness. I</hi> believe the prisoner was in Tilley's employment—he did not live in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop in Middlesex-street, Aldgate, and have a workshop in Garden-court, Petticoat-lane. The prisoner was in my employ—I employed him to take a few things into the house about the 11th of December—I am the tenant of the premises—I pay the rent, and hold it of the prisoner—he had possession of it at first, but gave up posses<lb></lb>sion to me to put my goods in, so that, of course, when the rent became due I should have paid it—the copper is mine—I had paid for it—I had put it in to be fixed—I never gave the prisoner leave to take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Webb-square on the 16th of December, about eleven o'clock at night, and met the prisoner with the copper on his shoulder—I asked where he was taking it to—he said to No. 9, Webb-square, to his own dwelling-house, and he had brought it from Ratcliff-highway, from Mr. Tatham's, the brazier—I said I did not think he had brought it from there—he said, "Well, you can very easily overlook it, it belongs to a relation—it belongs to the Excise"—I said I suspected it was stolen, and should take him to the station-house—he then said it had been repaired at Tatham's, and he had paid for the repairs—I went to Tatham's, and made inquiry, then returned, and charged him on suspicion of stealing it.</p>

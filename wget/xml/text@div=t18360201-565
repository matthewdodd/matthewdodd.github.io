                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live in West Cottages, Cambridge-health-road. I bought a looking-glass, which I placed where I purchased it—I saw it safe about ten minutes after one o'clock, on the 29th of January—I missed it afterwards—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) this is it—I Knew it to be the glass when I was at worship-street; but it is so mutilated and broken all to pieces since—the policeman had an accident with it—I Have every reason to think it is the same—that I saw at Wroship-street was the same.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who did you buy this furniture of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Wilson, a spirit-merchant—he was confined in the Fleet-prison at the time I bought it—the prisoner was one of the men I employed in removing the things—Mrs. Wilson was in the house when I got there—there was a padlock and chain on the front gate of the house—I did not break that with a crow-bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did you not tell the prisoner to take the glass to his lodging and keep it till he should see you, as you wanted to dispose of it privately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath, no such passed—I conceive Mr. Will.</p>

               <p>son had a right to dispose of the furniture, his rent was all paid—I do not think the Sheriff had been in—if he had, he would have prevented my taking the things away and purchasing them—I have never paid for the glass—there was no receipt given, or any instrument drawn up—only a verbal agreement—this was not purchased by auction—the things were not all packed up ready to be take away when I got there—my men took them down, and the glass too—I do not think there was any article, packed up.—I had made the agreement with Wilson some days before, because I had been receiving some furniture perparatory to this—there was no person present at the agreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You employed this man to take the property, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as to the removal of the goods—at noon-day—help me to put them into a van—I know nothing more than than seeing the glass on the lawn—I did not see the prisoner take it away—I did not make the bargain at the Fleet, but at the house, prepartory to my seeing him there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever been in any other part of this Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is not relevant to this question—I have been at Clerkenwell—I indicted a man named Hall, who robbed me of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I was never in<lb></lb>dicted for having sworn falsely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not ten witnesses swear on that occasion, that they would not believe you on your oath, and the man was acquitted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I dare say they could have produced fifty, they were such a set of man—persons came forward to say, and he was acquitted certainly—I was never in Chelmsford gaol, nor any prison in Essex—the prisoner was not em<lb></lb>ployed to take the glass home; but only to get the things into the van.</p>

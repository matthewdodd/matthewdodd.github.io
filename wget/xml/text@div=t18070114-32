               <p>Q. Did you live at Brent Bridge in the month of September. - A. I have lived there twenty eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at home on the 18th of September were you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it. - A. I do not know that, I cannot tell, I swore to it at the time, I am so destroyed since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen in your house. - A. I will give you the shortest and best account I can. I think it was in September, and I think on the 19th I do not swear now what I did in the indictment. At one o'clock in the morning I heard the window shake, something gave a motion, they called it night in Bow street; however it was one o'clock, I jumped out of bed, I went to the window, I saw a ladder against it, and that Prendergast with a lighted torch in his hand, in secret, with something like a bladder over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he upon the ladder or what situation was he in. - A. He was upon the ladder, he was ascending the ladder, about half way up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known his person before. - A. His daughter was my housekeeper, and he had every day a pint of beer and some cold victuals at my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140039"></xptr> house; I looked out at him and I saw him, I had got my sword drawn just by, at my right hand, I always kept it there at night time; I looked at him and knew him as perfect as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it as to light. - A. Why the night was just in the common way as the weather might be; it was not frost, but it was light enough; but what I saw him by was the light that he held in one hand, in something like a bladder, and the torch burning in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the light of the torch that enabled you to see him distinctly and to know him. - A. Yes. He came up to the window and attempted to push it up, but I held the window down with my left hand; and now upon my oath, as I shall soon appear before God, I was as cool as I am now, and more than I am now. I said within myself I will not shed blood, I shall soon die, my hands are pure, and I will keep them so; I could as easily have done it as I could have put out my hand. He came up to the window and attempted to push it open; I held it down, he began smashing the squares of glass with his hands, still I kept it down and could have done what I liked with him, but I looked into the court opposite, I saw an amazing quantity of men, there were not less than nine or ten; at last he ascended up close to the window with his feet, others ascending behind him up the ladder and held him; he began to smash the frames with his feet. He smashed in the lower frame of the window with his feet, and down he came, his feet hit my leg and knocked me down upon my back; down he came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. He came in and threw you down upon your back. - A. Yes, he hit my leg, but I do not believe it was by design, but he bruised my leg, he bruised my flesh, sinews, and bone, that I could have no case since, my torture is exceeding great. - [The prosecutor was a gentleman very far advanced in years, and appearing to be in a fainting and languid state, the court ordered him some brandy and water and a chair to sit on.]</p>
               <p>Q. When he got into the room as you have described, and you fell down, what happened next. - A. I hardly can tell; but this he said to me, lie down quietly in bed and be quiet, we will not hurt you, but we must have the treasure for travelling expences; I laid down in bed, and two men with black faces, and another with a bladder over his face, with eyes and mouth cut in it, came in before them; they came in at the window and up the ladder, the same as the other man, into the room. Prendergast came to me and took hold of my two hands, and said I must go down stairs and shew where the treasure was, and must have a light, I called to his daughter in the garret, who is my housekeeper, and desired her to come down, and I entreated and desired these men to be kind. I called to his daughter to come down and bring a light, she did, and she struck a light; the house were all alarmed. Then I saw his face and the other three in my bed room besides; there were four of them.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no disguise to Prendergast's face. - A. No, none at all, no more that it is now, it was quite visible, they were all around me then; I had a friend, a Mrs. Lewis, that was in the back room next the road, and the waggons and carts began to come; she threw up the back window and screamed out Murder and Thieves, they went into the room to her, they said, you blasted b - h, if you do not hold your tongue we will blow your brains out; she then ceased making any further noise, He took me with his two hands, he led me down stairs to him where the treasure was and to unlock the outer door of the house into the court; I unlocked it, I believe, and I do not know how many men rushed in; I pointed to the bureau, and told them that the money and plate was there; then I went up stairs to bed. The bureau was locked; they had got a dung fork and broke it open.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not part with the keys to them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them break it open. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see it broke open. A. Not till the next morning at day light, about eight o'clock, I could not get up before. I then saw it was broken open, and there were three pocket books gone; in one was six guineas in gold, and a note for sixty pounds, I had been looking at it the day before; a note for fifty pounds, and another for twenty-six pounds. There was missing from the bureau, a silver coffee pot, and twelve silver tea spoons, and different spoons for casters, and a watch, and I do not know how many other silver spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of any of the other people besides Prendergast. - A. I cannot swear that I do; one of the men had a black face; his features were very much like one of Prendergast's sons, but I do not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the coffee pot the lid. - A. Yes, the lid was to it, it was complete.</p>
               <p>Q. What other persons were in the house as part of the family, you have mentioned Mrs. Lewis. - A. There was a Mrs. Akenhead, she belonged to Mr. Sharp the engraver, many of you might have heard of him, she was in his employment and for her health, she happened to be down there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of them any fire arms. - A. I cannot tell, they said they would blow Mrs. Lewis's brains out, but I did not see any.</p>

He happened to come into my house one evening between ten and eleven o'clock, it is pretty nearly two months ago, my husband was up in his chair, sitting by the fire, I was in bed; he said he was going on board a ship, and that he would throw his life in his hands if Mr. Purcell would be so good as to assist him, he would tell him where the property lay, and he would shew him where it was. He said that he had none of the property, and there were seven of them that went to a farmer's house in the country, and that the property lay near the Edgware road, and he mentioned that there were some of it in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention how far the farmer's house was from London. - A. He did not. I got up and said he had no business in the house, and Mr. Purcell bid him give him down the names of the people that did the robbery; he said if the property was brought away it could be sold, he was going on board a ship, he could not stop in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any description of the farmer, did he say he was young or old. - Q. He said he was an old man. There was another man, I believe, he came with him, I saw him while the conversation was going on, his name is Sullivan.

            . - A. Yes, going up to the garret stairs, I heard a voice say lye still and be asey, we will not hurt you my good master. I said to Kitty what shall we do, she said come up here; I went immediately up to the garret, a dark garret adjoining to her's, we continued there about five minutes, then we went into her own room where she slept. I wished to get out of the garret window to secret myself in the gutter but she would not let me.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean she persuaded you not. - A. She persuaded me not, she said I should catch my death by going there; she directly asked me if I had brought up my watch with me, I told her no; she asked me to let her go down and fetch it, I told her she should not, I was afraid she might be seen. She knew that I set a great value upon my watch and therefore she asked me to let her go down, I refused, and she did not go. After a little while, her master, Mr. Bell, called her to come down and get a light, he called several times, and she cried very much and told me that she was afraid to go down, she was afraid she should get murdered; I told her she had better put on some of her things if she went down, which she did, and some man cried out is the light coming; on that she went down and took a light. When she was gone down I heard her speaking to Mr. Bell, and just at the same time I heard the men go into my room (either one or two); I heard one say here is a bed, here must be somebody, where are they. I heard Kitty come up stairs into the first floor, I heard Mr. Bell call out Kitty where is my key. When she was down stairs I thought it was the key that she had in her pocket that he wanted; as she always used to lock up the spoons and the mugs before she went to bed. It was not that key, she did not give him any key at all; then I heard a shriek of murder both from Mrs. Lewis and from Kitty. I could not tell where Kitty was at the time; I heard a man come running a part of the way up stairs, but what he said I do not know, it was apparently after her. I was so much alarmed I could not stand any longer, I flung myself on her bed, and some man that was out in the garden said, come we must be off.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of your watch. - A. I left it in my bed underneath my pillow when I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When you come down stairs again after the men were gone did you see whether it was there or no. - A. After the men were gone I went into Mr. Bell's room, they called me down and said I might come down now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it when you went into your own room. - A. No, nor a pocket handkerchief, that was not there. Mrs. Harrison and her husband were in the house before I came down, and a carter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the state of the bureau. - A. The drawers were all out, and the papers were throwed about the parlour. Mrs. Harrison examined them very much, I did not because I had no clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Franklin that lived in the neighbourhood. - A. I have heard of him; Mr. Bell has pointed out the place to me, it is called Oxgate farm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was any connection between Mr. Franklin and the prisoner at the bar. - A. Prendergast used to work there, and while, I was at Mr. Bell's, he employed him two or three days.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt now. - A. No; as I told your lordship, I could have run him through as easy as hit my finger, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did his daughter live with you after the robbery. - A. Till they fetched her away. I saw the danger, I put her in the room behind mine, facing the Edgware Road; there I put her and there she was. I thought I might have passed it off, and that they would have brought the things back.</p>

               <p>Q. Have any of the things been brought back. - A. Yes, I have had above twenty ounces of plate sent back, and a suit of mourning, and I do not know how many things, and I thought I might have passed it off, but the impression it has made, has never left my mind to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps the daughter continued to live with you till the father was taken up. - A. Till after, there she is, I told her if she would take care of me I would make her happy, but so perverse was she in all her ways.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Franklin. - A. I do, he lives at Oxgate, near to my house. I had the farm once myself that he lives in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do know what servants were in his employ. - A. Yes, I knew the eldest son of Prendergast was, and I believe him to be a good young man, and Prendergast was employed by Mr. Franklin and sometimes by me.</p>

            . (to prosecutor) Did not you mention whoever went into the window, he broke the sash, and his hand was cut, and there was a great deal of blood in the house the morning following. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw me the next day and I shewed you my hands. - A. You did not come near me on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. I was at work the next day, and Mr. Franklin he saw my hand that it was not cut. - A. I tell it openly in the court; that man's hands are not clean in this business. The ladder that they broke in at my window, he came down and looked at it, he said it was not his, but his was broke, and it was placed at my window when I went out to buy something for dinner; when I came back the ladder was gone. Now this man, there he is, he came and saw the ladder, and he sent one of his men to fetch the ladder away, after he had disowned it; he said it was Grindall's ladder, and that Mr. Grindall has got it.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say now, that the man who smashed the glass of the window, did cut his hand. - A. He did, I did not see his hand cut, but I saw the blood on his hands; I saw Prendergast when he led me down stairs, and when he was leading me out of bed; I am positive, I shall be out of time very soon; I held down the sash with my hand, but I was not cut in any way.</p>
               <p>ISAAC FRANKLIN. I am a farmer.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner Prendergast was in your employment. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You live very near to Mr. Bell do not you. - A. Very near.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner at the bar on the night of this transaction, was he at your place. - A. I cannot say whether he was or not; he slept in my loft when he was there, whether he was there that night I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the day after the commission of the robbery. - A. I did, I was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that he was at all charged with the fact at that time. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Or suspected. - A. I did not till Mr. Slade, a farmer just by, came and informed me that Mr. Bell's house was broken open. I was down in the field where Prendergast was spreading a manure, I stood looking at him one or two hours, and two more men where with him spreading the manure.</p>
               <p>Q. Having no suspicion you could not be called upon to examine him. - A. No, I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak with respect to the condition of his hands. - A. I saw no cut at all in the least; I did not examine them, I saw no plaister on them.</p>

I went to the Wool-pack about eight o'clock in the evening; I was drinking in the tap-room—the prisoner came in, said he was in distress, and asked if we could relieve him—I said, "No"—I gave him a drink of beer, and he got close behind me—I had a tobacco-box in my left-hand great coat-pocket—I left the house before the prisoner did—I was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in going home, and directly I got home I missed my tobacco-box—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it has my name on it.</p>

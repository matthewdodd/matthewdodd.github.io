            . The prisoner came to our house and remained there till the 18th; I missed a handkerchief - she said she knew nothing of it; on the Friday she did not return, and on the Saturday she came again - I said, Mrs. Roberts, (which was the name she gave me,)'you have taken a handkerchief out of my house;" she said, "If I have robbed such a poor woman as you, I ought to be burnt alive" - I said, "If you do not give it up, I will charge Crowder with you;" she bounced out of the house, and I saw her no more - I went to the pawnbroker's, and found the property; here is a handkerchief, a cap, and a mantle - they are all mine.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner and found this cap in a little bundle belonging to her, in her mother's house; the duplicates of the others were found on her.</p>
               <p>MR. FALKARD. I am a pawnbroker. This mantle and handkerchief were pawned with me - I am certain the prisoner pawned the mantle on the 10th; I am not quite so sure she pawned the handkerchief - that was on the 15th; I gave these duplicates for them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did the person come to you? A. I think in the afternoon - I cannot swear to the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The occasion of my pawning them was absolute want - I pawned them to pay for my lodging: I owed her 3s. 6d. for lodging and for a loaf of bread - I had work to go to the day after I was taken, and I should have taken them out; when I came back that Saturday night, about eight o'clock, she said if I did not get out of the room she would kick me out - I went out.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH MELLING. I did not - I was surprised at her not returning.</p>

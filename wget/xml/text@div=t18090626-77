On the 10th of June, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner went into the parlour, he called for a glass of ale, my daughter served him with it; he had a second glass of ale, and stopped as long as he thought proper; the girl, as he was going out, went into the parlour and found the candlesticks missing; I followed him up the hill, and said to him, I presume you have something about you that is not your own; he looked very stedfastly, and said, sir; I have? I took hold of him by the collar and said, you must go back with me. I took him back, and took him into the same room from whence he took the property; I said, deliver what you have, or else I shall be under the necessity of searching you; he took one candlestick out of his coat pocket, and another out of his hat, and gave them me. I took him to Hatton Garden. He said it was distress that made him do it; that could not be the case; the officer searched him and found five shillings and sixpence in his pocket.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

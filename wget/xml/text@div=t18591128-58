                  </hi> I am the wife of John Hennessey, a printer, 3, Charles-street, Curtain-road—on Saturday, 22nd October, about half-past nine o'clock, I left my house—I left the street door securely shut—I was gone about about a quarter of an hour; I blew my candle out when I went—when I came back I found it alight again in my front parlour—I screamed for help—I lifted the window up, pulled the blind a little on one side, and saw two men—I opened the window to see who they were, before I gave the alarm—Fitzgerald was at the top corner drawer, and the other one was at the dining table—I immediately got in at the window; they ran into the yard—by that time I got the door open, and the neighbours came to my assistance—the men could not get out the back way, and they returned into the room—I found my things out of the drawers, on the table—I left every thing in the drawers when I went out; a sandwich case was found in the yard by the policeman, and some plaid dresses—I found a key on my drawers on the Sunday morning; it was not mine, but it opened the front door.</p>

               <p>found the tin sandwich case behind the water butt; I did not take it up off the table exclaiming, "Thank God"—I left a sovereign on the end of the mantel-piece, which did not all belong to us; and as I had laid out part of my week's money, I did not know how I should be able to repay it; and when I found it on the mantel-shelf I said, "Thank God, that is safe."</p>

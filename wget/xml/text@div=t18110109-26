On the 14th of December in the forenoon, on going down into my cellar, I perceived the pipe to be gone, and looking about I perceived the prisoner going up stairs. I ran and tried to catch hold of her; she tried to get away. I held her fast till the constable came. I found the leaden pipe in her lap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in your house - A. No, I never saw her before; I had taken the house the Saturday before. I have lodgers, and I occupy the ground-floor.</p>
               <p>- GALLEY. I am a constable; I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner; on her person I found a lead pipe and a ball-cock. I asked her how she came by it; she said some woman had cut it; she told her to go below, it was in a tub, she might have it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Lombard-court on the 14th of December; I saw a woman at this door; she told me that if I would go down stairs there was a bit of pipe in the tub, to bring it up to her.</p>

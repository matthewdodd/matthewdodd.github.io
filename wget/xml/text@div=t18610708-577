               <p>Pentonville; it is my dwelling-house—on 21st April Mary Ann Redkisson was in my service—the prisoner Strugnell had been in my service for ten months up to the previous Christmas—while he was in my service I had an iron box which was kept in my bed-room—on 21st April, it had in it a cash-box containing about 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a bank-book, and other papers—I returned home on that Sunday night about 10 o'clock, and found that Mary Ann Redkisson was gone from the house—I found her wounded it the hospital—when I returned from the hospital I examined my house and found the box was gone—I know both the other prisoners—Liney had been in my service for about a year and a half—he left in October last—while he was in my service I often saw Quilter; he came to my shop purchasing meat to sell again—he and Liney were particularly acquainted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabman, "No. 12,810," and live at 4, Stevenson-terrace, Caledonian-road. On Sunday evening, 21st April, I was in the Caledonian-road, with my cab en the stand—about twenty minutes past 9 I was called off the stand by the prisoner Strugnell—he got up on the cab, and ordered me to drive into Lion-street—that was just across the Caledonian-road, about thirty yards off—the cab-stand is about a mile from Mr. Higgins' shop in Chapel-street—when I got into Lion-street I asked Strugnell where I was to pick up—he told me to draw just round there, and I drew, and stood right opposite the private door of 6, Stevenson-terrace—after I had stood there about a minute, two young men brought a box, and placed it outside my cab—the other two prisoners are the men, I am quite certain—the box might have been about that length and that depth (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—it appeared heavy as they carried it—it went down a rare bump when they placed it inside the cab—the two men got in afterwards, and told me to drive to the corner of South-street, Southampton-street, Pentonville-hill—I know who they were, those two that stand there—I noticed them at the time—Liney got out at the house in South-street, and knocked at the door—some</p>

               <p>one came and told him to knock three times—he knocked three times, and the party he asked for was not at home—he then got inside the cab, and they told me to drive to the Crown public-house on Pentonville-hill—I drove there, and we had a pot of half and half, which Liney fetched—I drank some—we stayed there about five or six minutes, and Strugnell then wished them "good-night," and went off—I never saw him from that day till I saw him down at Clerkenwell—after he left, the other prisoners told me to go to Camden-town—I went there—they pulled me up at a public-house—we had a pot of half-and-half there, and we all had a smoke together—we were there about a quarter-of-an-hour—they then ordered me to drive back to South ampton-street, to the corner, to South-street, where I had previously called—they said the party was not at home—they stopped there, and smoked a pipe, and waited till they did come—they paid me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my fare—each gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and they took the box put, and took it to the comer of South-street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 315). I received information of this robbery—I went to Strugnell's place in Basinghall-street on the same Sunday night, and took him into custody—I afterwards took Quilter in custody in River-street, or Sidney-street, Maiden-lane, King's-cross—on searching his premises I found some property, but having nothing to do with this present charge—while searching the house I saw Liney—he was in the downstairs apartment; the kitchen, sitting on a table—this was on the Wednesday after the robbery, the 24th—Liney was then taken in custody—the witness Granger gave a description to me of the persons he had seen.</p>

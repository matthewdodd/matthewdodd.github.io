               <p>I was going up Fleet street, on the 1st of April, and I saw the prisoner doing something at Mr. Fielder's window, and he had got part of the ribbon out of the window, wound round his hand, the other part was in the window; he directly ran off as hard as he could, and the rest of it followed him through the window, I suppose as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060111"></xptr> much as five or six yards; I said to him where are you going with the ribbon, says he, God bless me, master, a boy gave me the ribbon, you may have it, I do not want it; I took him back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Describe how this hole was? - There is a hole in the frame of the window, through which a screw goes every evening, and the ribbon was put against this hole, and there was some paper in every hole, to prevent any thing going through; the paper was pushed out, and the ribbons drawn through the hole.</p>
               <p>Is it your usual practice to put paper to prevent any thing being drawn through? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know if it was so filled that night, did you see it so filled? - I will not pretend to say for that night, but I in general put in the paper myself.</p>

               <p>I picked up the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I live at home with my father, I am nineteen.</p>
               <p>What is he? - A broker.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The breaking is not proved, as it is not proved that this hole was actually stopped at that time.</p>

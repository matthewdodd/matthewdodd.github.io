I have known the prisoner twelve months. He came to me some time before the 30th of October, and asked if I had any silk handkerchiefs. I shewed him what I had; he chose a piece, and gave me two half-crowns on it, but did not take it away. He called again in four or five days, and desired me to get him seven or eight pieces more, of a good pattern. He called again in about three days, to know if I had them ready - I was not in the way, but on going home was informed he had been, and went to the public-house and met him. He asked why I did not let him know that I had got them - I said I had called on him several times - he appointed to see me at eight o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come at last to fetch the goods. - A. On the 30th of October; another man, called Neary, was with him. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Well, Heavens, I have brought my friend." I said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose it is your friend to buy the handkerchiefs?" He said Yes. I got them and shewed them - they were tied in a handkerchief. He said to his friend,</p>

               <p>"Bill, there they are - you may look at them." His friend examined the ends of them. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't pull them about too much." His friend said, "Do you know that these goods are seizable?" I said, I could not say whether they were the right thing, but if they were, I supposed they were seizable. The prisoner said to me,</p>
               <p>"You be d - d; you know they are seizable." His friend said,</p>

               <p>"I am a Custom House officer, and must search your place."</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you think him an officer - A. I did. He said,</p>
               <p>"Have you any more?" The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, get them out - you have." I had two single handkerchiefs by me, which I had shewn him the day before - I got them out by the prisoner's desire; he took them. I begged of the officer very hard not to take them, because the prisoner had paid 6 s. on them. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Dick, don't be so hard - you know the young man very well, who lives in London-wall, has paid me 6 s. on these, which I must pay if you take them." The officer said,</p>
               <p>"I must take them - my place stands at a stake - I must take the whole; that is your informer (pointing to the prisoner), he has lodged the information at the Custom House, and unless you can settle it with him, you will hear further of it." I said,</p>
               <p>"Settle it! - how do you mean?" He said,</p>
               <p>"You had better give him a few pounds." I said,</p>
               <p>"A few pounds! - what do you mean! - I have nothing to give him." The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Officer, I will not allow that - I will lock you up and the man immediately." The officer smiled, and said,</p>
               <p>"You had better ask him what he will take." I turned round to the prisoner, and asked what he wanted - he said he would not take a farthing less than 3 l. I said I could not give him that, but would give him a sovereign, sooner than go to the watch-house, and I must go and borrow that. He said he would not take a sovereign, and that I should immediately go to the watch-house. The man who acted as officer begged of him to consider my family; and my wife interfered, and begged of him not to be so harsh. The prisoner then said he would consider my family, and take 2 l. I said I could not give him 2 l., and could not afford to borrow it. He then jumped up, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, you shall go to the watch-house immediately, and your woman too, if you don't hold your tongue." I told him he might take me to the watch-house, I could not give him the money. I asked the officer for his authority to seize these goods; he said he would shew his authority next day, when he summoned me before the Commissioners, at eleven o'clock. I said,</p>
               <p>"I always understood officers had an authority to shew." He refused to shew any. The prisoner said I should go to the watch-house, and came towards me as if to collar me. I said then, rather than go to the watch-house, I would apply to my publican to borrow the money. They both went with me to Walter, the publican. I spoke to him, and he told me to call them forward. The prisoner came forward, and the other man ran out with the goods. I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner saw the other man take the goods from your house - A. Yes. I then told the publican I wanted to borrow 2 l. He said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say you will take 2 l. from this man?" The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Heavens, are you dissatisfied?" I said</p>
               <p>"No; if my friend will advance the money I will let you have it, sooner than go to the watch-house." Walter said he would not let me have it; and told the prisoner if I had done wrong to take me up. He said,</p>
               <p>"I can take him tomorrow morning." Walter said he could not take me tomorrow any more than to-day; and if he had done wrong, to summon me before the Commissioners, and he would attend and trounce him for extorting money under false pretences. He then left the house. I expected to hear from the Custom House about my having the goods. He was taken up about a month afterwards. I should have taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140023"></xptr>him before, but I expected to hear from the Custom House. I enquired at the Custom House for Neary, but have not been able to find him - he was not known there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You asked for Neary at the Custom House - A. No; I asked for Mr. Steel. I went to enquire if the prisoner or Neary were officers. I knew his name was Neary, because Wells, who was at the public-house, told me his name. I have dealt in handkerchiefs about four times. I never sold four pieces to one person. A friend of mine sent a person to me with them. I cannot say whether they are Foreign or British - I never asked what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not believe them to be contraband - A. I cannot say what they were; I called them India. I live in Lovell's-court, Paternoster-row.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you began to look after the prisoner or Neary - A. It might be more than two months. Neary carried the goods with him to the public-house. I could not prevent his going away with them if he was an officer. The prisoner was taken at the Crown, public-house; but he broke from the officer, and was taken again - I knew him when he lived with Mr. Gale, a butcher, in the market.</p>

            . I keep the Crown, public-house, St. Paul's Church-yard. The prisoner and Heavens came to my house; another person was with them. When the prisoner was present, Heavens called me aside, and in consequence of what he said, I asked the prisoner what he wanted Heavens to give him 2 l. for - he said it was a matter of no consequence to me, and asked Heavens whether he meant to give him the money or not; he said he had not got it, and I would not lend it him. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"It is no matter, you will hear of me to-morrow;" turned on his heels, and walked off - I do not know what became of the other man; he had followed Heavens in in the first instance. I told him, in the prisoner's presence, that it was a scandalous shame to try to extort money from a man with such a family - he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what part of the transaction did Neary go away - A. They did not stop above five minutes - nobody came in while they were there. Neary went away first, and then in two minutes the prisoner went, saying he should hear of him to-morrow at eleven o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer, and apprehended the prisoner a fortnight ago. I first took him in a public-house in St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to HEAVENS. Q. Do you know the prisoner's brother - A. Yes; I went to him and told him his brother had robbed me, and if they were not paid for nor returned, and it was proved they were not officers, the prisoner must take the consequence of it; but if they were paid for, or returned, I should not see any further into it.</p>
               <p>GEORGE O'CONNELL. I am an officer of the Customs. I know of no officer of the name of Neary.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Are there not many officers of different names - A. Yes. If a man is an officer, it is easily proved - even if the man is absent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating himself to have been made the dupe of an artful man; he was induced by him to lay information against persons dealing in contraband goods - that he went to the Excise office, and saw a man in the passage, of whom he enquired for an officer, and he said he was one, and could make a seizure for him, and agreed to accompany him to the prosecutors - the officer agreed to take 2 l. to settle the business; they went to the public-house, and soon after he missed the man.</p>
               <p>C. H. LORD. I am a Revenue officer. The prisoner applied to me three or four times on the subject of contraband goods - it might be four months ago that he said he knew where some silk handkerchiefs could be seized, and he believed the man who had them was poor, but he thought he fetched them from another house. I was in St. Paul's Church-yard with him, and he said it was not five minutes walk from there, and he had better see if the goods were there, as I had told him. I must take my oath that they were on the premises. I never made a seizure through his information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You told him an officer must have a warrant before he made a seizure - A. Yes. I think he said he had been intimate with the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him since the 30th of October - A. I think I saw him in October, but not after - there are offices at which inquiries can be made for Custom House officers, but I have known people wander about the building for two days, before they could know where to lay an information - there is a room to apply for an officer to make a seizure.</p>
               <p>- NORMAN. I am a messenger to the Board of Excise. The prisoner has applied to me about seizures; he told me three or four months ago, that he knew of some goods; that is all. I referred him to Lord.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he ever ask you to make a seizure - A. No. He did not say in what street the goods were. We have a messengers' office; any one coming in there can get what information they want.</p>
               <p>- OWEN. I am the prisoner's brother. The prosecutor applied to me to make up the money for these goods, and said, on my not complying, he should certainly proceed, he thought it would hang him, and so forth.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He told you he must either have his money or goods, or he would prosecute - A. Yes.</p>

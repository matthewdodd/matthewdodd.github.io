            . I live at Mr. Patterson's, in Chiswell-street. On the 1st of September I observed the prisoner in company with another, in conversation, at the corner of the doorway - supposing he was a bad character, I gave information - I observed them there for five minutes in conver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160043"></xptr>sation together - after remaining there for some time, they turned a corner, crossed the road, and stood under Mr. Patch's gateway - I mentioned it to the policeman to give a look out - the policeman walked down the street - they afterwards joined a third man, and were all standing together by the gateway - I then gave information to the policeman, and shortly afterwards saw them all three running from Mr. Patch's - I saw the first one had got something, I could not tell what - it was not the prisoner - I saw the prisoner at Worship-street afterwards, but not before - I knew him to be the person I had seen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to me? A. By my knowledge of his features - I had not seen him before - I observed his face at the gateway - I looked through the shop-window as he crossed the corner - I had been at the door before that.</p>

            . I am a policeman. My attention was called to the men - I looked down the street, and saw them all three just turning out of the gateway - one with this bundle ran about four yards before the other two - I ran after them directly - one of the two behind, saw me pursuing and ran to the one with the bundle, and both ran off - finding I was gaining ground on them, he dropped it, and escaped - I picked it up, and it was five pieces of carpet - it was claimed by Mr. Patch - on the Sunday following I apprehended the prisoner in Chiswell-street, and told him I wanted him - he asked, "What for?" - I said I would tell him at the station-house, and there I told him it was for stealing five pieces of carpet - he said he knew nothing of it - I had not time to observe the three men before they ran away - I gave the carpet up to Mr. Patch.</p>

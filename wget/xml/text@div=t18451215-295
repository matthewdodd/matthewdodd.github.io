                  </hi>. On Saturday, afternoon, the 13th of Dec., I received a pair of trowsers from my master, Samuel Ellis—I was to take them to Mr. Elliott's, No. 236, Regent-street—on my way I met the prisoner in Fleet-street—he asked me whether I was going to Mr. Elliott's, No. 236, Regent-street—I told him I was—he asked me whether I had any clothes—I said I had—he told me Mr. Elliott had sent him to fetch them—he walked with me as far at Bedford-street, Covent-garden—I had another parcel to leave there—he asked me again for the parcel, and said he was sent down on purpose for it—I then gave it him—it contained a pair of trowsers, the property of my master—I afterwards saw the prisoner, and gave him in charge—I am quite sure he it the person—I did not know him before.</p>

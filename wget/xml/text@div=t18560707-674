The prisoner Russell was his porter—we missed some property—I discovered some on Russell, and in consequence of information I went with Mr. Smith to Grouse's premises—he keeps a shop at South-row—I met him outside his premises—the policeman told him he had come about some stolen property, which had been traced to his possession, and some duplicates which he had sold to the witness Smith—he said that he knew nothing about it—Smith said, "You had better tell the truth, because I have told everything"—Grouse then said he had got the goods to pawn from a young man who represented himself to be a traveller—he was then asked by the policeman why he sold the tickets to Smith—he answered, that the traveller had told him to pawn the goods, and if he did not return in a day or two, be could keep the tickets—I think the value of the property that Mr. Gugniere lost was nearly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a great deal of it is produced—this is part of it.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you plead guilty at the last Session to the charge of robbing your employer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I pleaded guilty at Marl<lb></lb>borough-street—I did not say I reserved my defence; I pleaded guilty last Session—I had not any attorney—no one spoke to me in the prison, and told me that if I pleaded guilty, and gave evidence against the other man, I should be recommended to mercy—I had no idea of being called as a witness on the part of the prosecution till a few minutes before I came into the dock—the counsel made the communication to me—I did not know till then that I should be examined—Mr. Lewis did not tell me that I should be recom<lb></lb>mended to mercy—this is not the first occasion of my making my appear<lb></lb>ance in a criminal court, but never here—on one occasion I received sentence of transportation—before that, I was merely taken for an assault, I was only in prison a few hours—I was convicted, and sentenced to be tran<lb></lb>sported for tea years at Portsmouth—I was, not charged with an assault, with intent to rob—I was never charged with robbing my employer before this—I had been in the service of a person of the name of Bernay, at Ports<lb></lb>mouth—I was sentenced to be transported for ten years, in 1850—I did not serve that out, I received a conditional pardon, and then my friends were gone to Australia—that was nearly two years before I went to the prosecutor's—I used to employ myself in copying, having received a liberal education—I did not communicate these facts to Mr. Gugniere—I gave him the name of some one to whom he might apply, and that was fictitious—as soon as I got into his employ I began to rob him—I had 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I had not board and lodging.</p>

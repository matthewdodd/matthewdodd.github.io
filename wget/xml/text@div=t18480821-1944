                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am waiter at a lodging-house. I went with the prosecutor to the station—the prisoner there said, if they would let him go and take the other two in charge, (meaning Marion and Jarvis), he would procure him his money—he was charged with stealing this money of Johann Herting—he is not here—this is Mr. Ballantine's writing to this deposition—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" The prisoner says, 'I am guilty of the crime; I am the man that has done it; I am sorry that I have involved my fellow<lb></lb>men; I do not know what number of pieces there were in the handkerchief; fifty-six guilders are at 65, King William-street, where I left them for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I had seen the money in the chest; a hammer was lying on the floor; I took it, and broke the lock off; I went on deck; Marion, nor any one else, knows anything about it from beginning to end.'

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I came to London with two friends, who went home; but I, having no home, went on board the ship; the passengers told me some foreign coin had been lost on board the ship, and all the people had been searched, and no money found; I took my money out of my trunk, and put it into my pocket; it ivas all foreign, as I came from the same place as the prosecutor; he was then gone for a policeman; I was afraid he should think it was stolen from him, and went to the public-house where I slept, and put it up the chimney, in my handkerchief; I then went on board, and was taken by the policeman; I and my two mates were brought up for having stolen it; my fellow-prisoners said I must plead guilty; I told them why I put the money there, that I was innocent, but could not prove it; they said, if I would say I was guilty, they would get me counsel, and get me off with a slight punishment, while, if they were found guilty, they would have a heavier punishment, and they would write to my friends in Sweden and America, and tell what trouble I had brought them into; I was afraid, and I said I was guilty, but the money was my own.</p>

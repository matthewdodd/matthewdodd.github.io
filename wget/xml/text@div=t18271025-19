On the 16th of October, about half-past one o'clock, while the work people were at dinner, the prisoner came into the warehouse - I was at the bottom of the warehouse - he came half way down, and asked if I could recommend him to a situation; I said I could not - he turned round, and as he went out he pulled the door after him, without waiting for an answer - this raised my suspicion; there was a pile of cotton between him and me, so that I could not see him take any thing, but hearing paper rustle I went out, and saw him turn the end of the lane, with something white in his hand; I ran, and stopped him with about 1 lb. of sewing cotton; I took it from him: he ran away - I called Stop thief! followed, and brought him back to the warehouse. We had only finished this cotton an hour before.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

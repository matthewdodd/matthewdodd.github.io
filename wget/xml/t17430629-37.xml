            . I am a Silversmith; the Prisoner came with this Bit of a broken Spoon, as I was standing at my Door in the Evening, with a very plausible Story, and said he had found it in Tottenham-Court Road, and did not know whether it was Silver, and desired to be inform'd; it being battered so, I could not readily tell which, I told him it was Silver; he asked me whether I would buy it; I asked him whether he had got a Father and Mother, he said that he had, and that they lived in Cary-Court in Drury-Lane; I asked him whether it was not his Father's, he said no; and the Boy that was with him claimed half of it, and said they found it; I could not tell whether it was good or bad Silver; there was an Ounce and a Quarter, and I gave him 5 s. and 6 d. for it.</p>

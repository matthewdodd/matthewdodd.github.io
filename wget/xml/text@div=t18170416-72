            . I live in Moorfields. I went to Mr. Mr. Lawton's shop on the 10th of April, between one and two o'clock, and bought four articles of the prisoner, which came to 13s. 6d.; I paid him with a half guinea, a 1s., 6d. token, and 1s. 6d.; they were all marked, except the sixpence - I saw him put it into the till.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I expected my money to be returned. I only wanted a lock. He put the money into the till immediately.</p>

             re-examined. At eight o'clock, I asked the prisoner what goods were sold to the amount of 11s. 6d., as that was the entry he had made in the book-it was entered, "clock, plyers, &amp;c. 11s. 6d." Mr. Gann was present. I asked him if it was not 13s. 6d. - he hesitated. I then asked him the amount of different articles he had sold; he said, the lock was 5s. 6d., and the other articles 6s., making the 11s. 6d. - he said, he did not remember what he sold the plyers for. I told him the different prices that Mr. Stace had given for the things, amounting to 13s. 6d., and he said it was correct, that he had made an error, and that the amount would be found in the till. I said, the till contained 4l. 4s. 2d. - his book contained an account of articles sold to the amount of 4l. 7s. 6d. There was a paper in the till of 4s. 2d. put down to the house, which made 4l. 8s. 4d.; if he had entered the prices which Mr. Stace paid, it would have been 2s. more, making<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160025"></xptr>4l. 6s.2d. - I only found a difference of 1s. 2d. Mr. Gann searched him, and found a 1s. 6d. token, and 1s., which had Mr. Stace's mark on them. The prisoner said he never robbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mr. Stace was to have his money back again; he might have given change out of his own pocket. He acknowledged receiving 4l. 7s. 6d. - there was as much money in the till as made the amount. There was another person, who served in the shop. The prisoner said he had changed a 3s. piece out of the till, to get some beer.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I went to Mr. Lawtoo's-it was agreed that I should charge him with the robbery. Mr. Lawton said, 11s. 6d. was entered in the book, and read over to him the particulars which Mr. Stace had given, viz. compasses, 3s.; lock, 6s. 6d.; plyers, 2s. 6d.; hasp, 1s. 6d. - the prisoner said it was right, and he had entered it wrong, but the money would be found in the till. We desired him to shew what money he had about him. He pulled out two 1s. 6d. pieces and 2s. 6d. in pieces-one of the 1s. 6d. tokens and 1s. were marked. The prisoner said he had taken change. I produce them.</p>
               <p>MR. STACE. They are the same that I marked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Lawton put the money into his pocket, at first, without keeping it separate. I told him I had taken change.</p>

On Saturday night, the 12th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, I was in the shop—the prisoner came in, dressed as a butcher, in a blue frock, knee-breeches, and three-quarter boots—he looked like a butcher—he asked to look at some hats, which I shewed him—he chose two, which came to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I never saw him before—he gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, as I thought—I gave it across the counter to Mr. Heath, and he gave him change, while I got the hats ready for him—I asked him if we should send them home for him—he said he had his horse and cart waiting outside, and he took them away in his hand—I looked out at the door—there was no horse or cart near, right nor left—I have not the least doubt of his being the person.</p>

In October last I was residing at No. 21, Alpha-road, St. John's-wood—the prisoner is the son of Mr. John Fitzgerald, of Romsey, Hampshire—his mother died on the 7th of October, and was buried on the 14th, at Highgate Cemetery—I am her executor. On the Saturday before the Mon<lb></lb>day of her interment the prisoner went from my house early in the morn<lb></lb>ing—he had been stopping at my house during the whole time his mother lay dead, sleeping in my room, at his own request, in a make-shift sort of bed—on that Saturday afternoon he came to my office in the City, within a very short time of three o'clock, either before or after, and we went together up to the Cemetery at Highgate, to see in what state of preparation the vault was—we went by a Holloway coach from the Bank—we remained at Highgate probably an hour—it took us rather more than an hour to go, as we had to cross the fields, after leaving the coach, to get to the Cemetery—it was dusk before we left the Cemetery—we crossed some brickfields into the Holloway-road, and returned by an omnibus to the Angel at Islington—we got out of that into a Paddington omnibus, which took us to the Nightingale public-house, Lisson-grove, which is very near my residence—it must have been after six o'clock when we got to my house—I should say nearer half-past six o'clock than other<lb></lb>wise—from the time that be came to me in the City about three o'clock down to half-past six o'clock, when he arrived at my house with me, he was never out of my company a moment—the afternoon was very humid, and the ground at the Cemetery was very wet—our boots were very muddy and wet—having to cross the fields twice they got more so, and having been on the ground adjoining thevault—I changed my boots the moment I got home, and I think he did—I put on another coat and waistcoat—I did</p>

               <p>not, to say, dress for dinner—I believe he changed hit clothes, but not in my room—I understood he changed his boots and his coat—we dined about seven o'clock, as dinner was not ready when we got home—he had no op<lb></lb>portunity of going to Oxford-street between the time we arrived and seven o'clock—I should think we were about an hour at dinner before the cloth was taken away—we either took wine or a little grog afterwards—I sup<lb></lb>pose that occupied another hour, as we naturally conversed about having been at the Cemetery—it was understood at first that the funeral should be on Sunday—I saw from the state of the vault it was doubtful whether it would be ready, and we discoursed after the cloth was removed whether it should not be postponed until Monday—it was never actually fixed for Sunday, but contemplated—about nine o'clock the prisoner expressed a wish to go out for a abort time—I objected, thinking he was better at home—he said he wanted a crape to his hat, and I think he said gloves—I said the gloves would be supplied by the undertaker; but he said, "I have pro<lb></lb>mised the man about the crape, and I shall not be above half-an-hour"—I think I gave him a sovereign and a half, or two sovereigns, when he went out—I made a bargain about his returning, as I had a great objection to his going out—I agreed with him that it should not exceed half-an-hour—he went oat—I will not pledge myself that he returned within half-an-hour, but I do not think it exceeded three-quarters of an hour—I consider that he kept faith with me in his promise—I rather think the tea things had been brought up when he returned—I do not think he could have gone to Ox<lb></lb>ford-street and back again in the time he was absent—it is quite impossible he could have got to the bottom of Oxford-street in that time.</p>

               <p>is cook also principally—sometimes it is rather uncertain what time I dine, when I cannot say what time I shall be home to dinner—I go home at five o'clock, and it takes half-an-hour to get it ready then, but I invariably order dinner at five o'clock when I know I am coming home—if I had any thing particular to delay me I should say six o'clock, which is not unfrequently the case, from unexpected arrangements—on the morning of the 12th of October I left the prisoner at home—I think the next time I saw him was when he called at my office, about three o'clock, I think, at all events it was previous to the office hour—I am not sure it was so late as three o'clock—it might have been two o'clock, as I thought his time was of less consequence than mine, and I might have appointed two o'clock—it was more than one o'clock—I should say three o'clock was the more probable hour, but I could not swear it—I should not have thought of fixing one, because it would be uncertain whether I could go with him at that hour—about the 12th of October it gets dusk about five o'clock—we went from my office to the Bank, and got into a Holloway stags at the corner of Moorgate—we got out, I think, where the stage stops—I know we had a tolerable walk—we saw the superintendent and four or five workmen at the Cemetery, and the master—they were making the vault—I believe a person named Moore at the corner of Rathbone-place, was the un<lb></lb>dertaker—there was nobody there from the undertaker to meet us or receive directions—I did not expect to meet any body there—I thought the vault would be perfected—the place is quite open, so that any body can walk in—the superintendent was superintending the workmen at the time—he knew me perfectly—I bespoke the ground of him originally—he is not here—I understand he has left the Company—none of the workmen are here, to my knowledge—we returned to the Angel by the same description of stage, perhaps the very same—I have no doubt of the hour, but cannot say whether I looked at my watch, or heard some clock strike, but I am certain we did not get home till half-past six o'clock—the prisoner remained with me at dinner two hours—he never moved from the table—I do not think he was away more than three-quarters of an hour—the funeral was fixed for Monday—he wished it on Sunday—I thought it was hazardous, as the superintendent informed me if the men worked all night the vault should be ready, but I did not like to depend on that—I am not quite certain that the undertaker had previous directions for its being on Monday, unless he had earlier notice, for it was my wish all along to be on Monday, thinking it should be a week at least, but Mr. Fitzgerald wished it on Sunday—the prisoner's mother lived at my house—she died there, and was buried from there—the undertaker came on Sunday night for fresh instructions—he concluded, as he had not heard from us, that it was fixed for Monday—I was at home all Sunday, except going to church—I am not certain whether the prisoner went with me lo church—I have not the same man-servant now as I had then—he is gone to a farm in the neighbourhood—he is not here—he did not wait at table—the housekeeper did—I did not know the prisoner was in trouble till he was actually in custody—he wrote me a letter—I had no knowledge of the charge against him till he was in custody—I had written a letter to him at Romsey, on the faith that he was there—I was not before the Magistrate on his coming up for re-hearing—I was in the office, but not to give evidence—it was last Friday, when he was finally committed, I think.</p>

Leat changed his clothes, and the prisoner asked me for slippers, as his feet were wet—he took off his boots, and I gave him slip<lb></lb>pen—it was seven o'clock, or after seven, when I took dinner in—I attended on them at dinner, and took away the cloth after dinner—they were an hour and a quarter at dinner—I took some coals in afterwards, and swept up the hearth about half-past eight o'clock—at that time the prisoner was still with Mr. Leat—I took tea in at half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner was not in the room then—the bell rang afterwards for some more hot water—I went into the room, and the prisoner was there then—that was about ten o'clock, I think—he did not go out any more that night to my knowledge—they went to bed about eleven o'clock—I took Mr. Leat's bed candle up.</p>

            . I live at Crabtree-row, Hackney-road. On Friday evening, the 4th of January, at a quarter past six o'clock, I was at the corner of <placeName id="t18220109-13-crimeloc61">Devonshire-street, Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

I thought he was going to insult me - I perceived the reticule go from my hand, he ran off, I immediately followed him; he was stopped without my losing sight of him - the reticule was not found, nobody ran away but him; I did not see it in his possession, it was silk velvet, and contained a brown velvet purse, with gold ornaments.</p>

            . I am beadle of Devonshire-square. I heard a cry of Stop thief! when I was in the square, and observed several people running up at the top of Devonshire-street; they appeared all of the same party, the prisoner was the foremost - I secured him, but found nothing on him; he said he was not the person, that he heard the cry, and was running at the time.</p>

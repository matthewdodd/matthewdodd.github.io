                  </hi> I am gardener to Mr. Joshua Pedley, of Forest-gate, West Ham. He has potato clamps in his ground—I know the prisoners; they live in premises adjoining my master's—about the 15th of April there was a large quantity of Regent potatoes clamped on my master's ground—on that day I saw the coachman pick some of the potatoes and put them into sacks—he made up five sacks—we left work that evening at six o'clock—I law the five sacks safe; they were put into the clamp, and covered with straw, and then with mats—next morning I went to work at six—about seven we missed two sacks of those that had been sacked up, and about three sacks of the loose potatoes from the clamp—two of the sacks which had been filled the night before, had been emptied, and the empty sacks left on the full ones—there were foot-marks which we traced from the clamp across the orchard to the corner of John Peck's garden, to the edge of a ditch; but I did not go across the ditch into his garden—Manning, the police-sergeant, compared some shoes with the foot-marks—I went with Benton to Peck's premises—I saw two sieves and about three-parts of a sack of potatoes in a shed adjoining his house—I went to a clamp in his garden, and found about two sacks and a half of potatoes there—they were exactly of the same sort as my master's—these are some that were in the clamp, and these are some that were in the shed—they are both exactly the same sort as were in my master's clamp—</p>

               <p>those that were in the sacks in our clamp were picked; those loose in the clamp were not—the value of those we found were 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I am coachman to Mr. Pedley. I picked these pota<lb></lb>toes on the 15th of April, and put them in five sacks—those produced corre<lb></lb>spond exactly with what I picked—next morning I missed two sacks out of the five—the gardener and I traced footsteps as far as the ditch that joins the prisoner's premises—I was with Manning when he tried some shoes—I was in the shed, and saw the potatoes in the sieves and in the sack—I likewise saw the potatoes that were brought from the clamp in the prisoner's garden—they were so much like my master's that I could not tell the difference.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, K</hi> 5.) I had a search-warrant to examine the prisoner's premises. On 16th April, I went to the clamp in Mr. Pedley's garden, and saw footsteps from the clamp across an orchard, and from there to a ditch that led to the prisoner's garden—that was about two o'clock in the day—the footsteps appeared fresh, as if made the night before—I did not cross the ditch which divides the gardens—I could see very plainly that a plank had been put across—there was the impression on both sides very plain, immediately at the point to which I traced the footsteps—I found a plank in the prisoner's garden—I measured it with a piece of stick, and then measured it to the impression; it exactly corresponded—I searched Peck's premises—I found the two sieves of potatoes, and three parts of a sack—the officer then found the others in a clamp—I took John Peck, jun.—I told him the charge—he said they were all grown there—I took the father, and told him what he was charged with—he said that he grew them all—I took him back to his own house—I showed the potatoes to him, and said, "These are the potatoes I allude to"—he then said he bought two sacks of his eldest son—he was then taken into custody—I afterwards examined the</p>

               <p>footmarks—I took Edward Peck's shoes off—I found some footsteps ex<lb></lb>actly of the impression that his shoes would make—there was nothing very particular in his shoes, but they had a very broad toe, and one of the heels was worn very much—I could not find any impression of the elder prisoner's shoes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw no footmarks in the prisoner's garden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was dug up—there was a man digging it at the time—the ditch might have been six or seven feet wide; the length of the plank—one side of the ditch was mud—on the other there were a few nettles growing—the ground is not perpendicular on the side of the prisoner's premises—the elder prisoner told me that he grew the potatoes—when I went with him to his house he said "I bought two sacks of my eldest son"—the potatoes were not in an open shed on his garden—the door was shut, and his wife pushed it open—the door leads from the shed to their back-room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On what day was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The day after the loss—we received information about nine or ten o'clock—the potatoes I found in the clamp were what I showed to John Peck, jun.—I took off his shoes and compared them with the marks near Mr. Pedley's clamp—I made an impression by the side of them, and there were the same marks exactly—I did not put the shoes into the original impression till afterwards—this was on 16th April—it was not wet that day, nor the day before—the ground was not to say dry, it was mould where the clamp was—there were weeds in some parts, some parts were clear.</p>

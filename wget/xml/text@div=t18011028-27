             sworn. - At the time this happened, I lodged in my master's warehouse, Mr. Gray, an auctioneer, in Roll's-buildings, Bond's-stables; I lodge now at the Bird-in-Hand public-house, in Long-Acre: On the 30th of September, I had been at work for my master all day, and I had drank a good deal in my work; in the evening I went to the Elephant and Castle, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at all how you got home that night? - A. I don't; I found myself in bed in the morning at home; I waked about seven o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoner in bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection whether you had seen him over night? - A. Not to my knowledge; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether, upon any occasion, you had ever seen him before? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon finding a man in bed with you that you knew nothing of, what did you say? - A. I asked him how he came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he undrest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so too? - A. Yes; he said I had attempted to commit an unnatural crime, and he would not leave me till I gave him two guineas; I told him it was not in my power to give him two guineas, for I had not two guineas; he said, as I was a poor man, he would let me off for a guinea and a half; he said, if I did not give him that, he would report me; then I gave him a one-pound note, a seven-shilling piece, and four shillings in silver; it was money that I had taken belonging to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that induced you to give him this money and this note? - A. From the threats that he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. The threats of doing what? - A.Accusing me of an unnatural crime; he said, he would report me, and turn me out of my bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from the fear of that accusation that you parted with the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay with you after this? - A. We parted directly.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say where it was he would accuse you of having committed this crime? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it you parted? - A. About seven o'clock; he left me as soon as he had got the money.</p>
               <p>Q. This was only a ware-room? - A. No, an auction-room.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the key of the room? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And nobody else was there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have let yourself into the room? - A. I cannot tell how I got home; I found the key in the inside of the door when I let him out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell whether you let yourself in or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not enquire how he came to be in bed with you? - A. I was so terrified, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not know that he was in bed with you till you waked in the morning in the way you have described? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Do not you know you took me yourself to those premises that night? - A. I do not know; I was so intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, after you had got into bed, say that my head was too low; and did not you go and get a bolster to raise my head higher? - A. I did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280024"></xptr>Q. In the morning did I tell you I wished to see Mr. Gray? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me you would certainly be a friend to me? - A. No; he said he was going of a furlough, and if I would give him that, I should never see his face any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not beg of me not to go away while the men were cleaning the carriages in the yard? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not then go down stairs, and lock me in? - A. When he told me he would take a guinea and a half, I had a two-pound note of my master's, and I went out to get the note changed, because I would not give him any more than a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you lock him in? - A. Yes, for fear he should take something out of my warehouse, and be off; I was absent about five minutes; I got it changed at Mr. Hall's gin-shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me there would be a sale on the Wednesday, and if I would come, you would buy me a bed, if I would be honest and fair with you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say it should be paid for at seven shillings a month, if I liked it? - A. I did not; that you will hear of hereafter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not look out at the window, and then call to me, and say, come down, now the men are gone? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not walk with me into Chancery-lane? - A. I turned him out of the room, and locked the door; I was obliged to go my master's, in Drury-lane, and as soon as the prisoner was gone, I went there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near to him did you walk? - A. Not very near.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you walk in sight of him? - A. Not many minutes; he went down Chancery-lane, and I turned across for Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him after you came out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take hold of my hand at parting, and tell me to come on the Thursday to the Yorkshire Grey, and call for a pint of porter? - A. No such thing ever was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take hold of his hand? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first mentioned it to any body? - A. Above a week after; he had plagued me at different times afterwards, and then I mentioned it to a friend of mine, who is here, Mr. M'Kinnon.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended? - A. On Monday, the 12th.</p>

             sworn. - I am a baker: On the 30th of September, about half past seven o'clock in the evening, the prosecutor came into the Elephant and Castle, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to frequent the Elephant and Castle? - A. Yes; he called for four-penny worth of gin and water, and while the landlord was making it, he was so much intoxicated, that he fell down on the bench; I took him up, and carried him across Holborn into Chancery-lane; upon going down Chancery-lane, he said, you shall not go any further, go back to your company.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was capable of holding conversation with you at that time? - A. Yes, then knowing he was very near home, and had no coach turning to pass, I left him; I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at Marlborough-street Office.</p>
               <p>

             M'KINNON sworn. - I am a cabinetmaker and upholder: On Monday, the 12th of October, the prosecutor came to me; he seemed to be under a great depression of spirits; he told me the story, and then I advised him to take the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Biggs.) How came you to learn who the prisoner was, so as to apprehend him? - A. No more than his coming backwards and forwards to me in the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you apprehended him? - A. In Roll's-buildings.</p>
               <p>HART KEELEY sworn. - I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner on the 12th of October; Mr. M'Kinnon applied to me to be in waiting, and I went with him; I understood the prisoner was to meet the old man to have three pounds of him, and the old man brought him to the spot where he had been advised, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Biggs.) Q. Did you not tell me when I was apprehended, that you were very sorry for it, and that you were forced to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had appointed me to meet him there to bid me good bye, because I was going out of town the next morning, and he gave me some gin and water.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, what have you to say in your defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing more to say than I have said; I know myself to be very innocent; I leave it to you, my Lord, as my friend, I have no other friend.</p>

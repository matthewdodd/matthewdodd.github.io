Mr. Rendall and Monsieur La Peletiere lodge with me—on the 14th of April, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came to me to inquire for lodgings—I showed him the first floor, which he said would be too expensive, and wished to see the second floor—I told him it was occupied—he said if the gentleman would take the first floor he would take the second—I said if the gentleman would take it instead of that I would let it—he said he would come next day at twelve o'clock—I showed him the rooms on the second floor which the Messrs. Rendall and La Peletiere occupied, and where the property in question was—he did not call next day as he promised—I gave information to the police.</p>

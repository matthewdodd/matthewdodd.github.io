Whereof I sent to her Master, and he sent me Word I should have my Ring, or Satisfaction, if I insisted in the Robbery, and I do insist in it, because when I took her Hand out of my Pocket it was clench'd.</p>

Its all one for that; I know as many good Things as another; I han't liv'd so long in the World for nothing; I know what belongs to the Law better than any Body can tell me, and if I put my Hand in any Body's Pocket, whether I take any Thing out or not, I say its a Robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. That, indeed, is more than the Court knew before.</p>

            . I went to the Prisoner's Master's, and she came out of his Room in her Shift, though it's well known he has got a W ife and five Children; and she said as how they had had some Words, and she got a Ring upon her Finger, and said it was so little that she could not get it off, and so she soap'd it, and bath'd her Hand in Suds. Laud, says I, this is like Mrs. Till's Ring. Gode daum you, says she, she never bade such an a Ring in her Leef; and afterwards she said, her Master had the Ring, and then she sent to borrow three Rings to see whether I would swear my parjur'd Oath upon the wrong Ring, and so I went and told Mrs. Till how and about it.</p>

               <p>A. Edson. Not so drunk as that comes to, neither.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I won't swear but I touch'd her Pocket, but my Hand was not in it; for I went to change a Guinea and laid it in her Lap, and she said she never see it, and bid me look if I did not drop it, and so she turn'd her Money out of her Pocket.</p>
               <p>M. Till. This was two Months before I lost the Ring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vanbritton. The Prisoner has lived with me 14 Years; I have trusted her with all I had; she is a very honest Creature, and was a good Customer to the Prosecutor, for she has laid out five or six Shillings in a Week with her, and all the Fault she had was, that she would let the Prosecutor entice her to get drunk at her Shop.</p>

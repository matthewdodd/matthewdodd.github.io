                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 520). On 12th May, about 12 at night, I was on duty at Swain's Lane, Highgate, and saw the prisoner standing in the prosecutor's garden close by the front window, and when he saw me he ran out into the road—I overtook him and said, "What were you doing there!"—he said "I was doing nothing"—I took him to the station, and then went back and called up Mr. Tabois and examined the place with him—I found the putty had been cut away from the bottom of the lower panes of the window at which the prisoner had been standing—there are two panes in each part of the window, and large enough for a man to get through—the glass was ordinary window glass—I then returned to the station and searched the prisoner, and found upon him this, farrier's knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he de<lb></lb>scribed himself as a shoeing smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Highgate Cemetery, and live in a detached house in Swain's Lane adjoining the cemetery—between 12 and 1 a.m. on the 13th I was aroused by Gibney, and by the light of his lamp I saw that the putty had been cut away from the bottom of the lower pane at the right-hand side of the window—it appeared to have been recently done; the broken putty was on the window sill—it is a large pane, and a man could get through into the room if the glass had been removed—there are not many houses near—the house is on the top of a slope, and the garden is on the right and left of the steps leading up to the front door and to this window—it is very easy of access.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner in his defence read a statement that he was a hard-working man with a wife and seven children, and had met with two serious accidents, the second being that of a broken jaw by a kick from a horse he was shoeing in December last; that by the doctor's advice he had been in the country, and, was walking from Finchley, where he had been working, and he met the policeman, who asked where he was going, and on being told he was going to the Kent Road he said, "I know you won't; you will go with me," and arrested him.</hi>

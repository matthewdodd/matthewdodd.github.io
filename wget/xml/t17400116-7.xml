            . I belong to the Cathedral Church of St Paul. I am Sub-Sachristan and Library-Keeper. On the 15th of December in the Morning, when I went to the Church, I missed the Nossels and the Brass Arms from the Branches. Eight Nossels, 8 Cups and Bosses, and a Brass Arm were gone. I asked our Watchman what was become of them? He could not tell; so I went away to Mr Giles, our Founder, and desired him to make Enquiry after them. About an Hour afterward, I heard some of the Things were found, and being produced before my Lord Mayor, I knew them and owned them; and as the Prisoner was carrying to Goal, I asked him for what was wanting? He told me he had sold some of the Brass at the Sign of the Bell in Long-Lane. I went thither, but the Man of the House denied he had bought any such Thing, upon which we carried the Prisoner to him, and then he owned he had bought the Brass of him, and gave us what was wanting.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not take them; they were given me to sell.</p>
               <p>Mr Rowden. He made no such Pretence when we took him; but he acknowledged he concealed himself in the Church all Night, and that he went to work in the Night, and took the Things, which he carried out in the Morning. The Cups screw very tight into the Arms; and one of the Arms he broke off. These are the Goods, and they belong to the Dean and Chapter. <rs id="t17400116-7-verdict42" type="verdictDescription">

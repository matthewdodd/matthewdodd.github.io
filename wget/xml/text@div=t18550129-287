                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Willcocks, of No. 26, Mary-street, Hampstead-road. On Monday, 23rd Oct., my husband wrote a letter to the Great Northern Railway Company, in my presence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Oct. 23rd.

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that neither the letter or the envelope were receivable in evidence, not being brought to the knowledge of the prisoners.</hi> The <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>

               <p>that length of time, and We should be obliged to purchase, the cheapest way would be to have the best—he said that although there was only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. differ<lb></lb>ence in the price, there was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the quality between Wallsend and Silkstones, and he was sorry he did not call before—I said that if he had, and the coals had been the same, he might have had the order—he said, "They would be precisely the same, for I come direct from the railway; I am an agent of the Great Northern Railway Company"—I said that another time if he was passing, and we wanted coals, he should have the order—he said, "Good morning," and went away—on the following Tuesday, 31st Oct., a ton and a half of coals were brought by James Dark, a carman—he brought these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with him—one is an invoice, and the other the vendor's ticket—I paid the carman two guineas—about two hours afterwards I heard some statement, and went to the Railway coal office, and made inquiries, and in consequence of what I heard I went to Bidborough-street, the place named on the ticket which I received—that is in the immediate neighbourhood of the railway—I saw Mrs. King, and as I came away I met King, and asked him who authorised him to send me those coals—I said, "You do not mean to say that I gave you the order last week when you called?"—he paid, "Certainly not; but a young girl, called last evening, and told me to send them"—I said, "I never sent any one to you"—he said, "I certainly received the order, or else I should not have sent them"—I said, "I do not believe that they have come from the railway at all"—he said, "They have, I can assure you, and I should like to see Mr. Willcocks"—I said, "He will be at home this evening at half past 7 o'clock"—he said that he would call at 8 o'clock—I said, "If you do not call, some one shall hall on you"—he said, "You make me laugh," and I left him in the street—he never called—I gave information to the company, and gave a (sample of the coals to Lockerby, the officer, on 28th Nov.—on the second morning after the coals were delivered, Bates came to me and said, "Is Mr. Willcocks at home"; I said, "No, but I am Mrs. Willcocks"—he said, "I have called about some coals from Mrs. King, that were delivered the day before yesterday, and to save any bother about it, Mrs. King has got me to come here to offer to take the coals away"—I said, "I do not think we can allow them to be taken away; we have been to a solicitor about it, and he told us not to let the coals be taken away, or accept of any money"—he said that Mr. King came home the night before beastly drunk, and had broken his arm and damaged his nose; he gave him a dreadful character for drunkenness, and said that it was not out of respect for him, but out of respect for Mrs. King that he came, for he did not wish her to have any trouble with it—he seemed to persuade me very much to let the coals go away—I said that Mr. Willcocks had lost the whole of yesterday, and I could not let the coals go without seeing him, and told him to call again, and I would let him know whether he would let him take them away or not—he went away and came again that evening, and offered 6a. for Mr. Willcocks's loss of time (Mr. Willcocks is a coach wheeler)—I said that it was not likely I should let them go when we should have the lawyer to pay, and the mess of the coals—he said, "I will tell you what I will do, Mrs. Willcocks; I will do it on my own responsibility, I will give you 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as the difference on the coals, which will make 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." (that was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. besides the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—I said, "I do not think we can do it, for the solicitor tells us not to make a compromise in any way; if Mr. Willcocks will agree to it, I will call upon you to-morrow morning"—I knew where he lived; I went</p>

               <p>there to see if I could find out who the carman was, and I went to three. shops to see if I could find out who had done business for King—in the afternoon, after he called on me in the morning, I went into the shop, not knowing it was the same, and Bates came into the shop—it was in Seymour-street, they sold potatoes—I am not certain whether they sold greengrocery—Mr. Willcocks afterwards wrote a letter to Mr. King, and Mrs. King came with a waggon for the coals, but on the previous evening, 27th Nov., Mrs. King and Mr. Bates came—they saw Mr. Willcocks first, he opened the door to them; he is here—they made an arrangement to take the coals away, and Mr. Bates in my presence offered to give Mr. Willcocks 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a difference on the coals—I said that they were very bad, and I had said so before—the name of the coals was not mentioned at all—when I said that they were very bad, Bates said that they were not Wallsend, and he offered 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the difference—my husband said, "What do you want to offer me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for now; you offered me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before?"—he said that Mr. King had been at such a great expense, that he thought Mr. Willcocks might take the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my husband agreed to take it, and he was going to make out a receipt for the money, when Bates said, "No, I must have it written down that it is a compromise, that you will not proceed any further in the case"—Mr. Will<lb></lb>cocks said, no he would not write that—I said, "Take the coals away, I had rather you would do that" he said, "Very well, we will"; and turned round, and said to Mrs. King, "If we take the coals away, they cannot proceed any further"—they said that they would come the next morning at 9 o'clock to take them away, and they did so, and Mrs. King paid 1. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them; that was at the rate of 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton for what was left; we had burned part of them—two carmen took them away, but I do not know them—I could recognise them, they were different men to those that brought them—I have not seen them since—on 2nd Nov. I saw the same man Dark delivering a load of coals at Mr. Veitch's, next door; I called him and had some conversation with him, and I afterwards spoke to Mrs. Veitch on the subject—the sample was taken out on the same day that the coals were taken away—Lockerby came and told us to save a sample, and we did so before the carman took the coals away.</p>

Nov.—I communicated with the Company the same day that the coals came, and about an hour after<lb></lb>wards, when the coals came that we had ordered from the Company—my husband immediately went to the office, and from there to King's house—I did not go with him, I took the coals in; I did not see King after that; his wife called on Saturday morning with a note which my husband had written to King; he had some conversation; she did not pay me any money then—that was nearly a month after, a few days before King was apprehended, when she came accompanied by Bates—she had been twice before wishing us to take money, and we refused; she came with another man, not Bates—the third time she came with Bates, and he was spokesman on behalf of Mr. King—he told my husband and me that King was keeping out of the way—that it was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of King's pocket being out of the way; and he could not make his appearance for fear of being tapped on The shoulder, and being told that he was wanted—he did not say what King was out of the way for—Lockerby had called several times before this—.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 123). I produce samples of coal from Mr. Willcock's, Mr. Eastoe's, and Mr. Veitch's houses—in consequence of directions I received, I went, in the early part of Nov., to No. 28, Bid-borough-street, to apprehend King, but could not find him—I was searching for him from 3rd Nov. to the 30th, when I took him into custody at No. 23, Clarendon-street, Somers-town—I went, on the evening of 5th Dec., to the defendant Bates, with Williams, the inspector of the Great Northern Railway line; he is a constable attached to the railway—it was after King had been taken—I called Bates out of a back room, and Williams produced a printed form, which had been delivered with Mr. Eastoe's coals—Williams asked Bates who gave his foreman that form; Bates said, "I did"—he asked who gave it to him; Bates said, "Mr. King"—he was asked whose writing was on the face of it; he said, "Mine"—Williams said, "Did you write the signature of King?"—he said, "I dare say I did; but it is so long ago, I can scarcely recollect"—Williams then showed him the book, and said, "Who wrote those words, '1 ton, the 26th, before 11 o'clock'?"—he said that he thought that was King's—King then came out of a back room of the house, passed us, and went up the street; he was out on bail at that time—he had been bailed by Bates, I believe—they were not both charged at that time—Bates was not under charge, but he was ultimately sum<lb></lb>moned to attend the Court as a defendant—on Sunday, 26th Nov., I saw Bates in the street—I knew him before—I had been told by another con-stable that he wished to see me—he asked me if I could not assist in settling this affair of King's—I told him that 1 believed the parties had written a letter for the purpose of settling it; but, before that, he told me that if I could do so, I could put 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket; and I was to meet him and Mrs. King the following evening, Monday—next day I went to Mr. Williams, and told him what Bates had. said to me; and whatever I did afterwards, was with the cognizance of Williams—I went to the authorities of Clerkenwell Police Court—I met Bates and Mrs. King' on the Monday evening, and walked with them as far as Mary-street, and saw them go in at Mr. Willcocks' door—I saw them come out again, and Bates said that they could not settle with Mrs. Willcocks, that they had settled with Mrs. Eastoe, and told me that I could have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble—this was all before Bates had been charged—on the evening of 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> Dec., the day after I took King into custody, I saw Bates at his house, No. 42, Seymour-street—he told me that he had advised King to go away, but he thought it would have been better for him</p>

               <p>to have stopped, and that it was a bad job—I forget whether it was that time, but I think it was, that Bates said that he thought it was a case of obtaining money by false pretences; and he said that he should be well defended, and should have a good counsel, one of the best that could be got.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Samuel Hanson, orange-merchant, of Botolph-lane. I know the prisoner. On the Morning of 27th Dec. he came and asked me to lend him an empty chest to carry some books in for a person, and he was to leave his coat in the place of the chest, while he went to do the job—he went for the chest to the first-floor warehouse—he was going through the warehouse, and Packburn called out, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, he has something in the chest"—I said, "Stop him then"—he would not stop—I called out, <hi rend="italic">"Jack"</hi>—he would not stop, but went on—Packburn went after him, but could not find him, and came back—I then went out and saw him in a passage, and the landlady of a public-house ordering him away, saying, she would not have his stolen things there—I insisted on knowing what he had in the chest, and told him to bring it back—he said he would bring it back presently—I said, "I must have it now"—he at last brought it back, and I insisted on knowing what he had taken in the chest—he said he would bring it back presently, he had left it at Epps's Coffee-house—we inquired, and he had not been there—I then went up the yard with him, and asked the landlady to let me look over her place, and I found in a corner this bundle of bags, with some steps over it, and a knot which the prisoner used—he</p>

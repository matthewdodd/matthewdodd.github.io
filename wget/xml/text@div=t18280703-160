               <p>HENRY HADDOCK. I have been at sea three years; I left my vessel, and employed the prisoner to carry a box, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, on the 3d of June; I had not seen him before - he was to carry it to Mr. Pearce, No. 14, Penny-fields, Poplar; I went there the next morning, and it was not there - I saw it at the watch-house the same night; I had paid him before he set off - it would have taken him about an hour to have gone with it.</p>

            . I am a porter. The prisoner lodged a few nights with me; I was at my dinner, and he asked me if I would go and fetch his chest - I said, "Yes, it was my business;" I do not recollect the day - I was to go for it at the Star public-house, Shadwell; we went there, and sat down, and had three pints of beer - he then told me take to this chest to No. 3, Glass-house-street, Rosemary-lane; I was going there, and was stopped - they said, the chest was stolen; I told where I got it, and they took the prisoner.</p>

Dawson was brought to the watch-house on the 3d or 4th of June, with the chest; the prosecutor came and missed a coat and some other things out of it - I was taking the prisoner to the office the next day, and he said he had pawned it; I asked where the duplicate was - he said, he did not know; he told me where it was pawned.</p>

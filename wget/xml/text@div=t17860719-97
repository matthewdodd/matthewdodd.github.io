               <p>Do you know Mrs. Moses? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And Mrs. Abrahams? - By sight; on Thursday last, between five and six, I went into Rag fair with my slippers and things to sell, so Mrs. Moses called me; she said to me, do not you know any thing about Fonseca; I said only that on Saturday he will go and surrender himself; so she said, will you do me a favour, and go to Fonseca, if he will give me some money I will go Holland, for I have a mind to go to Holland and keep out of the way, I am sorry for what I have done; Fonseca said I will not give a farthing.</p>
               <p>Was Abrahams there at the time? - No, she was alone, and it was on Friday, between three and four weeks ago; they both of them called to me in the street; she desired me to call on Sunday, for I want to speak to you something particular; I cannot speak in the street; I did not go then.</p>

The last time she wash'd my wife missed several things. I took the prisoner up, and before the justice I charged her with taking the things mentioned, and she own'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get them again?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. She brought some of them again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she bring again?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. She brought two shifts, a colour'd apron, a white apron, a pair of stockings, three handkerchiefs, and two caps; there were other things which she stole out of the window in the fore kitchen.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment out of the wash, as the cloaths were hanging to dry. I at first accused the girl that lives with me, but she denied it. The next day I sent for the prisoner, and charg'd her with taking them; she own'd it, and said they were in pawn, and that she would get them and send them home again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she wash these things at your house or abroad ?</p>
               <p>E. Wilkins. My servant deliver'd them to her to wash in my own house. I took her before the justice, where she own'd the same. She had before that fetch'd them out and brought them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her you would not prosecute her, if she would confess, and bring them again?</p>
               <p>E. Wilkins. No, I did not, I only put the things in the indictment which she brought home; I have lost more things than I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When I delivered these things to my mistress, she said she never missed any thing after me before, and if I would deliver them to her again she would not hurt me, and I believe it was put up for a month or more.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How long after you knew she stole the goods mention'd, was it that you took her up?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. The goods were stole on the 4th of April, and we took her up the 11th of May.</p>

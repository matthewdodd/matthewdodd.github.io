                  </hi>. I am a clock-maker, and live in St. Andrew's row, New Kent-road—I have known the prisoner for some years. On Christmas eve he brought a customer to my house for a clock, and another on the Monday evening—he asked for a Christmas box—I gave him a German silver chain from a drawer, which I opened—the chain caught against a paper containing money, and four or five half-crowns fell out—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "I wish I had got that money"—I said, I wished I bad some more, there was not much—he came again on the Tuesday with another customer—he bad left me half-a-crown on the first clock—I got nothing more—the customers were to pay 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the clocks, and when they could afford it, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the first clock was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other two 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I was to call on the prisoner's father, where he lodged, for the first instalment—I did not get any thing—he was not at home the first time</p>

               <p>—the second time he told me he did not know the people, except he saw them in the street, and I must go and find them out—I scolded him—on going home, on Thursday evening, in consequence of what was said to me by a lodger, I looked into my drawer, and missed the money stated—(I had seen it safe on Wednesday)—it was in the same drawer I had given him the chain from, in the front-parlour—I had rolled all the money up is the same paper on the Wednesday evening, and placed it at the back of the drawer—Hofmire works in that room for himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clock-maker, and live with Ferderer—we occupy the same room to work in, and pay the rent of the front-parlour between us—I have a bed-room up stairs—I was there the second time the prisoner came, when he asked for a Christmas-box, and heard him say be should like the money very much—on the "Thursday I met him at the end of St. Andrew's-row, about half-past four o'clock—he said, "How do you do?"—I said, "Very well; how is it you have been over here?"—he said, "I want to see Mr. Ferderer very particularly, about <hi rend="italic">them</hi> clocks he sold"—I said, "You have been in our place"—he said, "Yes, Mr. Ferderer is not at home, I will go back with you and wait till he comes home"—the lodger up stairs let us in—I went in, fetched the key from the kitchen, and let him into the workshop—I found the door locked—I lighted the fire, and the prisoner sat down close to the prosecutor's drawer—I knew there was money there—I put the kettle on the fire and began working—a woman in the next room called out to me, "I have got a good fire, if you want to put your kettle on"—so I went into the other room and put it on—I then went up stairs, leaving the prisoner in the work-room—I came down in a few minutes, and found the prisoner at the street-door, ready to go out—I said, "Are you not going to stop till Mr. Ferderer comes home?"—he said, "No, I had rather go to a public-house and have a pint of beer and smoke a pipe, and be back in half an hour"—I said, "If you want some beer I will get you some, you can smoke a pipe here, or you can have tea with me"—he said he had rather go to a public-house, and be back in half an hour—he left about five o'clock, and did not return—Ferderer came in about half-past five—in consequence of what I told him he went to his drawer and missed his money—I had seen the paper containing the money that morning, when I took a gimlet out of the drawer, after Ferderer went out—it had the usual appearance of having money in it—when I went out I shut and locked the workshop—there is no door opens from the workshop to the other room—you must go out into the passage—</p>

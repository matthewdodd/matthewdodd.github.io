                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in Rath bone-place. On the 16th of Sept. the prisoner came to my shop, and said he wanted some watches to show to a customer—he said, "I suppose you know who I am; I come from Jermyn-street; my name is Bruce"—I have had a customer named Bruce, sixteen or twenty years ago, a respectable jeweller, the father of the prisoner—he had lived in Cranbourn-alley—on the 18th he came again, in my absence—I was called down by my shopman, between one and two o'clock—the shopman said he wanted some watches again—the watches were selected, and a bill of parcels made out, but as I came down stairs I made up my mind not to let him have them—I said, "I cannot let you have these watches; I will send them to Jermyn-street"—he insisted on having them—he said he should not keep them long—I said 1 expected a customer who I wanted to show them to—he said he should only be half an hour; he was going to Fitzroy-square, to show them to a customer who was to select one—I was persuaded to let him have them to show his customer—he said he should be back in half an hour—I should not have parted with them for any purpose but for him to show them to a customer—they were worth 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if I had known they were going to be pawned I should not have parted with them.</p>

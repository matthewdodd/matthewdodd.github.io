I am a coal merchant, living in Barking parish, llford—On Wednesday night, 11th April, I lost a quantity of fowls from my yard—they were kept in two hen-houses, one of which was locked, and the other not—I lost some out of both—there were nine stolen and two injured—they were all Hamburgh, except two Spanish—there was not a</p>

I keep a beer-shop at Barking—I know the prisoner—on this night, 11th April, he was at my house when I came home at half-past 9, and he left there at half-past 10—I did not see anything more of him till about twenty minutes to 12, when I heard a knock at the door; I asked who was there; some one said, "Police"—I said, "I will let you in directly"—I opened the door, and found that it was the prisoner there—he asked if <hi rend="italic">"Jumbo"</hi> was there—that is another bargeman—I said no; that he was gone to his barge—he said, "I have got a dozen for him"—he did not say a dozen of what—one of his hands had a little blood on it—he came in the course of the next day and asked me if I would buy a pair—he did not say what, neither did I see anything—I had heard that Mr. Tyler's fowls were lost, and I said, "No"—Mr. Tyler's is about a hundred and fifty yards from me—I had heard in the morning of the robbery—I had not known the prisoner to be a fowl dealer before—I never knew anything wrong of him, except getting a little tipsy, as other men do—he has worked with me along the wharf—he never asked me to buy a pair before—he was tipsy on Thursday morning when he asked me this, and so he was on Wednesday night.</p>

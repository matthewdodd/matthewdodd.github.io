He has been under my charge since the 22nd October—his memory is very much impaired by the injury; he scarcely knows the nature of passing events—an attack of paralysis came on on the 29th October—five days afterwards one side of his body was then paralysed—he was unconscious a day or two previous, and his memory has been defec<lb></lb>tive ever since—on the 28th he was delirious, and on the 29th slightly so, and then we found that he was paralysed on one side—I was present on 26th October, when his evidence was taken before the Magistrate.</p>

She was always a jealous sort of woman. I saw her draw, her knife from her pocket; she always carries one with her. I cannot swear what she said. She stabbed me three times, and once under the ear, the most dangerous place she could hit me. She is a vio<lb></lb>lent woman, and always fighting.

I am a tailor, of 7, Long's Buildings, White Cross Street—on 34th October 1 went with the prisoner and prosecutor to their son's place in Chiswell Street—we had three half-quarterns of rum there, and then went to a public-house in White Cross Street and had some drink—the prisoner and her husband had some angry words in the public-house, but they were not quarrelling much—I said to the prisoner "Will you come up to McCarthy's house and have some beer," that is a private house in White Cross Street—we went up a court and I left them and went to tell</p>

               <p>McCarthy that they were coming—I have often heard the prisoner say that she would do for him—I heard a cry and went down and saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor at the bottom of Long's Buildings in the arms of several men bleeding—the prisoner was not there then.</p>

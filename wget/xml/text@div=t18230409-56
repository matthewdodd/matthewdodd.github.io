On the 11th of March, between nine and ten o'clock at night. I was sitting in a little back room; nobody was in the shop; I heard a noise of glass falling,; I then went in and saw a man's hand inside the window; he had hold of a cheese. I called Stop thief! I saw the cheese go out of the window in the man's hand; there were two candles in the shop, one stood near the window, and the other at the end of the shop. I saw his face as I went towards the door distinctly. I opened the inner shop door leading into the passage, but when I came to the street door, I found it tied with a cord, so that I could not immediately open it. I gave it three sudden jerks, and the gimblet which fastened it gave way. I ran out with a stick, and in about an hour I met him in Church-street, going into the King's Head, public-house. I said nothing, but sent an officer to take him. I missed the two other pieces of cheese from the window; when I returned, after he was taken. I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is there a door dividing the parlour from the shop - A. Yes; but it was open. I saw his face distinctly, when I ran into the shop, both the shop candles reflected a light in the window - six of them go to a pound.</p>

            . I live in Collingwood-street, Bethnal-green. I was passing on the opposite side of the street to the prosecutor's shop, about five minutes past nine o'clock, and saw three men standing there - one of them stood at the prosecutor's door, one at the middle of the window, and the other on the other side of it. As I passed, the one who stood at the middle of the window, turned round, and looked at me - I went on. I know none of them.</p>

            . My aunt keeps the King's Head, public-house, Church-street, Bethnal-green. I was in bed when the prisoner was taken at our house; he came in about six o'clock, and remained there till a little before eight o'clock - there is a clock in the tap-room, where he was, but not in the parlour. He came in again about a quarter past eight o'clock, and remained till twenty minutes or half-past nine, went out, and returned a little before ten, and was in the tap-room when I went to bed. I am certain of the time, as I look at the clock to see when to take out my beer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he was in the tap-room at first - A. Yes, and in the parlour afterwards. Some men were in his company; a man, a plaisterer, went out, and returned with him the second and last time.</p>

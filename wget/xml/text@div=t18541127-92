                  </hi>. I live at Roland Castle, Hampshire. At the end of July last, I came to lodge at the house of the female prisoner, Tulse-place, Tanner's-hill, Deptford—I had known the prisoner, her husband, and the family, for nearly thirty years, and at the time I took lodgings, she and her husband were living in the house—the male prisoner lodged there also—no other person was lodging there—I took my goods, a large quantity; a bed, bedstead, a chest of drawers, and a variety of other articles—on 14th Aug. I had occasion to go into Hampshire, and left my lodging for that purpose—I</p>

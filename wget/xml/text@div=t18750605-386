I am assistant to Mr. Higginbotham, an auctioneer—on the 19th May last I bought this piece of silk—in September I gave it to Burns to pledge for me and he brought me the ticket from Mr. Beswick—I have not the slightest doubt about this being the piece, it was catalogued at 15 yards and I paid for 14 3/4, which is an unusual length—there is one of the edges where it had been tied with a thin bit of twine—I have a great quantity of silk in my charge.</p>

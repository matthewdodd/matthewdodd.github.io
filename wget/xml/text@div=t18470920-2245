                  </hi> I am the wife of john Spencer, of Larkhall-rise, Clapham. The prisoner was in my service—I gave her notice to leave on the 22nd of Sept.—I had given her a character for another place that morning—I had no idea that she was dishonest, except in petty things—the same afternoon I went into her bedroom with a friends, who took up her comb-bag—the prisoner was not there, she was down stairs—we found in it two tooth-brushes, and a nail-brush with "15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." marked on it—the private mark was erased—I could see that it had been there at the time but the mark and price is rubbed off now—I am able to swear they are my husband's—they were never sold—I called the prisoner</p>

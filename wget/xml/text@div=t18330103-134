On the 4th of January the prisoner came to my shop and asked to look at a fancy ring - I took a tray from the window with rings in it, and put it on the counter; she asked to see some pearl rings - I put a case of them on the counter; she selected one at 15s.; I turned round to wrap it in a piece of paper, and, on turning again, she said, "I will leave you one shilling on this ring and call again;" she went out of the shop directly, and I immediately missed a ring off the counter - I rang the bell and my young man came down; I followed her down the street about ten doors, and charged her with taking the ring off the counter; she denied it - I said she must come back with me - I said I must search her; she said, "Don't do that;" she took her hand out of her pocket with her handkerchief in it, and laid the ring on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the meaning of leaving a shilling? A. She left 1s. and I was to keep the ring till she called for it - I did not say it would be better to give up the ring.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 19.</p>

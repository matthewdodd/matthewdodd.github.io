                  </hi>. I deal in hay, and live at Great Stanmore. On the night of the 17th of Feb. I lost two fowls—I saw them safe on the morning of the 17th—they could go about the premises, and roosted in the privy—Barnfather showed me some feathers, which are like the feathers of the fowls.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's daughter. I have seen some feathers—they resembled those of the fowls—I do not swear to them—I had fed the fowls about four o'clock on Saturday evening, and they went to roost in the privy.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 267.) I went with the prosecutor to Joseph Stanborough's lodgings in Oldchurch-street, Great Stanmore, about half-past twelve o'clock on the 18th—I found Hannah there, and Joseph was outside with the prosecutor—I apprehended him, and told him it was on sus<lb></lb>picion of stealing Blakeby's fowls—he said he knew nothing about them—I went into the house, and saw Hannah—I asked her to show me her room—she took me to an upstairs room, and there was no fire-place—I asked her what she had got for dinner—she said, "Nothing"—I asked her where she cooked it when she had any—she asked me, why, did I think she had got the fowls?—I said, I did not know—we came down, and went into another room, where there was a large fire and kettle—I asked her what was in it—she said, beef, potatoes, dumplings, and carrots—she took out the beef—I said, was that all?—she said, "Yes"—I found the greater part of the fowls in it—I took Joseph inside, and found some feathers in his bosom, and in the room I found some more feathers, corresponding with them—I then went back to the house—Hannah said she knew nothing of the fowls, but she had found them on the table, and her son said, when she asked whose they were,"Never mind, they are mine"—I traced feathers from their house nearly a mile to<lb></lb>wards the prosecutor's—he said one fowl was a small one, and one an old hen—the necks I have here exactly correspond with that description.</p>

I had seen him come down the street about five o'clock that evening, with Mrs. Langford; he tried Langford's door, and could not get it open; he then came from the door to the window shutters, and forced them open, threw up the window, jumped in, and was in the house about three minutes; he then came out, leaving the shutters and windows open, and ran up the street as fast as he could.

            ; we live in Shacklewell-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. On the 29th of August, about five o'clock, the prisoner came home with me. I had some silk up stairs, tied in a handkerchief, and put in an old bag. While he was there I said,</p>
               <p>"I will go up stairs and look after my property." I had known him a long time. He did not go up with me, nor did I bring the silk down, or say any thing about it; but he knew we had silk, as we get our living by it. About half-past eight I said I would go to my husband's club, to see if he was coming home. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You go outside, mistress, and put the shutters too, and I will fasten them." I left him inside the house, to fasten the shutters; he came out, and I locked the door, and went to my husband's club - he went away. I was fetched home by my neighbours about a quarter before nine, and found the window shutter was broken open, and the window shoved up, which was shut when I went out. I missed the silk, which was left with me to wind. I have to pay for it all; there were eight knots, weighing nine ounces and a half, and are charged to me by my employer 28 s. 6 d. I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who took you off the tap-room table drunk, at half-past nine o'clock, and led you home drunk - A. I was not in liquor; he did not lead me home, but ran down the street as fast as he could. I was at the Green Gate, public-house, for five minutes, and went from thence to the Black Dog, for my husband; but I had been home with the prisoner before that.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Langford; I saw the prisoner come home with Mr. Langford between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and Mrs. Langford came home in about ten minutes; they afterwards all went out together, and about eight o'clock in the evening the prisoner came home with Mrs. Langford. He came to me for a light - I gave him a candle and candlestick. He said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Langford, go out and shut the shutters, and I'll fasten them;" which she did, and he fastened them, to the best of my knowledge. She then went in, and they both came out together. I cannot say she was properly sober; she had drank a little. I saw them fasten the door and go up the street together; and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, he came down the street alone; he tried the door and found it fast; he then opened the window shutters, threw up the sash, and got into the room; he remained there three or five minutes. I and Dawson watched him, and saw him get out, leaving the shutters and windows open, and run away. After that he returned again with Mrs. Langford, and she said,</p>

               <p>"My God, the shutters and windows are open;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know they are; for I came back to the place, thinking it was not safe, and I thought I heard somebody on the premises, and could not get in at the door; so I got in at the window, and finding nobody there, I came away again." He went away - I saw no more of him till the Monday, when the officer brought him to Langford's. I am sure he is the man - I had seen him three times in the course of the day. I asked why he did not fasten the shutters and window? he said, because he was frightened, and thought they might think he had robbed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where did I go to after getting out of the window - A. To the Black Dog. He leant over the bar door and said to the landlady,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Stokes, I wish you would go up to Langford, and tell him to come down, for his house is open; and if anything is a miss, I am afraid he may think it is me." This was after Mrs. Langford had come home.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, the 2d of September, with another man, at the corner of Flower Pot-alley, Bethnal-green. I found nothing on him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I understand you have information against me." I said, Yes. He said he knew nothing of the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I was informed that night that Langford said I had robbed him, and I was willing to go with you - A. Yes; he well knew I should not let him go; for I had been after him ever since the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I declare before the face of Almighty God, that I am innocent of the charge. I was at the Green Gate, public house, on the 30th of August; the prosecutor and his wife came and sat in the same box, and observed that they had known me from a child, and I had worked for them when young; I drank with them, and went with them to the Black Dog, and sat drinking till Langford said he was tired and sleepy; they asked me to see them home, which I did. Mrs. Langford said she was going out, and told me to call Langford about eight o'clock, to go to his club; I went away and returned at that time, when I found the shutters open; and went to the Black Dog and told him his place was not safe. He seemed to take no notice. I went down, and found Mrs. Langford asleep on the taproom table. I took her home, got a light, and asked her if all was safe. I heard no more till Monday night, when I saw Gibbs, and was agreeable to go any where. I went to the watch-house without being collared.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

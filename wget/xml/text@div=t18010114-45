            . This shirt and neckcloth are mine, I know them by the mark P B. I had not missed them, nor have not examined my linen since, but I know them to be mine by the mark; the prisoner had been at our house that evening that he was taken, to collect the pots from the men, about seven o'clock; the linen is kept in my mother's room; I never saw him in any room except the shop and the cutting room, which are both up stairs.</p>
               <p>John Brewer. I know this to be my shirt by the mark upon it, which I made myself with permanent ink; it is the only one I ever marked in that way, and I had missed it; I can swear to my father's shirt by the size and the mark, and my mother's stockings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Wednesday morning I was going for orders for tea as usual, at Mr. Brewer's, and there was a man sweeping Mr. Brewer's door, who asked me if I would buy these things of him; I did buy them of him, I gave him three shillings which I had for my boxing-money; I went up stairs, and got orders for the tea, with a bundle in my hand; I went home, and told the orders that I received, and I went in the evening to the same house after I had cleaned myself, with the stockings on, and one of the shirts, I did not take any notice of the marks; and one day as I was coming down stairs, the maid asked me where I got these stockings from; I said, they were not her's; she said, I must come to her mistress; I went, and Mrs. Brewer told me they were her's, and I must pull them off; I told Mrs. Brewer if these stockings were her's, I had got more things that were marked the same; she said, yes, there were some shirts, she believed; I said, yes, there were, and they took me up.</p>

On the 21st of April I went to bed about eleven o'clock - the family had not then all come home; I sleep in the attick. I was disturbed between two and three o'clock by hearing a scuffling on the stairs. My young men who slept on the same floor awoke me. Mr. Stokes, who lodges on the second floor, came up to me naked, and in great alarm, and said he had had a scuffle with thieves. I came down stairs, and let in the watchman and people who had assembled about the house; then went to examine the house, and found a desk in the parlour wrenched open, and a metal watch taken out - a silk handkerchief was taken from my hat, which was on the sideboard. I missed from the kitchen closet, a silver tea pot, seventeen spoons, a pepper box, and a pair of sugar tongs, which were all silver and worth 10 l. 10 s., together. I found all this property at Mr. Platt's house, and knew it to be mine. I saw Harrington's coat at Bow-street - he is my apprentice.</p>

            . I am a clergyman of the Establishment, and lodge on the second floor of Mr. Russell's house. I came home about eleven o'clock, the street door was then closed. I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and about three I was between asleep and awake, and saw four men in my room standing near my bed; my sitting room door was open, and they stood in a row - they told me to be quiet, and threatened if I did not to shoot me. I am not quite certain but think I saw one pistol. One of them asked who the landlord was, I said nothing; then they left one as guard over me, and I thought he had a pistol - I kept my eyes nearly shut during the time. The other three went into my sitting room - I waited a few minutes, and then gave a sudden spring on the man, and cried out most lustily; he and I had a struggle across the sitting room, to the stair case, I then gave him a push and sent him down stairs; then went up to Mr. Russell and informed him. I believe the other three ran down stairs, for I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man who was guard over you, any light so that you could distinguish his features - A. I think I saw them standing with a candle in one of their hands. I cannot speak to any certainty, whether either of the prisoners are the men. A gold watch, with three gold seals, and a gold chain, worth about 10 l. together was taken from a little table in my bed-room; also a pair of spectacles and a silk handkerchief. I saw the watch and appendages in an hour or two in the hands of Mr. Fitch. I saw the handkerchief at Bow-street, but have not found the spectacles. I saw the prisoners at the watch-house, and from the voice of

I found the office window on the ground floor, at the back of the house open - a pane of glass was broken, which was whole when I went to bed; nearly the whole pane was out - I am sure the window was shut down when I went to bed, and half the shutter shut. When I was alarmed I found all the shutters up and the window up; it looks into the back yard. I had a gold watch, with two gold seals, and a key, worth about 7 l., which was stolen; it hung up over the kitchen dresser; I had shut the kitchen door when I went to bed.

            . I am a watchman. I heard rattles spring - Mr. Russell's door was open. I went in and found no thieves there - I found the back office window up, went to the watch-house for assistance, returned and went into Boswell-court; I came out again, and Mr. O'Collins gave Davis in my charge; I took him to the watch-house, he was without his hat - it was a wet night, his clothes appeared dry; he could not have been out long. Desmond was brought to the watch-house in about a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Shire-lane, and Temple Bar. At three o'clock I heard the rattle spring - I came down Carey-street, and heard a scuffle in the two pair of stairs of Russell's house; I stopped at the door, a gentleman put his head out of window and called out thieves! I sprung my rattle, and remained at the street door, and in a short time heard the chain of the door drop, it opened a little way, and I saw the glimpse of three mens faces - I up with my stick and said,</p>
               <p>"If either of you attempt to come out I will knock your brains out;" I made a blow at them. They closed the door in my face, and broke my stick. Thomas a watchman came up; I called to the people within to let me in, and in ten or twelve minutes Mr. Russell met me in; Thomas followed me in; we saw the office window open - I heard a rumbling of men in Mr. Oddy's yard, which is enclosed by New-court wall, it has a door leading into the court which was fast. More watchman came up, and I placed them in New-court to prevent an escape that way. Thomas and I called to the private watchman to open the gates of New Boswell-court, and we two (only) went in. We knocked at Mr. Oddy's door and were let in by the servant; we searched in the lower part of the house, but found nobody; we then went into his yard, which the office looks into, and found a silk hat near the window of Mr. Russell's house; it has not been claimed by any person belonging to the house - it was given to Davis at Bow-street to try on, and appeared too small - he said it was not his. We then gained admission into Mr. Platt's house, who has a window looking into the yard; we went through a back door into the yard, and found Desmond in the yard; he said,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I deliver myself up to you;" he had no shoes on - he was not known at Mr. Platts. I then asked who were his associates; or thieves with him; he said no person but himself - I said I knew there must be more for I saw three faces in Mr. Russell's house - he still said there was none but himself; I delivered him over to a watchman to take to the watch-house - I then went back to make further search, and after day light found five table, nine tea, and three salt spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs, all silver, on the tiles of an outhouse of Mr. Platt's house, Mr. Russell claimed them. I found six picklock keys of different sizes with them; also two skeleton keys, (one of them broken); a large door key and another small key. As I returned from lodging Desmond at the watch-house, Davis was delivered to me; he was searched at the office, and nothing was found about him.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is opposite Mr. Russell's. I have heard Quennell's account, it is correct. We found the picklock keys on the tiles of the wash-house, and the spoons. I found in the same place a pistol loaded with powder only; no ball or slugs, and a phosphorus box; also two handkerchiefs, one of which Mr. Stokes claimed, and 
               <persName id="t18220417-139-person1360">Russell</persName>
             the other, and also the plate. In Oddy's yard I found a hat. Oddy's servant gave me a coat, a silver tea pot, and a pair of shoes. Russell claimed the tea pot as his own, and the coat as his apprentice's. Desmond had no shoes, and I lent him these to walk to the watch-house, and to Bow-street - they appeared rather too small; he walked with the heels down. Another pair of shoes, and a small iron crow were found in Mr. Stokes's room. I found two chisels with the spoons, and in the yard a dark lantern.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was alarmed at the watch-house a little after three o'clock, and went to Mr. Russell's. Desmond was given into my charge without any shoes. Fitch delivered me the gold and metal watches.</p>
               <p>MR. STOKES. When I went to bed my sitting-room door was shut. I found it open after the struggle. I found a pair of shoes, a hat, and an iron crow in my bedroom, which were not there when I went to bed. I found my writing desk forced open, but nothing taken out.</p>

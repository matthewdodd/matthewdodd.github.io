                  </hi>. On the 20th of February, 1834, the prisoner called at my house—I had seen him before—I am positive he is the per<lb></lb>son—he brought a man with him—he ordered a dozen of port, then a gallon of brandy, then some spruce, and half-a-dozen of champagne—while I was getting them from the cellar, the prisoner and the other man began packing them in the basket which he brought—the young man was taking them off—I said, "I can't go from my agreement," which was to to have the money there and then—the prisoner said, "Oh, I will pay you make out your bill," and he shook up his pockets—I proceeded to do so—the porter took the goods off—the prisoner stood in front of my place in conversation, and all on a sudden he went off, and I saw him Do more till the beginning of this month—I pointed him out in Guildhall—I have got none of my goods since.</p>

I want my money"—I could have stopped the porter going, but my suspicions were lulled—I let him go, supposing the prisoner would pay me in ready money—I am certain they were all taken in one day there can be no mistake about that—I was making the entry in the book—I know of no bill being made out—I generally make out bills of ready money transactions, and receipt them—I believe I know my daughter's hand-writing—this bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)<hi rend="italic">-is</hi> nothing like my daughters hand-writing—I do not believe it to be her writing at all—I have my</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellowship porter, and was so 1834. I never saw the prisoner but twice—the first time was at the beginning of 1834 a person named Smith introduced me to him—he desired me to come to him at the Three Tuns public-house, to fetch some wine or something in bot<lb></lb>tles, to take it to Shepperton-street, New North Road—I took some on two occasions there for the prisoner—on those occasions I saw the prisoner at Mr. Gardner's—once he was in the parlour, and once in the front of the bar he wrote me directions where the wine was to go—I do not know what became of those directions—I left them with the wine—on the first occasion took a dozen of wine, and on the second, a dozen in a small hamper, and I think some more in a parcel—I do not know that the prisoner assisted on either occasion in packing the wine—Mr. Gardner was behind the bar on both occasions—he did not ask me any questions—he must have seen me pass with the wine, I think—I did not run—I walked away—on the last occasion I saw the prisoner in the parlour—I suppose he was taking a</p>

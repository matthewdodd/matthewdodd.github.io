I am landlord of the Oxford Stores, 315, Strand—on Sunday morning the 2nd April I was rung up by the police, when I came down I found the prisoner in custody—I recognised him as having been in my service six weeks or two months before—this table cloth is mine—it was taken from the breakfast room where the man made his entrance, I expect; where the window was open.</p>

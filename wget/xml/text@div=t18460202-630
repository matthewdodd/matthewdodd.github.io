                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Finch—we did live in Church-street, Woolwich—on the 10th of Jan. I had a pair of flannel trowsers inside the shop—I placed them there at ten o'clock in the morning—I did not miss them till the officer brought them about twelve o'clock—these that are pro<lb></lb>duced correspond in every way with the drawers I placed there, but the ticket is taken off them—they are new ones—when the officer brought them I found there were no drawers hanging where I had placed these.</p>

I was in High-street, Woolwich—I stopped the prisoner with this pair of drawers under his jacket—I asked him where he got them—he gave me no answer—in going to the station he said he picked them up in the gutter, and then he said he took them out of a shop next to a baker's, and near the Dock-yard—the prosecutor's is near the Dock-yard, and next to a baker's.</p>

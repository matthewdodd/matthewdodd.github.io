               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Whaley. The prisoner came to my house about three quarters after seven that evening, and brought a man to be measured for a pair of breeches; I took him and the man to the Magpye alehouse, and we all staid there till half after nine in the evening; they said they were then going to the other end of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was before eight when he came?</p>
               <p>Whaley. Yes, I am sure it was a quarter before eight or better; he was not out of my sight a minute except to make water.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear he was taken?</p>
               <p>Whaley. The next Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you recollect the night?</p>
               <p>Whaley. It was Saturday night, and I keep shop open late that night. I buy and sell breeches; I am not a breeches maker, my partner is.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. What night was you robbed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Saturday the 10th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to the time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, it was eight o'clock; it was not five minutes more or less.</p>

               <p>Did you see any blows? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the woman say, the villain has struck me? - No, she said, would you strike me? and he said, I did not strike you.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Godfrey come up before you shut your door? - Yes; I saw all that passed before Mrs. Godfrey came up.</p>

               <p>How soon after that he knocked at the door of the deceased; did you open your door? - I opened it directly, but I opened it again when Mrs. Godfrey came up.</p>

               <p>Have you any reason to believe at the time you opened your door, there had been any blows struck? - No, not the least in the world, I never heard any blow struck; I have no notion how she came by her death; she was very a few well minutes before; she was very much enraged, and in a great passion, and was very weak; she had lain in about six weeks before; she was very week and poorly.</p>
               <p>How soon after he went down did she begin to complain? - After he was gone down, I heard the child cry in the room, and I went in, and she was gone down stairs, into the one pair of stairs; there was only the children in the room; then about five or six minutes I heard the youngst baby cry very much indeed; and I looked out, and her room door was shut, and I opened her room door, and the deceased was leaning against the back of the chair, with one hand to her head, and the little child in her lap, like to fall off her knee; I took the child off her knee; and I said, oh, dear me, the woman is in a fit.</p>

               <p>They had a commence about a pot of beer ten or fifteen minutes before I went up; I went up by order of my mistress, and he had her by the right breast with his right hand, and his other hand up to strike at her; I asked him the reason he was going to strike her; he said no, she owed him for a pot of beer, and he would have the money before he went out of the room, and I told him it was the next room that owed him for the pot of beer, and not her; he said he insisted upon it, he took the beer into the room, and set it upon the table; I asked him if it was not a lusty gentlewoman that took it from him upon the stairs; he said, yes; I knocked at the room door adjoining, and Mr. Edwards came out, and told us it was him that owed for the pot of beer, and his wife came and looked over his shoulder; and Mrs. Godfrey then immediately came up and insisted he should go down, or she would push him down; that he should not use her lodgers ill; he said he would be paid for the beer before he went out of the place; and Mrs. Godfrey insisted on his going down, and she pushed him down, and he told her on the stairs that he would serve her as he had done the other, if she did not let him alone; I saw no blows at all.</p>
               <p>You say he had hold of her breast? - He had hold of her breast; his hand was upon her breast pushing against her to get out of her apartment.</p>

               <p>I did not know the deceased in her lifetime; the coroner and his jury sent a request that I would come and examine the body, it was the evening after the day of her death, in that space of time there can be very little room for any great alteration by putrefaction; I could not observe the least marks of any injury externally; I ordered the head to be shaved, supposing I might have found something there, but there was not the least mark of injury or mischief thereabouts, or her breast or neck; but upon examination in the internal parts, (I will not trouble you with every part we examined, it is not necessary) but in the head there was considerable mischief, so that it is not at all to be wondered at that she died so soon; in the brain there was a very considerable extravasation of blood; there had been a rupture of some small vessels, they had discharged their contents, and a great deal of this blood was diffused through the brain; no where else did I observe any injury at all, except a general appearance of weakness, such as might have been expected from a woman who had lately laid-in.</p>
               <p>I suppose these ruptures proceed from numberless causes? - A variety of causes, it might arise from violent anger, sudden fear, and a plethora might produce it; there are frequent instances of people that die suddenly from such causes; I believe my deposition was pretty much to that effect; it was like an apoplexy, if it was not quite so.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, there wanted nothing but the authority of a gentleman of the profession, to satisfy us about that, which I think the whole course of the evidence sufficiently points out, which is, that this woman came by her death from a sudden eruption of the blood vessels, which her emotion with this pot-boy occasioned; the death happening in that way, it is impossible to carry the consequences of this boy's misconduct to such an extent, as to impute that rupture to him: we cannot measure the effect that impertinent behaviour will have on different constitutions, so as to make it a crime of one degree in a boy to affront a person of a strong constitution, who does not care a farthing for him, and of another degree to affront another person whose spirits are all in an uproar at his behaviour; that is a refinement which cannot be admitted into the definition of crimes; so that upon the whole, I think it is impossible for us to say, that this woman came by her death by the hands of this boy; therefore we cannot examine into the crime of this boy, as both the charges against him presuppose that he was the cause of her death, though his impertinent behaviour was the thing that did lead to this unhappy end.</p>

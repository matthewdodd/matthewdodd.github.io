                  </hi> I am terasurer of the Society of British Artists, which was incorporated last year. I have been treasurer since then—we have a gallery in Suffolk-street, Pall-mall—artists and their paintings there to be exhibited and sold—we have fixed terms on which we receive them—we sell them at five per cent. commission to out-door artists; that is, those who are not members of the Art-Union, and two and a half per cent. for those who are—a great number of paintings are sent for sale—the prisoner was employed by the society—the secretary employs the servants, the prisoner received his instructions from him—I do not recollect whether the terms of his engage<lb></lb>ment were sent to him in writing—I understood there was a written agree<lb></lb>ment; that a letter was sent to him from the secretary to employ him—he was employed as a servant—the minutes of the society are entered in a book—the secretary generally makes those entries—I do not know whether any instructions were communicated to the prisoner, except what are in this book—I understood the secretary had given him instructions—there are no printed rules connected with the prisoner's duty—he received his instructions from the society—he was employed in the gallery, during last season, for the sale of pictures—I saw him sell pictures from time to time—the price of these pictures would be entered by him in a book—I know of his selling pictures in the gallery during last season—he would enter the sale of those pictures in the books kept by the Art-Union Society—this is the price catalogue (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—it is in the prisoner's writing—No. 308 is "A Rock Scene, near Simon's Yat, in Monmouthshire," by J. Tennant; it is booked in the catalogue, in the prisoner's writing, fifty guineas—No. 563 in the printed catalogue is, "The First Venture," by W. Shayer; the price of it in the price catalogue, in the prisoner's writing, is thirty-five guineas—No. 435 in the printed catalogue is, "A Scene on Sevenoaks Common after a Storm," by Henry Boddington; the price of it, in the prisoner's writing, is thirty-five guineas—this other book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the register of works sold—No. 308 is "A Rock Scene, near Simon's Yat, in Monmouthshire," purchased by A. Boetefeur, Esq.; the prize in the Art-Union—it does not say the amount—No. 563, "The First Venture," by W. Winter, Esq., prize in the Art-Union—No. 435, "Scene on Sevenoaks Common after a Storm," by H. Hillier, Esq.; a prize in the Art-Union—this other book is a register of what the works are sold at—it is in the prisoner's writing in this book—No. 308 is, "J. Tennant—Rock Scene, near Simon's Yat, in Monmouthshire; 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission, at two and a half per cent."—this commission was due to the society for the sale of this picture—No. 563 is, "W. Shayer—The First Venture;" entered at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—No. 435 is, "Henry Bodding<lb></lb>ton—A Scene on Sevenoaks Common after a Storm;" entered 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., com<lb></lb>mission, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these are the entries of the prices at which the pictures are paid to be sold—I, as treasurer, receive from the prisoner the amounts which</p>

               <p>he states to have received on these pictures—I received only these amounts—this is the ledger kept also by the prisoner—it contains the entries he has made with reference to these sales—here is "Received balance of No. 308, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that means that the purchaser paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than the Art-Union was to pay—the price the Art-Union was to pay for it is not down in the ledger—at No. 563 here is "Received balance, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—No. 435 does not appear down—the prisoner paid these sums over to me as treasurer, and these are the only sums I received in respect of these pictures—this check (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) has never been paid to me by the prisoner—here is the prisoner's writing on the back of it—I saw it once before in the hands of the solicitor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you got any book which is sent forth to the public as denoting the price at which the pictures are sold?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know that it appears in book No. 3, and that it goes forth to the public that the pictures sell at a larger price than they are marked at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Turn to 192, and tell and whether the picture was not first put in at 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, afterwards sold for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then entered in the book as sold for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is entered, "J. Woolmer, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is the price fixed by the artist as the price of the picture—in the register of works sold, No. 192 does not appear at all—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner here pointed it out to the witness</hi>)—here is No. 192, the picture was put in at 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it appears to have been sold at 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in book No. 3—the commission on it is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the Art-Union Catalogue? (<hi rend="italic">producing it.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; these cata<lb></lb>logues are published by the return made from the catalogue of the Art-Union—I imagine they take the prices of the pictures from the price-catalogues; and there 192 appears to be sold at 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no book of ours which would enable the catalogue to state that it sold for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think either of the gentlemen are here who put in these pictures—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is Mr. Hassetts' writing—he was the former secretary—the present secretary is Mr. Flint—he is not here—I believe none of the artists are here whose pictures the prisoner is alleged to have sold, and as to the sale of which he is alleged to have pout any money into his pocket—I am an artist—I think I painted two or three years ago, a picture, which I called "The Head of a Greek Boy"—I cannot recollect to whom I sold it—I think I have heard of a gentleman of the name of Bone, of Devonport—I might have sold it to him for seventeen guineas—it was sold in the gallery, to my knowledge—I do not recollect that I sold it over again, not the same picture, it is a common prac<lb></lb>tice to make a copy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in point of fact, send a copy to Mr. Bone, and send the original to the second purchaser? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been the case, if they are painted by the same hand—I acted according to custom—I did it deli<lb></lb>berately—I think the second was the best of the two—the picture the first gentleman bought, he saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not sell to him a picture he saw, for seventeen guineas, after<lb></lb>wards sell the same picture to another man for ten guineas, and send Mr. Bone a copy, which you painted afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was painted at the same time, I consider, or thereabout—I may have painted a picture which I put in the Society for sale, and sold it to Mr. Bone for seventeen guineas, and afterwards sent it to a second purchaser for ten guineas; and afterwards painted another for the original, which I sent to Mr. Bone—I think it was so—at the last season, for 1847, I sold a picture to Sir Thomas Phillips, for ten guineas—I had another picture in the society at the same time, called "Dividing the Spoil," priced at 200 guineas—Sir Thomas Phillips agreed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184802280056"></xptr>
               <p>for that—I had not received the money for the first picture of the Greek boy before I transferred it to another customer—I do not think I received a deposit on it—I do not recollect it—I had received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Sir Thomas Phil<lb></lb>lips on the small picture—I contracted to sell him the large one for 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he sent to me afterwards to ask me to take it back, as it was not conve<lb></lb>nient for him to pay for it—I did not afterwards go to the prisoner and ask him to alter the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit which I had received for the 10<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> picture, to the other picture, that I might enforce the sale of it—I merely asked whether the 2<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> could not be considered a deposit for the two pictures—that might be after Sir Thomas Phillips wanted to be off his bargain—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner whether he did not receive it for the two pictures—I considered it was on them—this letter contains the terms and conditions on which the prisoner was appointed to his office—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>,"He shall immediately communicate to any artist whose work are for sale, any offer that may be made of a price less than that inserted in the price-catalogue, and act on their instructions as to the sale of such works." "Sir,—On the other side I forward you a sketeb of the duties to be required of you for the office of keeper; you will perhaps be kind enough to produce the same at your next visit to the gallery on Monday next, should the members wish you to read the same before them")—the artists regulate the price of their own pictures; though they are put in at any price, the artist may reduce it to what he likes—one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being sold for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is an unusual instance—there was a picture put for 150 guineas, and sold 80 guineas—if a picture at 100 guineas sells for 20 guineas, with the consent of the artist, the society is only entitled to commission on what it is sold for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this letter, is this the prisoner's writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it refers to Shayer's picture, No. 563—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"My dear Sir, I have only just time to congratulate you on anther of your pictures being added to✗ the sold list, No.563; '<hi rend="italic">The First Venture,' for</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Yours always, <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD WRIXON.</hi>") It is a common thing for artists to make copies of their pictures—it is constantly done—the Greek's head, other picture, were the same size—there might be a little difference in value—Sir Thomas Phillips bought two pictures the same morning—I understood he paid a de<lb></lb>posit of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I consulted my solicitor, and in consequence of what he said, I inquired whether I could enforce the sale of the two pictures.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the sale of pictures, is it customary for artists to meet at the institution with the prisoner, and send for cards and wine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was introduced by the prisoner, but I did not approve of it—it was objected to—it was joined in by other members—I have joined in it myself.</p>

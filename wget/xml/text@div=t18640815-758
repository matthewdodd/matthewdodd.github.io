In November last I was on duty, and heard a noise of people quarrelling on Stamford-hill—I crossed over, and saw the three prisoners—I asked them to go quietly—it was then a quarter before 12 o'clock—Samuel Bowman said, "Who the b——y hell are you?"—I was in uniform—I told him I was a policeman, and that he would not be allowed to make that disturbance—he said, "I will knock your two. Eyes into one, you b——y sod, if you touch me"—Drage said, "That we were all a set of b——y thieves, and only joined the police to rob people"—they went</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to this indictment—I have known Randall ten years—he has been a porter at different places—on 18th February I was in the employ of Messrs. Yeatman and Co., hosiers, Regent Street—I left there, and Randall knew I had left and that I was out of work—I saw him frequently—I saw him three or four weeks after I left, it might be more—I told him I was going to the city to get some goods, and asked him to go with me, and we went—he went with me on more than</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060031"></xptr>
               <p>one occasion—we went to Tucker's, in Wood Street, and got some Car<lb></lb>digan jackets—Randall stopped outside—we pawned the things we got—sometimes I would pawn them and sometimes Randall would, at different places—I remember going to Messrs. Morley's and getting six merino shirts—Randall was not with me then, he was in work—I saw Randall about a fortnight before I was taken—Randall went with me to the city I should say about half a dozen times, perhaps more—I have seen these pawn tickets before (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—very likely I pawned more than half of them—I kept the tickets in my possession, and Randall used to give me his, but I afterwards gave them all back to him—we spent the money got from the pawnbrokers between us—we lodged together at a coffee-house—we had our meals together—sometimes I paid and sometimes he did—I know these tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they refer to merino shirts and Cardigan jackets—I cannot say where I got the shirts from—I signed in Messrs. Morley's books, sometimes in the name of Henderson, and sometimes Wil<lb></lb>liams—on 4th April, when I got the Cardigan jackets from Messrs. Morley, Randall waited for me at the Post Office—I pawned those jackets the same day, one at Mr. Dobree's, one at Smith and Dymond's, in Newgate Street, and another at Mr. Lawley's, 78, Farringdon Street—Randall went with me to all those places, but he did not go into either of them—I do not recollect Leonard Wilson's, 253, Goswell Road—I only went to those places once.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain to the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Potter. I believe them to be the men, but cannot swear to them; they took from me a silver watch and seal; first they spoke to me; they said it is very dirty walking; another said it was very dark, and then they knocked me down; I got up on my feet; they pretended to help me up, and said they hoped I had not hurt myself; then I felt my watch go out of my pocket; they held my hands fast while the little one took my watch out of my pocket; I pursued and took him; one of Justice Welch's people found the watch; that man's name is I think Coxon; he came down to Greenwich to me, where I live; as soon as the men quitted me, I pursued him I thought took my watch; I do not know certainly which took the watch; I think the little one did.</p>

               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Potter. Yes; I went into the Black-horse to treat a person with six-penny-worth of brandy and water; when I went in, the prisoners were in a box drinking a pint of beer; I asked the coachman to drink with me; I had come up from Greenwich in the stage; at the place the Greenwich stage goes from: one of them pushed the pot to the coachman, and asked him to drink, and I think they asked me; we both refused it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Potter. No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Henry Green. Sheridine and Harding and I went last Friday night was three weeks, we went into the Black-horse at Charing-cross; we saw the prosecutor stand at the bar changing a guinea: Sheridine called me on one side, and said, d - n his eyes, he has changed a guinea, stop a little, and we'll scamp him; we staid about ten minutes in the house; he went out; we followed him over the way: just by the corner of the Mews, Sheridine and I went up and knocked him down by the dead wall of the Mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Harding?</p>
               <p>Green. Close to us behind; we took the watch out of his pocket, and Sheridine and I ran away; Sheridine took it out of his pocket as he was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who helped him up?</p>
               <p>Green. Harding got hold of one arm, Sheridine hold of the other; they were going to lift him up and some gentlemen's servants came by, and we let him down again; he was not quite up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to him when they listed him up?</p>
               <p>Green. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say they hoped he was not hurt?</p>
               <p>Green. I did not hear them say so, they let him go and he fell down upon his backside again.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was said to him?</p>
               <p>Green. I did not hear any thing said to him.</p>

               <p>Harding's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming from the Mews: I went to make water at the corner of the Mews; Green went up and said there was a man stone-blind-drunk; he said, Harding come here; I went up; he was quite drunk; they lifted him up; one picked a watch out of his pocket; they said, come along; they ran away and said they had got a watch.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Green. Do you know Dalby?</p>
               <p>Green. I never saw him before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him then?</p>
               <p>Green. At the bottom of the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take notice of him then if you never saw him before?</p>
               <p>Green. Harding spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Harding. They said they would give me something if I would pawn it for them; Green asked me, then I asked Dalby, if he could pawn it for me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Chandler. Who was it pawned the seal to you?</p>
               <p>Chandler. It was Dalby.</p>

               <p>Q. to Dalby. Then you pawned the watch with one man and the seal with another?</p>
               <p>Chandler. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to do that?</p>
               <p>Chandler. I pawned it a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You had it in trust from them to pawn?</p>

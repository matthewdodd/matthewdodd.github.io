            . I live in Bishopsgate-Street, and work in the loom at ribband making. The prisoner came and call'd me from work, saying, his master had given him an old bedstead, and a great many other goods; he also produced five caps, which he desired me to go and pawn for him. I pawn'd them for 8 d. and brought him the money.</p>

            , going out of town (as she told me) to see her father and mother, left the key with the prisoner, who lived in the same house, that her master should not lose the sale of any of his goods; she went out, and when she return'd she could not get into her room; in the dusk of the evening Mrs. Fish brought the key of the door, and said the prisoner gave it her to bring home. In the morning about eight o'clock I heard her scream out, making a sad complaint. I went up to see what was the matter, when she told me that all her money, her ring, some caps, handkerchiefs and ruffles, were gone. In turning over the things in the box we found a chissel, how it came there I can't say, but this is the very same chissel. (producing one.)</p>

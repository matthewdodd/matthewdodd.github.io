                  </hi>. I live at 12, Hanover Court, Long Acre—on 22nd July, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was going home—I came from Leicester Square, and heard a cry of "Murder!" and "Police!"—I ran up; and saw the prosecutor lying in the street on the ground at the corner of Long Acre—three fellows were over him—one of them had got his throat so—that man is the prisoner—I have seen him before sometimes at the public-house at the corner of St. Martin's Lane—I said, "What's the matter here?"—at the same moment I sprang back and called the police, and the four fellows all ran away—a little boy was with me—when the policeman came up he gave orders to go with the prosecutor to the police court—two days after, on the Wednesday morning, the police asked me if I knew this man, and I identified him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What were you doing out so early in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was with three friends, countrymen of mine—I left them at the corner of St. Martin's Lane, near where this took place—at the same moment that I heard the cry a little boy came up, attracted by the cry as well—I was the first who went to the spot where I heard the cry—the boy came after me—my three friends did not hear the cry—I don't know how long it was after I parted from them—I am a jeweller—I have a very bad business—I now live in Bedford Chambers, Regent Street, Drury Lane—I have lived there a fortnight—I lived before at St. Martin's Chambers about a fortnight or three weeks—I lived before that in Hanover Street—I was turned out because the people said I was a police spy—I was turned out from the first lodging on that account—I came home late one night at the second lodging, and then the man said he had not room for me any more—I have never been a witness in another case—I have no connec<lb></lb>tion</p>

               <p>with the police—I have been in England since the 9th February last year—I have had very little work since I have been in this country—I have been ill and am in rather bad circumstances—you may ask Dr. Kinkel about me—I have worked for Mr. King—I cannot tell you whom I have been recently been working for—I have done some work together with a friend, a little—his name is Hearn, 103, Old Street—that was recently—no one was present except the little boy; afterwards several people came up—I don't know the boy at all—he was selling matches—he did not go to the police-court—it was only a little boy—it was dark—I am a Prus<lb></lb>sian—I left Berlin to come to England to get work—I don't know of any other reason.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Junction Road, Upper Holloway, and am an engraver—I was returning home on the morning of the 22nd July last—I think the time was after one—I turned up a court for a necessary purpose—I am a stranger in the neighbourhood, and do not know the name of the court—as I was turning round to leave I was seized hold of by one man round the throat, and another attempted to rifle my pockets—I laid hold of the man who had got me by the throat and called "Police!" as loud as I could—I struggled for a second or two, but was released imme<lb></lb>diately—I don't know from what cause—the police did not come up at the time—I saw the last witness come up immediately I was on my legs again—I saw three men running away, and one in front of me seemed to cover the retreat of the others—he menaced me—I don't identify the prisoner—the pressure on my throat was far enough back to prevent my calling out: it was severe, still I struggled violently against it—only my hat was taken from me—it was off in the struggle—one of them said, "Who's took the b—'s hat?" and I saw one of them take the hat and run.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On 25th July last prisoner was given into my custody for knocking a man down and stealing his pocket handkerchief—I took him to the station—on looking over the descriptions, I saw he answered the description given by Schmidt—Schmidt identified him in the yard the next morning—he was with eleven other men—he picked him out without any difficulty—he walked up immediately and picked him out.</p>

            . I live in Poppin's-court, Fleet-street, and am a constable. On the 22d of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in <placeName id="t18271206-205-crimeloc1093">Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Did you see the handkerchief put into the prisoner's pocket? A. No, into his bosom; it was dark, but it happened opposite a light shop; I could not find it when I returned - I am certain he threw it down; he was not out of my sight at all; he threw a stick down at the same time; if I had stooped to take it up, I should have lost sight of him.</p>

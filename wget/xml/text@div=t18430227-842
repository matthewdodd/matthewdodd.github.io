                  </hi>. I am a Thames police river constable. On the 7th of Feb., between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I stopped the prisoner in the West India Dock-road—his jacket appeared bulky—I asked what he had about him—he said, "A little lead"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said he picked it up at Millwall where he landed—I took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion—I cautioned him not to answer me—he said he worked at Mr. Mills's chemical works—I went, and saw Mills's foreman, who identified the lead and some copper, which the prisoner had hanging in front of him, and the lead slung at the back, under his jacket—they weighed 22lbs. together.</p>

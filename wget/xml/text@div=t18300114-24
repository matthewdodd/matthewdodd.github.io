These articles were in a box by his bed-side; there were two other lodgers and two beds in the room - the box was always locked. On the 5th of December, in consequence of information from my son, I went into the room, and found the prisoner doing something to his dress- he sat down on the bed; I said,"I found the box open and a false key in it;" the other lodgers had gone out hours before; I said, "Mr. Taylor, this is too bad;" he said, "I am innocent," and got up - I turned down the bed, and my scarf, spencer, and shift, were in the bed - they had been taken from the box; he was a civil quiet man, out of employ - I found eleven false keys between the bed and mattress where he slept.</p>

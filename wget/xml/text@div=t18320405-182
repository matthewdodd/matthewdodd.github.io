            . (Police-constable F 21.) On the evening of the 6th of March I saw all the prisoners in Drury-lane; Jones had this knife-case under his arm, and a green apron covered over it; he went into a pawnbroker's shop, at the corner of Blackmore-street, and told the other two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050080"></xptr>to wait outside - they were talking together, and then Jones went in; the other two waited outside - I went into the shop; Jones had put it on the counter, and offered it to pawn; I asked him who brought it - he said he had, to pawn it for his master, who lived at No. 14, New Church-court, Strand; I asked if he had any odjection to come with me to his master - he said, "Oh, no, not the least;" when we came out, he said it was all nonsense, it was not his master's, but that he and his companions had bought it of a young man named Robert Jones, who lived in Golding-buildings, and was a cabinet-maker - the other two prisoners were close behind at the time; I took them all to the watch-house - they then said the same as Jones, that they purchased it the night before for 2s.; Mr. Thomas asked them if that was the truth, and they both said Yes.</p>
               <p>Jones. Q. I did not say it was my master's, I said it was my own. Witness. He said it was his master's, and the pawnbroker said, "I think you will find it correct, officer, for he has often been here to pawn for his master."</p>
               <p>Jones. Q. I said the young man lived in Baldwin's-gardens, not Golding-buildings, but we bought it of him in Lincoln's Inn-fields. Witness. He said Golding-buildings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. Did you hear Jones tell them to wait outside the shop? A. I did not; they were talking together - he told them to wait, and he would see how much he could get for it; when I asked them if what Jones stated was the truth, they both agreed to it - I asked the question before Mr. Thomas came into the room, and when he came, I told him the charge; he asked them if it was bought of

            , and they both said it was true - I had asked them to discover who the property belonged to, and Jones told me that he and his companions had purchased it for 2s. the night before; when I saw them it was between five and six o'clock - it was not exactly dark; when I had brought Jones out, the other two walked behind us - I had my Police dress on; they must have known I was an officer, but I had directed two other officers to watch them - they were about two yards behind us.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. This is my knife-case; I missed it about five o'clock in the evening - my premises are about ten minutes' walk from Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had you last seen it? A. Perhaps about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Jones. There was a man followed us down Drury-lane, from Holborn, and he fetched the officer from the Strand, and that man said at the station-house, that he walked by our side; he came into the pawnbroker's and told the officer, "That is the boy, and those are the other two."</p>

            . No, I was not fetched by any man; a man came to the station, and asked if the property was stolen; I said I did not know - he said he thought he had seen the prisoners before; that man stood at the door of the pawnbroker's - he did not go in.</p>

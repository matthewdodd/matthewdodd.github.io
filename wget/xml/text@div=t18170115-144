            ; we lodge with my mother, in the first floor; the prisoner also lodged, down stairs, with her. On the 21st of December, I went down stairs to tea with my mother; I shut my door after me, but did not lock if; when I went into my mother's room the prisoner was there and my mother too, before we began tea, the prisoner made an excuse to go out to fasten my mother's shutters - He came in again in about a quarter of an hour. He was not out after My mother's clock stopped, and I said I would go up and look at my watch; as soon as the prisoner heard that, he went out, and did not return until the officer brought him the same evening, very late. I missed my watch out of my room, it hung up over my bureau. I went round to stop the pawnbrokers from taking it in, if it should be brought, and Mr. Matthews stopped it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Minories. On the 21st of December the prisoner brought me a watch to pledge; Newton had left a description of it at my house - I detained him; he said it was his property, and that he had it sometime, and would sell it, as he was going a long voyage.</p>
               <p>Q. by Prisoner. Did you receive it out of my hand-</p>
               <p>A. I saw you deliver it to my man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KINNERSLEY. I am a constable; I took the prisoner into custody; he refused to tell where he lived, or where he got the watch; when I was taking him to the Counter, he said it was given to him by a girl.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy to Mr. Davis, a lodging-house keeper, of 42, West India Docks Road, Limehouse—James Laws, the deceased, was a regular lodger there at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—he was a sickly man, evidently suf<lb></lb>fering from bronchitis or pains in the chest—on 5th February, about 1</p>

               <p>o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came there and asked for a lodging—he had evidently been drinking—I took him into a ten-bedded room, and assigned to him bed No. 31, the third bed on the left, the next bed to the deceased, No. 40—I left him there, and about a quarter of an hour after<lb></lb>wards I heard screams from the deceased—I went into the room and found the deceased's bedstead overturned, and the deceased's head and shoulders were on the floor, and his feet entangled in the bed-clothes—the bedstead was turned sideways—the flock bed weighed perhaps 10 lbs.—the prisoner had not undressed himself at all, nor had he got into his bed, because it was unruffled—he had one boot off—the first thing I and a lodger did was to right the deceased's bed—I was very excited, and told the prisoner to go downstairs as the persons in the room said that he had overturned the bed-stead—I cannot recollect whether the prisoner said anything to that, as I was in a passion—I put the deceased to bed, and turned the prisoner out of the house, and next day I gave him in custody—I went into the room again to see the deceased about 2 a.m., and at 10 o'clock next morning I found him speechless—I sent for the parish doctor, who came at 12 o'clock, and the deceased died about 2.30—we knew him by the name of Daniel O'Rourke, but we afterwards ascertained that his name was James Laws.</p>

I gave him in custody between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—the deceased was evidently a weak man, but he could eat well—his age was about fifty-six—the bedsteads are side by side, five on the left, four on the right, and one lengthways—No. 41 runs out from the wall—they are 2 ft or 2 ft. 2 in. apart—they are wooden French bedsteads, single, about 3 ft. wide and 6 ft. long—I did not hear the prisoner say that the deceased jumped up when he shook him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dock labourer—on 4th February I slept in the bed opposite where the prisoner was going to sleep—Mr. Gill brought the prisoner in about' 1 a.m., and showed him to a bed—the deceased was in bed snoring a little, he was very poorly—the prisoner began cursing and swearing at him because he was making a noise, and then he; deliberately took hold of him and shook him and pressed him very hard, and made him holloa out very much—the prisoner then sat down on his own bed, pulled off one of his boots, sat there for about a minute, and then deliberately got up, <hi rend="italic">catclied</hi> hold of the bedstead and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it over on its side, and pitched the man out—I heard him fall on the floor; he made a deal of noise—the prisoner did nothing, he only stood there—he was not sober and he was not drunk—the deputy came and turned him out.</p>

I went to bed about 8.45—the room is not lighted all night; the deputy brought a light up when he came to show the prisoner his bed, and left it with the prisoner—I was awake when they came up—I said nothing to the prisoner—do you think I was going to interfere with a sailor when they carry weapons about them, and besides, I did not know he was going to turn the bedstead over—the bedsteads are very heavy.</p>

I am medical officer of Stepney Union—on 5th February, at 12.15 I was called to the West India Dock Road, and found the deceased in an insensible and dying condition—I after wards heard that he died at 2.30, and I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination by the Coroner's order, and found that death arose from con<lb></lb>gestion of the brain from the rupture of a blood vessel on the brain—I found the membranes thickened and greatly congested, and a clot of con<lb></lb>gealed blood about the size of a horse bean, behind the left ear, on the brain and under the membrane—there were no marks of external injury on the body—the pleura was adhering from the standing pleurisy, and the lungs were collapsed here and there, and there was evidence of old standing bronchitis, but those injuries were distinct from the clot of coagulated blood—I attribute the rupture of the blood. vessel to violence—I have heard the evidence—such a blow as would be given in a fall from a bedstead would cause the condition I saw—he did not die of pleurisy or bronchitis, but from the rupture of a vessel in the brain from violence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. Pleurisy and bronchitis would affect the the circulation of the blood, and I have known apoplexy resulting from them—the bedstead was about 18 inches high—I mean to say that if the man only fell 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">feet</hi>, and the pillow and bedclothes fell with him, that would produce what I saw, with no external signs of violence—the appearance would not be produced by violent coughing under excite<lb></lb>ment; there would be different symptoms altogether—I don't think any excitement would produce what I saw—I know that the man had had bron<lb></lb>chitis some time, and that would affect the circulation—he was dying when I saw him, and was beyond the reach of medicine—supposing the blood vessel to have burst at 1 a.m., when the bed was thrown over, the man might live till 2.30 p.m., because there would be a small oozing out of blood which would ultimately bring him to the condition in which I saw him.</p>

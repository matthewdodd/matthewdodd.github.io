                  </hi>. I lodged in the house in question. On Sunday, the 24th of January, I went out, at nearly five o'clock, just twilight—I occu<lb></lb>py a bed in the front attic—I had been at home nearly the whole day, in my room—I had a fire in it, and cooked my dinner there—the prisoner was at home when I went out, and her husband, Henry Fisk, also—they pass as husband and wife—I returned in about an hour—the prisoner was at home then, and her husband—I went up stairs to unlock my fellow<lb></lb>lodger's box to get him a shilling; and when I entered the room, I was suffocated with smoke—that was the room I have a bed in—Cartwright, my fellow-lodger, slept there also—I found the bed full of smoke, but saw no fire—after letting the smoke evaporate, I got into the room, and got the shilling out of the box? and when I came down stairs? I said to the prisoner, "Good God! Ma' am, what is the matter up-stairs? I cannot enter my room for the smoke"—her husband was sitting by the fire in the same room as her—she said, the room at times, with contrary winds, was apt to smoke; but I had been there eleven months, and never saw it—I went to Cartwright, to the public-house, and gave him his shilling—I came back a little before eight o'clock, and went up-stairs to bed—when I opened the door, there were flames of fire from the bedstead—the husband was at home then, and the prisoner also—I came running down stairs, and said to Mr. and Mrs. Fisk, "The place is on fire"—there were several people there being served—it is a chandler-shop—Mr. Fisk went up-stairs, and got pails of water—I went up stairs, and instead of going into the room which I told him was on flames, he burst open the other room door, and that was in flames also—I heard the prisoner say nothing, nor saw her do any thing—I got some water myself, and assisted in putting the fire out—I</p>

               <p>had no conversation with the prisoner about it—I said, the day after that, it was strange to me there should be a loose besom cut open, and strewed about under the bed of the room the husband had burst open (there were two rooms on fire)—that room was unoccupied—she went down and called her husband; and he came up, and chastised me for saying so—he said, there was no besom about—the fire was put on in the two rooms—I slept in mine that night—the bedstead and sacking were burnt—I did not observe any part of the room on fire—I have not been in the other room since—I could see the broom, and bed on fire—her husband exerted him self very much on that occasion, thought he he had been under the doctor's hands—he was able to go about the house.</p>

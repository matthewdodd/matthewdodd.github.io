The inspector has got a letter from the manager of that establishment which will bear out that I was at work there that week. I have witnesses to prove it, among whom is the gas engineer. The inspector has got the book, which shows how much gas was consumed, and I believe I can recollect the amount consumed in three days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a laundress and know the prisoner as a friend, who occasionally comes to our house—on the night of 24th December he was with me at Mr. Morrison's, from a quarter past nine to a quarter past ten, when he passed out of the shop he went into Lisson Grove, that was at a quarter past ten.</p>

I told the Inspector on the 20th, that I was absent, at work at the Oxford Music Hall—I know nothing of the affair of the 20th till I went to the station—Ada Davis said that she did not see me on the 23rd, and when asked by my Lord she admitted having spoken to me on that day—I was in the Edgware Road on the 24th, but the process under which I work at gas meters can only be used at night, when the gas is alight.</p>

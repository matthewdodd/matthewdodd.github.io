                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Jones, at Ealing, and have known the pri<lb></lb>soner five years—she was with me in Sept., and slept with me eight or nine days, at Mr. Jones's, at Woodland-place, Ealing, by his consent, as he was from town—she was in the habit of going about the house with me, and knew where the things were placed, and knew all the fastenings of the house per<lb></lb>fectly well—on Monday, the 19th of Oct., the day before the robbery, I put my master's desk in its proper place, under the table between the dining-room windows—on Tuesday evening, about six o'clock, the prisoner came to the house to bid me good bye, saying she had gut a situation and was going to Bedford—she was only in the kitchen that day, and remained with me from six to nine o'clock—I went with her, and saw her go away by the railway train to London—on that Tuesday evening, between five and six o'clock, as soon as it was dark, I fastened the house up—everything was safe when I went to bed, for all I know—I got up next morning at eight o'clock, and found the dining-room door open, which was shut when I went to bed—that was the room the desk had been in—I went down stairs, and found the kitchen-door shut, which I had left open—I opened it—the shutters were quite open—I found the shutter of the kitchen window was open, and the blind hanging down at one corner—it was up when I went to bed—the window was shut the night before, but I cannot swear that it was fastened, but I should say it was—no part of it was broken—the shutters fitted quite close—they are inside the window—there are two of them—one overlapped, one going into the other—there were marks inside the window, on the cill, and foot-marks of somebody outside—it was a small foot—I cannot say whether it was male or female—the police were sent for directly—the desk now produced is my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. I was the first of the police that examined the window—I found that something had been passed through between the shutters, and lifted up the bar—they would admit of a knife being passed between, which would lift up the bar—I saw some footmarks close to the window, coming from towards the fields—they were only one person's—they were women's feet, and I traced the same marks from the field to the garden—there is a small flower-border in front of the window—there were marks on that border—I discovered the marks on the dung against the wall—a person could have got over the wall by getting on the dung—the descent would be five or six feet—it would not be easy to get up again—the marks were towards the wall and towards the kitchen window—the dung was in the field—in the field I found the kitchen knife, which Mr. Jones identified—on the 30th of Oct., about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I went to the prisoner's lodgings—I found her undressed—she had just got out of her bed—there was another young woman in the room also undressed—I asked the prisoner if her name was White—she said it was—I said I had come from Ealing to apprehend her for a robbery at Mr. Jones's—she seemed agitated, but said nothing—I thought she was going to faint—I then commenced searching, and on a box, which the prisoner said was hers, by the side of the bed, I found this paper parcel directed to Mr. Jones, Ealing, and containing deeds and papers, a miniature of a gentleman, a desk seal, a knife, and a pocket-book—I found this desk under the pillow of the prisoner's bed—the desk contained a pocket-book, eighty-six pieces of ancient silver coin, and sixteen pieces of gold coin, and two memorandum-books—this ivory-handled pen-holder, with a gold end, I received since from Mrs. Glover—the desk had been broken open, and the private drawers under are also broken—I have lost the coins this morning—they were ancient coins, gold and silver—I found no sove<lb></lb>reigns in the desk—I found on the prisoner a purse, containing one sovereign, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver.</p>

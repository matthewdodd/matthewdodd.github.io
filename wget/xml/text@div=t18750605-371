                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Arnold, a stationer, of 29, Poultry—on 11th May I served the prisoner with a penny pencil—he gave me a shilling—I put it in the till where there was other silver, but I cannot say whether there were other shillings, and gave him 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I was in conversation with William Moore, who spoke to me after the prisoner left, and I took a coin from the till not a minute afterwards and tested it—I am not sure it was the same coin, but as far as I know it was—I found it was bad and placed it in my desk by itself till I gave it to the officer—next day, about 2.30, the prisoner came again; he was smoking—I recognised him—he asked me for a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stick of sealing-wax and gave me a florin—I asked him if he had any smaller change; he said "I have only these," pointing to two half-crowns in his hand—I bent the florin in the tester, but he did not see that—while I was looking for change he said "I have 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and placed it on the counter—he asked me two or three times to give him the coin back, but I called Mr. Arnold and told him that the prisoner had uttered the florin and a shilling on the previous night—the prisoner said that it was entirely a mistake—Mr. Arnold detained him and I went for a constable—the prisoner said that he had never been there before.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the East India Company, in the Stationary office. There was a deficiency in the office of twenty-five reams of fool's-cap, and twenty dozen of pencils, and something of every thing that was in the office. I went to a school at Finchley, where the prisoner teached the children to write. I was there informed, by the mistress, that the prisoner found stationary for the school. The prisoner told me he was the <rs id="t18120916-122-deflabel679" type="occupation">writing-master</rs>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 18th of August last I went down to the Sunday school at Finchley. Mrs. Castle opened a cupboard, and in that cupboard I found these thirteen copy-books. I apprehended the prisoner on the same night, as he was coming across Hackney fields. I told him he was charged with taking paper belonging to the East India Company. He said, he had taken the books there, and they were perquisites. They were outside sheets.</p>
               <p>MRS. CASTLE. Q. You keep this school at Finchley - A. No. I attend there occasionally. These books were there, in the cupboard. I gave them to the officer. Who took them there I do not know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

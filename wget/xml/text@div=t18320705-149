            . I am clerk to Sir Richard Carr Glyn and others, and am employed in the country-office; it is my duty to superintend all payments for country correspondents. On the 21st of June we received a letter from Lovell, and Co., bankers of Birmingham, in consequence of which, Mr. Feltham filled up a cheque, and handed to me - this is it (looking at it) - I know his handwriting; on the 22nd of June, a person applied for that cheque, in the name of Allen; it was in the morning, and I should say before two o'clock - when we receive letters to pay money to a particular person, Feltham draws a cheque, corresponding with the order, and gives it to me to deliver to the party to whom the money is to be paid, and that party signs it; it then requires my initials on it, as an authority to the cashier to pay it, and on the 22nd, it was presented to me - I put my initials on it; it was about four o'clock, to the best of my knowledge, because I was preparing for the clearing at the time - I cannot say whether when I put my initials on it, it was in the same condition as it is now, as I did it in the usual course of business; the cheque was brought to me again about a quarter to five o'clock, by Thomas, the cashier.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect who presented the cheque for your initials? A. I do not - I have not the least recollection of the prisoner's person; I cannot say whether the 6l. was altered to 60l. at the time it was presented to me - it might have been altered before it got into the prisoner's hands for what I know; it was brought back to me full three-quarters of an hour after I put my initials on it - I should call this figure a bad six.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might any person present it for your initials? A. I gave it to

            . I am a clerk in the country-office at Messrs. Glyns', and keep the account of Lovell, and Co., of Birmingham. This letter was handed to me in the course of business, and in consequence of it, I made out this cheque for 6l. 3s., all except the signature, the syllable ty. and the figure 0, after the 6 is my writing; the date, "June 22nd," is written by the clerk who delivered it to the party applying for it - at the time I gave it to Pargiter it was drawn for 6l. 3s. only, I am certain, according to the direction in the letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any knowledge of who presented it to be initialled? A. I have not, nor whether it was altered then; I have nothing to do with that department.</p>

            . I am cashier at Messrs. Glyns', and attended at the counter. On the 22nd of June, about ten minutes to five o'clock, the prisoner presented this cheque to me for payment, drawn for 60l. 3s.; I asked how he would have it - he said three 20l. notes; I cancelled the signature, and on looking at it again, it struck me the letters ty. had been added - I then took it to Mr. Pargiter, in the country office, then returned to the prisoner, and told him he must go with me to Mr. Butcher, the solicitor to the bankers; but before that I asked him how he became possessed of the cheque - he said a person at the Post-office had given it to him to present for payment; that the person was a stranger - I then went with him to the solicitor's office, in St. Mildred's-court, and from there to the Post-office; I saw a City Policeman, and desired him to follow us - I followed the prisoner into the Post-office, and the officer afterwards; the prisoner could not recognize any person there, as having given him the cheque- I returned with him to the solicitor's, and gave him into custody; on Mr. Butcher asking him at what time he received the cheque, he said, "About half-past two o'clock"- that was on our return from the Post-office; he was asked where be lived, and I think he said he was in the Chartered Gas Company's service, at Westminster.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many clerks initial cheques? A. Two are regularly employed to do it, but in their absence, others do so; four o'clock is about the busiest time with us - I left the prisoner alone at the counter, while I went to Pargiter, but had my eyes on him now and then; there were other clerks there - there was a glass door between us; the Policeman was in uniform - I think he kept ten or twenty yards behind the prisoner; I think a person waiting there, might see the Policeman.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is it your custom, if there is any thing objectionable in a cheque, to state it before you cancel it? A. Yes, if we discover it; the prisoner could see me cancel it - I did not express any doubt to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you perceive any body make any haste from the Post-office when you went? A. Not any; the prisoner looked round, and said he could not see the person who gave it to him - a person might have gone off without my seeing him.</p>

            . I am a City Policeman. I took the prisoner into custody at the Mansion-house about twenty minutes past five o'clock - I found nothing on him but this cover of a book - I asked where he got the cheque; he said a man against the New Post-office gave it to him in that book-cover, and asked him to go to Glyn's and get it cashed, and he would give him a sovereign for his trouble; that he told the man he would return in an hour - he said he received the cheque from half-past two o'clock, to a little before three; I said,"Why, you have been a long time - it is a good deal more than an hour; why have you not returned?" he said because he had been into Wood-street, Milk-street, and various streets in Cheapside, seeking for a situation at different warehouses - I said, perhaps he could tell me some of the names or the numbers of the houses where he went; he said he could not recollect them - I asked if I went with him whether he could show me any person he had inquired of that afternoon for a situation; he hesitated, and said he did not think he could, and he thought he had given me quite satisfaction enough - I said, "If you do not give me more I must lock you up;" he said, "Well, I cannot help it, you must then" - he said he had had the cheque in his possession from half-past two or three o'clock till he was apprehended, and it had not been out of his possession at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Do you know where he lived? A. I asked if he had been at work lately - he said he had, at the Gas-works, in the Horseferry-road - I found no money on him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. He said he worked at the Gasworks? A. Yes, that was true - I think he said, he had not been at work for a day or two, as the work was so laborious he wanted to get something else.</p>

            . I am time and gatekeeper at the Westminster gas-works. The prisoner was in the company's employ up to the 22nd of June, but was absent on the 18th, 19th, and 20th; without leave, he would not receive pay for that time - he was at work on the 21st, and half a day on the 22nd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was absent for three days before the Birmingham letter is dated? A. Yes - he has worked for us one or two years; he had a bad hand a week or a fortnight before this: he worked a full week before the three days' absence - his hand might have got worse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I feel convinced you will plainly see I have been led innocently into this; I had not the slightest knowledge the cheque was bad; having a wife and two children, I was anxious to procure a situation of about 20s. a week, having but 15s. at the gas-works - I was looking for a situation, when a gentleman accosted me at the Post-office, and asked me to take the cheque, and bring him three 20l. notes for it, and he would give me a sovereign; I said I was looking for a situation, that I would make inquiries as I went along, and return in an hour; I admit a sovereign was a large sum, but I suppose it was thought I should go directly, before the fraud was discovered.</p>

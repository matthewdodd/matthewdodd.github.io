                  </hi>. I live with Mr. George Ravenor, a pawnbroker, in Tot<lb></lb>hill-street, Westminster. On Saturday evening, the 22nd of July, I saw the prisoners in the shop—Weeks wanted a jacket to fit his mate (meaning Ker<lb></lb>chearwell)—I turned my back to get the jacket, and knowing them about the neighbourhood, I cast my eye round, and saw Weeks go to the door and snatch down a bundle of handkerchiefs from the door—they were fastened round a hook inside the door—I got the jacket, and did not take any notice—Weeks had got the handkerchiefs between his legs, standing in front of the counter—I showed them the jacket—Kerchearwell was looking at them—Weeks wanted me to turn my back to see if I had not got another jacket—he said that would not suit him—I said we had not got another—I charged them with stealing the handkerchiefs—my fellow-shopman secured Weeks while I went for a policeman—while Weeks was at the counter he began to scratch his head, and knocked off his cap, he stooped, and tried to put the hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs into his cap—when he found they would not go in, he put them be<lb></lb>tween this legs again, and put the cap on—these are six of the handkerchiefs—they have our private marks on them.</p>

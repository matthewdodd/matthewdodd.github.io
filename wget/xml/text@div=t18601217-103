I am a smith and engineer—on 19th September I was tent to the prisoner's father's house to do some repairs in the kitchen, the shop, and the counting-house—I had been engaged there previous to that—the prisoner, who was there, kept taking away my tools and hiding them, all the morning—I told him that I was losing my time, and he said, "My</p>

I do not want to get Ted into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> because we were both larking, and it was both our fault"—I said, "Make it as light as you can for Ted; do not let his father beat him if you can help it"—I said that to Joe—I could tell it was he by his voice—I did not give as a reason for that that we had been larking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This was done deliberately, according to your account; he said that he would do for you, or pay you out; then, why did you not wish his father to beat him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Do you think I should like to have heard of that boy being three parts killed? I know what a passionate man his father is—I swear that I have never said we had been larking, and that it was my fault—nothing of the kind—this gave me great pain in my eye—I cannot say whether Richardson, the other apprentice, was present, because I have not been accustomed to his voice—Miller did not say to me, "What can you say? what did you tell the people at the hospital?" nor did I reply, "I told them the truth"—Miller did not say "Well, the best way is to speak the truth now; his father is sure to hear of it, and you had better tell it;" nothing of the sort—I did not suggest that the father should be told that it was an accident—I only spoke those words that I have said—when I went to Mr. Ingle's, my master's, I saw the prisoner's uncle, James Cooke—he is a clerk where my father works—he was tipsy—he is nearly always tipsy—he was tipsy in Court yesterday—I cannot say whether he was at work when I went back to Mr. Ingle's, but I saw him, and he said to me, "Halloa <hi rend="italic">Stokey</hi>, what is the matter?" although he was tipsy—I did not say."I think.</p>

               <p>I am blinded; it was done by your brother's boy"—I did not answer—he did not say, "Good gracious, does his father know it?"—I did not then say "No, I have not told him; it was done in a lark; we were larking together; I did not want to get the boy into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>"—no expression of the kind—I did not speak to him at all as he was tipsy—I knew him very well—he has got only one arm—he came to the hospital to inquire after me—he was tipsy, and began swearing—that was the first time he came, and the nurse would not let him come iu again—he did not sit down and chat with me—he came to ask about some work that we had done some months before—I came out of the hospital in seven weeks and two da'ys—I did not take out a summons against the prisoner directly I came out; I was not able; but I did directly I was able—James Cooke is still in Mr. Ingles's employment—I hare worked at Mr. Cooke's before, but the prisoner was not there the first time I went there—I did see him, but he was not in the shop—the family were living in the house, and he was with them—I had spoken to him, but had not played with him.</p>

"he said, "Stokes hit me with a screw-driver and I ran up stairs, picked up a handful of putty, and threw it at him as he came up stairs"—the father said, "How often am I to tell you of throwing that putty about, you are likely to get into Newgate over this" or something tantamount to that—neither the father nor the prisoner expressed any regret for what had occurred, the father said he did not know what right my son had there after dinner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Benjamin Cooke. of Salisbury-court—I know the prosecutor—I saw him playing with the prisoner on the day of the accident—it was a Wednesday to the best of my recollection—they heaving things at one another, and running after one another in play—I saw Stokes take that lad up and put him into a tub, in play—that was after 2 o'clock, after dinner—they were playing together for an hour or an hour and a half—they were heaving fine stuff at one another, the same stuff that went into Stokes' eye, ouly it was harder—I did not say anything about it at the time—it made their clothes in a greatness, and Stokes was very particular not to get any white on his clothes—this was in the shop—after that they went down stairs and brushed one another down, and Stokes washed himself—after that was in the kitchen, and Stokes was looking up his tools—he said, "I wonder what Ted has stolen,"or "prigged?" I do not know which was the word, and then Edwin took up one of his chisels and pretended to put it into the fire, but did not: that was in play I should think, and Stokes took up his screw-driver and hit him across the back as hard as he could—the lad ran up stairs, and Stokes was going up stairs with his tools when Stokes hit him—he said, "Well, Ted, I did not mean to hit you so hard as that;" and I said, "If it had been in earnest, I should have hit you," but of course it was in play—the lad did not say before he went up stairs, "You b----b----, I will do something for you now," nor any such expression—I will swear that I did not say to Stokes, cautioning him, "What he says he will do"—I left Stokes in the kitchen and went up stain—I saw the lad as I went up—I did not call out to him,"Now you b----r, it is not him coming, it is me;"—or any expression of that kind—when I got up stairs the lad had got some fine stuff in his hand—I said, "Edwin, what are you going to do with that? he said, "Leave it at Stokes, to make him in a mess"—I said, "There is some softer here which will make "him in most mess;" and he took some of that—that was the same kind of stuff only softer—shortly afterwards Stokes came up stairs with his tools, and the stuff was thrown—I found that some had gone into his eye, and I went to him and took him down into the kitchen—I wanted to take it out, but he would not let me, because the pain was so great; he said that he should go <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>—could not wash it he was in such pain, but afterwards I helped to wash some of it out, and so did Edwin, he came into the kitchen and helped to wash it out—Richardson was in the kitchen when the stuff was thrown, and when the larking took place, and putting the lad in the tub, and also when Stokes packed up his tools—Stokes then went to his father, and to the hospital—he returned in about an hour for his tools—he told me that he had been at the hospital, and said, "Has Mr. Cooke been here?" I said, "No;" Richardson was present—Stokes said, "What can we tell Mr. Cooke; because I do not want to get the boy into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, for it was done larking"—I said, "What did you tell the people at the hospital? "he said, "I told them the truth"—I said, "Well, the best way is to speak the truth, for Mr. Cooke is sure to know of it"—he said, "You are not working where you are using fine stuff,</p>

               <p>so that I might say it accidently went into my eye?" I said, "No; we are not"—he asked for a piece of fine stuff to take to the hospital, and I gave him a piece—I have been an apprentice to Mr. Cooke four years, but I have known the lad from the time he was twelve months old—he is a good<lb></lb>tempered, well-behaved lad, and who, I do not believe, would do anybody any harm.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been an apprentice to Mr. Benjamin Cooke for ten months—I was there on the Wednesday when this matter occurred—down stairs in the kitchen—I heard them larking up stairs and running after one another and things being thrown about—Stokes came I down into the kitchen while I was there and lit the gas—I will not be sure whether they both came down together, but they were both there—Miller was not there; he was in the shop—he afterwards came down when they were down—Stokes was chaffing the lad about his father and mother, and he said when he was taking up his tools to go away, that he expected Edwin had prigged one of his chisels—Edwin took a chisel off the table and pre<lb></lb>tended to put it in the fire, and Stokes rushed across the table and hit him with a large screw driver as hard as he could on the shoulder—I did not hear Edwin say, "You b----b----, I will do for you now"—he went up stairs, and Stokes followed him—I did not caution Stokes about his going up stairs, or say that if Edwin said anything he would do it—Miller was up in the shop, but he was down stairs when Stokes hit Edwin—after Edwin went up stairs Joe went up—Stokes went up two or three minutes after Edwin—I did not hear Stokes say anything—I was in the kitchen making some whitewash—soon afterwards Stokes was brought back into the kitchen when some stuff had been thrown—I think Edwin went up first after the blow with the screw-driver; I will not be sure whether it was Edwin or Joe, but Stoke, went up last—Edwin went up directly the blow was struck—when Stokes came down in great pain Joe and Edwin came down into the kitchen—Stokes would not let us assist him for half an hour he was in such pain—I wanted to examine his eye and to wipe it out—he afterwards went away and returned in about an hour for his tools—he then asked us whether we had been working at any job, where he could say that a piece fell in his eye, as he did not like to get the lad into trouble—he said, "No, all we can do is to tell the truth in the matter, as the father will be sure to hear of it some day," and that he believed it was done in game—the prisoner is a good tempered well-behaved lad, I never saw him otherwise—I did not hear Miller say after he left the kitchen, "Now, you young b----r, it is not him coming it is me; nor at any time during the day did I hear the expression, "You are a b----y sight too fast, and I will pay you for it before you go."</p>

               <p>could not see who it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when Stokes struck the boy he was near the fire-place standing up, I think, but I will not be sure whether he was standing or sitting—he was between the fire-place and the table; and Stokes reached across the table to him, and hit him on the shoulder—I think it was the left shoulder—it was on the left shoulder—I hesitated because I recollected that he was standing sideways—I do not know whether it was a very severe blow, but he complained that he did hit him hard—Stokes asked him whether he was hurt, and he said, "Yes"—I did not hear Stokes say anything at all—I did not speak to him—I forget whether Miller spoke—I was present all the time—I did not see or hear the boy cry when he was struck—he was not angry at all—he said nothing to Stokes as he left—he did not say that he would wait for him—he sail nothing that caused me to think that he was in anger—I am not sure whether Edwin or Joe went up first, but Stokes remained there about three minutes putting his tools together—I do not know when Joe went up—I do not know whether he did or did not call out when he went up stairs—I only say what I have seen—I have not been told what I should say here to-day, or what evidence I should give—I and Joe have talked over it ourselves, what we have seen, but I have never been told what to say—Mr. Cooke has not told me—he has only told me to tell the truth, and what I know of the case—I have a slight recollection of the prisoner hiding Stokes's tools—I do not know that he complained to the father about it.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my nephew—I am clerk and book-keeper to Mr. Ingle, where Stokes was employed—he came to Mr. Ingle's on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 19th September, with a bandage over his eyes—I said, "Why, Stokes, what is the matter with you?"—he said, "I think I am blinded" I said, "By whom?"—he said, "By your brother's son"—I said, "Good heavens, does the father know it?"—he said, "No, I do not believe he know it, and I want if possibly can, to prevent his knowing it, because we were larking together, and the boy threw some putty or lime into my eye, and I do not want the father to know it, as it may get him into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>"—I believe he went to the hospital—he said, "Good-bye, Cooke," and shook hands with me—he distinctly said that he had been larking with the boy, and I believe he had—on the following morning, I believe it was, I saw John Stokes the elder; but I am there every day—we almost met, and I said to my brother, "There is old Stokes," the prosecutor's father—I called him and said to him,"Halloa, Stokes, how is <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>," and he came and stood against the door—while he was there the father sent for the lad, who was down stairs in a sort of kitchen, and said to him, "Now, how was it that this acci<lb></lb>dent occurred; tell me all about the facts?"—the boy made a statement-the father said, "Now, if there is any error or mistake, I think you are both in the wrong; because your son was larking with my boy the whole day, and my eon accidentally threw some lime at him, and they are both to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—in September last I was house-surgeon at King's College Hospital—Stokes came there—I examined him—his left eye was injured—I asked whom whether he had been playing, and he said, "I have been playing"—I asked him one or two questions which I do not remember, and he said that it was done either coming up or down the ladder, and that the putty stuff was thrown at him—I afterwards found out that it was lime—he left no im<lb></lb>pression upon my mind that he charged anybody with it; but that it was an accident—the best thing that could be done was to wipe it out—it was washed out directly he came and some oil put in, but he has lost his eye—he said that he could bring me some of the stuff, but I said it was not necessary.</p>

I am the prisoner's father, and carry on business at 4, Salisbury-court—he was twelve years old last October—on the day this hap<lb></lb>pened, I was in the shop all the morning till 1 o'clock—I saw Stokes finish the job that he was doing for me—he went away just before one, and I took him over the way and gave him a drop of beer, and all he had to do was to take his tools away—I went to dinner and expected that he would do the same—he returned, to the best of my recollection, between 4 and 5 o'clock—I saw him no more that night—Stokes never made the least complaint to me during the day, about my boy hiding his tools—he was always on too good terms with the boy, and they were always chaffing and giggling.</p>

Yes; on the 15th of March she had three two penny cheese cakes; she gave me the seven shilling piece; I gave it my son to change: I brought her the change, then she said she could pay for them without, she only wanted to know if it was a good one; she put the seven shilling piece that I brought back into her pocket; she felt for money, then she said she could not pay without change; she then gave me a seven shilling piece and wanted change; I saw it was not the same seven shilling piece, I gave it to my son; he said it was a bad one, and not the same; he said he would send for a constable. She got it from his hand but he got it from her.</p>

            . Q. You keep a pastry cook's shop in Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street; do you remember your mother bringing the first seven shilling piece to you. - A. Yes; I rung it on the table, it was a good one; she afterwards brought me a different one; it did not ring; the first rung as well as any seven shilling piece could; the second sounded like lead; I then came out and asked the prisoner how she could offer a bad seven shilling piece; she said it was a good one; I told her the changes had been attempted to be rung on me; it would not do now, it was the fourth time; she then said it was a good one to the best of her knowledge, she would go with me to where she took it. I refused going till the constable came; when he came I told her I would go any where with her: she attempted to get it out of my fingers; she got it between her fingers but not so as to get possession of it. I am positive it was not the first seven shilling piece; she said it was.</p>

            . I have the seven shilling piece; Mr. Steventon delivered it me, I have kept it ever since. I searched her, and while I was searching, a shilling dropped from her hand. I perceived she had something in her mouth. She made two gulps; I put my fingers in her mouth; I could not find any thing.</p>
               <p>CALEB POWELL. Q. Look at that seven shilling piece. - A. This seven shilling piece is a bad one; the shilling is a good one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sold six pair of shoes for eight shillings at Rag-fair: I went into this shop to buy the cheese-cakes for my sick child; I said is this a good seven shilling piece. Yes; she makes answer; then I says, I can pay you without change. I thought I had halfpence; I had not; then I gave the same seven shilling piece: I will be upon my oath it was the same; as to swallowing any thing, I had nothing in my mouth.</p>

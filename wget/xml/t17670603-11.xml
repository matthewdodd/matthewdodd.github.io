I went home, and after some time I was sent for again, and told they had stopped the prisoner with the bag; I opened the bag, and found in the whole four pieces of solder, which, before broken, was one compleat piece of solder, about forty pounds weight of it. I asked the prisoner could use me so; he begged I would forgive him, and was very sorry for what he had done, and said, if I would let him go, he would be very honest for the future. I took him before my Lord Mayor on the Monday, he had been doing business at my Lord's house; he was asked, how he came by the solder; he said, he carried into his Lordship's house, and concealed it among some rubbish, but did intend to carry it home again to my house.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Paterson's on the 2d of May; Mr. Paterson took me into his yard, and told me the prisoner had left a bag, which he suspected had something in it that was not honestly come by; he asked me what was best to be done; I went and fetched Mr. Salter; there were some old brass cocks and some solder in it. Mr. Salter desired it might be there till his men had done work, and were paid, to see who came for it; the prisoner came there again, and put something into it, and went and drank some beer, and after that took the bag and was going away. I stopped him, and told him, his master had been and seen what was in it; then Mr. Salter was sent for again; there was then about 40 pounds weight of solder, and three old brass cocks.</p>

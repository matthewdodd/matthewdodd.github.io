                  </hi>. I live in Dover-street. I employed the prosecutor as house agent, in 1838—in 1839 I called at his office in Bond-street, and paid the prisoner five guineas, on account of his master—he gave me this receipt—I said it was a higher charge than he bad made when I had employed Mr. Hay in the same way, a year or two before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Conduit-street. In May, 1839, the prisoner was my clerk—he was authorized to receive money on my account—it was his duty to account to me, and to hand money over to me at the time he received it—he left my service at Christmas that year—he never ac<lb></lb>counted</p>

Q.</hi> Is an house-agent's the only business you follow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I never followed any other since I have been a house-agent—I followed the paper manufacturing business before, and I had a coach from London to Oxford—I have not been any thing else—the latter end of 1839 I was in embarrassed circumstances—had I been paid that which was owing me, I should not have been so—in October, I had three execu<lb></lb>tions against me—I never had but three—they never were in the house, but against my person—I was taken in execution in May—I had an execution in my house, and paid it out in five days—I never had one longer—I bad a distress for rent—I cannot tell how long it was in my house—I had a man some time—I kept him there to keep out other executions, till the other executions were taken out against me—they were not debts of my own—I think it must have been two months—I swear it was not four months—the prisoner brought an action against me in June, 1840—I applied to the court of Queen's Bench for criminal information for a libel—I was obliged to do so, for he sent me most scandalous letters—he set up in business about a quarter of a mile from my place—he left me on the Saturday night, and sent me a letter on the Monday, to say he was going into business—I beard after, that he was quite prepared to go into business, and bad got hit books all ready—he wrote me a note to say, that as he did not seem to satisfy me, he thought it a duty to himself that I should get some one else to fill his situation—I was in the rules of the fleet at the time—he did not come down to the Fleet to settle his accounts—I think I went there on the 18th or 19th of May—on the Monday I paid 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the warden's hands, and on the 22nd, I went into the rules—I took day-rules, and went on with my business—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the first day, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. every day after—it was not my creditors' money—I remained in the rules till the following Sep<lb></lb>tember—I was advised to go into the Fleet by a gentleman in the profes<lb></lb>sion, who is here—I went, and staid two days—it was my intention to get the rules—I had never been in custody before—I got my money by going to the west end of the town, the prisoner never brought a shilling to me—I went to him, and then he used to settle with me when he received any money—he very seldom received any—when he had, he handed it over—upon my oath there never was an execution in my house for twelve months, nor for four—a distress was put in by Miss Alberton, and Harbour was the broker—that did not remain more than three months—I do not think it was more than two—I have a brother in the medical line—I did not advise him to bring an action—I never was in custody at Marlborough-street, nor in any police-office—the prisoner sued me for arrear of salary—Sir George Talbot was at my office the week before last—I had let a house for him—I received the rent three or four months before I paid it—I paid in the last payment within a day of having received it—the prisoner did not tell me from time to time that the money had been inquired for, when I was out of the way—I remember Sir George Talbot applying for his account—I went there and he had left town—the next time he came to town he called, and I gave it to him—I sold a Mr. Davis's house to Dawkins, and got a deposit of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was sued for the money, I suppose about a month after I had it</p>

               <p>applied to me for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Boyd was arranging his accounts, and Mr. Bartlett I wrote to me to pay it—the account was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Bartlett said it was a very gross thing—there were twenty-five quartern loaves charged I in one week—I think I was sued by England, a milkman, for something—I paid it directly—I was sued by Gingell, the farrier—he pricked a horse of mine worth seventy guineas—I was sued by Mrs. Butler, of Bruton-street, six years ago, for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and by Brenham, a gilder—he claimed half a commission for a house—I was not sued by Ray, a stable-keeper—he put a distress into my stable one morning about eight o'clock, without asking me for the rent, which was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he owed me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid out the distress directly, and commenced proceedings against him for what was owing—every one of these were disputed accounts, which I did not conceive 1 ought to be called on to pay the whole amount—if I had expected to have been asked these questions, Miss Devine would have been here to say she never regretted any action so much in her life—I was not sued by Hooper, nor by Smith, for wages—I do not recollect the name—I was sued by the boy in my own office, after he had left me and gone to the prisoner—I paid him, though I was not liable—he was of very little use to me—I knew Hardy—he was a fellow prisoner of mine in the Fleet—he had no goods that I know of—I let him have my two back rooms at Conduit-street for the purpose of commencing business after he left the Fleet—he fitted up a laboratory there—when his case came to be heard, he went back to the Fleet—there was some dispute about some furniture at some other place, and the Court decided that it was to be given up—I kept his stock, but you will be pleased to bear in mind, that five months and a half had elapsed before his case was heard, and he agreed to give me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for six months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While you were in the rules of the Fleet unable to pay your debts, did you not, in point of fact, become bail for another person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, sir—I did not become bail for Francis then—that was two months after, I think it was the latter end of November.</p>

                  </hi>: I live at 2, Alfred Cottages—on Whit Monday I was on Woolwich platform with my wife and children—I was holding a child in each hand, and was about putting them into a carriage, when the prisoner put his arm over my shoulder and snatched my watch out of my waistcoat pocket and then gave me a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> back and pretended to be in a hurry to get into the carriage before me—I fell back against my wife, but recovered myself and held the prisoner till assistance came—I said "You have taken my watch"—he made no answer—I gave him in charge—my watch was in my pocket immediately before he came behind me—I have not seen it since.</p>

I live at 5, Argyle Place, Euston Road—on Whit Monday I was in a carriage at Greenwich Railway Station, and saw the prosecutor and his wife struggling with the prisoner, and on the guard coming up the prisoner passed a watch to a man—I thought it was Dick<lb></lb>enson who immediately went down the platform and got into another carriage—I saw the watch in the prisoner's hand.</p>

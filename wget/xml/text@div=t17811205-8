               <p>What sort? - It was a shagreen case, the watch was metal.</p>
               <p>Court. The inside was made of silver? - No, my Lord, metal.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is an indictment that will never do, because it is not the same offence. How they could have convicted her is extraordinary: the indictment is, that the inside case was silver, which is very different from an inside made of metal. This is for receiving stolen goods; the indictment says, a watch, the inside case made of silver, and the outside shagreen.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. The indictment says, one watch, the inside case made of silver, the outside shagreen: the witness says, one watch, with the inside case metal, and the outside shagreen.</p>
               <p>Court. It is put altogether 40 s. one watch with the inside case so much, and the outside so much.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. He certainly said silver, when the person was indicted who was convicted.</p>
               <p>Court. She ought not to have been convicted; the conviction is bad.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. One of the witnesses says, that before the Justice he said it was a silver case.</p>

            , last sessions, was found guilty of stealing a watch; the inside case silver, the outside shagreen. It was a mistake; she could not be convicted of stealing a watch, the inside case made of silver, and the outside shagreen; the original conviction was wrong, and the person is now under punishment. You can't convict an accessary, when the conviction of the principal is not warranted in the fact; you must find her not guilty.</p>

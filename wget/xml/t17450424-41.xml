               <p>Harrison. He died of a wound he received upon his head.</p>

               <p>Harrison. It was on the fore part of the head, a little above the right ear.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other wound upon his head?</p>
               <p>Harrison. There was a wound on the back part of the head, which was very trifling, and did not at all contribute to his death.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think as to the wound by the right ear?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I think it was the occasion of his death. The bone was laid bare, and he had all the symptoms of a concussion of the brain that could be, which was the reason of opening the head; and between the dura mater and the brain there was a large quantity of matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that follow a concussion of the brain?</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ostler, and live in Fig Tree-court, Barbican—on Saturday, 17th April, about 4 in the afternoon, I was at the Black Horse, Barbican, in a public compartment of the bar—I afterwards came out of there and went into the private compartment—I saw the prisoner there—she had a knife in her hand, and she put it into my right thigh, saying, "That is the b—that stabbed me"—I had never said or done anything to her—she did it directly I went in—I saw the knife in her hand and tried to get it out, but could not—I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and was there a fortnight—there was no one but the prisoner in the private department—I think she had been drinking a little—three days before she had threatened she would rip my inside out for me—a man named Dan Saunders had died in the hospital, and the prisoner said I had kicked him and killed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Black Horse—on Saturday afternoon, 14th April, about 4 o'clock, I saw Port there, in the public department, and the prisoner in the private department—I served her with half a pint of beer—some man went round and asked her if she would have half a pint of beer—she said, "No"—he said, "Let her have a pot of the best half-and-half"—I said I should not serve her with any more—he put his arm round her neck—I said, "Look out, for she is no good"—she said, "Enough of that, or I will have your blood"—as she put her hand in her pocket, the man went out by a small door into the public department—Port was then just coming in at the private door, and by that time she had the penknife in her hand, and she rushed it into his thigh—a man named Willis caught hold of her and took the knife from her—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Port had not spoken to her—he was sober—I think she was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant tun-man at Mr. Clutterbuck's brewery at Stanmore—the prisoner was engine-driver there—on 29th October I was sent into the tun-room—I went about half-past 7 o'clock in the evening—I concealed myself behind some tubs—I remained in that position about a quarter of an hour—I had a view of the yeast box, where the money for the yeast was put—the prisoner then opened the door and halloed three times—he then went to the second tun-room door and opened it and looked round and shut the door close—he then pulled a key out of his right hand trousers pocket and unlocked the drawer in which the money was kept that came for the yeast—he then put his left hand in, and in taking up some money he dropped some into the box again—I heard the money rattle—he then put his hand into his left hand trousers pocket; then pat his left hand into the drawer again, and put the contents into his left hand trousers pocket—I saw the hand passing from the drawer to the pocket—I could not see what was in the hand—it appeared as if he had something in it—he then put his hand a third time into the box, and put it into his left hand trousers pocket again—I then crawled to him on my hands and knees and caught his left hand, and said, "John, don't take it all"—he said, "All what?"—I said, "All the money"—he said it was a lie—I said, "It is true; I saw you"—and I said, "You are no friend of mine or you would not have done it"—we then had a bit of a scuffle; I pushed him away and locked the door and shut him in till Clarke came—the prisoner locked the drawer and put the key in his pocket—when Clarke came I unlocked the door and let him in, and I said to him, "John George has got the key of the drawer in his right hand trousers pocket, and the money is in his left; search him," but he did not—he did not understand the extent of the loss—the prisoner swore and said that he wished his own arm might drop off if he did it; he did not do it—I said to Clarke, "You search him"—Clarke said he did not know what to do—the prisoner said he would be d—d if he had got it, and he went out and said he must go to stop the engine—he went away and was from five to ten minutes gone—he came back and offered to be searched—I told him it was no use to search him then, he had got rid of it—on the Monday following he came to me and said he hoped I would think no more of it—he had no right to have the key of that drawer.</p>

               <p>him at all—I was obliged to let him go—we scuffled and he got the best of me—Clarke came in—we did not search him—I left it to Clarke—Clarke would not be accountable if the money was missing—I am not aware that there is any account kept of the yeast that is sold and of the money taken—I will not swear that the prisoner was more than three minutes away—he was away from five to ten minutes as near as I could guess—he was not away longer than was necessary to stop the engine—his place is in the engine-room—there was no search made in the engine-room at that time—there was afterwards when the inspector took him—I told Mr. Clutterbuck on the following Monday morning—I don't know how it was that the prisoner was not taken in custody—he came regularly to his work after that—for three weeks nothing more was done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am tun-man at the Stanmore brewery—on 29th October I sent the last witness into the tun-room to watch—the prisoner was engine driver at the brewery—the tun-room was my department—the prisoner only went to the tun-room to ask if the steam was wanted faster or slower, and when it was wanted—he had no business to go to the box in which the money which comes for the yeast is put—no one had a key to that box but Mr. Clutterbuck—I went that day and shook the door, and it was opened from inside by the last witness, and he said, "John George has been robbing the yeast box and taking the money out three times—he unlocked the drawer with his light hand, and put his left hand in the drawer three times, and put the contents in his left hand trousers pocket"—George declared that it was a lie—Harrington told him he was no friend to him as he was just come in there, and he might be accused of that which he had been doing—he pointed to George's pocket two or three times and said there was the money in his left hand pocket and the key in his right—George then ran and stopt the engine—he was but a very short time gone—when he came back again he offered to be searched and Harrington said, "It is no use to search you now, you have got rid of what you had"—the prisoner took a small key out of his pocket and some money not connected with the yeast, and declared that he had put nothing out of his pocket while he was gone—he declared that he had not done it—it was my duty to put the money, in the drawer—I had put money in it that day and for nearly a fortnight since it had been opened—when Mr. Clutterbuck came he opened it.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you been there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty-three years—the prisoner has been there about seventeen years—he has borne a good character—the box was opened on Monday morning by Mr. M.—there was silver, coppers, and one half-sovereign in it—when it was said that the prisoner had taken the money out he said it was a lie—I understood that Harrington meant by saying he was no friend of his, that he might be accused of it as he had been but a short time there—I heard the engine stopped—it was going on very fast and George ran and stopped it—he was but a short time gone—there was no search made of the place where he went to in the the engine room—I did not search his pockets—I did not know whether I had a right to search him—I did not tell Mr. Clutterbuck; Harrington did—the prisoner came to me on the Sunday morning, and he declared that he did not know how it was that Harrington should make the mistake, for he was an innocent man—I said, "Well if that is the case we will say no more about it"—on the Monday morning I saw Harrington, and I asked him if he was not mistaken on the Saturday night—he said "No, I am not"—I said, "George declares by all the oaths in the world that he is innocent"—Harrington said, "What I said is true, so help me God"—the</p>

               <p>vat was on a stand—I was working at that vat—I myself tried whether Harrington could see the tun-room from where he was concealed behind a tub and looking over the top of it—the tub was about four feet high I should think, or a little over, and not very great in diameter; there was a very clear view of the tun-room and the box from there—nothing could be more clear—I can't say how it was that the prisoner was not taken for more than three weeks.</p>

I am manager of Mr. Thomas Clutterbuck's brewery at Stanmore—on 31st October I received the key of the yeast drawer—that key is always kept in possession of Mr. Clutterbuck—I went to the yeast drawer and took the money out—the prisoner had no business with a key of that drawer.</p>

On the night of the 5th of January I was at work in my parlour at the back of my house—my wife spoke to me—I got up, and saw the prisoner in the act of taking the flannel jacket which had been hanging up inside the shop for sale—I came towards him—it had been tied with a cord to the sleeves—he bad undone the cord, and ran away—I ran after him—he</p>

I saw his face as plainly as I do now—the shop-door is a glass one—I lost sight of him for a moment after he got the jacket, and then I looked round and caught him—I am certain he is the person—I am certain he told me twice that he did it from hunger, and he went on his knees twice—when I first took him he said, "It is not me."</p>

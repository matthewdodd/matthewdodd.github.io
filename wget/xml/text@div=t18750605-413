                  </hi>. I am a partner with Alfred Cooper, at 5 and 7, Fenchurch-Street City, I have a mine in Devon for raising umber for colouring paper—I have recently added to that business that of a paper merchant, which latter business we have carried on for eight months or a year—I have known Algernon, about a year and two months—I knew them both at the same time—I had no-business relations with the firm of Bozzi, Dudley &amp; Co., Fish, Street Hill—I did know of such a firm-Granville Brothers, was the name I first knew—the elder prisoner afterwards joined in the name of Bozzi Dudley—Charles Granville and Stephen Granville, were the names in the. firm of Granville Brothers—I am not quite sure whether the younger prisoner had a share in the buisnesss, or whether he acted as clerk—he told me he was seventeen—we had some business rela<lb></lb>tions with Giranville Brothers, which were closed at the commencement of this year, January—they owed us money—when Granville Brothers ceased to exist we occasionally sent Algernon Granville to get orders for us—he was an ordinary clerk, and had been about three months in our service on the 29th April, he came to the office at 1 o'clock—10 o'clock would be the proper time—I asked what he meant by coming so late, and he said "I came very early, before you arrived, and went out to get orders, and I have taken a very good order, I have sold eighty-one reams of paper to Grimwade, on condition we let them have delivery to-day; I knew we had only got five reams of that quality in stock, so I have ordered the rest of Scott &amp; Anderson, and will send it in to day—I said I was very glad he had got the order, and it was entered in due course by myself—he knew previously that when we required it, paper could be procured from Scott &amp; Anderson, on our credit to supply our customers—we sent an invoice</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050078"></xptr>
               <p>to Grimwade—on the Thursday following, we had a communication from Grimwade—the invoice should be delivered as soon as we had the weights of the paper—we had not the weights on the same day, but the following Tuesday—we sent the invoice by post—Mr. Cooper posted the letter by particular request—that was the first statement sent in to Grimwade—on the Thursday night, 6th May, having received no reply to the invoice and letter we had sent, and the younger prisoner stopping away from business that day, our suspicions were aroused, and we went to Messrs. Grimwade, and resolved to go down to his lodgings, somewhere in Woolwich, to sec if we could find him, but Mr. Cooper found him by chance before that—I was outside Cannon Street Station, and Mr. Cooper went on to 26, Bridge Row, the address of Willis, Webb &amp; Co, and came out in company with Algernon—he left Mr. Cooper then, and "came with me up Walbrook, and I said "I want to know what you have done with our paper," he expressed surprise at first, and I said "You shall not leave me until I know where it is" after some hesitation he said that he would tell me the whole of the facts in connection with it—he said "You know about the 7th March, I brought an order purporting to be 'from Willis, Webb &amp; Co., for twenty two reanis-of paper which you supplied, and when the time approached, when the account was due, I brought you the money telling you it had been paid by Willis, Webb &amp; Co., in reality Willis, Webb de Co., had never had any paper, nor did they pay me that money. When I obtained the paper I gave it to my brother Charles, who sold it When the account was coming due I day after day entreated him to hand me the money to pay to you, but instead of giving it to me he only told me to get some more paper which he would sell, and give enough to pay this as I was afraid that to would find out the first affair I consented"—I said to him "But you didn't want 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of paper to pay a 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. account"—he said "But Charles said He Should have to sell it at such a sacrifice that we should want a lot to cover It, 1 so I got these eighty-one reams of paper and handed them to him. I told you I had sold it for three months credit, because within that time I could have paid you for it myself, and I hoped you would never be any the wiser for it"—I think that was the substance of the conversation—I asked where Charles Gran Ville Was, and he said be thought down at Putney—he told me the paper had been sold to Dinah Somers of Hounds ditch—Algernon had access to our forms—this (<hi rend="italic">marked C</hi>) is on one of one of our invoice forms—we had no idea such an invoice had 'gone out it is in Algernon's writing—we never had such a transaction as that with Bozzi; Dudley &amp; Co., and there is no entry of it in our books—this (<hi rend="italic">marked D</hi>) is Algernon's handwriting—he had no authority whatever from us to hare transactions with his brother Charles, and we were in utter ignorance of any such transaction the exhibit "G" is the original invoice from Scott &amp; Anderson for the seventy six reams of paper—we had the other five reams in the cellars of our office—we have paid Scott &amp; Anderson for it; they sold it to us for a month, but as we lost at the <hi rend="italic">money</hi>, they took a three months' bill for it—after the interview with Algernon he accompanied Mr. Cooper and myself to his brother's—we went to 56; Princes' Square, Kennington, where he had apartments, and waited till he came home—I said 1 had come to know what he had done with our paper—he immediately became very violent and wanted to know what I meant by coming there and asking an accusation, and then he threw off his coat and wanted to murder me, or something of that sort, he said—he is a rather bigger man than myself,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050079"></xptr>
               <p>so I declined—I said "I have come about my paper"—he said "I don't know anything about your paper; I am a business man and know what I am about; every bit of paper I have, had from <hi rend="italic">Algernon</hi>, I have got receipts for and I will show you them"—he produced some receipts—there were two or more—there is only receipt here-to the best of my knowledge that is one, (<hi rend="italic">pointing</hi>) I said "You knew your, brother was our clerk and could not have all that lot of paper to sell he said "I did not know anything about it, he could have paper to sell for all I knew—I said "Do you mean to throw all the onus on your little brother and let us give him into custody?"—he said, that was no business of his Algernon had given his word before we went iu that he Would come out with me again. I said "Come along" and his brother said "Don't go, but he did come he came to our office every day, as usual until the morning of the examination at the Mansion House—then the detective officer came and took him-we applied for the warrant the next day after we went to kennington, but we could not get up sufficient evidence till the next Saturday when we obtained it—I did not enter into any particulars with the elder prisoner-here was such a transaction with Webb, Willis &amp; Co. as that to which Algeron alluded when with me in Walbrook—there were twenty two reams of paper supplied by us to that firm in March—the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that was paid the same day were ceiyed what we supposed was Grimwade's order—it was paid in a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the rest in gold-Algernon Granville told me he had met Mr. Webb in the street and he said "I am going into the country for a little while, and if you will come up to my office I will pay you that account and gave it to him—I have been several times then to Webb's place, and since the conversation in Walbrook—there is such a firm but I cannot find any one there my partner has been there perhaps a dozen times during the ordinary hours of business the value of the five reams Would be 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the average value is about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per cwt the brown paper trade is regulated by weight—12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt. would be a very low price-any man. would buy paper at that price who dealt in it—17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the the price we charged to Grimwade—<hi rend="italic">here</hi> it is 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I understood a little about the paper trade—I treated Algernon as a friend for some months, and when his brother shut up their place and bolted, we, wanted to give him a chance, of getting on and took him in to our employment-we should not have given him so much been of use to us our object in taking him in was we were ignorant of the paper trade and that he would be useful to us-we do not care about the paper trade Mr. Cooper is here we are the sole partners in a the firm-we carry on business at 5&amp;7, Fenchurch Street, and North Devon—it is one office in Fenchurch Street—it was in the evening that I met Algernon in Walbrook—I did not threaten to take him at once to Old jewry and have him looked up unless he confessed everything—I did mention the Old Jewry-do unfortunately know the Old Jewry—it is unfortunate to spend 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in legal expenses when one has lost 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. already—I did not do that in the Old Jewry, but it leads to it—I told him he should not leave me that night untill be told me what had, become of my paper or I Would give him to a police constable—I suppose a policeman would lock him up—I don't remember his saying "What paper?" and my saying" Grinwade's paper"—I will not say that we did not—he asked me to. go up some court to be out of the public</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer living in Cleaver Street, Kennington Road. close to Prince's Square—Charles Granville gave me directions to go to Nine Elms Station, and take ten reams of paper from there to Houndsditch, which I did—I forget the number—there was no one with me—the next day I also went by his direction, to 5 and 7, Fenchurch Street, and took five reams from there to Houndsditch—there was no one with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. Sorrell, of Mitre Street, Aldgate—on the 29th April, I saw the elder prisoner at the bottom of Fish Street Hill, he came to my employer and asked whether he would let him have the van to remove some paper from Trigg's Wharf—that was in the middle of the day—he gave my employer a card—that is the one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went with the van—when I got to Trigg's wharf I found both the prisoners there—I waited there some time before I could receive the load—I loaded sixty reams of paper, I think it was, and I was told by the elder prisoner to take them to Somers, of Houndsditch—after delivering some there, I took the rest to Swan's—I have not been paid for my labour—I have been down to Bozzi, Dudley &amp; Co., 46, Fish Street Hill, but found no one there—I went the next morning.</p>

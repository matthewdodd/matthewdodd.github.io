               <p>JOHN STALKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am servant to Messrs. Pearce; I saw the prisoner in the cutting-room, with a piece of scarlet cloth in his hand, which he put into his right hand pocket; I then gave information to Mr. Roberts, and that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was done openly, so that you could see it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other men there? - A. The shop was full.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father is a tailor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was one of those honest men that did not strike their work? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father did strike? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father is employed instead of the prisoner? - A. Not instead of the prisoner, he is there.</p>
               <p>Q. There has been a little bit of a war between these honest men who have discharged their duty; they have been set upon by such men as your father, who have thought sit to strike? - A. I do not know any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it is a general rule amongst those that strike, to ill treat those who do not strike upon every occasion? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there is such a thing in the trade as cabbage? - A. Yes; I have heard of such a thing as a bit of thread, or any thing of that sort.</p>

               <p>Q. The garment is to be cut out from a piece of cloth, and if a man can cut it to so much advantage as to save a little, and put it in his pocket, the master is no loser? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a description of men in the trade called dunge, and they cannot cut out with so much advantage as those that are more skilful? - A. I don't know any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When cabbage comes to be explained, it is stealing, is it not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever understood that the cutters had a right to cabbage cloth? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Messrs. Pearce: In consequence of information from Stalker, Hoare was called out, and I charged him upon suspicion of having cloth in his pocket; he was very much struck, and searched his pockets willingly himself, and then produced this remnant of scarlet cloth; he said, he hoped it would be overlooked, being a trifling matter; I told him it could not be overlooked; I told him to go into the room again, and instead of that, he went away without his hat, and did not return again, (produces the cloth); it is of the same quality with the cloth we had, and he had been cutting the same kind of cloth that day; I have no doubt of its being my master's property; I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at the office about two days after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q. If you cut out a coat from cloth that I give you, and you had such a piece as this left, would you return it to me? - A. I am no tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it ever returned to the customer? - A. This is a very different business; every cutter is to cut the cloth to the best advantage; I know nothing at all about the tailoring trade.</p>
               <p>Q. You never employed a tailor yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any returned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that man's name, for I should like to employ such a tailor? - A. He is gone to sea, his name was Matthews; a man is to make as many garments as he can out of a piece of cloth, and what is left is to be used up.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am foreman to Messrs. Pearce; I received that piece of cloth from the prisoner, and gave it to Roberts; he said he saw it lying there, thought it was of no consequence, and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When there were such pieces left, was that considered as a perquisite to the person who cut out the garment? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In your line of business that is never permitted? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. The cloth is to be worked up as much as in can; are they allowed to take the remnants? - A. Not at Mr. Pearce's; they make a return of it in their accounts, and then it goes towards another sized garment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you bred a tailor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never known this done at Mr. Pearce's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But have you not known it done by tailors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Very common, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that there has been a new rule, that the masters are to have the cabbage and the men are not to have any? - A. I don't know any thing of it; I did not understand my employers to be tailors, but army clothiers.(Nicholas Pearce proved the firm as stated in the indictment).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 13th of January I received an order to cut several coats from five foot six to six foot; I went to Strover for a piece of cloth, the length of it twenty-three yards and three quarters; there was a number of pieces for breast, facings, and different things, and that very boy, Stalker, was picking them out, and an old man said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140094"></xptr>he would have a bit to mend his waistcoat; I said I should want them myself, most likely, and if, when I had got to the end, there was a bit left, I would give it him, and I put this in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I will admit to you, that in the tailoring line, cabbage is univertally allowed, but not in the army clothing line.</p>

On 17th May, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and another man came to the house—the prisoner asked for half a quartern of gin—I served him, and the other man put down in payment a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, which the prisoner gave him—I tried it; it was bad, and it bent very easily—I put it on the counter and said, "This is a bad one"—the prisoner picked it up and put it in his mouth—I asked him to give it me again—he said, "What do you want with it if it is a bad one?"—the other man was then going to drink the gin, and I pulled it from his mouth—I wanted payment for it, and the prisoner put down 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was very abusive, and my husband sent for a policeman—the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece was not found—the prisoner produced a good one from his pocket—I am positive the one I had in my possession first was a bad one, it bent so easily—the other one which he produced was not bent—he had bitten it in several places round, to make us believe that was the other—I saw nothing of the other one after he put it in his mouth.</p>

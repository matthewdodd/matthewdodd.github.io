            . I am a slopseller, and live at the corner of Dock-street; I saw Mr. Church pass me; I saw the prisoner and another man walking on very fast, following about ten yards from him; they overtook him opposite my shop; they passed him about half a yard, and then turned and met him full in the face; I saw the other man's hand go as if pulling something from him; (it was under a gas lamp) at that moment the other man ran off; it was done very quick; Mr. Church turned round and called Stop thief! the prisoner ran after him, and made a violent blow at him which knocked him down; I was about fifteen yards from him; I pursued the prisoner calling Stop thief! but nobody would stop him till he fell down, in the middle of Dock-street, and as he was getting up I secured him; he asked me what I wanted of him; I said he was the villain that knocked the gentleman down after he was robbed - he said he was sure I was mistaken - I said I was not, and took him - I am sure he is the man.</p>

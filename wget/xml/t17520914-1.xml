Mrs. Edwards came to see me, I asked her to stay and lie with me that night. At going to bed she desired my maid, the prisoner, to call her up at 6 o'clock in the morning, but she did not call her, so we got up and look'd about the house for the prisoner, she was not to be found; I found the key in my book case, I likewise found she had taken away her cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any quarrel previous to this?</p>
               <p>M. Showring. No, my Lord, none at all. I sent for Mr. Chillingworth to see if he could find her, which he did and brought her to my house the same morning betwixt 9 and 10 o'clock. [ The pillowbear produced in court and deposed to.] She had it under her arm with her cloaths in it, when brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that pillowbear?</p>
               <p>M. Showring. It was in my house the Sunday before. I believe she then put it on her own bed, in the pair of stairs room where she lay.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chillingworth. I found the prisoner in White-chapel, and told her she had no good reason for going away, and persuaded her without discovering farther to return; so she took her bundle in this pillowbear and returned with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she searched?</p>
               <p>Chillingworth. She was at the prosecutrix's house, but found no money upon her. She did not go out of my sight from the first time I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140003"></xptr> her. She owned (before she got to Mr. Alderman Chittey) in the coach, that if her mistress would pull down the coach window, she would tell her the truth; I was on the outside the coach; when it was pulled up again I heard her say she let a young fellow,

             in, in the morning betwixt 6 and 7, and that he went to the book case and took the gold and put it into his pocket; and read the note and put it into the bag again. She owned the some before the alderman; she was afterwards before my Lord Mayor, there she denied it, and said she had not seen that young man for above a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any threatnings made use of in order to her confession ?</p>
               <p>Chillingworth. No, none at all, her mistress said she would forgive her if she would tell the truth.</p>
               <p>The prosecutrix being asked, confirmed this of her confession, but said she never found any thing dishonest of her before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Edwards confirmed the whole of the prosecutrix's evidence.</p>

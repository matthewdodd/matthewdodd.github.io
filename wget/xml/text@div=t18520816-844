On Sunday, 4th July, at a little before 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing in East-street, Barking—I know the Bull corner—it is a sharp ugly corner—I saw a horse and cart coming towards London—the prisoner was driving—he was coming galloping—I should think at fourteen or fifteen miles as hour—the prisoner had a white stick in his hand, and he hit the mare with it while it was galloping—there was a girl and a boy in the cart with him—he drove round the Bull corner at the same pace—he did not pull in—one of the wheels <hi rend="italic">skidded</hi> on the ground, it did not go round at all—the other wheel was turning round, but it was not on the ground—the wheel that was on the ground was sliding along—as they were going round the corner the cart upset—there was a dead horse on the cart besides the prisoner and the two chil<lb></lb>dren—they were all thrown out—I went and took up the little girl—I saw</p>

            . I keep the Angel, public-house, Fleet-market. On the 8th of January the prisoner came in with a small basket in his hand, and had a pint of porter - he remained there about two hours, and shifted his seat from one end of the room to the other, which made me suspect him - there were two pots before him for sometime, one was missing for about ten minutes; the prisoner suspecting that we were watching him, pulled it out of his basket. When the prisoner got up to go away I wished to see his basket, and there found the prosecutor's pot and two knives, and another knife belonging to Mr. Remmington, who keeps the Mail Coach, public-house. I saw him bring the basket in.</p>

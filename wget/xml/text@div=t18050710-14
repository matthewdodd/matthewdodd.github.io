             sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Dallat, of Putney; they are soap-makers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the chesnut gelding that stood in Brown's livery stables? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen that in the possession of the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, he came to Messrs. Dallat frequently with it; I believe it to be the same horse. The first time that I saw the horse was in the beginning of April or May, I think it is about a twelvemonth back; he used to come to our house with it in a cart to buy goods there; I noticed to him that he had a good horse; his mane was not hogged then, but he had a short tail the first time I saw him; he said he had bought it cheap, for he had given only ten pounds for it; he said he should alter the horse, he did not like to be much about with him for fear of being known; whether it was on account of his being a private soap-maker, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the horse which you saw in his cart is the same horse that you saw at Mr. Brown's? - A. I have every reason to think so from his general appearance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are clerk to Messrs. Dallat, they live at Putney? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. They had a manufactory in Back-lane, Clapham? - A. Not as a soap manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed there as clerk, or at Putney? - A. At Putney; Mrs. Dallat is a tallow-chandler, she has a manufactory in Back-lane, Clapham.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any seizure having been made of five hundred pounds weight of soap some little time ago? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the seizure was made was it that you charged the prisoner at the bar with stealing this horse - was not he taken up the very same day? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you do not know when he was taken up? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first attend the Police-office, in Worship-street? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day the seizure was made? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not recollect? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you do not recollect your taking up a man for horse-stealing - that is a remarkable occurrence, and you not to recollect the day? - A. I cannot tell the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when he was to be a witness, and attend at the Court of Exchequer as a witness? - A. I heard he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him there - look at this gentleman, do you not know him? (pointing to Mr. Bentley.) - A. Yes, I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you see that man and speak to him at the Court of Exchequer? - A. I do not recollect seeing him there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known the man a long time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been a long time in the service of Mr. Dallat? - A. I never knew him as a servant, I do not think he was a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a clerk to Mr. Dallat? - A. I believe near five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you do not know that he was employed in any capacity for the last year and a half? - A. I believe he was not, I have delivered goods to him.</p>
               <p>Q. A person carrying on a soap manufactory and a shop-keeper in the country, very frequently use carts and horses - Mr. Dallat has a cart? - A. Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know your master's handwriting? - A. I have seen him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Mr. Dallat is - is he in Putney now? - A. He has lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he is? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me whether that is his hand-writing? - A. That looks like his hand-writing, I take it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, sir, whether Mr. Dallat did instruct the prisoner at the bar to buy a horse for their use? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him pay fourteen pounds<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100018"></xptr>for a horse which the prisoner said he had purchased for him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner used to be riding along the road with this horse in the cart? - A. Yes, I have seen him with this horse in the cart, I think, from April to June.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said that the prisoner told you he paid ten pounds for the horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Dr. Hayes - did not you ever tell him that he gave four pounds for the horse? - A. When I found that the horse was in the hands of Dr. Hayes, I said that Morgan told me that he gave ten pounds for the horse, and Jackson told me that he gave but four pounds; I believe that such a conversation passed between me and Mr. Brown, and there was a conversation passed between me and Dr. Hayes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to Mr. Brown that he gave four pounds? - A. I do not recollect but there might such a conversation pass between him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to Mr. Brown, in whose possession the horse was found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Brown it was not the horse that was the object, but it was the getting the prisoner out of the way, who was to be a witness on the part of the Crown? - A. I do not recollect saying that; there was a discourse about the horse, he was charged with coming dishonestly by the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, whether the horse was not the object, but that you wanted to get this man out of the way, who was to be a witness for the Crown? - A. I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect how long ago it is since you were at Mr. Brown's? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not say that? - A. No, because in conversation it might have passed, but I do not think that any such conversation passed between me and Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you recollect that expression, that he was to be a witness for the Crown against Mr. Dallat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Brown at all? - A. On the 27th of last April, Mr. Dallat had a horse owned belonging to Mr. Heale, a quaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go at all to Brown about this business? - A. Yes; Mr. Corder, a quaker, came, and said it was a stolen horse; we were summoned up to Worship-street to give evidence against Staples about that horse; Mr. Corder told us there were nineteen horses missing round Chelmsford, and counting over the horses he mentioned a horse like that which Morgan had; from that the inquiry was made, and it was proved to be the horse, and from that Morgan was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he apprehended at the instance of yourself and Mr. Dallat? - A. I believe Mr. Corder was the principal man at Springfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this horse being mentioned was merely accidental? - A. Yes; I was there upon another business concerning a horse that was stolen from Mrs. Dallat's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever employ you to work it in any way? - A. Yes, to cart with it, and he has often told me not to stop with it on the road, but to take care of the horse, and let nobody see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse in Brown's stables? - A. I saw the horse at Worship-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have been employed by the prisoner, and you have frequently gone out with the horse and cart in the night-time, as well as the day? - A. Never but once at night, and that was with Morgan.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you your hire when you went out? - A. Morgan; I first took the place for half a guinea; he never paid me more than fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you would go to Mr. Dallat, and ask him if he did not allow the prisoner a guinea a week to pay you? - A. I am sure I never said that; Morgan paid me; I do not know who I was employed for; he employed me in Parson's Green-lane.</p>

             sworn. - On Friday, the 21st of June, I, Bishop, and Vickery, executed this warrant on the prisoner; he was then at work at shoe-making, in King-street, Golden-square; we took him to the Office, and the horse was produced at the Office by Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Harris is wrong in what he says; he has worked in the place, and has gone backwards and forwards to Dallats' manufactory, so has Carpenter; Carpenter took the soap from the private works, and took it to Clapham; Carpenter was sent by Dallat to me, and shewed me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100019"></xptr>the place, and he has gone in the road in the cart frequently. He says in the month of May the horse was brought to him, whereas I took it home to Mr. Dallat in the beginning of January to get my money which I paid Richards for it; Richards in the mean time went over to Dallat for the money, he being a man that Dallat had employed; he had bought horses for him before. I took the horse to Mr. Dallat; he said he would give me fourteen pounds to pay Richards; he met me at Richard's, and there he received the fourteen pounds; he gave a seven pound note, a two pound note, and a five pound note, to pay for the horse. At that time the horse was at work, and after the seizure took place I kept the horse for a matter of a fortnight; I asked Dallat what I was to do with this horse; I said, I have no money, I cannot keep the horse any longer, do you mean to keep it, or to sell it; he said cash was short, I might sell it; Staples came over to me, and said he had got a man to buy it, and he would bring him to me; I was out when Mr. Brown came, as Mr. Brown says; I took the horse to Mr. Brown, and there I sold him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Brown.) Q. Tell us what it was that Carpenter said to you (the witness that has been examined,) when he was speaking about the horse? - A. It was on Friday, the 14th of June, that Carpenter came along with another man; he went into my stable to see this chesnut gelding; he would have taken the horse out of the stable, saying it was a stolen horse, had it not been for my servant saying he was not at home; the next day three of them came, Mr. Carpenter, Mr. Corder, a quaker, and Mr. Dring.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Dring? - A. He is a tallow-chandler and dealer in soap; I had shifted the horse, thinking I would not give him up except they gave me a description of him; I understood from them that it was the quaker's brother that had lost the horse, and that he was a bay horse; I told them that description would not answer; they told me that I had no occasion to let them see the horse, for the horse was not the object, - that neither I nor Dr. Hayes should be any loser, or be disturbed, or to that purpose, for the person that I bought him of was Morgan, who was a principal evidence in the Court of Exchequer, and they believed that he had bought him of a man of the name of Richards for four pounds, who was implicated with the evidence in the Exchequer. This conversation was about the brown horse, and when I came to shew them this horse, it was not the horse that Morgan had in his possession; after that Mr. Corder found an owner for the horse, and it was from that partly that this horse was claimed.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a surveyor of the Excise? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend as a witness last week at the Court of Exchequer? - A. I attended the Court of Exchequer by order of the Court of Excise, but not as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar there? - A. I did, he was attending as a witness.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was this? - A. On the 9th instant, the day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the witness, Carpenter, there? - A. I did, he was very near to him; the prisoner passed very near to him, twice I am certain of; the prisoner passed Carpenter in custody of the turnkey of this prison in his way to be locked up, where the witnesses are generally locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing whether they made any observations one with another? - A. It was my particular business to do that; I was to keep the witnesses apart by order of the solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the witness took any notice of the prisoner? - A. I observed him to look very hard at the prisoner more than once or twice, and at his wife and children; I am certain that he saw him, he looked extremely hard at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me when the seizure of the soap was made at Clapham - was it before or after this man was taken up for horse-stealing? - A. Before the prisoner was taken up, I should imagine, four or five days.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I am a surgeon and apothecary.</p>

               <p>Q. You bought a horse of the witness, Brown, which turns out to be a stolen horse - do you recollect having any conversation with the witness, Carpenter, about the horse? - A. He told me that the horse was certainly stolen, that, in fact, Morgan had given him to understand so.</p>
               <p>Q. Morgan was not present at this time? - A. No; Mr. Brown was present; he said then that Morgan gave but four pounds for the horse; he added that I might judge from that whether the horse was honestly come by or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you that ten pounds were given for the horse? - A. No; Mr. Brown produced a receipt which was signed by Brown, shewing that he purchased the horse, and observed that it was a very hard thing to lose the money; Mr. Carpenter replied that neither Mr. Dallat, nor Mr. Corder (whom I afterwards saw, who is one of the people called quakers,) would desire Mr. Brown or me to be a sufferer, because Morgan was an important witness in a trial impending, and that it was material to remove him on account of his evidence; he afterwards said there had been an information laid against the Dallats.</p>
               <p>Q. He used the term in the plural number then - there had been an information against the Dallats? - A. Yes, and they were likely to be fined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100020"></xptr>to a heavy amount; this is all that passed on that particular topic.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not mistake what passed, you are certain to the conversation? - A. I am certain of it, that he said, that Morgan gave four pounds for the horse, while we were in Worship-street.</p>

            , the wife, was standing then in the entry with Peach; I said, I have a warrant to search this house; I went through the bottom apartment, the kitchen I believe it is, but I soon returned; I then proceeded to go up stairs; the woman then, it might be the alarm of seeing four of us, just touched me with her hands; I followed up stairs, hearing Ferris say, here, here; I came up three pair of stairs to a garret door from the street door; the door appeared to have something which kept it fast at the bottom; Wray and Ferris being at the back of me, I did get in; I was shoved in by their force and my own; when I came in, I found the prisoner, the father, just half bent, or had got up, I don't know which, and from that I believed it might be his keeping the door; I saw no spar nor nothing against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to open the door before you got in? - A. I did not; the father, son, and daughter, were in the room; I then acquainted them I had a warrant to search the house; with that a scuffle ensued between me and the father, and kept on, I dare say, for ten or twelve minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a scuffle was it that continued for ten minutes? - A. A fair fight between him and me; on the left hand there was a fire-place, with a fire made of coke, I believe it is, with an iron plate on it, with some round pieces of the size of shillings and sixpences; they got kicked off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the colour of those pieces on the plate? - A. They appeared white; after the three prisoners that were in the room were secured, on the right-hand side of the room I found this trough, with stuff, called black mould, or sand, in it, and this half mould on it, with these filed and round impressions complete in it; at that time, before it had been disturbed, it was all complete; by taking them to the different examinations, they were rubbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The impressions were more perfect than they are now? - A. Yes; the round impressions were; on the floor, within about a yard where this trough was (producing the frame the other side of the mould,) was this laying; it his the mould; it laid with the mould apparently kicked or fell out, with this money lying by the side of it, (producing some shillings and sixpences;) these are, I believe, the pattern shillings and sixpences, with this half-crown; there are two sixpences that appear to have some of the mould or sand on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. All this money you have now produced, are all of them good money, and you call them pattern shillings and sixpences? - A. Yes; this counterfeit half-crown (producing it,) I found in the rough, that is unfinished, among the coals, after we put the fire out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By unfinished, you mean unfit for circulation? - A. Yes, it bears the date of 1745, with the word Lima, and I believe, from all the observations I could make, it might be cast from that good half-crown; in one corner of the room I found these, which I believe are called blue pots, filled, (producing them;) there are four of them; they are filled with grease and bits of cotton, or something of that sort; I have lit one of them to try, and they will burn like a torch or candle; they are used, I believe, for what they deem it smoaking the mould, to dry it, that it may make a very fine impression, otherwise it would be damp, and the impression would not be fine and clear; here is a bag, (producing it,) I found in the same room; I believe it has fine rotten-stone in it; the bag is shook, because the mould would not be so fine as this; it is done over any thing they wish to cast; here are three pair of tongs, (producing them;) the fire being exceeding hot, and the plates, when listed on and off, must be done with these tongs; these two pair, I believe, are to handle the blue pots that may have metal in them; here is a fine sieve,(producing it,) which, I believe, the mould is run through with the hand this way (describing it shoved about with the hand;) these two screws, when the metal is poured in the moulds, are to press down and make the two sides of the mould keep close together.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Pressing that together, the impression both on one side and the other is left? - A. Yes; here is a pot, (producing an iron pot,) with a quantity of fat in it; this was in the same room in the corner where the blue pots were; here are three odd frames for moulds, unfit for use; they have been broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare the impressions made upon the mould you first produced, with any of the silver produced? - A. No; I did not presume to do that, least I should break them, but in the face of this Court (the shillings were laid on the mould, and shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the condition of the prisoners' persons? - A. Yes; the men were then without their hats, in waistcoats, and slippers, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300069"></xptr>no buckles in them, and dirty hands; the girl was in a bed-gown; I know nothing of her hands; I never saw the mother in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the kind of dirt on their hands? - A. As if they had been handling the moulds; by my handling the stuff, my hands got like theirs.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had these implements been apparently in use recently? - A. Yes, they had; I was by in the room while the things were found by the other officers, but have had them in my care locked up ever since.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. I am an officer: I went with Armstrong and the other officers to the prisoner's house, on the 26th of October; I went up into the garret with Armstrong and Ferris; Armstrong got into the room first; I went in next to him; I observed three of the prisoners at the bar in the room very dirty and very black; the elderly man had a pair of very dirty trowsers on; his face, and hands and arms, were prodigiously black; I think, to the best of my knowledge, he had his shirt sleeves tucked up; he had no coat nor hat on; I immediately turned myself round upon the left hand, I saw a fire, and on that fire there was an iron plate covered apparently with base money; there was a great deal of what they called coke lying down by it; we endeavoured to secure the two men, and in doing that a scuffle ensued; I observed the girl then go to the fire, and kick up her foot against the iron plate on the fire; I went immediately and got hold of her, to keep her from going to the fire again; while Armstrong and Ferris were engaging with the men, the girl was very mischievous; I did not like to use any violence while I had hold of her to keep her from going to the fire; the son had got away from Ferris, and came and knocked me down; I got up again; he was coming the second time, and I knocked him down; he then was secured; I then went to the fire, and raked out some base money, which I have here; I believe here is one shilling and three sixpences, which are good; they had sell into the crevice of a brick by the fire; here is a base half-crown that was lying close to the fire on the cinders.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether this which you say is a base half. crown, is fit for circulation? - A. I believe it is; here is another half-crown I took out of the fire; while the son knocked me down, the girl went to the fire immediately and kicked it very violent with her foot two or three times; we then secured the girl, and, with the tongs, I got this crucible out of the fire full of metal, just sit for pouring. (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Except that it was fit for pouring, it was in the state it is? - A. Yes; there had been something apparently broke in the fire; by the side of the fire upon the floor, there was a great deal of blanched copper; there had been a phial thrown in the fire; here is some more base money which I took out of the fire; there are four among them which appear to be patterns; we secured the prisoners, and they were taken to prison; I returned to the house in company with Armstrong, and Mrs. Simmons; we went back with her, there being a large fire, to see that all was safe; under one of the windows in the garret, apparently one of these moulds had been upset or kicked up; it was broke into pieces, into quarters; I picked up a piece, and on it were two King George the Second's shillings, both heads; Mrs. Simmons was then in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you clearly perceive the mark of 
               <persName id="t17961130-47-person435">

             the Second? - A. Very clearly indeed, they were very perfect; I found a bottle in the fire; there had been a half-pint phial thrown in the fire, which had had something in it, but I could not tell what; the ashes were wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You say in the part of the mould you could clearly distinguish the two heads of

               <p>Q. This was not at the first search? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the shillings now produced answer to that mark? - A. I did not find any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a half-crown? - A. I did.</p>

            , up stairs? - A. No; only in the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You observed her hands, that they were black? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a colour that appeared to be by something lately done, or had it been a long time on her hands? - A. By something lately done.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Whether that blackness could not have proceeded from handling the shovel in the fireplace? - A. I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was it a blackness that proceeded from cleaning fire-irons? - A. It is more likely from cleaning the fire-irons.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did it appear to be a black that might proceed from cleaning the fire irons? - A. More likely to have proceeded from cleaning the fire-irons than handling the poker or tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it proceeded from doing what was done up stairs? - A. It might, I could not judge.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. I went with Armstrong, and the rest of them, to the house of the prisoners at the bar; I went up stairs first, when I got up to the garret-door, I looked under the door, and there I saw the father and son on one side of the room where the flask was, the daughter was near the fire very busy there; I called out, here, come up here; directly comes Armstrong and Wray, and then the father and son got right up against the door, I tried to push it open with my staff and could not get it open; then us three pushed against it, and Armstrong got in first; then I caught hold of the son, and Armstrong hold of the father, we were going to handcuff them, and got the hand-cuffs part of the way round the hands; directly they parted, and begun a scuffle; I threw the son down and I fell upon him, he turned me over some how, and got up first, then he ran towards the fire-place and struck Wray; then I got hold of him again, and got him up into the other corner, and there I knocked him down; then he said, he would not make any more resistance, and Armstrong at that time had knocked the father down; we helped him up, and then we handcuffed them together; in the scuffle, some how, one of the moulds was kicked up; when we first went in, the mould that was kicked up had shillings and sixpences upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of perceiving that clearly? - A. I had; then we went to the fire-place, for, in the mean time, the daughter had kicked up all the money on the plate into the fire, I tied her with a handkerchief to the father; then I begun to get what I could out of the fire of the money, it was all, apparently, white before it was kicked into the fire; we searched about the room, and found the things that are produced; this is the plate that had the money on when it was on the fire; there were several other plates in the room, but not on the fire; (producing them); here is a pan, it was almost full of liquor, I don't know what it was that was kicked down; here is a pair of shears that were found in the room; I found some money; (produces it); there is one, I believe, a good shilling, and one a bad one, I found them all about the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any counterfeit shillings fit for circulation? - A. I don't think there is one fit for circulation; here is a Queen Ann that is a counterfeit; here are many different sorts of bad shillings which were all on the plate, on the fire, when I first went into the room, they appeared very white then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Did you find a shilling or a sixpence fit for circulation? - A. I did not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>ARMSTRONG called again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. You have had a great deal of practice and experience in apprehending coiners? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge and experience in these things, and looking at all the implements and things now produced, do the whole make a complete set of instruments and apparatus for casting coin fit for circulation? - A. I should believe so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. With respect to the wife, you have told us she never was up stairs? - A. I never saw her there.</p>
               <p>Q. She never had any communication with any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300071"></xptr>body up stairs? - A. Not to my knowledge, if she had, I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand as to the mould or flask, one part of it was perfect, the other imperfect? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not fit for use? - A. One part was; while I was engaged with Mr. Simmons, the other part was kicked down.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long had you been engaged with Mr. Simmons? - A. Ten or twelve minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. The money you produce, saving one half-crown, is all good? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not one of the base ones are fit for circulation? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any piece of base money fit for circulation? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a half-crown, is that in the state it was found? - A. Wray found it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other calculated to be passed but that? - A. I produced all I found; no other but that.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mould or impression fit for casting a half-crown? - A. Here is a piece in the middle knocked out.</p>
               <p>Q. What that was for you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no mould for casting a half-crown? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that space in the mould large enough for half-a-crown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not as big as the palm of your hand? - A. Yes; much larger than half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. That is surrounded by what you call the impression of shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the other part, any impression that answered to a half-crown? - A. I could not see any.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you knew the business this man was of? - A. No; I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know he was a buckle-caster? - A. No; I saw in one window, which was dusty, seven or eight rims, without tongues or chapes; I saw no moulds or impressions, or any thing like it, that induced me to think he was casting rims for buckles.</p>

               <p>Q. I asked you whether you have any reason from any thing you did see, to know what was his business? - A. I saw rims, from six to eight.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was a buckle-caster, or caster of any thing, were not every one of those things, except the mould, calculated for that business? - A. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. In answer to a question, whether that was a complete apparatus for coining, you said, yes? - A. I said, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not aqua-fortis used? - A. There is a pickle used.</p>
               <p>Q. Of that you found none? - A. There was some wet on the floor, but I don't know what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not rubbing necessary, with cork? - A. I never did find cork at any place where there was casting.</p>
               <p>Q. You found none here? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not, to your knowledge, think that necessary? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a file necessary for filing that that is cast all round? - A. I don't know, I found none.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ever find any file when you have apprehended other coiners? - A. I never took but one before, where there was casting.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all your knowledge is acquired since you took these people up? - A. Yes; I never saw the same apparatus before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand that those shears are sufficient to cut a piece of metal round and perfect? - A. I suppose the spray is cut off by these shears.</p>
               <p>Q. (Shewing him the base half-crown). Could a pair of shears cut that base half-crown as round, as smooth, and as polished as that good one is now? - A. I believe, after the spray is cut off, it is rubbed on the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how it is rubbed? - A. I have seen other money rubbed on a thin board; I have seen in some places, rounding engines, and in other places, boards, on which they are rubbed; I saw a piece of sack nailed or laid down on the ground, so wet with the liquid, that I could not form an idea of the use of it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no rounding engine or board found here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a reward upon the conviction of coiners? - A. I have had the share of a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that? - A. The share of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Would rubbing it in soft sand on a board make it complete for circulation? - A. I should believe it would.</p>
               <p>Q.With respect to this mould, I understand when you saw it first, you saw some patterns lying upon it? - A. No, Ferris saw that; I only saw some lying by the side.</p>
               <p>Q. JOHN NICHOL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am one of the Moniers of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this money, and the other shillings produced by Armstrong, as patterns, are they good? - A. I don't see any bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these four half-crowns, and say which of them are good, and which are bad? - A. There are three bad and one good.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that is in such a state as to be fit for circulation? - A. I have no doubt of it, I should take it myself without particularly observing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round the edge, and say if any part is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300072"></xptr>more unfinished than the rest, is there any projection that feels rough to the hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that have remained there if a file had been used to it? - A. Very probably a file would leave a rougher mark than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those shillings? - A. Here are three bad and two good.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. The half-crown is such, that skilled as you are, you should have taken it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you think that is an apparatus sufficient for coining? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Might those shillings have been cast in that mould? - A. I think it possible.</p>
               <p>The prisoners all left their defences to their Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. (To Wray). Q. Did you observe when you were in the room, some silver laying upon the surface of the moulds? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that any of those pieces were shillings, sixpences, or half-crowns? - A. They seemed to be some of all, shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that they appeared to be shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns, you are positive in that? - A. I am, it did appear to me so.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Armstrong). Q. You produced the mould where the vacancy is, did you ever see the part that was to be on that place, in a perfect state? - A. No; it was kicked up.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wray). Q. Did you see the part that was to be put in that vacancy in the mould, in such a state so as to know what it was? - A. I picked up a part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there was any impression upon that part, of a half-crown? - A. There was not, that I could see, there were shillings on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any vacancy on the mould, where the impression of a half-crown might have been? - A. I could not perceive it, for a great deal of it was trod upon to pieces</p>

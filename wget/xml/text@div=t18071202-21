               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar on board the hoy at the time you went to bed. - A. I never saw him till I took him. On the night of the 19th of November I heard the footsteps of a man over my head, I considered it to be the officer that had the charge of the liquor: I got out of bed, I listened, I heard a spilling of liquor or water; I instantly went on deck, there I saw the prisoner at the bar with a bladder in his hand; I asked him what he did there, he said nothing; I said you have a bladder in your hand; he then said he begged I would consider his wife and family</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an empty bladder, or full of any thing. - A. It had a bulk, it had the appearance as though it was full.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bladder. - A. I compelled the prisoner to go down into my cabin; in my forcing him down in my cabin it fell over, or whether he threw it down I do not know; I got the bladder afterwards by the assistance of two fishermen's boys laying at Billingsgate stairs; I called to them, they got a lanthorn and found it; when I came on shore the boys gave it me; I delivered it to Mr. Clark, who keeps the King's Head public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity might there be in the bladder. - A. I cannot say, I looked at the cask, there were two spile holes; when I turned the cask it leaked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. It was impossible for you to tell us what was in the bladder, you neither know the contents of the puncheon that was in the vessel, or whether the bladder that was found was the same bladder. - A. I cannot say any more than I believe it was this bladder, it had a pipe in it.</p>

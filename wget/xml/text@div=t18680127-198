               <p>be had to communicate an important matter, and that he wished to speak to an officer of the Embassy, but only one—he spoke in German—I said that we were all officers of the embassy, and that he could say what he knew—I communicated with the Baron von Schmidhals, and he and the prisoner went into, another room-after a short time he came from the room, and went out—on the 9th he came again—I had no conversation with him then—on the 10th he came, and I had some conversation with him—he told me that Mr. Emerich had come from Paris about six months ago, and that he had lived here in very needy circumstances with him at 1, Osborn Place, Whitechapel, on the money that he, the prisoner, had given him—he said that Emerich was a Hanoverian, and a soldier of the Hanoverian army, hut that he had nothing to do then, that he was a very desperate man, and that he had the intention as long as he had known him to kill the King, of Prussia—he said that Emerich was in communication latterly with high persons, and that he had received very much money—I afterwards went with the prisoner to some place where he had said he had been with Emerich-the first was 14, Hinde Street, Manchester Square-that was the house where he said Emerich had been sometimes, and where he had received money—we afterwards went to 20, Eaton Place, where the Baron Blome resided-that was also pointed out to me by the prisoner as a house where Emerich had received money-Baron Blome was the representative in this country of the late kingdom of Hanover.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Secretary to the Prussian Embassy-these two documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were written by me on the 8th and 9th of January at the prisoner's ictation-they bear his signature and my own. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"London, 8th January, 1868.) I lodged here in London for upwards of six months with a certain William Emerich, who stated himself to be a Hanoverian officer, and that he had arrived from Paris. At first this person was entirely without means, but after a while he received money from various sources, among others from a certain Hanoverian Baron, who resides in Eaton Place. Ultimately Emerich became continually more mysterious, and talked about a duty he had to fulfil: he must avenge George, his King, on the King of Prussia. I drew his attention to the fact that in reality Count Bismarck was the instigator, but he persisted in his view. Yesterday he suddenly startled for Berlin, and I have just now received this letter. As Emerich is a desperate man, and asserts himself to be in posession of Orsini shell, I felt myself in duty bound to give infor<lb></lb>mation about his criminal intention. Further interest in the matter I have not, as I am not a Prussian subject. Emerich is a member of the Society of aithful Hanoverians, and lived here without work, and, as I believe, on funds which were placed at his disposal. Signed, Gustave Victor." "London, January 9th, 1868. The Baron of whom I made mention yesterday is, as I have just ascertained, the Baron Blome. I was myself with Emerich at Baron Blome's about three weeks ago, and waited outside the house. I don't know if Emerich has had personal interviews with Baron Blome. The interview that he had three weeks ago lasted about an hour. Emerich has on other occasions, doubtless, received assistance from Baron Blome, as he changed directly after leaving him a sovereign at a public-house. Signed, Gustave Victor." This is the letter referred to in the first of these papers:—"Cannon Street Station. My dear Gustave, in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801270055"></xptr>
               <p>hurry I write you only these few lines as adieu. I put thee on thy oath to keep the promise that thou gavest me. Farewell, and pray for thy faith<lb></lb>ful friend, Wilhelm Emerich. If God will give me His blessing I will return to London. Farewell." In consequence of these communications with the prisoner I felt it prudent to communicate with my Government in Prussia by telegram, on the 9th.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801270056"></xptr>
               <p>description-Victor described him in the presence of Mr. Reeck as a man thirty-six years of age, as tall as me, and I am six feet, with dark brown hair, and a moustache fairer than his hair—he said the first four months of his acquaintance with him he was dressed very seedy, and the last two months he was dressed like a gentleman-the description which the other man gave of Emerich was, that he was about twenty-two or twenty-three years old, with black curly hair and a dark brown moustache, and always dressed like a gentleman—I said to him, "Always?" and he said, "Yes, always, during the six months I have known him, and always had plenty of money, and lived in a French hotel in Leicester Square"—in fact he said, "I have dined there with him"-when he said that, the prisoner made a sign to him, and the man then said, "In fact, I am so confused, I have been drinking; another time I will be able to give you a better description"—I said to him, "Where can I see you?"—he said, "I have business in Whitechapel, but I live at Brompton, but if you write to me in the name of Mr. Simon, at Gatti's Coffee-house, Adelaide Street, Strand, I will meet you anywhere"—I have inquired there, and no Mr. Simon is known-the whole of this conversation took place in the pri<lb></lb>soner's presence, and in the presence of Mr. Kenipe, a friend of Baron Blome's-the prisoner speaks as good English as I do.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Hinde Street, Manchester Square—I am a Hanoverian, in the service of his Majesty the King of Hanover—I do not know a person of the name of Emerich—I never gave a person bearing or assuming that name any money for any purpose whatever—I was abroad from 12th November to 6th December.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a long address, through the interpreter, entered into a detailed explanation of the different interviews he had with the Baron Schmidals, and the other witnesses, as indicated in his cross-examination. He declared that he had no object in what he did but that of relieving his mind of the secret with which he had been entrusted by Emerich; that he compromised no one, and, so far from desiring to obtain money, he had determined upon returning the few shillings that had been given to him, and should have done so but for being taken into custody. In the course of his address he put in letters addressed by him to the Prussian Embassy, of which the following are trans<lb></lb>lations</hi>:—"London, January, 13th, 1868. Sir, I am sorry I cannot come myself, being busy; if you have need of me, please to give my friend, the bearer of this, a few lines for me. It will be very agreeable to me if you do not trouble me any more, and I am sorry I cannot render you any further assistance in this affair. Please to receive the assurance of my profoundest esteem and devotion. (Signed) Gustav Victor." "London, January 14th, 1868. Sir, It is my duty to address yet a few lines to you. My friend tells me that you will give me a reward if I can to-day discover the residence of Emerich for you. You know that I have run about in rain and storm last week, and that my health was jeopardized in this weather. I have not even recovered the expenses I incurred in riding every time into the City and back. If you are an intelligent man, and on the whole know to appreciate a man who can render you such a service, you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801270058"></xptr>
               <p>will understand that I cannot lose my time this week about an affair which brings me in nothing, and interests you more than me. Until now I have only done my duty, and now, if you want to have a proof that my in<lb></lb>formations are correct, I will guarantee to tell you within twenty-four hours that Emerich is in Berlin, &amp;c. You will understand yourself that I cannot present myself to a respectable person in the state in which I find myself at present; if you give me the necessary means to present myself respectable in three houses I am ready to find out the affair in a few hours. If you will do your duty, you will give my friend a cheque for a clothing magazine and a little money to buy necessaries. It is impossible for me to gain the end in view in any other way, as you will understand yourself, and it is the highest time now for that, as my reason tells me, perhaps. Receive the assurance of my profoundest esteem and devotion. (Signed) Gustav Victor."</p>

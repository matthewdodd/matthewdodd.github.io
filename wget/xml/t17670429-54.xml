We stopped the Newington stage, and robbed four gentlemen that were in it and a gentlewoman; we got five guineas in gold and some silver, a gold watch and a coat; Sweetman insisted on having the coat, and the gentlemen would not give it him, so Brown struck at him. We went home; Gorman had the watch: we put five halfpence in a hat and hussled for it, and he hussled four heads, so the watch remained in his possession.

               <p>with a hue and cry and "Stop thief" he ran across the common for some distance, and then took to the road till he came to a gap in the hedge; he got through that, crossed a field, and over the railway; at that point several other persons joined in the chase—he came to a bank of the railway, and was obliged to return; he got over a gate, where his clothes caught in some nails; he hung there for a few moments till his clothes gave way and he dropped down, and ultimately he ran into a house close by, where he was captured—I came up and said, "What have you done with the packet the boy gave you?"—he said, "I don't know, you have worried me so"—the packet was found under a couch in the room where he was—it was in the same state as it is now, bearing the post-stamp of that day—I went back to the place where he had hung by the nails, and there found the letter of advice—after the prisoner was taken to the post-office at Boxmoor, he said he had been sent to the post-office by an American, a friend of his, to call for it, and he was to have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the job; "he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account this morning, as I had not enough money to travel with"—I then produced the money<lb></lb>order for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said, This was received by Mr. Benson, of Ludgate Hill, yesterday, with a letter requesting that a gold chain might he sent of the value of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>; I also produced the advice, and said that had been taken out at Frogmore End for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and had since been altered to 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "I took out the order, and afterwards handed it to the American, who afterwards gave it back to me with certain instructions"—I asked him his name and address, and he said, "J.

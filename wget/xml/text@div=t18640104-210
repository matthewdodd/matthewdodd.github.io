                  </hi>. I am toll collector of Lam beth-bridge—on Sunday night, 27th December, I was on the Surrey side taking tolls—the prisoner came up and paid with a shilling—I placed it on one side, while I took the halfpence from other people—I then gave the prisoner 11 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he went on—about two minutes afterwards I discovered that the shilling was bad, and sent a man after the prisoner, who brought him back, and I told him he had given me a bad shilling—he said that he was not aware of it; he was sorry for it, he had just changed a half-crown for some tobacco—he asked to look at it—I allowed him to do so—he put it in his mouth, and I believe he swallowed it—I sent for a policeman, and he was given in custody—I saw him put his hand to his mouth a second time, putting something in, and he made the attempt to swallow something—I followed to the station, two or three yards behind, and as the prisoner passed, I saw something like metal fall into an area in Paradise-street—I Saw Mr. Tricks go into the area, and find a bad shilling—I cannot say whether it was the one the prisoner had given me; but I am quite sure the one uttered to me was bad.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I changed a half-crown for half an ounce of tobacco, and with the change I must have taken this shilling. After it was given back to me, not having got any pockets in my clothes, I put it in my mouth, and having some tobacco there which I wanted to spit out, the shilling and the tobacco came out together. No man in England can swear that I ever uttered a bad coin to my knowledge; my eyes are very bad, as is well known to the Governor of the Gaol. My spectacles were broken, and I could not see whether the shilling was bad or good.</p>

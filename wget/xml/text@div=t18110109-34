               <p>GEORGE CORFIELD. Q. You are a partner with Mr. Gregg - A. I am a partner in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Blair - A. He has been a clerk of ours two years, he was book keeper and collecting clerk, he collected all our debts.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do with your banking-book - A. It was his peculiar duty every Monday morning to check the bankers book.</p>
               <p>Q. We are told that Bruce and Co. are your bankers - A. They are. Besides keeping the ledger, it was his particular duty, every Monday morning to check the bankers book, so that every Monday morning he called at the bankers for our book, brought it home with the checks that had been drawn, and having checked the amount, he gave both to Mr. Gregg and myself the balance.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean an account of the balance - A. Yes, the statement of the balance. It was his business to point out any error that was in that book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Vaughan. Was he acquainted with your manner of drawing blank checks with the house - A. Perfectly. I am in the habit of drawing nineteen checks out of twenty, and I therefore use the printed checks, Mr. Gregg uses plain paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you authorize any body to draw for you - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Were this printed forms accessable to the prisoner Blair - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you given to him checks that you have drawn upon the house - A. Frequently.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know from him where he had been living before - A. He had been living with the bankers between two and three years of Bruce and Co. before he came to live with me.</p>
               <p>Q. I beg you to look at that check; I believe you have it in your hand, tell me whether that is your signature, whether the words Gregg and Corfield is your signature - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the signature of Mr. Gregg - A. Certainly not, it is meant to resemble my hand, it resembles my hand, I am perfectly sure it is not my hand; I always fill up the body of the check myself, except in some cases, a young man who is standing here fills them up for me.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a particular clerk that fills up the body of the check - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Vaughan. Is the body of that check in his hand writing - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the body of the check in your hand writing - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me in whose hand writing the check is - A. I can form a judgment, I believe the date of the check, 15th November, and the name of the payee to be in the hand writing of the prisoner Blair, it is not his natural hand to be sure, it is disguised; I believe I hold in my hand the check by which it was made.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Blair on Thursday, the 15th of November - A. I do, at the banking-house, I think between three and four in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the 15th of November a holiday - A. I do not think it was; the stock brokers are very busy at that hour; it is the clearing hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon his application to you for the change of twenty shillings, tell me what passed - A. I told him change was very scarce, I hardly could spare it; he pressed me very hard for it, I therefore gave it him principally in sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give us any correct notion how long it was either previous or subsequent to it that note was presented - A. I cannot; I believe it was between three and four in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Blair at any other hour - A. Yes, at nearly five.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time that you have been speaking of between three and four was the time that Mr. Gray shewed the check - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. You do not mean to speak with any degree of certainty whether it was between three and four or five - A. The first time was between three and four.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Blair - A. Yes, and the prisoner Dale; I knew Blair about a fortnight before the 14th of November, and I knew Dale about half a year before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of meeting 
               <persName id="t18110109-34-person406">Blair</persName>
             that fortnight before the 14th of November - A. At Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How often might you meet him in Newgate before the 15th of November last - A. Not above two or three times in all. I met him on the 14th in company of Hitchen and Roberts; Hitchen sent for me to go to Newgate, I went on the 14th, Hitchen told me Blair was present, he wanted me to go to get a check changed, Blair told me I must come again the next day, Thursday the 15th, at twelve o'clock; I went the next day at twelve o'clock, I found Roberts and Hitchen, a little after that Blair came in, they then were all in conversation together, Roberts, Hitchen and Blair; I was walking up and down the ward; I was ordered by either Hitchen or Blair to go out with Blair; Blair took me to the Prerogative office in Doctors Commons; Blair told me I was to get a porter to give the check to in Doctors Commons on the Wednesday, he told me I was to get a porter at the Prerogative office to get the check changed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on the Thursday he took you to the Prerogative office, he told you to get a porter - A. Yes, on the Thursday, he told me I must not come in the hat, which I had on, which was a straw hat; he told me then to meet him a little past Doctors Commons, and St. Pauls church-yard; we went both into a public-house, he called for two slices of bread and cheese, and a pot of beer; he told me to meet him exactly at three o'clock, at the Tobit's Dog in St. Paul's church-yard; I parted with him then at twelve o'clock, he left me eating the bread and cheese. Dale came in soon after Blair went out, Blair did not see him as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you how Dale came to meet you at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090031"></xptr>time - A. I had appointed him on the morning of the Thursday; I went to Westminster before I went to Newgate; I set off from Westminster about eleven o'clock along with Dale, Robinson, Hooker, and myself, all came from Westminster together, and coming home I told Dale I had got to go to Newgate to get a check changed; I understood for Mr. Hitchen, and I was to get a porter. He said he would be porter, I said you may if you like; with that, upon the top of Fleet-market, me and Dale left Hooker and Robinson, and came to Newgate just before twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. You have said it was for Hitchen, were Robinson and Hooker present - A. I told Dale to himself as we were coming along. In consequence of what I told Dale, Dale came in after Blair went out, I was eating the bread and cheese; I told him I was to get a porter, he said he would be porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether you met Blair at three o'clock - A. I think about two or three minutes before the clock struck; I went in, and met Blair exactly at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When Blair came in the Tobit's Dog was any body else there - A. There were two or three servant girls. Blair set down on my left side, he put the check into my hands folded up, I never opened it. He told me to send a porter to Bartholomew-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that is the paper he put into your hand - A. I observed these small figures, he told me that was of no consequence. I never opened the check, the figures were exactly like unto these. He never put any other check into my hand, and I never put any other check than this into Dale's hand; I never had it out of this hand until I delivered it to Dale.</p>
               <p>Q. When he put it into your hand did he say any more to you than the porter was to take it to Bartholomew-lane - A. He told me I must give it to the porter in Doctors Commons, and go out myself from the Prerogative office, and also put a pen into my hand; he told me to let him see me give it to the porter the check; the pen was into this hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any use made of the pen - A. No; he directed me to hold the pen in my hand; I do not know what for no more than you. He told me I was to go to the top of Paternoster-row, and stand there till he came back. That was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now having stated what became of him, and what became of you - A. He went along St. Paul's church-yard, leading to Cheapside; I turned to go to Doctors Commons to look for Dale to give this check to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Dale - A. Yes; I went to the Prerogative office according to his desire.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you now whether when you found Dale at the Prerogative office you delivered the check to him - A. Yes, I delivered it to him at the bottom of the street; I am quite sure that the check that I delivered to Dale was the check that I received from Blair; Blair was in the street, I saw Blair look to see whether I gave the check to Dale, he saw me do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Having given the check to Dale what became of you - what became of Dale and Blair - A Directly I gave the check to Dale he set off to Bartholomew-lane. I looked and saw the other set off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner Blair walking in a direction to Bartholomew-lane - A. They both went there, they walked separate; I soon lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might elapse before you saw either and which of them again - A. About twenty minutes or half an hour elapsed before I saw either of them again. I saw Blair first at the top of Paternoster-row, that was the place he appointed to meet me; Blair came all of a sweat, I then thought it was all wrong, and a bad piece of business; I was frightened; he said to me, I saw the money paid, and the check filed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked him any questions upon the subject - A. Not a word; he spoke to me first, he then walked fast off, I followed. After walking about fifty yards he said, have you got the money? I said no, I thought you were going for it yourself; he said, go and look after the porter. We parted. I went to Doctors Commons, I saw Dale, he was walking very fast on one side of Doctors Commons, I went to get up to him, he held his hand up, and said,</p>
               <p>"be off, be off, I am followed;" I tried to get up to him to catch him, I could not, he got away, I lost sight of him, I gave up the pursuit, and went to look after Blair, I found Blair between the top of St. Paul's church-yard, and the end of the Old Bailey, I told him the man was run away, I could not find him; he seemed to say nothing at all to it; I continued a little with him, I told him, I thought he thought I had the money; I did not tell him so then, I desired to go with him to Hitchen and Roberts, to let them see I had not the money, that the man had run away with it, if he had got it; he went and I went with him to Newgate, I saw Hitchen and Roberts in his presence, they were altogether in conversation, they seemed to make a laugh at me; I told them if the man had got the money I knew nothing of it, he had run away; I assured them I had none at all of it; I told them altogether; Blair told me to go to the Tobit's Dog, back again immediately; I went out him and all, he said he would come to me there, I went there, but he never came.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were apprehended upon this subject - A. Yes, I was taken up on the Tuesday following; I gave the description of every thing about it before I was taken up; directly I found it out I told it to Hooker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You live in Young's-building - I see by the Sessions Paper you were here last October to swear an alibi - A. I know nothing of an alibi.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not here last October in favour of a man for horse-stealing - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was convicted notwithstanding your evidence - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have been concerned in this transaction if you had known it had been a forgery - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any suspicion it was wrong until it was all over - A. Not at all. They told me they had got thousands of money, I supposed it was right.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would not have sent the porter to get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090032"></xptr>the money if you had not thought it was all night - A. No, to be sure not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell any body that when you sent the porter to get the money for the check that you changed hats with him - A. I was desired to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you change your hats again - A. Yes, on Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever in your life before lend your man your hat to go of an errand for you - A. I do not now justly recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You not having the least suspicion that any thing was wrong, believing all was right, you lent the man your hat, and you wore his hat while he was gone - A. Dale desired me to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the reason - A. No. Dale told me to change the hat, and I did it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up on the Tuesday after about this forged check - A. Yes, and I was kept in custody several days.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought it was better to be a witness than a prisoner - A. To be sure, because I was led into the business.</p>
               <p>HARRY ADKINS. Q. You are an officer of Bow-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend a person of the name of

             - A. I did, on the 17th of November at night, in Playhouse-yard, No. 20; I searched him, I found upon him a hundred pound note, a five pound note, and two one's, this is the 100 pound note, No. 9m985. I apprehended Dale on Sunday morning, in Aldersgate-street, he was at Mr. Stevens's, a hair dresser; I asked Dale what he had done with the money he had received on the Thursday, he said that he had not received any money. I then asked him if he had not taken a check on that day to some bankers, he said that he had taken a six hundred pound check to a bankers, he had received that check from Mark Chambers by the Prerogative office in Doctors Commons, and that he was to return there, Chambers was to be waiting for him. When he got back to Doctors Commons he found Chambers was gone, he then went to a man of the name of Robinson, the same person that I have been speaking of, that I apprehended, he gave him the money, thinking it would be safer in his hand than in his own; he said, that the check did not belong to Chambers, he understood it belonged to a tall man, he should know him if he was to see him, that he was dressed in black, and had long black whiskers, and that man he was near him at the time he received the check of Chambers. I apprehended Blair on the Monday morning in his own office, at Messrs. Gregg's and Corfield's; on my taking him from there in a coach to Bow-street, I asked him if he had ever been at his late employers, meaning by that the bankers; he said he was in the habit of going there very often; I asked him when was the last time, he said, on the Thursday before he had been to the bankers; I asked him what he went for there, he said, to get a note cashed for twenty shillings worth of change, that he had been twice there on that day in the afternoon. I then asked him if he knew a man of the name of Robinson, he said he did not. I then asked him if he knew a man of the name of Chambers; he said he did, he knew him by going to see Hitchen in Newgate, he had seen him several times in the last week, he saw him on the Wednesday and on the Thursday about twelve o'clock, he met him in Newgate. He asked me what charge I had him upon; I told him upon a check of six hundred pound, that I suspected he was the person that had drawn the check, he said, that if that was the charge I had him upon he did not care about it; he thought that I meaned to arrest him for debt.</p>

             had not behaved well to him, he had brought him six hundred pound bank of England notes, and Robinson had not given him a shilling out of it. I told him he need not ask a favour of Robinson, he might help himself with the money, if it was good money. Mr. Robinson came down at the time, Robinson said, come along, to Dale; they went into Golden-lane, and they stood about ten minutes together; I was about ten yards from them. Robinson sent Dale away and came to me; I then went with Robinson to a man of the name of Brown; I saw Robinson produce at a public-house in Worship-street two notes, one was a five hundred pound note, and the other a one hundred pound note, I did not know the amount of them, only Robinson told me six hundred pound. Afterwards, at another public-house in Whitechapel, Robinson produced the notes, a five hundred pound note. The number of the five hundred pound was 8789.</p>

I would wish to speak to Chambers, he has told the truth, that he himself gave me the check; he said it belonged to a gentleman, he would give me half a crown, and when I came back he was not there; I went to St. Paul's church-yard the next morning, I met him, he gave me some rum, and told me the gentleman would not like them large notes, he said he wanted thirty pounds. I was going to justify bail, I paid him fifteen shillings for bailing one of the men for sodomy. Chambers asked Hooker if he would take any small sum. Hooker bailed one Whiffen; just after the long vocation he took his brother's house, I do not know whether he did not take his brother's name; there are gentlemen here that recollects his face very well, he engaged with one Mason to swear that a gentleman owed him a bill of ninety-five pounds, Mr. Arabin and Mr. Adolphus were on the part of Mason, he received money as long as he could, then he went on the other side, though he had been sworn at Mr. Arabin's before; he went to the coffee-house and swore for Shirley, Mr. Price the attorney gave him a pound for his trouble. He had an execution in his house, I was present when the things were sold by auction; he has not been worth a shilling for this half year.</p>

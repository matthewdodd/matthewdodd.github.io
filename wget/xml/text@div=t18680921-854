                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Bricklayers' Arms, Trafalgar Road, Greenwich—the prisoner is a police-constable stationed there—the deceased, Henry Pogmore, was in the habit of frequenting our house, and lately drank considerably—on Wednesday, 2nd September, he left the house, alone, a little after 12 o'clock—he had been there about two hours—he was then sober—a few minutes after, I went out and saw the prisoner there in uniform, on duty—Pogmore was next door, about four yards off—I heard him say to the constable, "What the hell is it to do with you how I get my living?"—the prisoner made no reply—Pogmore made use of very bad expressions, called him a "B——old thing," and said he was only creeping about for a pension; and he said, "I have fought for my country, and I have medals to prove it"—the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">You</hi> fought; go on!" and deliberately seized the man by the front of the breast, and pushed him from him—it was done very quickly—it was a very hard push indeed—the man fell backwards on the pavement, on his head and shoulders, and his heels came down after—I went and lifted him up, and told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself to knock a man down in that way—he said, "Why did he insult me?"—I said, "You ought to have locked him up if he insulted you"—he said, "I will lock him up now"—I then had the man on my knee—he never spoke—he put his hand to the back of his head—the prisoner took him out of my hands—he could not walk, or rather, his feet dragged along the ground about twenty-five yards—he staggered, and dragged the best way he could—as the prisoner was dragging him along, Tester came up, and said, "You don't want to lock him up"—the prisoner said, "No, I don't"—I and the witness Shaw then took him from the prisoner—the prisoner said to him, "Are you satis<lb></lb>fied with what I have done to you; if not, I will take you to the station; or are you satisfied with what you have had off of me?"—the deceased said he had had enough about his head, and he put his hand to the back of his head—I and Shaw led him part of the way home—I left him in Shaw's hands, and went home—the deceased was not trying to strike the constable at the time he was pushed—I am certain of that—it was done deliberately, and very quickly.</p>

               <p>prisoner, "What do you mean by asking me what I do for my living? you are what I call a b——thing; you are no man, and no policeman"—the prisoner said, "I don't know how it is, Harry, but you seem to have an ill feeling towards me"—the deceased took no notice of that, but went on say<lb></lb>ing, "I will let you know; I have fought for my country, and have medals to prove it"—with that the constable seemed to become excited, and seized him, and threw him to the ground with violence, his head striking on the pavement, and made the remark, "<hi rend="italic">You</hi> fought for your country; go on, now!"—he seemed to catch him by the shoulder—I could not say for certain how he seized him—he threw him from him with force—the man's head and shoulders touched the ground first, and his heels struck the ground after<lb></lb>wards, like two hammers, one after the other, and I heard a dull sound, as of a man's head striking the ground—the deceased never made any attempt to strike the prisoner—when I heard the sound I said, "If that is the man's head, he is a dead man, as sure as fate"—Mills went towards him and raised him, and told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself to push the man down in the way he did—the prisoner said, "I shall lock him up now, for interfering with me in my duty," and he then took him about fifteen yards, or further—he took him by the shoulders, and dragged him along—the deceased was very weak and trembling, almost in a state of palsy, and his head dropped down from the pain from the blow—he was partly walking and partly dragged, like a person would in illness—I said to the prisoner, "Whether you lock him up or no, if this man dies during the night, you will have to be answerable for it"—Tester implored the constable to let him go, saying, "You have done quite sufficient, without locking the poor fellow up"—the prisoner said, "I did not strike him"—he said, "No, but you pushed him with force," or words to that effect—the prisoner said to the deceased, "Harry, are you satisfied with what I have done this night?"—he said, "You have done enough for my poor head"—I then took charge of him, and took him towards his home—I gave him up to a man of the name of Windle to take him home—Windle is a man in very good circumstance, connected with the telegraph works—I hear he has gone to Newfoundland—at that time, the man could walk a little—he kept putting his hand to the back of his head—I had known him about four years—he had been drinking lately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boat-builder, at 5, Crane Street, East Greenwich—I was at the Bricklayer's Arms on 2nd September—I came out a little before 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and Pogmore—I heard pogmore say that he was a b——thing, and no man—the prisoner told him several times to go on; he then gave him a push, and he fell flat on his back, and the back of his head went to the ground—Mills and the prisoner picked him up, and the prisoner said he would lock him up—I asked him not to do so,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186809210113"></xptr>
               <p>and he said to him, "Will you go home if I let you go?"—he said "Yes!"—the prisoner said, "Have you got any complaint to make against me, be<lb></lb>fore you go?"—he said "No!" and he let him go—he was taken away by his two friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What kind of push was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He went up to him and gave him a push, as if to make him go on; I can't say whether it was with one hand or two, it was nothing violent—I did not see anything wrong; the prisoner seemed quite quiet, not at all angry or irritated—I heard him say, "I don't know what it is, Harry, you seem to have an old grudge against me;" that was as he was going away, after he fell down—I did not think the man was hurt—the prisoner held him by one arm, and the other man by the other, and he walked along, but staggering, as if he was tipsy or stunned—I saw no violence in the prisoner's conduct.</p>

I am a surgeon, at Greenwich—I knew the de<lb></lb>ceased and have attended him—I was called to him, between 4 and 5 o'clock, on the morning of September 2nd—he was dead when I got there—I live about five minutes' walk from his house—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next day, by order of the Coroner—there were no external marks of violence—there was a contusion inside the scalp, on the right side, and there was a certain amount of effusion between the scalp and skull—the bones on the right side of the head appeared to be dislocated, and there were two fractures—on removing the skull cap there was a large clot of blood between the skull and the dura mater, pressing on the brain, and on reflecting the dura mater there was another large clot of blood underneath, in the same posi<lb></lb>tion; the brain itself was healthy—the cause of death was compression of the brain, caused by the clot of blood; that was evidently occasioned by external violence—I have heard the evidence—if a man was knocked violently backwards, and his head came in contact with the pavement, it would have caused what I saw—he had been drinking—he was in the first state of de<lb></lb>lirium tremens—there must have been considerable violence to produce the appearances I saw—it is sometimes the case that there is no external mark,</p>

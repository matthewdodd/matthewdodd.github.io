            . I lost these sheets on the 13th of May. I had been out, and as I was coming in, I met the prisoner going out at the threshold of the door. I asked her where she had been; and she said, to one Mrs. Clarke, to get some washing. I told her no such person took in any washing in the house. By that, I suspected she had been robbing me. She went into the New Inn; I followed her. She ran as hard as she could; and I called stop thief; by that, she was stopped, and I brought her back to my appartment; I missed the things in the indictment then, and I found the things on her. I sent for an officer, and gave her in charge.</p>

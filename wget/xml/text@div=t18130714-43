               <p>Q. What passed when the prisoner came home with you - A. He did not stay a quarter of an hour then; he went away, and returned on the Sunday. I invited him to come on Sunday. On Sunday he dined with me; he went away between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been with him during the whole time - A. Not during the whole time; he had been down in the yard with a sailor boy that he called his servant.</p>

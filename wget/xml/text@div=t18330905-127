             (policeman A 1). On Saturday night, the 21st of July, I was in Southampton-street, Tottenham-court-road, on duty, and saw the prisoner Connell - I followed him; he went into Bellamy's shop in <placeName id="t18330905-127-crimeloc720">Fleet-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He had not denied having them, though you said it was no use to deny it? A. No; but I should not have thought it could have slipped his memory - he said "Cocks, what cocks?"- he hesitated, and would not give me an answer whether they were there or not - and not giving me an answer, in my opinion, admitted that he had not got them, when he had only bought them ten minutes before - he went along with me - I had hold of him at first, when he came from behind the counter, but not in the street, as he was willing to come - he walked by the side of me; I had hold of Connell - there was sufficient time to conceal the cocks, but not being in my uniform it was impossible to know I was an officer - I was looking in at the window, and I thought he observed me, by his turning and looking towards the window - I do not mean that he put the goods under the counter because he observed me - it is proof sufficient that he saw my person at the window, or a woman would not have come to the door - I have been in the New Police eighteen months, and was in the old establishment - I do not think Bellamy could have escaped from me, as my attention was directed to him; I think I should have caught him if he had run.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. Did you hold out any threat or promise to Connell? A. None at all; after he was in custody he said it was the second time he had been there - Bellamy did not hear that.</p>

            . I am foreman of the smith's department, at Mr. Cubitt's, Connell has been in the employ some years, and was so on the 20th of July - I know these cocks, at least one of them, positively; the other is not so particular a one - these are cocks made unusually heavy and rather different from the general course of the trade; and they are made to a given pattern, to fit a screw to fit to an iron pipe - I have no hesitation in swearing to them, from having had them in my possession - we never sold any of them; I believe it is charged 10s. 6d., subject to five per cent discount - the other I should say is worth 1s. 6d. being old, but it is worth 3s. - the value as old metal would be 7d. per lb.; they are not made of cock metal, but with copper and a portion of tin - the 10s. 6d. one is new, and is of more value than to be melted down- it may weigh 21/2lb.; 7d. a lb. would be the value if it was melted down, but it is quite new and perfect - I had not given either of them to Connell, he had no right with either of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The mixture of the metal is what makes it valuable? A. Yes; perhaps there are few men in that business, but know the relative value of that metal, and copper, and other metals; they know by the colour of the metal; no marine store dealer would give as much for old cocks as for clear copper, and bell-metal; we keep a stock of these cocks; I have no private mark on it.</p>

            . I am a metal cock manufacturer; these cocks are my manufacture; they are made of better metal than usual, according to the directions of Cubitts; I have made none of that description for any other house; this one is made to an iron guage; I am certain of their being made for Mr. Cubitt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This being made particularly for Mr. Cubitt would not be likely to fit any other pattern? A. I cannot tell the size of the different gas pipes in London; it is an uncommon pattern as regards the size of the screw, and certainly less likely to be generally useful; a person would be more likely to buy it, for the value of the metal than for its particular use.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live in Ratcliff-street, St. George's-in-the-East—on Saturday night, 28th April, I was near the Old Rose public-house in the Highway, about half-past 10 o'clock, and was knocked down by three persons—the prisoners are two of them—I am quite sure of that—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186605070022"></xptr>
               <p>they struck me after I was down, and I felt my watch and money go from my pockets—I could not say which of them took them—I called "Police" as loud as I could holloa—I held the two prisoners and gave them in custody—the other man got away—I was sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 488.) I was on duty in St. George's-street, at about half-past 10 o'clock, and heard a cry of "Police"—it had been raining very hard—I ran towards the spot, and saw the prisoners coming round the corner followed by the prosecutor, who said, "I want my watch"—both the prisoners know me by name, and said, "Mr. Walker, he wants to charge us with stealing his watch"—I said to the prosecutor, "Be careful what you say"—he said, "Three men met me at the back, knocked me down, and stole my watch"—his guard was dangling out of his waist<lb></lb>coat with the swivel broken—he said, "There is one of the men down the hill"—he was about a yard behind them, and I was four or five yards in front of them—I took them to the station and searched them, but found nothing on them—the inspector asked him two or three times whether they were the parties, and he said he was quite sure.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the prisoner very tipsy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was quite drunk; he was sensible enough to know what he was doing, or else he could not have run—he called out, "Police!"—I saw no more running.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statements before the Magistrate</hi>:—<hi rend="italic">Jones</hi> says, "I am not guilty." <hi rend="italic">Collins</hi> says, "I am not guilty. I was walking up the Highway on Saturday night, and met Jones, and said, 'What cheer! come and have some beer in the Old Rose.' He said, 'Come somewhere else.' I looked, and there was no one there I knew, so I came out. I saw the prosecutor, and he made a <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> at me. I said, 'What are you doing, you drunken old beast? get away,' and as he made a punch at me he fell against the pub<lb></lb>lic-house door, so I said, 'Get away.' He said presently, 'You have got my watch,' and holloaed out, 'Police!' He was six yards away then. He did not have the words out of his mouth when Mr. Walker came up, so I walked over to him, and said, 'This man accuses me of robbing him,' and a mob gathered round and Jones came and said, 'This man accuses me as well,' and walked them on to the Gravel-lane station, and gave Jones to another policeman, and took us to the station."</p>

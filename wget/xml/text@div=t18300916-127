On the 5th of August I put 6s. into my till overnight, which were marked; there were four shillings and four sixpences - the next morning at nine o'clock they were all gone; I called in the Policeman, and accused the prisoner of it - he denied it; the officer pulled his money out of his pocket, and I found two marked shillings and four sixpences; I said, "Where are the other two shillings?" he said he had taken half a crown, and given 2s. of the money - he said he had taken it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I believe he has been in your service some time? A. Yes; and conducted himself well up to this time; I have no recollection of directing him to make a payment that evening - it might have been taken from the till.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner; he produced two marked shillings and four marked sixpences - he said that he took them, but gave no explanation; on going to the watch-house, I said, "My good man, you made a bad thief to take marked money;" he said he had not looked at it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect whether he said that he took the money from the drawer, but it was to make a payment? A. No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. On the 24th of February, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I was in St. George's-road, leading from the Elephant and Castle to New Bedlam—I had come from a public-house, where I had been to join a bene<lb></lb>fit society, and was going home—I was alone—I had been drinking a little, but was quite capable of taking care of myself, and knowing what I was about—I was walking on the edge of the foot-path—I did not observe or hear any person in the road near me, but I received a violent blow on the cheek—I turned round momentarily and perceived Tanner—I had scarcely time to make a slight grasp of him, when my heels were tripped up, and I was knocked down nearly on my back—my breath was almost knocked out of my body—the blow did not knock me down—it cut my cheek—I should suppose the blow was from a fist—I had a bundle in my hand, and the moment my heels were tripped up, a snatch was made at it, but I had it tied round my wrist, and they could not get it off—it was all done momentarily—what passed after I was down I cannot say—I know Tanner was one of the men, for I turned round instantly on receiving the blow, and saw he had very black eyes, as if from blows he had received—I never saw him before, to my knowledge—there was a light from a gas lamp—I cannot say how many there were, it was done in such a sudden manner—the policeman and Lee came to my assistance momentarily, or I should have been robbed—I did not miss any thing—I had some fifteen or sixteen shillings loose in my trowsers' pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber. I was in St. George's road, going home on the 24th of February—I saw Usher crossing the road near the foot-path in a slanting direction—there were five persons five or six paces from him close together—three of them darted from the five, tripped up his heels, and knocked him down—I instantly ran to his assistance, and collared Brown, who was on the prosecutor, and had his hands on him—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor laid on his side between the road and the path—I secured Brown, and he bit my hand to try to get away—the policeman took Tanner instantly, in my sight, and had great difficulty in keeping him—Tanner was stooping over the prosecutor in the same position as Brown—there was plenty of light from the gas lamp—they could not be off seeing me—they could not see the policeman—he was in a dark corner of the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the morning of the 25th of February, in St. George's-road, and saw the prosecutor coming in a slanting direction across the road towards where I stood—he was the worse for liquor, but capable of going home—he walked straight, but at the station-house I saw he was the worse for liquor—I saw five per<lb></lb>sons coming after him, six or seven yards from him—they could not see me where I was, which was within twenty yards of them—I saw Tanner come from the five, and trip the prosecutor up, and fall on him—Brown came up, and threw himself on the prosecutor directly he fell—he was about four yards behind him—I saw Lee come along the footway the moment the prosecutor was tripped up—I saw Tanner make an attempt at the prosecutor's pocket—I ran towards them—I saw Lee take hold of Brown.—I got up at the same time, and took Tanner, who was stooping over the prosecutor, and upon him, but on seeing me coming he straightened up, and tried to run away—I collared him—he tried all he could to get from me, by throwing himself about—they were both secured, and taken to the station-house—I am sure they were both sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Tanner's Defence.</hi> I was going home entirely by myself—I was in liquor, and do not recollect knocking the man down—if I did, it was not to rob him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Brown's Defence.</hi> When I heard the man call out, I ran to the corner of the street, and saw him lying down—I did not touch him—he never said at the station-house that I bit him—I was on the path when he took me.</p>

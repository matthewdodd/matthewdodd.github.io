                  </hi>. I am a chemist at 11, East Street, Walworth—on 4th March I served the prisoner with threepenny worth of caps—he tendered a florin—I said, "This is a bad one, you had better give me threepence"—he said, "I have only three-halfpence"—I called my brother and said, "Take charge of that man"—he tried to snatch it from my hand, and was going to strike my brother, but ran out of the shop—my brother ran after him—a constable brought him back; I charged him and gave the coin to the constable—I gave evidence at the police-court—he was twice remanded and discharged. Frederick Roberton. I saw the prisoner come to my brother's shop on 4th March—when my brother said "Hold him," the prisoner struck at me, and then bolted out of the shop—I followed him—he turned and again struck at me; I called out, "Stop that man," "Stop thief"—a constable came up and took him, and brought him back to the shop.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 27th of November, at nine o'clock, I left my house - my three children were in bed, and my wife also, when I left, as she was ill; I bolted the wash-house door and the room door, and locked the street door as I came out, leaving a light in the room; the windows were secured - I put the key into my pocket; I returned in a quarter of an hour, and took the key from my pocket - I applied it to the lock, and could not turn it; I listened, and heard footsteps inside - I thought my wife had come down stairs; no answer was made to me - I tried the key again, but could not turn it; Shortly after the prisoner opened the door about halfway - he rushed out against me; I immediately laid hold of him by the collar, and asked what business he had there; he said, "Nothing, Sir;" I said,"Then I insist on knowing what brought you here;" another man then rushed out after him - I collared him: there is a passage about ten yards from the house, which leads into Shoreditch; they both tried to get from me, but I held them fast till they got me down to the passage - they had both been inside the house; none of my windows or doors were broken - I stuck close to them both till I got out at the gate, at the end of the passage; the other man then gave me a shove, got himself at liberty, and ran off - I called for assistance, but nobody came; the prisoner kept saying "Let me go;" he turned round, struck me a blow in the mouth, and cut me - I stuck fast to him; some people caem up, and one fetched the serjeant of the Police - his hat fell off, and I called to the serjeant to search it; I gave him into the custody - I saw him searched on the spot; a shirt was found inside his waistcoat, on one side, and a shawl on the other side; a sheet was in his hat - I never let him go till I gave him to the serjeant; the prisoner is the person, I am certain; I went to the station with him, and when I returned to my own house. I found a chest of drawers open - some things were in the drawers and some out on the floor; I had left the drawer shut, but not locked - the things were all safe when I went out; I left three half-crowns in the drawer - I took a shilling from the three half-crowns when I went out, and when I returned the three half-crowns were gone; he must have opened the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090008"></xptr>street door to have got in - I was in the house from seven till nine o'clock, and left nobody but my own family there.</p>

            . My husband is in the service of the East India Company - I live right opposite Mr. Long's. On Saturday, the 27th of November, I heard a noise in the street - I went to the door, heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw Long struggling in the garden with the prisoner; I saw the prisoner's hat fall off into the next garden, and saw something white in the hat - somebody picked it up, but I cannot say who; I went to Long's house, and Mrs. Long was there - I saw the drawers open, part of the clothes hanging over them, and part scattered over the floor; I saw the Policeman take the prisoner from Long - I am sure he is the man Long was struggling with.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police; I know Long's house - it is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Middlesex. On the 27th of November I was called by a man to come to Norfolk-place - I there found the prisoner in Long's custody; he gave him up to me - his hat was off, and laying on the ground; Long had no hat on - the hat was handed to me by a person; the prisoner owned it was his himself, and claimed a handkerchief which was in the crown of it; the hat was picked up, and handed to me by somebody standing by - I took the sheet out of it; I searched the prisoner, and took a shirt from between his waistcoat, on one side, and a shawl from the other - he appeared very anxious to search himself, and thrust his hand into his pocket; when he took his hand out I laid hold of it, and found in it a skeleton key - he was very anxious to conceal it from me, and I had some difficulty to get it from his hand; he said it was the key of his own room door, and I had no business with it - I immediately took him to the station; I came back afterwards, and found the key would not open the outer door; I have had the charge of the property ever since.</p>
               <p>MRS. LONG. I swear to the shawl! - I know it by the colour and the border, and I have a mark on it; I know this shirt - it is my own marking; the sheet also is my own marking.</p>

I was at the London Apprentice last Saturday week; a man came, and asked if I was a porter - I said No; he said was I willing to carry a box for him - I said Yes, and went with him; he said the box was so full - he took me over to this man's house, gave me these things, told me to put them under my coat button the coat over, and he would come to me - the key belongs to my own door; I got it fitted to the lock by a man who works in Whitechapel; I was in the house with the man- this man came, and knocked at the door; I opened the door to him - he said, "What do you want there?" I said, "Nothing at all," and immediately the other man rushed out, and shoved me almost over him; he struck him a violent blow, and in the dark he said it was me - he let the man go, and hallooed Thief! and Murder! - the man gave me the things to put into my hat to keep the box from burting my head; I did not know what he collared me for - I work at Mr. Mills, No. 24, Peter-street.</p>

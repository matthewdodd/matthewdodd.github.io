               <p>Mr. Pickering. I am a broker, and live next door to St. Giles's church. The prisoner brought one of these Turkey stones and the plough to me about seven last Thursday morning: he said they were his own. I asked him where he worked; he said in the Ruins in St. Giles's. I went with him to see if any body there would say they were his; but he could not find any body that knew him: then I supposed he had stole them. I gave the constable charge of him, and he was taken to the Round-house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060003"></xptr> then a little boy came and said the prisoner had left a saw and oil-stone at a public-house for liquor. The constable went and brought them. (The tools produced in court, and deposed to by their respective owners, who with the constable deposed to the prisoner's confession before Justice Welch of his stealing them out of the building.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>

            . On the 19th of September, the prisoner knocked me down, and took my watch out of my pocket. It was a little before seven in the evening; it was light, so that I could observe him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do - A. I cried stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he stopped upon that cry - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not pursue him yourself - A. No, he got away too soon; he was brought back to me when he was stopped. He had walked behind me from Aldgate pump, all the way, before he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel your watch go from you - A. Yes, as I was falling.</p>

            . I am a copper plate engraver. On the 19th of September, at about ten minutes before seven in the evening; I was standing at my own door, and heard a cry of stop thief; and saw a crowd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250009"></xptr>of people run round the corner of Osborne street; they were running after somebody, but I am not sure that person was the prisoner. I saw something in the kennel shining; I was going to pick it up, when a man picked it up. I took him by the collar, and asked him what he was going to do with it; he immediately put it into my hand without saying a word, and ran off. It was the prosecutor's watch.</p>

            . I am a patrole of the parish of St. Mary's, Whitechapel. I remember hearing a cry of stop thief and saw the people running after the prisoner at the bar. I am sure it was the prisoner at the bar, I knew him well before. I caught hold of him; he struggled and got away from me; I run a few yards again, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home at night, and saw a row, the people run, and I run too, and was taken before the magistrate without knowing anything at all about this. The prosecutor's wife was walking arm and arm with the prosecutor, and she said, that I never interfered with the man at all.</p>

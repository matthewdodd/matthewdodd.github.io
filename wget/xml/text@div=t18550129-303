I went to bed about 11 o'clock, leaving the property on my premises perfectly safe—on coming down next morning, I found the shop door half open, and a panel out—a basket had been taken away with a large quantity of silks—the parties had got in by the skylight, which had been shut the night before, but not fastened—a rope was hanging from it, by which they must have let themselves down—I have lost velvets and silks to the amount of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 5th Jan. I accompanied the police to Wilstead-court, Somers-town, and found the three prisoners there, the females downstairs and the male upstairs—he was brought down by sergeant Harris, and told to consider himself in custody—we commenced a search, and found a quantity of short lengths of silks and ribbons (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this other parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found upstairs, but not in my presence—I have examined all these articles, they are all my property—I have a pattern of silk which will match with this piece—these patterns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were cut two days previously to send into the country to a person, and were returned</p>

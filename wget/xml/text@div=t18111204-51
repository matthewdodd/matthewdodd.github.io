             was in our service, he came to live with us in the month of May 1805. Cornford continued to live with me till July last, 1811.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way was the prisoner entrusted by you and your partner. - A. It was his duty to take care of the cash, make payment of bills drawn upon the house, he had every power that a confidential clerk could have except the endorsement of bills and drawing bills for sale, he could accept a draft drawn upon the house, or draw a bill upon the banker, but he could not draw a bill upon the Bank of England. Messrs. Prescott and Co. were the bankers of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a power over those funds. - A. He had, he had the power to act generally in my absence, according to circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he power to borrow money. - A. Certainly if it was necessary, and he has occasionally done so in my absence, - he kept the cash-ledger, he was entrusted to receive money on the accompt of the house, and he was in possession of the bills of the house and securities, he had the fullest confidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he entrusted to receive all monies, goods, monies, bills, notes, banker's drafts, cash, and every money security. - A. Goods did not come under his notice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. What salary did you give him. - A. Three hundred guineas, and it increased to three hundred and fifty guineas before he gave me notice to quit my service. He had permission to join in partnership with his brother in the coal trade, but it was not to take any part of his time under the firm of Thomas and

               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did you assist Cornford in carrying on that coal trade by loans of money. - A. I did, I lent him money to join his brother in the coal trade, some few hundred pounds. Afterwards he stated, that Mr. Everett the banker had offered an account in his favour, but he did not know how to keep a balance there, that if I would assist him in a balance of two or three thousand pounds, Mr. Everett would discount bills that I had on hand, provided I kept up such a balance as made it worth their while, I acceded to his proposal.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an account of him and his brother in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040039"></xptr>your books. - A. The account was

               <p>Q. At what time did that account open. - A. I believe it was in the year 1807, and it continued untill July 1810.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. At what period was Cornford in the habit of balancing that account. - A. On the 1st of April, he ought to have struck it monthly, that was my order. The book was balanced on the first of April, 1810, at that period the balance was in favour of Thomas and

               <p>Court. With respect to this draft of fifteen hundred pounds, was there any prohibition to his entering it into Mr. Everett's accompt. - A. I was two hundred miles off at the time, there was no prohibition of his increasing his debit, he might have debitted himself ten thousand pounds, but he had not done that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the accompts debitted exceed three thousand pounds. - A. They did not. As soon as I found that he had exceeded the credit that I had allowed him, he left his own house, afraid of the eye of his master, I returned from Lancashire, on the 20th of July, I found that his business had been greatly neglected, and that the cash had not been balanced. On my ordering it to be done, and persevering in it, he retired to his own house on the 24th. At this period this book was looked up, I could not ascertain the extent of the account.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first discover the charge that you made against Cornford this day. - A. In October, by Cornford's successor examining this book.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to the book where this complaint arises, is this Cornford's hand writing. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>(The accompt read).</p>
               <p>Q. You knew nothing of the money except what you heard when you came home. - A. I knew nothing of it except from what I saw in the books, there is fifteen hundred pound as paid to Lion and Earle, they deny ever having received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever received this fifteen hundred pounds of Cornford since. - A. I have not, Mr. Hall that succeeded Cornford made the discovery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Q. When was your banking-house opened for Cornford and Co. - A. I believe in 1808.</p>

               <p>Q. He had a power of taking bills that you held for the purpose of discounting at Everett's house, keeping a proper balance up. - A. He had the power of taking bills and securities for the purpose of discounting at Newman's and Everett's.</p>
               <p>Q. It was convenient to you that this should be done. - A. I conceived it would be some convenience, or else I should not have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have very extensive connections. - A. Certainly, mine are inland bills.</p>
               <p>Q. This transaction happened in July 1810. - A. What transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Why the draft in question. - A. In July 1810, during the time I was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You placed great confidence in him, you left him twenty-seven thousand pounds, with power to borrow upon your correspondents. - A. Yes, he had a general power to that effect, I cannot say what balance I left, I left sufficient for the demands in the house, and so much money in the house, to the amount of twenty-seven thousand pounds, to answer all the demands upon the house during my absence, and I say as a proof of it, I found the debt of Thomas and George Cornford, increased to twenty-seven thousand pounds in my books.</p>

               <p>Court. You say that you had no reason to think that the balance was increased to beyond two, or three, or four thousand pounds. - A. Certainly, I had no reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he permission to use your money, so that you could not say to three or four thousand pounds, where was this license to stop, and which he was never to exceed. - A. There was a sum understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not tell me what you understood, I must have a positive answer. - A. Three thousand pounds was the outside limit that ever I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that ever mentioned in terms, Mr. Cornford you may apply three thousand pounds and no farther. - A. It was never mentioned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Q. I believe the house of Cornford and his brother became bankrupts. - A. In November 1810, I was petitioning. creditor, sixteen thousand pounds is the amount I proved under the estate, and some odd pounds.</p>
               <p>Q When did Cornford leave your accompt. - A. In July 1811.</p>
               <p>Q. This accompt was made up in 1810, who keeps the rough cash book. - A. Any person that receives money enters it.</p>

               <p>Q. And from this book is composed the clean cash book, though you had not the book which you have now before you, had not you the rough book, and the other book of which this book is composed. - A. I had, and they all agree, if I had not examined the castings.</p>

            . Q. Were you applied to at any time to examine these accompts, and when. - A. In last September.</p>
               <p>Q. Look over that accompt of Lion and Earle in 1810. - A. There is an accompt where they debit in five different sums, they are credited with two, five different sums making six thousand, one hundred and thirty-two pounds, two shillings, and nine pence, as it stands here.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is that book that you now produce. - A. The cash ledger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The debtor side of Lion and Earle, they are represented in five different sums, debtor to the amount of six thousand one hundred and thirty-two pounds two shillings, and nine pence. - A. It appears so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Sir I ask you in that casting up is there a concealment of fifteen hundred pounds, casting it up fairly, and according to the figures, would it make fifteen hundred pounds more. - A. It would, and on the credit side there are two items that appears six thousand one hundred and thirty two pounds, two shillings and nine pence, the same as the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body looking at the face of that balance, it would appear to one who looks no further, that there was no difference between the parties. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. But looking minutely, and examining carefully, you find there is a difference of fifteen hundred pounds from the 9th of July to the 21st of July, and the last credit of the 24th of July. - A. On the 10th of July there is fifteen hundred pounds; on the 9th of July two thousand pounds; 13th fourteen hundred and ten pounds, fourteen shillings; 14th, seven hundred and nine pounds, seven shillings and nine-pence; 21st of July, two thousand and twelve pounds, one shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. That is in July 1810. - A. Yes, these are the sums paid. Upon the other side July 7, 1810, six thousand pounds; July 24, one hundred and thirty-two pounds, two shillings and nine pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Q. Did you examine that ledger with that book from which the entry was made. - A. Not the whole of it, I supposed it to by correct, it refers to the fair cash-book; I discovered this in October.</p>
               <p>Court Q. (to Procecutor. Then for aught you know that fifteen hundred pounds is included in the proof of your debt; it cannot be a debt and felony too. - A. I have the clerk here that drew up the debt.</p>

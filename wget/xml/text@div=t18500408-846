                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 337). On Saturday night, 2nd March, I was on duty at Woolwich—about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I saw Honour serving at his master's shop-window, and Howick was about five yards from the shop, loitering about—the window was open, and both the prisoners were outside—I watched them, and saw Honour take a piece of bacon and give it to Howick, who put it into his pocket, and walked away—I stopped him, and said, "You have got a piece of bacon that that person gave you"—he said, "I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—I took him back, and took him and Honour into the shop—I stated the charge, and Honour said he gave it to Howick to go in to get it weighed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Richard-street, Woolwich; Honour was in my employ nearly three months. On the night of 2nd March, he was engaged in my shop—I know this piece of bacon—I saw it on the window-board—there is no particular mark on it—I had not cut it off a larger piece—it was his duty to do that—he was authorized to sell bacon outside—before it was sold, it was to be brought in to be weighed.</p>

On Wednesday, the 19th of June, I was in town - I did not know either of the prisoners before; but I was at the Castle that night having a drop of beer, after we had cleared our boat, and I was too late to get into the yard; I then fell in with the prisoner Smith, and we went to the Leopard; when we got there, there were some loose men about, and as I had some money with me, the landlord advised me to leave my money with him, which I did - Smith was there with me at the time, but Thomas was not - I gave the landlord thirteen sovereigns and a half - I suppose it was ten or eleven o'clock, or it might be after; Smith still kept in company with me, and we when to Thomas house, No. 7, Ball-yard - I cannot tell whether I saw Thomas there that night, as it was late - I cannot tell; we did not have any liquor there that I know of - I slept there, and I believe Smith slept with me; I found her aside of me the next morning - I got up in the morning and wanted my money, and Smith went with me to fetch it; I received it about eight o'clock - Smith and I had a little something to drink there, and we went back - I did not feel well by a great deal, and I said, I would go back and lay down upon the bed a little bit; I went back and laid down on the same bed I believe - I had my money in my breeches pocket - I had seen Thomas in the house that morning, and I fancy I gave her something to drink - Thomas was not in the room where I laid down; as Smith and I went up by ourselves up two pair of stairs - I don't know whether it was a room that Smith used or not - I laid down with my clothes on, and Smith as well; I fell asleep, and slept for about an hour; I then awoke, Smith<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040057"></xptr>was still on the bed, and I did not offer to awake her - I did not notice whether she was asleep or not, but I went down as fast as I could, as I found my pocket had been cut and the money gone out - I went down, but Thomas was not there - I sat down considering what I must do; after a while, the policeman came in and said, he had taken the woman that had got my money, and I went to Worship-street - I went to sleep that night at the Castle, and the next morning, when I got up and was dressing myself, my purse laid on the floor with a sovereign and a half in it - I had put my money into my purse when I received it of the landlord; I suppose they had taken the purse out of my pocket, and left me the sovereign and a half to do what I liked with - I believe the prisoners are the women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You are not quite sure they are the women? A. Yes, they are the women - I was not very drunk when I got to the Leopard - I was middling - I don't justly know where I met Smith, but we went to the Leopard together, and we went there again in the morning; we had not drank anything till we got there - I think I had half a pint of beer there - I did not sup the night before with these women, and have fish for supper - I did not give Thomas my money to take care of for me.</p>

            . I keep the Leopard public-house in Seward-street, Goswell-street. On the Wednesday evening the prosecutor came to my house with two other men and two females - Smith was one of them, but Thomas was not - the prosecutor was not very tipsy; he called for half a pint of gin, which I served him with; he took his purse out to pay for it, and dropped his purse on the floor; I could tell by the sound that there was a good bit of money in it - I called him into the bar and persuaded him to leave his money till the morning, as he was rather in liquor, which he refused to do - but after a good deal of persuading he did, and went away; he wanted more liquor, which I refused to let him have - on the Thursday morning, he came in company with Smith, between eight and nine o'clock, for his money, I counted it out, and gave it him, there were thirteen sovereigns and a half; he had had fourteen sovereigns the night before, and changed one half sovereign to pay for what he had to drink.</p>

             (police-constable, G 196). On Thursday afternoon, the 20th of June, a man came down and said, there was a woman with a great deal of property about her, and she had dropped four sovereigns and some silver on the ground; I went out with Kelly, and found Thomas standing drunk against the wall, between four and five o'clock - Kelly left me to go after a woman who they thought had been robbing Thomas, but I sung out for him to return to me, as Thomas began to bite me - we took her to the station-house; in going along she said, "It was not me that robbed the Captain, it was Deaf Poll;" I began to search Thomas and four sovereigns fell from her- we searched her further, and found another sovereign on her, and four sovereigns and a half in the corner of her handkerchief, and some silver and copper in her pocket, amounting altogether to 10l. 11s. 01/4d.; there were nine sovereigns and a half in gold, one pound in silver and one shilling, and a farthing in copper.</p>

             (police-sergeant, G 8). On the Thursday afternoon, Thomas and two other women were brought in; the money was found on Thomas as has been described - when the four sovereigns fell from her, I asked her if that was all she had, and she distinctly said, Yes; she was then searched and the rest of the money was found - she said,"Deaf Poll took it and gave it me" - I went out, and from what I heard, I went to No. 7, Ball-yard (I asked her if she lived there? she said, Yes), I found the prosecutor there dozing; I asked him if he had been robbed? he said, Yes, of all his money - I took him to the station-house, and he identified Thomas; and before the Magistrate he stated the same - I searched him on the Thursday, but did not find any money, but I suspect the purse, with the sovereign and a half in it, had slipped down his trousers - he went to sleep that night at the Castle, and told me the next morning, that he found his purse and the sovereign and half on the floor.</p>
               <p>Thomas's Defence. He gave me the money, and told me to go for some fish, as I went I met two women who saw me drunk and wanted to take it from me - the prosecutor told me to keep the money for him; he kept a sovereign and a half, which he put into his purse - he was drunk when he gave it me.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FARRINGTON. No, I don't recollect it; I should not have began feeling for my money when I awoke if I had - I believe Smith is innocent.</p>

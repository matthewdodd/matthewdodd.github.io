               <p>On the 5th of May I went in company with Barrier, to search Mr. Skinner's house; there I found a jack-plane, two squares, and an axe, among other things not in this indictment; Skinner keeps a broker's shop, he made no difficulty in letting us search; but after we found the plane, he said he had no more; and there we found them after he said he had bought no more things of the man that he bought the plane of; but we afterwards found the two squares and the axe.</p>

               <p>I am a cabinet-maker and keep a broker's shop; on Tuesday the 28th of April, the prisoner brought these things to my house, he came in the dusk of the evening, after I had shut, or was just shutting shop; he said he had these tools to sell, two planes, two squares, and an axe.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to say you had no more of these things? - I did not know I had any more, I thought they were sold.</p>

               <p>As I was coming along the street, I saw this plane laying for sale, I bought it of Mr. Skinner for one shilling and nine-pence; it was a double-ironed plane; I had heard of the robbery, I knew it to be lost; I gave information at Litchfield-street office, and the Justice gave me an order to search Mr. Skinner's premises.</p>
               <p>(Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Barrier. Skinner told us we were very welcome to search, but we found but a few<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030063"></xptr>in the shop; we found the rest below stairs, he denied having those that were below, he said he did not know who he bought them of; the Justices recommended to him to look after the thief, and it seems he was the cause of his being apprehended.</p>
               <p>Court to Skinner. Did you know the man at the time he brought them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know his name? - Yes; at first I was not sure, because I had bought a whole chest of tools of a cheesemonger in Brooke's-market, I have not his name now; upon seeing him, and recollecting what things I had, I was well convinced I bought them of the prisoner, and I informed the Justice.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFERCE.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if it was the last thing I have to say, I know nothing of the tools; they told me at the Justices, if this does not do you, we will do you with something else; there were twenty carpenters there, and Mr. Skinner also, who said so.</p>

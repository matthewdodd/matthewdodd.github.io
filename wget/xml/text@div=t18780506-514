                  </hi>. I am a copper-plate printer, of 64, Rupert Street, Haymarket—on the night of the 9th of February I was walking up Ludgate Hill with my three sisters, who were in front of me and my brother, who was walking at my side—I noticed four men coming from the direction of St. Paul's—they surrounded my three sisters, and pushed them rudely up against the shutters and fastened them there, and would not allow them to pass either way—I immediately went to their assist<lb></lb>ance, and said to the prisoner "What are you doing with my sisters"—he took no notice, but stepped back a step or two, when one of his com<lb></lb>panions answered me, but I did not catch the words, and so I said "Are you aware those are my sisters you are interfering with?"—the one who had answered me said he didn't care a d——whether they were my sisters or anybody else's sisters—I felt annoyed at that, and said "I will pull your nose"—the prisoner then pushed me up against the shutters—he had a large stick in his hand and brought it down on my leg; I felt my leg tremble, and found I had no power in it—it was a black or brown polished notched stick like a thorn—I put my right hand out and caught the prisoner with that, and my young sister with my left, and held on to them—I cried out "Oh my leg, my leg is broken, that man has done it" (<hi rend="italic">nodding to the prisoner</hi>)—my sister got round to the other side of the prisoner and held him and cried "Police!"—the prisoner then kicked me on the same leg—I caught hold of him with the other hand and gradually sunk to the ground, and sat on the pavement—whilst I was on the pavement I told him if he attempted to go he would have to drag me with him—my sister had hold of him still and so had I, and I went on my back on the pavement afterwards—whilst on my back one of the party came to me and said there was nothing the matter with me, and if I did not get up he would kick the top of my head in; or off, I forget which—I think that was the one who had spoken before—I appealed to the bystanders to protect me—"Will anybody protect me from this man? you hear what he says," and he tantalised me, I cannot say the exact words he used—he then walked round the crowd and I said "There is the stick he has done it with"—a young man attempted to take it out of the prisoner's right hand—he resisted at first, but when he saw who it was taking it he let it go, and my sister gave him in custody and I charged him—I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and was in bed for five weeks and two days—when the prisoner was given in charge he stood and grinned—he didn't say anything—my sister Sarah was with me the whole time—I had hold of the prisoner from the time he struck me, and am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I am positive he struck and kicked me—I solemnly swear I saw a stick in his hand—I said at the police-court I might know the other men if I saw them—I may have said I should know them—I was asked if I could identify any one in Court as one of them—I picked out one who I said was very much like one of the young men with the prisoner—I know he turned out to be a witness in another case, but I was not positive—no second person was brought under my notice—Thomas Gray was brought under my notice—I didn't see him when I looked round the Court—he was afterwards put into the witness-box—I heard my sisters examined—I heard Eleanor say "My brother was</p>

               <p>behind us; <hi rend="italic">three</hi> young men, the defendant being one of them, pushed very rudely against us"—I say <hi rend="italic">four</hi>—I cannot say whether Elizabeth said three or four—I heard her say "One of the three got hold of my sister rather indecently; the defendant was one of them, but he had no part in the annoyance"—I heard the prisoners had all been drinking together at the Dolphin, on Ludgate Hill—the prisoner was behind my sisters—he stopped their way this side; he was taking the principal part, to my idea—when my sisters were pushed up against the shutters, I did not go up to one of the men and say "What do you mean by insulting respectable married women?"—I did say "Why are you insulting my sisters?" both to Gray I think and the prisoner—I know it was to one of the four—I cannot say whether it was to the one who used the violent language—neither of them said it was an accident and he would apologise—I did not say "Accident be d—d, it was done on purpose;" it is not an expression of mine—I did not attempt to strike Gray; nothing of the sort—I never fell, I slid myself down by the prisoner's coat, the pain in my leg preventing my standing—I nodded to the prisoner while on the ground—I said perhaps 20 times before the police constable came up, that he had broken my leg—I said when the policeman came up "I charge that man with breaking my leg"—I suppose that was giving him in charge, but I did not go the station—another constable took me in a cab to the hospital—I did not hear the prisoner say to the constable "I know nothing about it; you might as well have picked out any one else who was passing"—I heard the constable give his evidence—I saw the stick passed away, I cannot say whether the constable had come up then or not—I have not made a solemn statement on my oath about it—I was cross-examined at the police-court at some length—I know what I said about the stick—I did say "While I had hold of the defendant, I said to the constable 'That is the stick with which he struck me'"—I said "The constable was present when the other man took the stick from the defendant"—I do not think I am mistaken, or that what was done to me was done by the man who used the violent language—I said at the police-court "Whilst I was on the ground one of the defendant's companions came round to the back of me"—I said "I appealed to the bystanders to protect me from this man, and then that man walked away to the back of the defendant, and he drew the stick out of the defendant's hands"—the attempt to take the stick was im<lb></lb>mediately after I pointed it out—I nodded to the prisoner when I was leaning against him and my sister—after that he kicked me on the leg—I had been with an apprentice of mine that night—I left 64, Rupert Street, at 11.30 with my eldest sister, and then we went into Bluecross Street for my eldest sister to wish her mother good night, where we joined my other two sisters and my brother, and we all went from there—we had nothing to drink—it was as dark as on an ordinary night on Ludgate Hill—I don't think my sisters said anything at the police-court about the kick—I was very bad when I went to the police-court—I did not say anything to the policeman about the prisoner having kicked me—I swear the prisoner did not turn round in the presence of myself and the constable, and appeal to the bystanders and say "Can any one say they saw me raise either hand or foot, or interfere with this man in any way?"—I had hold of the prisoner by the bottom of his coat when the constable came up—I did not see that the prisoner was smoking a cigar;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060074"></xptr>
               <p>he was not when I had hold of him—I was on the ground I suppose 20 minutes—I did not notice the prisoner's left hand—I saw no cigar—my sister, who spoke about the stick was called on the last occasion at the police-court—some of them said that he had something in his hand but they did not see what it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Eight weeks had intervened, I think, between the occurrence and the time I was at the police-court, and I was then called on to identify some of the men who were with the prisoner—it did not take a second to pass the stick—the policeman may or may not have seen it—there was no fight at all, nor did I intend to strike one of the men and fall in the attempt—I was in too great pain to look in the prisoner's hand to see if he had a cigar.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 64, Rupert Street, and am the wife of Edward Robertson, a printer's clerk—on the night of 9th February I was on Ludgate Hill with my sisters and brothers—about 12 o'clock three men and the prisoner pushed rudely against us and got us up against the shutters on the wall side—my brothers, who were behind, came up and asked them what they insulted us for—my sister, Mrs. Crawley, said "I beg pardon, allow us to pass; we are married women"—we tried to walk along—we got away from them, and when turning round to go away I heard my brother Thomas Edward call out "My leg is broken; that man has broken it; don't let him go"—my younger sister had hold of him on one side and my brother had him by the coat and never loosed him until he lost power over himself and gradually sank to the ground—my younger sister called for the police until they came and then gave him in custody—the prisoner was the nearest of the four men to my brother—he had something in his hand, I could not see what it was—there is not the slightest truth in the suggestion at the police-court that we induced the men to annoy us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I am sure the prisoner had something in his hand—I said so at the police-court—I said "I believe he had something in his hand"—I believe so now—it was something dark—I dare say I said at the police-court that my brother said "That is the man that <hi rend="italic">struck</hi> me"—I have been out to luncheon this morning, but I did not associate with my brother—I know he has been examined this morning—I did not say at the police-court that there were <hi rend="italic">three</hi> men, of whom the prisoner was one—if I did it was a mistake—I did not then say anything about the prisoner having kicked my brother—I don't know whether he said anything about being kicked when the policeman came up—there was a great crowd—I did not notice that the prisoner was smoking a cigar—I did not hear any rough language between my brother and Gray—I heard a man use brutal and rough language to my brother—he said that if he did not get up from the ground he would kick the top of his head in, or something of that kind—I said nothing of that at the police-court because I was not asked the question—the prisoner said to the policeman when he was given in charge "You might as well accuse anybody else as me"—I did not hear my brother say "Accident be d—d, it was done on purpose"—I was not near enough to hear—I was in the centre at the beginning of the occurrence—I did not see my brother attempt to strike Gray—I saw nothing of it until I heard him cry out that his leg was broken—the prisoner insulted us with the others, only the other three were arm in arm and he was not—I said at the police-court "The</p>

               <p>three young men, the defendant being one of them, pushed very rudely against us; one of the three got hold of my sister rather indecently; the defendant was with them, but he had no part in the annoyance"—it was one of the other three that caught hold of my sister—he encircled us, but he did not catch hold of us.</p>

We have plenty of cases of broken legs caused by a simple fall—the breakage might have been caused by the man striking his leg on the corner of the kerb-stone—in the case of a blow or kick I should not necessarily expect to find an abrasion of the skin unless the man's legs were bare—it would depend on the force of the blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. In all probability it was caused by a blow more than a fall—I cannot say exactly—the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> is the chief bone of the leg, the shin bone—the bruise was just over the seat of fracture—it was about the size of a hen's egg—if the fracture were caused by falling on the kerb it would more easily occur if he were standing in the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 101, Coburg Buildings, Rochester Row, and am employed at the Bodega, Glasshouse Street, Regent Street—I met two persons named Gray on this night on Ludgate Hill; I was with the prisoner, and we all four went into the Dolphin—I had met the prisoner in Glasshouse Street—I have known him nearly three years, he is generally a teetotaler—I have seen him drink a glass of ale occasionally but never spirits—I cannot remember what he had that night or who paid for it—he was not the worse for liquor—as we went down the hill, Gray and his brother were a little in front of the prisoner and myself—the prisoner was smoking a cigar—Charles Gray accidentally knocked against one of the females coming in the opposite direction, but not in an indecent or improper manner; she turned round and asked what he meant by insulting a respectable married woman—I believe that was Eleanor Robertson—at the same moment two young men came up who were walking behind—one of them, the prosecutor's brother, asked Gray what he meant by insulting his sisters—Gray said it was quite an accident, and he would apologise—he replied "Accident-be d—d, it was done purposely," at the same time attempting to strike Gray—one or two of his sisters caught hold of him and took him up Ludgate Hill towards St. Paul's—while they were taking him away the prosecutor rushed at Gray and struck him two or three times with his fists about the shoulders or face, a scuffle ensued between them, and the prosecutor fell, calling out that his leg was broken—the prisoner and I walked over to see if it was the case; he was lying on the ground, and he pointed to the prisoner and said he was the man that broke his leg, that he struck him with a stick—I had not seen any stick, nor had he one that evening to my knowledge—a policeman came up almost at the same moment, and the prosecutor's sister gave the prisoner in custody—he was taken to the station and charged—he was still smoking his cigar when taken—the prisoner had nothing whatever to do with interfering with the prosecutor, and never spoke one word to him until he was taken in custody, neither did he press up against the women or come in collision with them in any way whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I think there were four remands at the police-court—I was there on each occasion but not called—we have plenty of drink at the Bodega—I met the prisoner in Glasshouse Street—of course he can take a glass occasionally—we had one glass at the Dolphin—I have no notion who paid for the drinks—I have a good notion of what occurred afterwards—we met the Grays somewhere in the Strand, I believe—we went to Fleet Street because the prisoner wanted to see a friend of his—he does not drink gin or any sort of spirit—I don't know about wine—he drinks a glass of beer occasionally—I don't know that we went into any public-house before the Dolphin at about 11.40—we went into a tobacconist's in Fleet Street, where the prisoner bought</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soap hand at a perfumer's and live at 6, Martlett's Court, Bow Street—I was with the prisoner and my brother and Warrell on Ludgate Hill—my brother and I were in advance of the prisoner—three females were coming in the opposite direction—as we were passing them my brother and myself accidentally knocked against one of them with my shoulder—there was not too much room—there were five abreast on the pavement, three going one way and two the other—she turned round and rebuked me, and wanted to know what I meant by insulting her—I offered an apology, but it was not accepted—I said "It was quite an accident; I am very sorry for it"—the prosecutor's brother came up to me in a very threatening atti<lb></lb>tude, and he was drawn away up the hill by two of the females—at the same instant the prosecutor came deliberately up to me and struck me on the shoulder and followed it up by striking me two or three times more, and wanted to know what I meant by insulting his sisters—I went to defend myself and he jumped me on one side, and in so doing I caught my foot accidentally against his leg and he fell down, exclaiming that his leg was broken—I did not kick at him—it was more a slip than anything, being a greasy night—we both fell in the centre of the pavement—he fell towards the shutters right away from the kerb—it is rather steep there—two or three people standing round in the crowd told me I had better go away before anything further was done, and I went away and saw no more of it—the prisoner had no stick that night—he had light spring-side boots on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was about two hours in the prisoner's company—I met him at Charing Cross-the first place we went into to drink was a public-house at Charing Cross—Warrell was with us—we had some bitter ale and the prisoner had a glass of stout—the next public-house was the Dolphin, but we stopped some time at a cigar-shop at the corner of Whitefriars Street—I have not given evidence at the police-court—I have known the prisoner since that night—I know Warrell very well and have seen him frequently since then and had conversation with him—I have inquired how this case was going on—I was at the police-court at all the three remands, but was not called—I had no conversation with my brother about this—he was not in court at any of the remands—I walked arm in arm with my brother—I did not notice which of the females I pushed against—I saw them coming, but never separated from my brother—I am employed at Osborne's, Golden Square—I was called into the witness-box at the police-court, but not sworn—I did not volunteer any statement—I said then I lived at 6, Martlett's Court, Bow Street—I told them I had worked for Osborne and Co.—I did not say I was then out of employment—I have not seen the prisoner with a stick, I have seen him with an umbrella, but he had neither that night—the prosecutor fell close by the shutters, but not against them.</p>

I don't know whether he ever carries a stick—I did not see my brother's leg near the prosecutor's—I was two or three yards off—there was a lamp but not a good light at all—it did not rain that day—it was rather cloudy—nobody had a stick—I think I was smoking—I could not swear Whether all four were—the prisoner may have been smoking—I didn't notice a cigar—Warrell and I went to the police<lb></lb>station. <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner received a good character</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 2, Thornhill-place, Isling-ton—the house belongs to Mr. John Dashwood; he lives in the house—I am his housekeeper. I know the prisoner; her sister lodged there for some time, and the prisoner waited on her—I think the prisoner and her sister left about three weeks before the robbery was committed, and at the time of the robbery the prisoner was living in Bagnigge-wells-road—on Saturday night, 21st July, I went out; I got back about half-past ten o'clock—the servant told me something—I did not miss anything till the Sunday morning—I then found the drawer had been broken, and I missed a blue satin gown, and a piece of satin, and other things, worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was taken on the Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single; I live servant at this house of Mr. Dashwood's. On Saturday evening, 21st July, I went out about seven o'clock—I left no one in the house—I came out of the front door and closed it after me—it was fastened with a latch-lock—the house was safe in all other respects—the lock might be opened by anything that would turn it—I came back about ten, and found the door open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What profession is Mr. Dashwood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has a situation in a clothier's shop—they have lodgers at the house in Thornhill-place, not men, but young women—it is not a house where women go—I never saw any women there but the prisoner and her sister—the prisoner's sister had a room, the prisoner attended on her—I do not know how her sister got her living—she might have been a dressmaker or a staymaker—they had no visitors—I had an engagement to go out that night to the Strand.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see Mr. Dashwood again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he came back, and my husband would not let either of the sisters go out, and that was the reason they were all found the next morning—I said to Mr. Dashwood," When she came home she showed me a piece of satin, but she says she can give a very good account of it"—he said, "I am very much obliged to you for the information, we will search the room"—he took the policeman in, and between two beds he found the satin—he said he did not know it, but his wife did—I do not know whether Mr. Dashwood went to the station—only one of the sisters lodged with me, but the other two came to see her on the Sunday, and my husband would not let them go away till Mr. Dashwood came—we waited till two o'clock for him that night, and he did not come—he came on Monday.</p>

On the 29th of May I left the key in the wine cellar-door; I went down, and missed one bottle from a bin which I had seen safe that morning, it had laid very smooth, and if a bottle was gone I should know it; the wine had been there for six months; the prisoner was my pot-boy, and had access to that cellar; on the day following I left the key in the door on purpose, when he was going down to fetch a pail of water - I afterwards went into my bed-room, and saw him, (while he was washing his pots,) pour some wine out of a bottle, into a pint pot, and drink it - I had before this seen the bottle in the wash-house - I went down, and the bottle was gone - I told my wife; she said, "I will call him to tea;" I then went down again, and found the same bottle filled with gin - I fetched a constable; and he denied the whole of it- I knew the bottle by these two distinct marks of mud on it, which it got in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. But if your bottles had been elewhere, might they not have got some dirt on them? A. Yes - I missed the bottle on the evening of the day he drank the wine; I told him I was going out for an hour, and then I went to my bed-room; I saw it empty after he drank the wine, and I then missed it for about three minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean, that while you went to speak to your wife about the constable, it was filled with gin? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been there but two days; he said he had had a young man who had robbed him, and he should be very strict upon me - I said he might; this bottle of gin had been in the cellar nine months or more, and having a few words with my master, he got it up and accused me of it.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did the pint pot hold all the wine? A. There was one-half the wine gone out of the bottle at twelve o'clock, and the remainder he drank out of the pot - I had a good character with him.</p>

She was drunk. I went away to get a pot of beer for dinner; I came home at 9 o'clock at night; she wasn't there. A little boy gave me a letter from her, in which she said I was to write off and tell her father that she was off to Scotland, and he would never see her any more. I wrote to her father, and told him so. That is the last time I saw her."</p>

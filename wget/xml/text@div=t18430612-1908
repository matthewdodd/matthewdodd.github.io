About twenty minutes past two o'clock, on Monday, the 5th of Jane, I was standing at the corner of Grotto-passage, away from the rain—the prisoner came into the passage—this child was standing there alone—the child had no bonnet on—there were other persons at the other end of the passage—the prisoner asked the child where she lived—the child pointed towards her home—I heard the prisoner afterwards say, "Will you go with your father and mother, or with me?"—the child did not answer—she then took the child's left hand, and led her down Paradise-street, into a baker's shop—they came out again, and the child had a little loaf in her hand, and the prisoner had hold of the child—I followed them down South-street into a marine-store shop, in Marylebone-lane, and while there a policeman came in, and I told him—the prisoner came out of the marine store shop, and went into the pawnbroker's—she came out again and went into the marine-store dealer's again—she had the child's hand all the time, and when she came out of the marine-store shop the child had an old green bonnet on.</p>

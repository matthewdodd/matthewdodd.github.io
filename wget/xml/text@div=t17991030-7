O, I said, I will take care of that. Then the master,

Then Connell went up stairs and brought down a paper full of bad sixpences and shillings: Mrs. Connell said. you have not had time to colour them since; the devil colour you, says I; she said no more, but took them in her apron and served me with nind sixpences and three shillings for half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300008"></xptr>crown. The Magistrate gave me the half crown; I had no other money but one bad halfpenny; the Magistrate searched me before I went out. I received them from Mrs. Connell; Mr. Connell and Mary Waghorne were by at the time. I kept them in my hand in a bit of paper, till I gave them to the officer, Mr. Hamilton, which I did the moment I got out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This is a bad trade you have got into? - A. I don't think it is a bad trade to inform against all rogues.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stories of this kind have you hatched before? - A. I never hatched any before, and I am very glad I have informed against them; and I will inform against any body that I can find out coining money.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of your husband; he was transported, was he not? - A. He has served his king and country, and is now in Greenwich Hospital, where every vagabond cannot go.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do you follow? - A. I sell apples in the summer, and go to the wash-tub in the winter; I had better be any thing than a smasher.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a strange term? - A. I dare say you are very well acquainted with it; I have heard them call one another that every day these seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were taken up to Marlborough-street? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you never taken up for a smasher yourself? - A. I give my oath I never was. When I went down to the prisoner's house there was Molly outside the door selling apples.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you to get for going to buy this money? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you leave your business to go about and buy bad money? - A. Yes, and I would leave my business a month to find out such another set.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrates had so good and opinion of you, that they would not trust you with the half crown, without the officer going with you? - A. Yes, and a good thing too.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the house where these people lodged, you discovered a man, his <rs id="t17991030-7-deflabel36" type="occupation">wife</rs>

               <p>Q. It was the man that made the bargain with you? - A. No; he went up stairs and fetched the money, but the mistress served me.</p>
               <p>Q. You made a good bargain, did not you, seven shillings and sixpence for half a crown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to say that either of these prisoners served you with a farthing's worth of bad money? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrate desired you to tell them a lie? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did tell the lie? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know that half crown piece again? - A. Yes, perfectly; I have it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did she return to you? - A. From ten to fifteen minutes; I was in waiting near the house of these people.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of her information, did you go to the house where these persons were? - A. I did; the house is in Flying-horse-court, Oxford-street; Warren was with me; the three prisoners were all at dinner in a back room; she moment I got in, I seized the prisoner Waghorne, I began to search her, I found in her pockets bad money in this bag, (producing it;) there is one paper with five sixpences and two shillings, all bad; here is another paper with four shillings and seven sixpences, all bad; here is, in the same bag, a box containing some blacking.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use to which that blacking is applied in coining? - A. It is generally used upon bad money before it is attempted to be passed into circulation. I then searched the man, and in his sob I found this paper, containing five sixpences and one shilling, all bad. I then searched Mrs. Connell, and found, in a pocket in which was good money, the half crown that I had before given to Lewis, and one bad sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the half crown you found upon Mrs. Connell is the same that you furnished Lewis with? - A. Perfectly sure. I heard something which I desired Warren to take notice of; he will inform you about that. When I met Mrs. Lewis she produced to me this money in this paper, nine sixpences and three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these nine all represent the coinage of this country? - A. No; one of them appears to represent the French coinage.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that money good or bad? - A. It appears to me to be all bad.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not chuse to trust this honest Mrs. Lewis, without searching her? - A. No; I have understood it is the usual mode, and I did it by the direction of the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. That blacking you found upon one of the women? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing uncommon in that? - A. I think there is; I know of my own knowledge that it is used in coining and colouring.</p>

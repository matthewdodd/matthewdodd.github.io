                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Hassell, of Commercial-road, Stepney—we are linen-drapers—the prisoner was in our service about eleven months—I discharged him, on 15th Jan., for negligence—I called on some of our customers, and caused the prisoner to be apprehended—he was our town traveller—it was his duty to enter the money he received in the cash-book, and pay the money to us every night—sometimes he did not come at night—he used to come in the morning for orders where to go to, and then he paid—I went to take him into custody, and received this letter from his wife—it is his writing—the sums charged in this indictment are not entered in his cash-book.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your partner here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he has been subpœnaed on a trial—he has not been subpœnaed here—this is the book kept by the prisoner—it is the entering cash-book—we have a day-book; the prisoner did not keep that: I kept it sometimes, and some<lb></lb>times Mr. Hassell did—Mr. Hassell kept the ledger—the day-book was merely to enter orders—we enter cash in the cash-book—Mr. Hassell has entered sums in this cash-book; he has entered them from bills—he would not make entries from the prisoner's statements; he has never done it to my know<lb></lb>ledge, I will not swear that he has not—if the prisoner told him of an account he had received, Mr. Hassell might enter it—Mr. Hassell and I and the prisoner were all three together in the warehouse, at my residence in the Commercial-road, when we agreed to employ him—Mr. Hassell left it more to me, he is very deaf—I and the prisoner made the agreement—we employed him as a town traveller at a salary of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, travelling expenses, and one per cent, on all the money paid into this little book—we expected, when he received money, he would pay it to us—I do not know that there was anything particular said about the accounting—we are wholesale clothiers and slop-sellers—the prisoner had lived with Mr. Pawson—he introduced Messrs. Pawson and Co. to us as customers; we had them about three months, they spent 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at our place—he introduced a good many other persons to us—not a great number—he introduced Morrison and Co.—we have kept them; we sent them some goods last week—I went to them the morning the prisoner was discharged, to get an introduction to the buyers; it was not that the prisoner might not introduce anybody else—I went round to see whether the accounts were paid—the first deficiency I found</p>

               <p>was Mr. Sell's, in Tooley-street, the next day after the prisoner was discharged—he was given into custody the next day—the prisoner had never applied to me for money when I was not able to give it him but once—he has gone in the country when we had nothing for him, to do in town—he has not applied for his expenses to go down—he has asked for cash, and has always had it, with the exception of once, when he asked for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not tell him we had not got 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the house—I told him it was a heavy day, being the 4th of the month, the day we settle, and we liked to keep our banker's account as respectable as possible—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. might not have been an improper sum for him to have—we have not, during the time he has been with us, been exceedingly pressed for money—we have not, over and over again, received orders from him, which, on account of not having the money, we have not been able to execute, without it was one or two little things—he brought us an order for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Sheard, of the Strand—we would not send it; we did not like the order—I did not tell any one I was very sorry I could not execute Sheard's order, as he was a very good man—the prisoner settled accounts once before he left—it was in July—we had to pay him money then, I really do not know how much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what time did that settlement go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the time he came to our service, which was in February—in July we had to pay him about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we used to pay him his wages weekly, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me how much you paid him as the balance of his claim in July last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think there was a regular settlement—I do not see any balance in this book—this is not my account—Mr. Hassell generally keeps the account—the prisoner always had money when he wanted it—the settlement was between Mr. Hassell and myself, and the prisoner—this book is only an old banker's book—it is filled up—I brought it, to ascer<lb></lb>tain what money we have paid him—from February to June, be received 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he did not beg of me a fortnight before he left to go through his accounts—he said he should like to have a settlement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your answer to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That we would settle with him shortly, when he had been with us the six months, or the time had expired—up to July we always paid him his wages weekly, and afterwards we paid him his wages as he wanted them—he has received since the 4th Aug. 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is more than his wages—he made no claim on the morning I discharged him—he did not make any statement at all that I was indebted to him—I have not heard from anybody in my employ that he complained of any money being owing to him—it was by going round to my customers that I ascertained that these sums had been embezzled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and carry on business on Bread-street-hill. I had seen the prisoner once, and I believe no more—I have found a great many pamphlets, and this description of papers, and I judge by that that I have lost them.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had a great quantity of waste? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—we have no refuse, as we have no cutting press—I employed Mr. Meyrick, and he employed the prisoner—these pamphlets are mine—they were printed many years ago—they are probably not; worth more than waste, but they are not what we call waste—I print for various publishers, and what they do not take remains with me, and is my property—this is good waste, and is useful to me in various ways for set<lb></lb>off sheets.</p>

               <p>Mr. Clay asked mo to clear away his waste paper—I gave the prisoner leave to go and take it in my name.</p>

               <p>I was down at the bottom of Bear-key. I heard the locks rattle. I went up and saw a man by the gate-way. I asked him what he did there. He said a woman had picked him up, and picked his pocket. Finding the cellar-door open, Rice and I went down, with two lanterns, and at the farther end of the cellar we found the prisoner between the boards and the puncheons. We brought him out to a publick-house, and delivered him to a constable.</p>

               <p>On the 13th of this month I was called to assist the other witness at a cellar, at Bear-key gateway. When we got into the cellar we found five bladders of rum, and a cock in a cask. The next morning we found a tap-borer in the cellar. We went round the cellar, and found the prisoner concealed between the puncheons and the board.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the excise. On the 7th of this month I was at these buildings to let some hogsheads of rum out; they were then locked up and were never opened till they were broke open. The King's lock is always on as well as the trader's. The owner of the cellar is never allowed to go in without us. No other officer had the key but myself.</p>

               <p>A man asked me to earn a couple of shillings, and sent me down into the cellar, and said he would come to me with a light; I went down, and being in liquor, I fell asleep on the cask till this man came and waked me.</p>

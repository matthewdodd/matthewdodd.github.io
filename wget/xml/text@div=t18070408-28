               <p>Q. Are there any other lodgers in the house besides you. - A. Only one. On the 30th of March, I went out about half past three in the afternoon, I left my door locked, and my shutters bolted; I returned home about half past twelve; I found my door on the latch. I alarmed my landlord, and the first thing I missed was a basket, containing two bed quilts, and a blanket was taken away, and a straw bonnet, four gowns, four aprons, five petticoats, several napkins, and several towels; my landlord and me looked about the door, we found a child's spencer of mine in the saw-pit, opposite my door. We found a few piece of muslin, which is my property. The next day there was a child's petticoat produced at the office Worship-street, which I prove to be mine; it belonged to one of the children. They got in at the window and went out at the door; they had drawn the nails from the bolts of the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on the evening of the 30th of March, and at what what time, hear any noise. - A. Being an ailing man, I went to bed about eight o'clock; between eight and nine I heard a rumbling below stairs, like a drawing of boxes; I had been in the house all the afternoon, I heard no noise before; I can hear the mangle go in that room; I heard the street door shut as I laid in bed, after the rumbling noise was over, which was about ten minutes. About one o'clock my landlord came up and asked me if I had heard any noise; I told him I had heard a noise; I at the time supposed the woman was about her ordinary business.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street, Harding was brought to the office in Worship-street. On Tuesday morning the 31st of March, by Armstrong, Bishop, and Kennedy, I understood he had been in Shoreditch watchhouse, and he had secreted a child's skirt in the privy; I went with Bishop, and Bishop took the child's skirt out of the privy. The prosecutrix swore to it before the magistrate.</p>

            . On Monday night the 30th of March, I went out in company with Armstrong and Kennedy. About half after twelve o'clock we met the prisoner in company with two other men; knowing him, we secured him and took him to Shoreditch watch-house. I searched the prisoner Harding; in his hat I found a small child's black skirt; he said it was his own; he put it in his hat; the hat having no lining to keep it from coming over his eyes, believing his story, I returned it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him by name and person. - A. I did; I heard of this robbery about four o'clock in the morning; we kept Harding in the cage all night. In the morning we took him before the magistrate, and among other articles that were lost, this black petticoat was mentioned; I then asked Harding what he had done with the black petticoat that he had in his hat the night before; he said he had thrown it down the watch-house privy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assign any reason why he had done so. - A. No.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home about half after twelve o'clock; I was stopped by three of the officers and taken to the watchhouse. Bishop searched me, and left the petticoat in my hat; I was put in the cage, it was very wet and dirty; in the cage a man had been sick there. In the course of the night I fell asleep on the bench, my hat felt off, I would not put it in my hat again, it was very wet. The next day, when I was taken to the office, they asked me where the black petticoat was that I had in my hat; I directly told him where it was. I have two of the same yellow strings, and two or three of the same black pieces of stuff; my sister is here that made the petticoat.</p>
               <p>- HARDING. Q. Are you the prisoner's sister. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make this petticoat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the petticoat before you see it. - A. It is bombazeen, with a narrow hem at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen it since your brother has been taken up. - A. No, I have not; it has yellow strings to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080019"></xptr> it. I made it nine weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have examined it before; I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Jury. The stuff which the prisoner has produced and the skirt appear to be very similar, and there is no doubt but the strings he has produced are of the same piece of goods as the strings on the petticoat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer, of 35, Jamaica-row, Bermondsey—on Sunday morning, 14th February, about a quarter to 3 o'clock, I was lying awake, and heard footsteps, and somebody trying to open the door which I had fastened on going to bed—my window was not fastened, and the prisoner knew that there was no fastening to it—somebody came to my bed<lb></lb>side, and passed their band between the mattress and the bed, and tried to take a cash-box which was there from under my head—I have been in the habit of keeping it there for the last five or six years—the man struck a light, and lit the candle, and then I saw that it was the prisoner—I jumped out of bed, and took hold of him—he became very much excited, and was all in a tremble—I walked to the window, a man came from the opposite tide of the road, and said, "All right"—I said nothing when I seized the prisoner, nor had he said anything to me—he was standing still in the room while I was at the window—I returned to my bedside, and sat down and dressed, while the prisoner waited there—I had not said anything to him—I knew him; I might have been a little excited—I have not seen the man outside, since, but I know him, and have seen him and the prisoner together—after I was dressed, the prisoner opened the door and walked down stairs—I picked up the light, and followed him into my shop—I told him he could sit down, and make himself comfortable till the police came—he said, "Some man came across and called me up and said, 'Somebody is breaking into your master's house'—I asked him who his master was, but he made no reply—he was not my servant then—he ceased to be so in October—he had been in my service three months, and in my brother's a little over five years, at the same place—I had a habit of putting my money into a box, and putting it under the mattrass, and the prisoner knew that: he had fetched it from there several times—I had in the box that night 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

On Friday, 7th June, I went to the London Docks, to take a berth in the <hi rend="italic">Sir Robert Peel</hi>, which ship I was to emigrate in—after I had been there, I went to the American Stores public-house—I then had twenty-nine sovereigns placed in two fingers of a glove, which had some black thread tied round them, in my side coat-pocket—the prisoner was there—he had some accordions in a bag, and books of instruction—I bought one of them, and another man, also, who was with me, who was going in the same ship—it was near one o'clock—we stayed in the house till three, and the prisoner also—we had a good deal of ale to drink—at three o'clock I asked the prisoner to play another tune, and he refused, saying that his sabbath began then—I do not recollect anything that happened after three o'clock, how I left the house, or what became of my money—I did not get sober till the next morning, but I was conscious I had lost my money and the glove; there is no doubt that it was gone next morning—I went to the station at five o'clock the same afternoon; but I am not conscious of the time myself—this is my glove (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

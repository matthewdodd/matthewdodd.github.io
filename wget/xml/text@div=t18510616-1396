                  </hi>. I live in Lower Marsh, Lambeth. I deal in china and glass—the prisoner was my servant-of-all-work—my family consists of my wife and one child; on Tuesday morning, 20th May, about 9 o'clock, I had occasion to go up-stairs—I left my waistcoat on a chair in the parlour—there was a sovereign and two half-sovereigns in the pocket—I had seen them safe at 12 o'clock the night before—I had not seen the money that morning, but I had heard the sound of it in bringing the waistcoat down-stairs just before—when I got up-stairs my wife was there, and the prisoner—I sent the pri<lb></lb>soner for some water, and told her to take it into the parlour; she did so, and I waited up-stairs till she came up again—I was up-stairs about 5 minutes altogether—I then went down, and I did not leave the parlour again—in about a quarter of an hour I went to my waistcoat—I was going to put the money in a bag—I found the sovereign had been taken away, and a bright farthing was put in its place—the two half-sovereigns were left there—I am quite sure that the sovereign was there the night before, and not the farthing—I cannot tell whether it was the sovereign or the farthing that I heard rattle</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185106160107"></xptr>
               <p>that morning—I afterwards told my wife, and she went up to the prisoner—the brought down a woman's pocket belonging to my wife, and in it was a purse, containing two sovereigns and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and a foreign silver coin—I did not know the purse, but I knew the coin; it was one I had given to my wife some months previous—the prisoner had been in my service about three quarters—my wife was out when I first missed the sovereign—I told her about it when she came in—I could not swear to the money, because there was no mark on it; only my suspicion was raised by the prisoner bringing home five or six new dresses, and she had not received any wages.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Moses. When I came in that day, he gave me some information—I went up to the prisoner, who was in her own bedroom—I told her her master had missed a sovereign from his pocket; and as I had been missing things for some time, I intended now to have a search for them—I asked her if she had any money about her—she said she had not a farthing, and wore no pockets; taking, a penny from the table, she said that was all she had in the world—she said she was going out for a holiday, and she intended to ask me for some money—I searched her box, and found several pieces of lace cut from lengths in my drawers, and two pieces of silk, cut from lengths in the drawers—I then asked her to let me search her, which she refused, and said she would unfasten her dress herself; and she unfastened it to the waist, but the skirt still kept close—a lace cuff of mine was in her bosom—I lifted up the skirt of her dress, and saw a pocket of my own—not where a pocket is usually worn, but in front of her, under the skirt—I took hold of the pocket—it was tied round her waist—the string broke, or I should not have got it, for she resisted very much—in the pocket I found a purse, which I did not know—there were two sovereigns in it, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a foreign silver coin, and some coppers—the foreign coin I am positive was my own—I had had it sixteen or eighteen months—my husband gave it me; when I found the money, the prisoner said she had found the foreign coin in my bed-room, and the two sovereigns, and all the other money, her sister had given her—I bad missed this coin, I think, for a month, but I had never mentioned it—I thought it might have got loose in the drawer—it was missing from a small trinket-box in the drawer—I kept the drawers locked, but the prisoner was frequently sent to the drawers.</p>

I said, "What money I have is my own; my sister gave it me to go home and see my mother;" I had told my mistress, months back, that I was going home in June to see my mother; I had in my pocket two sovereigns and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the two sovereigns were what my sister gave me to go home; the prosecutrix then went down-stairs, and showed my master my purse with the money in it, and my master gave me in charge; my mistress was not so friendly with me as usual, having had a quarrel with her nephew, and tearing the coat off his back; he summoned her, and she had no witnesses; she came to me, and asked me to be a witness against her nephew by saying that I saw the quarrel between them, when I had not, and I said I would not; and when I would not go, she promised her shop-boy a shilling if he would go with her; and when he would not go, she discharged him the next day, and after that she never liked me, and she used to leave money about in the chair-covers, and all parts of the house, and in the par<lb></lb>lour, where she says she missed the sovereign; I found a half-sovereign about a fortnight before be missed the sovereign, and I gave it up directly I found it; I found sixpences and shillings also in the chair-covers, and always gave them up; I humbly beg to throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

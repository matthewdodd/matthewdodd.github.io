                  </hi>. I am the chief engineer of the <hi rend="italic">Marley Hill</hi>, and was so on 23rd Jan. last—she is an iron screw steamer, belonging to the General Iron Screw Collier Company—she returned from the Crimea on 23rd Jan., and came into Limehouse Hole, in the river Thames—I left the ship about 4 o'clock that afternoon with Milligan, the third engineer—I left the prisoner on board, the second mate, two Custom-house officers, and some of the firemen, that were getting the things over the side—the prisoner was the second engineer—before leaving the ship I went into the engine room—I examined it, and looked at all the cocks—they were all in a pro<lb></lb>per position—there was about six or seven inches of water in the engine room when I left—the cock in question is called a "sea cock"—it is attached to the ship's side for the purpose of supplying the ship with water when wanted—it is considerably below the level of the water outside, and when it is turned on the water flows abundantly into the vessel—I returned to the ship, about a quarter after 10 o'clock next morning—I then found seven feet of water or upwards in the engine room—that could not have come from leakage—the prisoner and I had had no quarrel of any conse<lb></lb>quence before this, a little jangling on the passage, nothing more than that.</p>

                  </hi>. I was third engineer on board the <hi rend="italic">Marley Hill</hi>, and came over in her from the Crimea—we arrived at Limehouse on 23rd Jan.—I went ashore at 5 o'clock—I believe Taylor was then on board, and the chief mate—I saw that everything was right in the engine room a few minutes before going ashore—the sea cock was shut—it is difficult to move, it requires the whole strength of my one arm to move it, either to open or shut it—it is used for different purposes, either to pump water in or out, or to pump water into the boiler, or on deck, to wash the decks—it could not be opened by a person merely walking casually past it—nobody could open it by knocking against it—I went into the engine room next morning about 6 o'clock, and found between six and eight feet of water in it—I did not see the cock at that time, it was covered with water—I have never known more than two feet of water in the engine room in the worst weather—I am certain that quantity of water could not have come in if the cock had not been opened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I reside at Bethnal-green—I rent Peel-grove Chapel: that is for the committee of the Wesleyan Methodists—they use that place for worship—I am clerk—on Thursday evening, 14th October, I went to the chapel door—no one went with me—I met the witness Boss there, and an old gentleman—I put the key into the lock—I found that the bolt of the lock was back, and that the door was fastened with a small bolt under<lb></lb>neath the lock, inside—Mr. Boss immediately ran round behind the chapel—while he was gone, I heard somebody at the door inside, and supposing that Mr. Boss had got in behind, I said, "Boss, can you not open the door," and immediately the door flew open, and a man rushed out and nearly knocked me down—I seized the man—we both fell down in the mud—I was covered with mud—I held his clothes, and a piece of his coat that I had hold of came out—I dropped that—the man ran away—as I ran after him Boss passed me very quick, and I cried out "hold him, hold him"—I immediately returned to the chapel to see what had been done—the prisoner answers the general description of the man who knocked me down—the first thing I did when I got inside the chapel, was to turn the gas on, and I lighted one of the lamps—I went to the vestry door immediately, and found that the lock was literally smashed to pieces—we have not missed anything—the clock, which was suspended by a very strong nail at the top, had been turned round as though some one had endeavoured to wrench it off—the tops of the pews near the clock were covered with dirt, and the mark of a man's hand was all down the wall as if some one had been standing on the pews.</p>

               <p>round to the back"—I stopped there a little while—I heard a bit of a scuffle, and I saw a man running away from the chapel—I pursued after the man—he jumped over two fences—I followed him into the middle of a field—he turned round menacingly, and I thought it advisable to keep away from him—we had a struggle, and he got away—I followed him to the high road, and held him till some one came up—when I first saw him he was about thirty yards from the chapel—there were other people there—I believe the prisoner is the man that Smith was pursuing—Smith was apparently running after him—when Mr. Smith saw me running after him he stopped—a piece of cloth was found the next morning which matches his coat.</p>

On the evening in question, I was on duty at Cambridge-road—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I went to the spot where the alarm was given, and found the prisoner in the hands of Mr. Boss and several others—I examined the prisoner's coat—I found a piece of cloth missing from it (<hi rend="italic">the coat was here produced</hi>)—it is now in the same state as when I found it on the prisoner—there is a piece missing in the breast—the front of it was in a very wet state, as if he had recently rolled in the mud—the mud is now dry—the prisoner was quite sober.</p>

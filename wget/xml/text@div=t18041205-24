             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden: On Monday, the 12th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I stood in Cross-street, Sutton-street, near to Charterhouse-wall, I saw the prisoner at the bar with this package on his head and shoulders together; there was a carman coming along, he said, good man, you are loaded, it seems falling, shall I assist you? he put his hands, and heaved it up, while the prisoner got his head under it; they walked on by me; I looked at the bundle, and went and stopped him; I asked him what he had got; he said, what is that to you; I said, I am an officer, and I insist to see what you have got; I suspected them to be part of the things in the hand-bill we had given in at our Office; I asked him where he was going with it; he said, he believed he was going to Chick-lane, but the gentleman gone on was the person that the property belonged to, he had but just taken it up, that he met him in Aldersgate-street, he told him he would give him two shillings to carry a bundle for him; I asked him where he worked; he said at Mr. Bartholomew's, he was in the masonry line, at Islington, he was coming from work; I put him in a coach, and took him to the Office; after I had taken him to prison, I told him he might as well tell me where he fetched it from; then he told me that that man that was along with him brought him out of Whitecross-street, and engaged him to carry this bundle for two shillings, and that him and another man lifted him up with it at a shop-door within about three yards from where I saw him; there is no shop within a hundred yards of the place; he said, if he had his liberty, he could find the parties that gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the man before? - A. I believe I have, but not lately; he had two shillings in his pocket, which he pretended to say was given him to carry the bundle; he is a stonemason by trade, he was out of here but four or five days before the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is he? - A. Sixty-six; I produce the property.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gillman.) Look at these things? - A. I cannot swear to them, there are no marks on them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Woolley.) Do you know whether these are the goods that you put on board this waggon? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Williams. They are prohibited goods; I am a King's officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether these are the goods that you put on board this waggon? - A. I cannot venture to swear, but I believe I have a piece out of the same lot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am the man that worked for Mr. Wilmot, a plasterer, at Battle-bridge; as I was going home, at five in the evening, in Clerkenwell parish, between St. John's-street and Goswell-street, a man spoke to me at a corner house, and said, will you carry a load for me; he said into Field-lane; says I, Sir, I will go and fetch a knot; a knot, says he, you do not want a knot, it is only some things in a bag; with that, he fetched it out of a house; I had not walked above forty yards from the house, he gave me two shillings; he says, old man, you carry it very uneasy, shall I lift it up? Mr. Chapman coming by, asked me what I had got; says I, what is that to you, Sir, thinking it was some gentleman that enquired; a woman made answer, and said, he is an officer, and will see; with that, I begged pardon; then he tied my hands before me; pray, says he, how came you by these things here? says I, you know where you met me, as you turn towards the right towards Goswell-street way, there is a corner house, that is the house I came from; says he, did he give you any thing; yes, I said, two shillings; with that, he searched my pockets, and found no more; then he said, where do you live? I gave him to understand where I lived as well as I could, I was not afraid; I said, my daughter shall go and shew you; that is every word I said from first to last, and it is nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Chapman.) Is it a fact that he told you this story? - A. Yes; the prisoner's daughter was not there at that time, she was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at work for Mr. Newman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050027"></xptr>and the turnkeys know it, at the time this robbery was committed.</p>

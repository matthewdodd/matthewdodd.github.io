            . I am a bricklayer. I was in Kingsland-road on the 12th of October, between seven and eight o'clock at night, and saw the waggon there, and the prisoner in it - he had three more with him, who were standing against a stay shop; the prisoner got into the waggon twice, and came out again without bringing any thing - he went in a third time, and came out with a little bundle under his arm, which he gave to one of the others. I followed them into Hare-walk - they all went together, when they got to the bottom of Hare-walk I lost sight of them. I presently saw three of them come up again with the things in a basket, a bundle, and a bag - the prisoner had the bundle, it seemed to me to be the same. I followed them to the corner of Turner-square - one of them went up Hoxton, the prisoner and another went down the square - I did not see him again till he was in custody - I knew him before quite well. I went home and told my father, he told the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you live? A. At the side of the Dutchess of York, public-house, Kingsland-road - the prisoner lived with his father. I have never been to his father to enquire about him. I saw the prisoner take this bundle from the waggon; it was after I had been here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards? A. No, it was about a week after I had seen the waggon robbed; my father told me it was on the 12th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you on the 9th of October? A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What day is this? A. I do not know, nor what month. I can swear this was on the 12th of October, because my father told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at a fire to-day? A. Yes, on Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. And was you charged there with picking a pocket? A. Yes, but I never picked a pocket in my life. I am a bricklayer. I live in Union-buildings, Kingsland-road, but at the time of the robbery I lived in Wellington-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The persons you appeared against before were Briggs and Carter? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always given the same account of it? A. Wells and Archer were with me, and saw what I did.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in company with the last witness when he was charged with taking a handkerchief? A. Yes; we told the gentleman we were here as witnesses, and therefore we were not locked up.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BARLOW. I live in North-place, Kingsland-road. On Sunday, the 19th of June, I was on my way to church, and saw the prisoner and another young man in a field near a dung-heap - I have some ducks which run in and out of that field; on my return from church I missed one duck - about three o'clock I went again into the field, and saw the prisoner and another person driving the ducks about and trying to catch one; I set a watch, and went for a Policeman - on my return I missed a drake, and found the prisoner and the drake in my house: they had been taken there while I went for the Policeman.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BARTRAM. I am servant to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner and another man in his field that Sunday, hunting the ducks - when the prisoner went away I pursued him, and Benfield took him, and took a drake from his pocket; the other man ran away.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BENFIELD. I was in the prosecutor's field on the Sunday afternoon. I saw the prisoner and another laying by the side of the pond; they then got up - I moved and looked over a wall; I saw the other feeding the duck with bread, and when they got between the two, the prisoner took one and put it into his pocket; they then went away - I pursued, and took the prisoner with the drake in his pocket.</p>

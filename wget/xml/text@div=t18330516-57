            . I lodge at a coffee-shop, next door to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner there that night, but did not see him go out; but about four in the morning I saw him with a copper on his shoulder - there had been a disturbance at the coffee-shop all night - there were twenty other persons there and the prisoner; they were pulling the seats up, and breaking the place to pieces - I did not see where the prisoner got the copper, but he turned down a street, and I told what I had seen.</p>

             (police-constable D 151). I was on duty about four in the morning of the 7th of May, in Lisson-grove - I saw the prisoner come out of Duke-street with his hands very dirty, and when he saw me he pretended to be very drunk - I went round my beat and in about five minutes I saw the prisoner again in Dukemews; I went into the mews and saw the copper, the prisoner was then gone out another way; I looked for him, but could not find him - I took the copper to the station, and the next morning I fitted it to the place where it had been - I know that coffee-house, it has had a bad character, and has been reported.</p>

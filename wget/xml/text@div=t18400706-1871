The prisoner was in my employ, from June to September last—I paid him what he earned—he took his work out of the shop—I was losing leather all that time, which attracted my attention—I tied up my leather in bundles, such as twelve pairs at a time, and if I had five or six pairs left, I tied them together again—the prisoner left me near about the end of September.</p>

I was in the prosecutor's employ—about the 29th of August, the prisoner went to the drawer in the prosecutor's shop, and took one pair of boot-fronts out, he put them up his coat, and took them up Stairs where we both slept—there was a mark which he rubbed out with a piece of glass—I do not know what he did with the leather—the first pair of fronts he took he worked up.</p>

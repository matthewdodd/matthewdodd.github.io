            . I gave the prisoner this cheque(read, drawn by D. Fletcher, on Messrs, Gillespie for 5l. 15s.) - I gave it to him to be at Messrs. Gillespie's by ten o'clock; I told him if he would go, and come back directly, I would give him something to get a breakfast- he did not come back; I did not see him again till last March - his wife was out at the time; he went away with his child - she returned in a short time, took all their things, and went away.</p>

            . I was at Messrs. Gillespie's when the cheque was paid - I entered it in the book, but I cannot tell who had it; it was paid on the day it is entered - Mr. Dowson came in the afternoon, and asked if we had paid the money; it had been paid two hours before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you had not looked at the book, would you have remembered any thing about it? A. I distinctly remember the payment, but not the person; I looked at the back to see if it was entered - Mr. Gillespie asked me the question, and mentioned the name of Dowson; I cannot say whether it was a man or woman received it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you be sure whether the person who complained that the money had not been paid, was the person who presented it? A. My impression is that it was not, but I cannot be positive - it was paid in five sovereigns, but whether the silver was in shillings or halfcrowns I do not know; we keep sovereigns exclusively for the purpose of paying these orders, and never pay notes.</p>
               <p>Q. But if I wanted a 5l. note to send in a letter, you would accommodate me with it? A. It is a very unusual thing; I never knew it done.</p>

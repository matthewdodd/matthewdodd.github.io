On the 22nd of April, at a little past nine o'clock in the evening; I was at the Red Lion at Kilburn—the prisoner was sitting in the tap-room—I had a quarrel with another man—I pulled off my coat to fight him and laid it down On the seat—there was a pair of stockings, a handchief, and a prayer book, in my coat—I was about half-and-half—I did not fight with the man long, as we made it up—I went to look for my coat, and could not find it—the prisonerwas gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I met the prisoner about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, on the 22nd of April, in Abbiey-fields, coming from the direction of Kilburn, with a fustian frock coat in her apron—I asked how she came by it—she said it was her father's, who worked on the railway—I asked if he was going home without a coat—she said, "No, when I brought his dinner down to-day, I brought him his great coat, and I am going to take this one home"—about twelve that night I heard there was a coat lost, and I looked after the prisoner; but I did not meet with her till the Thursday after, when I found her in Salisbury-street, Portman-market—I said, "I want you about the coat I stopped you with on Saturday night"—she said, "Yes, I told you a fine tale, but I did not think you would let me go"—in going to the station, she said, "You will not find the coat; there is another in that; it is not pawned, but sold."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you have a character with him? A. No, he came as a lad to work for us at two or three shillings a week; when I called him back, he was in the yard about ten yards from the counting-house - he had quitted the factory, and had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110123"></xptr>baize under his arm; any one could see it - we never knew that he took cochineal home to grind; he lost three fingers, and then we employed him in the dye-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he his hat on at the time he was stopped? A. Yes, he had a place to grind the cochineal on our premises.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had by mistake taken 2lbs. of cochineal to grind, and was returning it to its place when the prosecutor charged him with stealing it.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 19.</p>

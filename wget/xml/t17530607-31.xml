I told her I was not a good judge of diamonds, and upon my own judgment could not allow her above six guineas; but if she would leave it a day I'd shew it to a friend of mine, and if he valued it at more I'd give her more for it: she said she would not part with it under 8 guineas, for she had given 11 guineas for it, and that the weight of the stones were in the receipt, which was three grains, and that she had the jeweller's receipt at home, which she could shew. I said if she would leave it a day, I'd shew it the person that did that sort of work for me, and if he valued it at the money I'd give it her. She said she could go to a shop higher and could have it, so they went out of the shop with it, and return'd within the space of a minute, and Clark said, then she would take seven guineas for it, but no less, for she did not love haggling, or some such sort of a word she made use of: I still desir'd her to leave it, and then she said give me six guineas, and I will put three or four more to it, and you shall make me a better; but before I bought this ring, it was necessary I thought to look into the Advertisements from Goldsmith's-hall, upon which

I paid her the six guineas bargain'd for, I had opened shop but about a month, upon which very likely they took the advantage of coming to me, for I had no advertisement concerning this ring being stolen. Just in the interim Mr. Flavel pass'd by my door, he was the jeweller I intended to have shewn the ring to, I beckon'd to him, and shewed it him, and desired him to give me his opinion of the value of this ring, he immediately put it on his finger, and said, Sir, this is my ring, and I'll swear to it. Upon which O Neal desired we would not make a mob to expose her, so we took them into the back parlour; Mr. Flavel sent for his wife, who, as soon as she entered the room, said to O Neal, I know you are one of the women, but I am not quite positive to the other. The other had not spoke above a minute or two, before she said, now I am positive you are the other person. As as soon as Mr. Flavel claim'd the ring, Clark said she had taken it in pawn, and had lent five guineas and half upon it, and that

When they were taken before the justice he examined them apart.

            . I had been ill for some time, and kept my room on Saturday before Christmas-Day, my servant acquainted me there were two women below; but I did not see them. My wife had call'd to me for the amethists to be sent down; after this my wife came up stairs with the rings from below, I open'd the case, and miss'd a 3 stone brilliant ring, then I dispatch'd my apprentice to some shopkeepers to detect the women, if offering them to sale. I sent another servant to the turner's shop; he brought word back that the turner and his apprentice answer'd the description given of them by one of the women; but the turner's wife was neither of the women who had been at my house. On Christmas day, being the Monday following, I advertis'd the ring, and the day following, with proper descriptions of it; but never heard any thing of it till last Tuesday. Passing by Mr. Portall's shop in the Strand, seeing people in it, I pass'd the door, he beckon'd his hand for me to come in, as soon as I came in, he said to the women (the two prisoners at the bar) it is very lucky, this is the very man I intended to carry it to to-morrow: he gave the ring into my hand, and ask'd me the value of it, I wiped it, and look'd at it. I know it from ten thousand, because I have wore it scores of times myself. I clapp'd it on my finger, and said it is my ring, and I'll swear to it. He told me he had given six guineas for it to those women. I begg'd his leave to shut his door too for a minute, and said, that ring was stole from me by two women that I had never seen, and insisted upon detaining them, till I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175306070023"></xptr> sent for my wife, which I did, and said if she did not know them they might go about their business, but it was necessary they should return the gentleman his money.

             said return it if it was ever so much, which then she did; after that, they told me I looked like a good-natur'd man, and that they knew I was father to several children, and that I should have compassion ; and as to money, if I would accept of it, 20 or 30 l. was at my service, and produced to that value, in gold of different pieces : they afterwards found that would not do, they laid they'd make it a hundred; I said, if they made it a thousand it would not do. As soon as my wife enter'd the room, she said to O Neal, as to you, madam, I am positive you was one of the women that was in our house, and you had a red cloath about your face at the time. She said to the other, as to you, madam, I must think a little; for, if I mistake not, you was with child at that time, and by conversing, Clark said she had a child 5 months old; after that, upon O Neal's speaking to her, she said it was 9 months old. My wife said after this she was certain as to the other. They were taken before justice Lediard: they were examined apart, and made many blunders in their examination. One went by four different names.</p>

             ask'd me if I could take a red stone out of a ring, and put a purple one in (that was to take a garnet out, and put in an amethist, I said I could) so took up the ring, and took it out, and came down; they chose out an amethist. I went to the lapidary to have that stone cut less; when I came back they were both gone. I went up to my master, and he said, do you know them, I said I should could I see them. He sent me after them to the turner's shop, but the turner's wife was quite different from either of them. The man and apprentice answer'd the description they had given. On the Sunday at night I carried an advertisement to the Daily Advertiser, facing St. Dunstan's church, and it was put in, on the Monday, being Christmas-day. I was sent for to justice Lediard's. The justice ask'd me, if I knew that lady, meaning O Neal; I said, I believ'd that was the woman that had a red cloath at her face; she said I am not asham'd of my face. I said I will not swear of her face ; but as to

            . I happen'd to be at Mr. Jeffery's in the Strand last Tuesday, he came in and said Mr. Flavel has been robb'd, and the two women are at Mr. Portall's, I went there, and saw them in the back parlour; I was there when Mrs. Flavel came in; immediately she said she knew O Neal, but the other she could not be sure of just then (she said it was the same gown, but there may be one gown like another ). As soon as Clark spoke, she said now I know you very well. Mr. Flavel went out to get a constable and a warrant. They both fell on their knees to me, and begg'd I'd persuade Mrs. Flavel not to prosecute them. O Neal said she had a husband, and desir'd not to be expos'd. I ask'd her if she had any friends, or who she knew, she nam'd a gentleman in the city, and said he was at her house but two nights before, but I could not prevail upon her to send for any body.</p>

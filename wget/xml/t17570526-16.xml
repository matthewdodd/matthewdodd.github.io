            . On Holy Thursday, at about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner tying the legs of a sheep, after which he laid it in a bye place; he had fourteen other sheep, which he was driving to Bloomsbury Market, and in about half an hour afterwards he came back to fetch that which he had tied the legs of.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that sheep mark'd?</p>
               <p>Farrier. There was a figure of eight on the rump, and the letter I.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is the prisoner your servant?</p>

               <p>Farrier. I went and told the constable after he had laid the sheep in that bye place, who came and took it into his possession, till the prosecutor came and demanded it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when he came back for the sheep?</p>

            . The prisoner was bringing some sheep to Bloomsbury-Market, when the beadle came with another man and told me of a sheep laying in a bye place, with its legs tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>Ford. I live at the Plough in Queen-Street, Bloomsbury Market.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Ford. I am a constable. I went there and saw some people about the sheep, which I took and carried into my yard, to lie there till somebody own'd it. After this the prisoner came, and finding the sheep was gone from the place where he had laid it, he came and demanded it of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose did he say it was?</p>
               <p>Ford. He said it was his own; after that he said it was a butcher's in St. James's-Market; after that he said it was a sheep that followed him from Paddington, and he would take it back again; when I said I would not let him have it till the right owner came, he said he would fetch the owner in half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come for it?</p>
               <p>Ford. No, nobody that night, till the next day about nine o'clock; then the prosecutor came and demanded it. The next day we found the prisoner, between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Ford. He said little or nothing.</p>

               <p>Ford. He said there that the sheep came into his drove by the brick-fields.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house on that day for fourteen sheep, which he was to take away; my servant not being in the way, I desired him to take them away right, and that he would stop as he came by the door with them, that I might count them; but when he came with them, he hurried them by so fast, that I could not count them. I went down into the field about half an hour afterwards, and found that one sheep belonging to the prosecutor was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. I live at Paddington, and take in butchers sheep to grase.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this sheep?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. It was in my ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the other fourteen sheep belong to?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. They belong'd to other persons, not the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he to drive the other fourteen to?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. To Bloomsbury market.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheep all together in your ground?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. They were all in one pen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take them out of the pen?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him as he went by with the sheep?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. I call'd to him, and said I could not tell them; he said they were all right. The next morning the prisoner came to me, and ask'd me if I had lost a sheep, saying he had found one in the Brick-fields. I ask'd him why he did not bring it home; he said it was in the constable's hands, who would not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was that?</p>

               <p>I went to Mrs. Gee's house for fourteen sheep, and driving them along I went to case myself, and the sheep went down the road; when I came to count them I found one more than I should have, so I took and ty'd it's legs, and drove the others where they were to go. Then I went up to Peter-street, to a young man that drives a cart, and said I had found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260016"></xptr> a sheep in my parcel that was none of my own, and bid him come down and look at the marks. He said he would. When we came there the sheep was taken into the constable's house, and they would not let us see it till the constable came home. I ask'd where he was, they said just by. When I saw him he said it was one Mr. Giblett's sheep, it was mark'd with the letter I. They ask'd me how she came amongst mine, I said I did not know. I went to Mr. Giblett's drover, to see if he had lost such a sheep, but the constable bid him keep away, and not trouble himself about it, so he is not here to be a witness for me.

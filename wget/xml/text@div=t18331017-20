            . On the evening of the 6th of September, I was at Bartholomew-fair, near Richardson's booth, and saw the prisoner there, he spoke to me, and described the characters to me in the booth - I thought he spoke in the broad Yorkshire dialect: he asked me to walk round the fair with him, which I did - he showed me the different booths, and when he came to Giltspur-street, he pointed to a second floor window of a coffee-shop, and wanted me to go in, as he said, he had had neither dinner nor tea - I did not go in with him, we came on to Newgate, and he pointed to another coffee-shop, and wanted me to go in - I said I was not in the habit of going to such places - he complained of wanting tea - I said,"Come home to my lodging, and I will give you some tea;" I took him to my lodging in <placeName id="t18331017-20-crimeloc116">Tower Royal</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you been in town before this? A. I came to town in June; I was in the employ of Fpy and Curtis, of Thames-street - I am not so now; I left them on the Saturday before this happened - I had never seen the prisoner before; he spoke to me and described the characters to me; I did not tread on his toe and beg his pardon - he began to talk to me, and described the characters, and asked me to walk round and see the shows, and I went; when he pointed to the coffee shop and wished me to go in, I said I was not used to go to such places - and that is true, I never go to such places - I have done it at times, but never do it promiscuously - I have not been to more than two, since I have been in London; the pin was found in his breast, where it would naturally be if it was his; the ring was found in his pocket, the handkerchief was found in his coat pocket; I never took a stranger to my lodging and left him alone for twenty-five minutes before - I have lodged there since the 2nd of July; I did not say to him, "I have a friend coming, be so good as to go;" he was on the sofa when I returned to the room - the sofa stood on the opposite side of the room - I had walked with him all this way; I had not pressed him to go home with me - he went of his own accord; he went to Queen-street - he complained then of being hungry, and I said I would give him some tea if he came to my lodging - it did not occur to me that it would be better to give him tea at a coffee shop; I am a Yorkshireman; I knew we should be quite private at my lodging - I have no wife or children; I noticed my bureau, and missed the things after I returned up stairs -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170021"></xptr>I had not the key in my pocket; the bureau was open, and the key was lying inside - the sovereigns were left in it; there was no servant in the house and therefore I thought it safe.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Pickering was called for, did he charge you with taking indecent liberties with him? A. He did; there was no truth in that - I never had such a thing happen to me before - I have been in St. James's park many times; I was once accosted there by a gentleman; I had stopped in Sloane-square and took supper one Sunday evening, that was not with a stranger - as I returned, I was coming along, they told me I could not get out of the park except by the monument - I was going along there, and a gentleman came up and spoke to me, and wanted to take my arm; I said I was not in the habit of talking to people I did not know, and begged him to keep his distance, or I should give him in charge; and when we came to the steps, he went away from me; I did not give him in charge, he left me; that was some weeks before I was at Bartholomew fair - this happened at ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. But at the fair you walked round with a stranger and heard his explanation of things? A. Yes; I took him home to tea because he said he was a Yorkshireman, and was hungry - I did not ask his name - I am doing no business now; I have not a fortune, but I have enough to support me at the present time - my employers and I did not agree - they did not turn me away - I did not desire to go; since that, I have been doing nothing - I have been living at Hampstead occasionally; I did not ask the prisoner what part of Yorkshire he came from - he asked me what part I came from; I said, "The north;" he said his grandfather was a Scotchman, and he a Yorkshireman.</p>
               <p>Q. When Miss Pickering came into the room, did you desire her to shut the window shutters? A. Yes, when she brought the candles - (it was half-past six o'clock, or nearly seven o'clock, when my friend called) - that was after I had been down to my friend; he was gone then; he was to call again in a quarter of an hour, and he came again; but I did not go to Vauxhall - the prisoner made this charge against me immediately anybody came that he could make it to.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you been up in the room when you called Mrs. Pickering? A. I should think five minutes the very uttermost.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you in the habit of wearing that ring? A. Yes; one ring, with a red stone in it, I wore that very day; that was the ring found on the prisoner; the other was found by the staircase window.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you have it on your finger at the fair? A. Yes; I took it off in the room at the table; he asked me to allow him to look at it, as he never had one on his finger; and I left it on the table when I was called down - when I returned to my room, I went to get the key of the cupboard, to get a bottle of spirits; I was going to give him some spirits, and I missed the key; and I accused him of robbing me, as I missed two sovereigns, a seal, and a ring - the key of the place where the spirits were was in the bureau drawer, where the other things were; and on going to get the key, I missed the things; I said, "I have been robbed since I have been down stairs," and he must have robbed me; he said, if I said so, he would knock me down; and I opened the door, and called out to Mrs. Pickering, "Thief, and a bad character;" and he pushed by me towards the stairs, I caught hold of him, he got hold of my handkerchief and dragged me along - I suppose tea was about a quarter of an hour getting ready, and we were about a quarter of an hour having it, and it was about half an hour before my friend called.</p>

            . My brother lives directly opposite Mrs. Pickering; she called my attention to her house between seven and eight o'clock I think; I went in directly - I found somebody standing in the passage; I took a light from her, and went up stairs; and on the landing I saw the prosecutor and prisoner struggling; the prisoner was trying to get away, the prosecutor had hold of him, and appeared very much exhausted; he said the prisoner had robbed him - the prisoner said, if I would go up stairs he would explain all to me; he went up, the prosecutor followed him, and I followed him - when we got up the prosecutor accused him of robbing him of two sovereigns, and two or three rings - the prisoner said he had given the rings and things to him for taking a liberty with him - he was charged with taking sovereigns; he said he had not got any sovereigns, and knew nothing about them - I found the pin in his shirt; I took it out myself; he was endeavouring to take it out, I assisted him; - I either took it from his hand or his shirt, and gave it to the prosecutor; and he took the ring out of his waistcoat-pocket himself, it had a red stone in it - I saw a sovereign found just at the head of the bed, going out at the bed-room door; it dropped from the head of the bed - and one on the bed clothes, just by the bolster and pillow - the sovereigns were found in a situation a person could have placed them in going out of the room - the head of the bed is on the right-hand side of the door, and close to the door; anybody passing might take and put them there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found them struggling together? A. Yes; from my observation I supposed the prisoner was endeavouring to get away - I don't know whether there is a door leading to the staircase or not, from the front room; I think there is; and if so, and that door was not locked, he could get out without going by the bed- one sovereign dropped from the bed clothes or pillow, one dropped on the floor, and the other was looked for and found just under the bolster; they might have been put there in a hurry, and one not so far as the other - the red stone ring was found in the prisoner's pocket, the pin in his breast, and one ring on the staircase window - the prosecutor might as well have placed it there as the prisoner, if he had it in his hand - the prisoner described the offence that he charged the prosecutor with in very plain terms - I went for an officer - I knew nothing of the prosecutor before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you get into the room? A. Through the bed-room door - the prisoner and prosecutor went through the same door - I should not think the prisoner had time to place the sovereigns there at that time; the bed was near enough for him to do it; his left hand must almost have touched it - when I first saw him he was about half way down the stairs close to the window - I should not think he could have put the rings there while the scuffle occurred - the staircase was not very wide; his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170022"></xptr>back was to the balustrade, and the prosecutor had got his hands round him and the staircase post.</p>

            . My attention was drawn to Mrs. Pickering's - I found my uncle there - the prosecutor accused the prisoner of robbing him; the prisoner immediately replied, that he had the things given him for taking improper liberties with him - I found the ring on the window of the stairs, and I found the two sovereigns; the ring was placed close against the edge of the sill of the window - another person was standing by at the time I found the sovereigns; they appeared to have been put there very hastily; one fell down, and the other would have fallen I have no doubt - I went into the room through the bed-room, the door of which was open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went in with the last witness I suppose? A.

            . The prosecutor, Mr. Haw, lodged at our house from July, and lodges there now; he goes backwards and forwards to Hampstead two or three times a week, but keeps on his lodging - I recollect the time of this affair - the prosecutor and the prisoner passed the parlour window; Mr. Haw went up stairs with him, and came down and said, "I will thank you to make tea for two;" I sent out for a small loaf, and the tea was ready in about a quarter of an hour - my daughter took it up; a young man afterwards called to see Mr. Haw; I went up to tell Mr. Haw a gentleman wanted him in the parlour; he said, "Let the gentleman come up;" I said, there was a light in the parlour - and my daughter had shewn him in there; the prisoner was then on the sofa, and he rose from the sofa and went towards the window, which was half open at that time - the prisoner was laying on the sofa with his hand over his head at the time I went up, and the window on the side of the sofa was open, it was opposite the door; Mr. Haw, said, "Let the gentleman come up;" I said, "There is a light in the parlour;" I waited there to let Mr. Haw pass, and I went into the kitchen and said to my daughter,"Take up a light to Mr. Haw's friend;" she said, "Oh no, not till Mr. Haw goes up;" and I said no more about it; after Mr. Haw's friend went out, my daughter followed him up stairs with the candle, and brought the tea things away; and Mr. Haw came down and said, "Miss Pickering, come and shut in the windows;" she turned back and shut them down, and came down; and immediately I sat down in my chair, I heard a tremendous hallooing - "Mrs. Pickering - a thief - a bad character;" I went out, and Mr. Haw had the prisoner holding him on the stairs; I ran out at the door, and called, "a thief, a thief;" and the witnesses came; I followed my daughter who was quite motionless - I took her into the next house - I then considered as eight or ten run into my house, that my property was all exposed; I went up to my own bed room and found it all safe - I came down, the prisoner stood at the top of the stairs; I was much alarmed; he said, "I will not hurt you;" they got him into the parlour, and requested me to leave the room while they searched him; I said,"Mr. Haw, what could induce you to bring a thief into the house;" the prisoner said, "I am not a thief, I am as respectable as you, and my friends are as respectable as your's;" the prisoner said, "You don't mean to give me in charge;" I then went out of the room, and I saw him on the top of the stairs again, when I came into the house with my daughter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor state at that time what he had lost? A. I don't know, for I was too much flurried; I lost nothing - nothing was done to my apartments; I had not observed the ring on Mr. Haw's finger that morning, that I remember, but the morning before - he had been very poorly for a fortnight, and staid at home a good deal.</p>

            . I am an officer; I live in Watling-street; I went to the assistance of the parties at a quarter before eight o'clock; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him of two sovereigns - I was searching him for them, and the prosecutor brought forward the seal and two keys, and shortly after he gave me a ring and key; and after that, a third person brought me a second ring - the prisoner said, "If you will come in, I will tell you all about it; I have not robbed the man at all - he is a scoundrel for accusing me of any such thing - he gave them to me for an indecent liberty which he took with me; when I said I would raise the neighbourhood and give him into custody - he said, 'Don't do so for God's sake, take these things and say nothing about it;'" one sovereign was tucked into the bolster; a person going out could not place them there unless the door was shut, because the door opens against the bedstead - folding doors open from the bed room to the sitting room - I found the handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket - the prisoner said, "He touched me on the thigh and said, what an old handkerchief you have got, I can give you a better than that;" and gave it to him; he said his parents were as respectable as his - a person, before they opened the bed room door to go out, would certainly be able to place the sovereigns there - the sofa is in the front room; if a person passed from the sofa through the bed room, and out at the bed room door, they could put them there before the door was open, but not in any other way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a door to the sitting room? A. Certainly there is, facing the stair-case; I went in at the bed room door and passed through the folding doors - I found no other door open; no door was locked; while I searched the prisoner, they were searching for the sovereigns; the prosecutor was among the persons; one dropped from the bolster, and the other was taken from the blankets under the bolster.</p>

Certainly he might; or the prisoner in trying to escape, might do it - I should think a minute and a half elapsed while I was searching the prisoner, before the sovereigns were found; and in the meantime the prosecutor was in the bed-room - the prisoner made this charge against the prosecutor - the prosecutor said,"It is no such thing - I did no such thing - I did not give them you - you robbed me of them."</p>

            . The bed-room door opens into the passage out on the stairs, not into the bed-room - the folding doors are always open; I don't think they were ever shut while Haw lived there - it was usual to go through the bed-room door to the bed-room; but sometimes the door has been left open, and the doors meet each other - I cannot say which door the prisoner came out of - they were struggling at the bend of the staircase; Mr. Haw was calling out, "Shut the door, he will make his escape; I am overpowered."</p>

               <p>Q. He is a witness against you; is he not? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened to you, I do not impute it to you as a crime, we are all unfortunate at times, but has it happened to you to be a bankrupt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And your property assigned over to assigness? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any dividend been made? - A. Yes, two.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your certificate yet? - A. It is not quite ready, yet it is very near; but there was a sale of my goods, at which they permitted me to re-purchase these, and other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner sometimes worked for you, and sometimes for Longland? - A. He worked for Longland previous to his working for me, when my work became slack; he rented a forge in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not done some small jobs for you on his own account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always considered him, till this, as a very honest man? - A. I had a very high opinion of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you lent him tools, in the course of your business? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know these things were taken in execution by the sheriff? - A. No; he sold them after the sale.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not lent this man the very tools in question? - A. I have, but they were brought back and used; I have taken great pleasure in assisting the man, and am sorry to be under the necessity of appearing against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give him a general permission, if he wanted any tool, and you were not in the way, that he might take it? - A. No.</p>

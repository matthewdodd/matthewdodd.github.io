On the morning of 6th January, about 1.40, I was in the Park Road, Kent Road—I heard shouts of "Police!" and "Murder!" and saw three men running towards me from the Old Kent Road—when they saw me, they turned and ran back again—I followed—they dodged me backwards and forwards, and one of them said "Down here," and they ran down Alfred Street—I pursued the prisoner, and stopped him—he said "Did not you hear cries of 'Police!' and 'Murder!' "—I said "I did," and he said he was running after them—I said it was a strange thing that he should be running in the opposite direction—I took him to the "Chard Arms," at the corner of Park Road—I rang the bell, and the landlord came, and said his house had been entered—the prisoner said nothing, and I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the "Chard Arms "—on the morning of 6th January I went to bed about 1.30—I had undressed myself, and was stand<lb></lb>ing before the fire, in my night-shirt—I heard a window-pane broken—I went to my sitting-room door, and heard a voice, "Hush, hold your noise,"—upon that I took up a revolver, and went to the sitting-room door—I opened it suddenly, and there were two men about six feet from the door, and a third man was half in the window, with one leg on the sill—I fired at the two men that were in the room—the cap went off, but the bullet did not—it had been loaded for two years—they jumped out of the windows on to the leads—I followed them oh the leads, and they dropped down into the garden adjoining—I called out "Police!" and "Murder!"—I looked out of the window and saw three men running round in front of the house, and they turned down the Park Road—about three minutes afterwards I went down stairs and opened the door to the constable, who had the prisoner in custody—to the best of my belief he is the man who was in at the window—he had a pea-jacket on and a billy-cock hat—the window had been fastened the night before—a table which was standing by the window had been removed—I did not miss anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It all occurred in about a minute—the man who was at the window was only partly in, and the was farthest away—there was no light in the room, or I should have been able to identify him—the other two men were about six feet from my sitting-room door, inside the house, in my private sitting-room—I looked at the men in the room, and I meant shooting them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live at Deptford. I had a child named Margaret; she was between ten and eleven years old—she died, and on 10th Sept. was buried in the churchyard of St. Paul, Deptford—it was about half-past 10 or a quarter to 11 o'clock that I left the churchyard—the two defendants were there, acting as gravediggers—the funeral service was performed by the Rector, the coffin was lowered into the grave, some</p>

               <p>earth was thrown on it by the gravedigger, the Clergyman left, and I then left with my friends—the grave was about nine or ten feet deep—when I got home three females called on me; Susan Waller was one—she commu<lb></lb>nicated something to me, in consequence of which I went back to the grave, but did not see the coffin there—I saw Rutherford, and asked him where my child was; he said, "It is there," pointing to another place some few yards off—I asked him what authority he had for that; he said, "Who the h—is going to dig a nine foot grave for a shilling?"—I went to the grave he pointed out; it was open—it was not sufficiently long, and was under<lb></lb>mined at the two ends—I saw the coffin; both the ends of it went under<lb></lb>neath the surface—the length of the coffin was five feet one inch—I measured the grave, but I forget the length of it—it had to be dug some sixteen inches longer before they could get the coffin out again—the coffin was injured, two ornaments above the nameplate, and one below—the coffin was taken out of that place by order of a Magistrate, And put into its original place.</p>

                  </hi> I am single, and live in Griffin-street, Deptford. On the morning of 12th Sept. I was in the churchyard of St. Paul, Deptford, and saw the funeral come in—I stayed till the mourners went away—they had hardly got out of the churchyard gate, before the two prisoners pulled the corpse up by the ropes which they had let it down by—they carried it to another grave, and placed it down head first—I then went and told the child's father—I got back very nigh as soon as he did, and heard the con<lb></lb>versation between them—M'Kann was very civil, but Rutherford was very impudent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Towerson, of Copperas-lane, Church-street, Deptford. I was in the churchyard on this day, and saw the funeral of the prosecutor's child—when the mourners had left the ground I saw the two gravediggers fetch the corpse from the grave, put it on the ropes, and carry it to the next grave—I then saw them put it down head first and heels upwards—they were not many minutes putting it into the second grave; two or three minutes—they could not get it in, the grave did not appear large enough at the top, so they had to lower it down head first—I believe they used ropes to lower it into the second grave.</p>

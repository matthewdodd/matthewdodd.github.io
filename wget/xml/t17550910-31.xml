I returned in the morning, and looked at the lock of the till; I told the halfpence, and missed nine-pence. I suspected our other people, I searched them , and found none upon them. I asked the prisoner what she had in her pocket; she produced her money, and I found amongst it five halfpence marked. She said she knew nothing of it; but when we came before the justice, at Guildhall, she told me if I would forgive her, she would go and live with me for nothing as long as I liv'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess she had taken the money?</p>
               <p>Patershall. She did not directly confess; I had a very good character with her; but when I came to inquire for the people, I found she had never liv'd there at all.</p>

             . I am wife to the prosecutor; five halfpence marked were found upon the prisoner, and two in her box afterwards; and I had left her a shilling, when I went out, to lay out for me, instead of which she had laid out half-pence ; and upon inquiry, we found there were nine marked amongst that shilling's worth.</p>

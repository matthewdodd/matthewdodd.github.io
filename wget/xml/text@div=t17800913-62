On the 9th of this month, about ten minutes before twelve at night; I went from the Clifford's-Inn coffee-house, where I spent my evening, with an intent to go, to Newgate market, where I generally lie when I come to town. As I was going down Fleet-street, at the end of Fetter-lane I met the two prisoners; they were strangers to me. Whether they asked me to treat them with a glass of wine, or I asked them, I cannot charge my memory; it was soon agreed between us to drink something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130069"></xptr> together; they said if I would step back just as far as Temple-bar, they knew of a very good house. I very imprudently went back with them to that house, it is up a passage by Temple-bar; the people were gone to bed. They said they knew of another very good house, the One Bell in the Strand. We went there; there were a great many people at the door, so I would not go in; they brought me at last to the <placeName id="t17800913-62-crimeloc370">London Hotel, in Bridges-street, Covent-Garden</placeName>

It was about three in the morning, and as the morning was short we all three lay together, which was imprudent in me.</p>
               <p>And unreasonable I think? - It was. I waked about seven o'clock, as near as I can guess, and then the prisoners were gone, and my purse and all my money was gone. When I took the purse out to pay the waiter I had six guineas left in it.</p>
               <p>How long before you went to bed did you take out the purse? - I do not think it was above a quarter of an hour at most. I heard some people talking below, and I went down; there were the two prisoners. Nairn said good morning to you, you was bravely drunk last night. I said it may be so, pray what have you done with the money you took out of my pocket? Money, says she, with some opprobrious oaths, I know nothing of your money; you do remember, I suppose giving this

I am the wife of Alfred John Wrangham, the land-lord of the Gregorian Arms, St. James's-place, Bermondsey—on Monday, 17th June last, the prisoners came to our house together, about 12 o'clock in the day—Williams asked for a quartern of gin and peppermint and gave me a bad shilling—I told her it was bad, and gave it her back again—she said she must have taken it in change of a half-sovereign on Sunday evening—the other prisoner then paid me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—they then went away together—I am quite sure it was a bad shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Admiral Hawk, Bermondsey—on Monday afternoon, about 2 o'clock, the prisoners came to my house together—my house is about a quarter of a mile from the Gregorian Arms—I served them with a quartern of gin and peppermint—Williams gave me a florin—</p>

               <p>I put it in the till, and gave her the change—Holmes ha a child in her arms—there were no other florins in the till—after I gave Williams change, Holmes went out carrying her child—Williams remained at the bar—Holmes was away about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—when she came in, and I believe Williams again asked for another quartern of gin and peppermint—I served them, and Williams gave me a florin in payment—I examined it and found it was bad—I showed it to my barman—I then went to the till to examine the first one, and found that bad also—that was the only florin in the till—I said I thought it was a cash that a policeman ought to take them in charge—Holmes offered to pay me all the money in her pocket not to say anything about it—I saw the money; I believe it was four or fine sixpences—she said, "I will give you what money I have in my possession, if you will not lock her up, or go further in the proceeding"—Holmes also said that Williams got it in change for a half-sovereign—she did not call her by her name; no name or address was given—I gave them into custody, and gave the florins to the policeman.</p>

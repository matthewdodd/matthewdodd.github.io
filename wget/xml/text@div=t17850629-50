               <p>Did you live upon terms of intimacy with her? - The woman was agreeable.</p>
               <p>How happened you to be in this familiar way, drinking with a woman whom you charged with being a thief? - It was needless for me to think anything of a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I leave the keys with you two days and two nights at different times? - She did once or twice at the beginning of the time.</p>

               <p>I took the lodging of him by the week at two shillings a week, I told him we could get no work, and my husband went to the parish, I got up on the Monday morning, and I unlocked the door, I told the prosecutor he should not lose the money; Mr. Smith got out of bed and slipt his coat on, says I, I have not four shillings if it will save our lives, we went to the work-house, and were there eleven weeks; I never robbed anybody of a penny, I went all about Whitechapel, and then he met me, I am as innocent as any gentleman in Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you open the door yourself? - I broke it open myself I tell you, the Thursday after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her for any money to make it up? - The day before she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290059"></xptr> brought to the magistrate again to be fully committed, I would have made it up that night for the exact money the sheets cost me.</p>

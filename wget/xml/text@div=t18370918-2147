                  </hi>. I am married, and live in Southampton-street. Mr. Lacy lives in Tottenham-court-road—about ten o'clock on the evening of the 2nd of September, I was near Mr. Lacy's shop, and saw two persons go from the window—the prisoner was one—he went away with something under the skirt of his coat—I went and told Mr. Lacy he had lost some thing—he went after them—I did not see him brought back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella manufacturer, and live in Tottenham court-road. Mrs. Hilman gave me some information—I ran across the road, and on turning down Cheyne-street the prisoner dropped the parasol—my son took it up and gave it me—I still followed the prisoner, and never lost sight of him till he was taken—this is the parasol.</p>

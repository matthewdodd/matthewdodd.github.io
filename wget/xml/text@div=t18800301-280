                  </hi>. I live at 8, Leterstone, Walham Green—I am the wife of Frederick Adolphus Patten, who is in Persia in the Indian Civil Service—in the middle of September last my husband introduced me to McMurdo in this country, who stayed at our house at Dulwich from Saturday to Monday—my husband left England on 2nd October—McMurdo shortly afterwards called on me at Dulwich and brought me a little dog—he had a friend waiting outside—I said "Why don't you ask your friend in?"—he said that, he was a betting man, and he should not like to intro—me to him, and that he was in a hurry; he was going to a pigeon match—he came again before the 8th December—he had often mentioned that may house was damp—towards the end of November he said "I think the house is very damp; if you wish to sell your glasses I could get a good price for them," that a good many swells came to his office, and he would put some lace curtains over them and show them to anybody who came—he asked me to go and see his office at Aquarium Chambers, 2 and 3, Tothill Street, Westminster—I went there and he introduced me to Barnett as "Mr. Wilmot, my partner"—he said "We do not keep any clerks"—the name up at the chambers was "Herbert and Co., financiers"—McMurdo pointed to the wall and said "Your glasses would look very nice there, I would put lace curtains over them," showing me with his hand how he would raise them up to show the swells who came in—he then sent coat or an older for me for the Aquarium, and asked me if I should like to go; it was about 1 o'clock and he took me over—Wilmot took care of the chambers—I went back to the chambers at 4 o'clock and we had to there, and they saw me to Victoria Station and left me there; they did not wait to see me off—McMurdo wrote to me afterwards—I have burnt the letters—he often wrote to say he would come, but did not—he referred in his letter to my glasses—he came to my house the last Sunday in November and asked me if I had made up my mind to move—he dined there and we talked about various things and about the goods—I had not then made up my mind—the suggestion came entirely from him—he called again on Sunday, 7th December, with Barnett—they were left a long time in the drawing-room and amused themselves with my picture books about an hour; I left them there—I called them when dinner was ready—I told them I had quite made up my mind—McMurdo said Barnett was brought down to arrange about the moving and to look at the valuable things that were to "be packed, and that Mr. Moore was to come down on the Monday to pack them, and I was to dress myself—I said "I do not like this moving"—You are going to give my things</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010077"></xptr>
               <p>McMurdo said "Mrs. Patten, you shall have no trouble whatever you place yourself entirely in our hands, Mr. Barnett will wrap the glasses in wadding and take care of everything; I have known him 12 years, he is one of the best fellows living; he will come at 6 o'clock in the morning if you like"—I agreed to move if they would take care of my things and dispose of the glasses, because I believed McMurdo thoroughly—I had then been after a house at Walham Green, or I was going the next day—that house was let, I was disappointed about it—they went away about 8 o'clock—I received this letter on 9th December: "8th December, 1879. 2 and 3, Aquarium Chambers, Tothill Street. Dear Madam,—Bob is away on urgent business; the van proprietor will be with you at. 11 o'clock, Tuesday. I shall meet him at roar house. I was unable to come, having to keep office. Yours faithfully, S., Wilmot." They had not come on the Monday—at that time I only knew Barnett as Wilmott—on the Tuesday he brought a cart and two men—they commenced packing the clocks and chandeliers and other things in the drawing-room immediately—the looking-glasses were not packed—I went upstairs—I heard Moore call to Barnett, "I wish you would come down, I know I am packing the wrong things"—I said "Oh dear me, you have packed my drawing-room clocks; they are ormolu mounted, I am not going to sell those"—I went down and saw they had packed a lot of those things, and I told them they ought not to have done so—I said "They are not to go to your chambers"—Wilmot said "You had better let them go lor security, I or Moore will bring them down in a cab in a day or two to your house, whenever you wish for them"—Barnett persuaded me and I said "I will sell the dinner and tea service, and coffee service If you will get me a good price"—Wilmot said he would rtake care of them and not dispose of them without my consent and sanction and without consulting me as to the price—I let all my valuables go as "Wilmot proposed—he said "Let all your valuables come to our office, you can have them whenever you like, and I consented to their being taken away—this is a correct list of the things that were taken: "Two large looking glasses, one red and white Bohemian glass wine service, one china dinner service, one china tea and coffee service, two green and white cut bottles, one lamp, two clocks, ormolu mounted; two Dresden figures, stands and shades complete; two blue and gold large vases with shades complete; revolver in case, one silver-plated cornet complete; 16 silver-plated dishes, with silver handles and rims; one velvet pile table-cover, valued at 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." I think my husband could have sold them for more than 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that paper is signed by me and is dated 9th December—Wilmot wrote it after the things were in the van on my paper—he said "I am going to write on some of your pretty paper"—I said "I do not think it is necessary to write a letter, as you are going to take the things to Mr. McMurdo"—he said it was in case Mr. Patten came home—he gave me a copy; I have lost it—I think that remark referred to another letter I wrote on this occasion at his dictation—he said "I want it and I should like to have it," and then I signed it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, Cambridge Villas, Fryan Road, East Dulwich, December 9, 1879. To Messrs. Herbert and Co. I this day send you two looking-glasses, six ornaments, eight plated dishes and covers, one cornet, one table cover, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010078"></xptr>
               <p>to Mr. McMurdo, there is no occasion for a letter from me"—I afterwards wrote this letter at Wilmot's dictation: "Dearest Bob,—I have asked your partner to take over all the plate and china and looking-glasses to dispose of them on the best terms he can for me. I send you the three volumes you wished for.—With love, I remain, ever yours affectionately, Susie Patten." The words "except dessert service "are struck out—I did not write those words; that is Witmot's writing—he took that letter away with him, leaving the things in the cart—Wilmot came the next day, the 10th, with Moore and the van to move my things—they cleared the house and took the furnitnre to our new house, 8, Leterstone Road, Walham Green—I went there on Friday, the 12th—the things remained in the van two days—on the Saturday I went. to Aquarium Chambers—I met Barnett on the top of the stairs with a man with a packing case—I said "What are you doing, what is that?"—he said "They are your silver dishes, I am going to show them to an earl"—I had noticed a Hansom cab waiting at the door—I said "You ought to have asked my permission first"—I felt very angry—Barnett said "They will come back again, I shall bring them back soon"—the case was carried down, I did not follow it—I remained talking to the people who keep the chambers, I was so upset—I asked Barnett, "Where is McMurdo? why are you taking my things away?"—he said "His wife is very ill, she is in a fit"—I waited at the chambers from 12 till between 3 and 4 o'clock—Barnett came back, but he did not bring my dishes—I do not know whether it was on that occasion, but he said the things had gone to the Earl of Dudley's gallery, which his father kept, and he had left them there to show the earl—I think he said it was in Bond Street—he said he was going to fetch a Queen's physician to McMurdo's wife, who charged 40 guineas a visit—on Monday, 15th December, I want again to Aquarium Chambers—I afterwards received this letter; "Dec 15, 79. Dear Mrs. Patten,—Your glasses were seen by the best judge in London; he says they are very good but modern; he says we are asking too much, and would not make an offer to<lb></lb>day, but will do so in the course of a day or two. When he does I will submit his offer to you immediately. Yours in haste, R. A. McMurdo."—I also received this letter on 16th (<hi rend="italic">Stating no offer had been made, and promising to call and consult her when it was, and to write next day</hi>)—I went to Aquarium Chambers once only, early in December—I received this letter, dated 27th December, from McMurdo (<hi rend="italic">Headed Eton and Harrow Club, and stating that he had settled something substantial about the glasses, and would call to<lb></lb>morrow and would telegraph the time</hi>)—I called at the chambers on the 28th—on the 29th I received this letter from McMurdo (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he could not come to terms about the glasses, and ashing the witness to telegraph if she would include the dinner service</hi>)—when I received that letter I was so angry I went at once to the office—I saw McMurdo after I had waited for him—I said "I know you have only written to put me off, and to keep me from coming to the office; there is something very extraordinary about your keeping writing to me like this"—he was very angry and so was I—he said "So-and-so has not come, it is very strange they have not come about the glasses," and he wrote a letter and sent it off by a man—he did not tell me to whom he wrote it—I thought it was about my glasses—I asked him why Barnett had not brought back my silver dishes and table-cover—he said Barnett had written the necessary letters to get them back, but it would take some time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010079"></xptr>
               <p>and that they were at the Earl of Dudley's gallery—a man came in called Emmanuel—I went outside and talked with the people who kept the chambers, but I did not go right away—I afterwards looked in at the door and said "Are you engaged?"—he came out and said "What do you want, do you want to speak to me?"—I said "No, I do not want to see you, I want you to bring me back my silver dishes, my table-cover, and my clock, which you said were at the Earl of Dudley's gallery"—he went back into the room without saying anything—I walked backwards and forwards—I went into the room again—McMurdo said Emmanuel had a lot of jewellery about him, and he wished he had shown it to me—I went away—I next received this letter from McMurdo: "2nd Jan., 1880. Dear Mrs. Patten,—Just a line to say no bargain yet; same old yarn you will say, but it is not my fault If I cannot do justice by your glasses I shall wait till I do; in the meantime I can but try. I have, thank goodness, a good business in the office, and shall lend you anything you want pending the sale." I omitted to say I was there on 24th December, when he showed me a gentleman who went out of the room—he said "I have sold your glasses to this gentleman, I could have sold them for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I will try to get 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am holding oat for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and he said "you will get no money till after Christmas, as the gentleman will not alter his banking account"—at that time most of my packing—cases were in the room—he then said "Good-bye, Mrs. Patten, I am going out of town"—I wrote this letter of 5th January at my house, and gave it to Mr. McMurdo—I had written him that day, and he said "I shall put that in the envelope I received from you to<lb></lb>day, as if it came from you: ""Dear Mr. McMurdo, you are at liberty to use my things till you have arranged your business at Hoare's the bankers, when of course you will return them to me; in the mean time I hope you are negotiating for the sale of my glasses." McMurdo dictated that to me—once when he came to my house he said "I offered your dinner service to a man the other day for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he did not beat me down a penny; until then I did not know how good it was"—this letter of 5th January, 1880, is written by McMurdo (Enclosing a letter from Barnett taking McMurdo to arrange at Hoare's the bankers on Wednesday, and stating that he expected a Mr. Abrams to see him about the glasses, but that he had to go to a funeral)—I wrote this letter: "Dear Mr. Mac—I hope you will not let Sam put his fingers on any moneys realised by the sale of my glasses. If he does not soon produce my clock and dishes I shall go to Mr. Patten's lawyer and take immediate proceedings against him before a week is over his head. I will not endure this suspense much longer. I feel very bad from that horrid stuff I drank last night; the last drop was too much for me. I trust only to you. I hope you will not let the tea service go, etc I trust God my conscience is clear, having done nothing wrong since Fred was away. I do not think 8am should have taken anything from your rooms. I hope he will try to do better and not swear so." That was written I think about the third week in September—I do not know anything about the pencil writing—I never received a letter of which that pencil writing appears to be a copy—I commenced proceedings about 17th or 19th January—I have not received one farthing from either of the prisoners for my goods—I lent McMurdo 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get a will from Somerset House on 1st Or 2nd September when I drew my money, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the latter end of November—I paid Barnett's cab for him once, and afterwards lent him a sovereign—he said</p>

               <p>"I have left my purse at home"—those were loans which they promised fa pay, but never did—I have been shown by Mr. Chapman of Attenborough's a cornet in a case, and a revolver; by Mr. George Milton, Mr. Vaughan'a assistant, a table cover, which I was told was at the Earl of Dudley's Gallery, nine entree dishes, some silver dishes, a clock, some pieces of glass in a broken box, the eight decanters, and eight dish covers I have not seen yet—I was also shown by the assistant to Mr. Smith of 45, King's Road, Chelsea, two candelabra; and two chimney glasses were shown me by Mr. Charles King, assistant to Messrs. Hoare's, of 14, Cranbourae Street—all those articles are mine—I never authorised any one to pawn them or authorised McMurdo to make temporary use of any of them, with the exception of those mentioned in the letters—all he asked me for was the dinner service and the two candelabra that are in Sloane Street—I was not informed of the various pawnings, and McMurdo was very indignant when I said I thought they were raising money on my things—he denied that he had allowed Barnett to do so, and on one occasion he swore it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. I was in ill—health when I lived at Dulwich—I had not the slightest idea of leaving the house till they proposed it—I left it a fortnight or so before the rent became due—I did not leave it for the purpose of avoiding the payment of rent—the prisoners told me to place myself in their hands, and if anybody came for the rent I was to refer him to them—I knew my landlord could seize the furniture for the rent—it was his security—my husband went to Persia in October—I did not create a disturbance at Aquarium Chambers on 8th January—I was very angry—McMurdo wanted me to place my dinner service and Dresden figure! at Hoare's, the bankers—he said he had a writ over his head, and I said I would not let my glasses go—this was on the 5th, and he promised me faithfully they should not go—when I went two days afterwards I found they had gone, and I said "They have robbed me most cruelly and deceived me," and that was all the noise I made—I said that in the evening on the landing at Aquarium Chambers—when the landlord said to me "Everything is gone, your glasses have gone/' I was so astounded I said it was a most cruel swindle—McMurdo wrote me a letter after my visit on the 8th threatening that he would write fully to my husband and explain his position in the matter without reserve, or something like that—I only gave McMurdo authority to sell my property for me subject to my approval, but not to pawn it—I never authorised him to deal with it for his own purposes because he was in a difficulty, except the dinner service and the two Dresden figures, about which he asked my permission on the 6th, while they were already pawned on the 3rd—he always told me he was doing a good business—I did not know anything about a tutor named Hoare—he said he wished to place my property at Hoare's, the bankers, and I gave him permission to place these two articles alone—I wrote this letter on 5th January: "Dear Mr. McMurdo,—You are at liberty to use my things until you get that business finished, when, of course, you will return mine to me. In the meantime, I hope you are negotiating for the sale of my glasses.' McMurdo dictated the whole of that letter—I wrote it unwillingly because he pressed me and said he should have to go to prison or to Paris that night, and I said "I do not like you to leave my things in the hands of Mr. Barnett"—I do not remember whether I said at the police-court that the letter was written at McMurdo's dictation—I have not a good</p>

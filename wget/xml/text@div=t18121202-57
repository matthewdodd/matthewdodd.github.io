I lost my handkerchief on Monday, the 16th of November. I was going home. There were two calves being put into a cart in Smithfield, which occasioned me to stop. A porter of the name of Brooks, asked me if I knew of a situation. I said, I did not at present, if you look into my house at any time, if I do, I will tell you. At that time I felt something at my pocket. I put my hand into my pocket. My handkerchief was gone. I instantly turned round, and seized the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand. The prisoner said he had found the handkerchief.</p>

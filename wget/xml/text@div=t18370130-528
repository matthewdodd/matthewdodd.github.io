                  </hi>. I lodge at the Green Man, Beaufort-row, Chelsea, and am a printer. I carry on business at Mr. Williams's, Beaufort-place—I employed the prisoner to assist me in printing handkerchiefs for about three months—she was not a domestic servant—she had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, which she used to take home to her mother—on the 21st of January Mr. Williams paid me a £10 Bank of England note and five half-sovereigns—I took and doubled up the five half-sovereigns in the note, and placed them in my hat, in the window, at the head of the table where I work, at Mr. Williama's—I was paid by piecework—I put my handkerchief over the money—the prisoner was present at that time—I had to go up stairs, and was absent six minutes at the furthest—on my return I inquired for Elizabeth Wagner—she was not there, but I found my hat moved from the window and placed under the window, and all the money gone—I had left three men there at work, besides five or six girls—none of them are here—I went after the prisoner to her mother's—I met her in Tothill-street, between two and three hours after, with a bundle—the constable who was with me took her into the first public-house, and asked if she had any money—she said she had nothing—she was searched in my presence, and a £10 note and a sixpence were found on her—when the note was found I did not ask her whether she had any more money—I believe this is my mark to this deposition—she had a pair of new shoes on, a pair of clogs, and a pair of stockings—I had noticed the number of the note—it was No. 1345—I am sure of it—I made no promise or threat to induce her to tell me any thing—she told me she had only got the £10 note and the sixpence; that the other money she had lost—she said she took the money out of the hat—she had worked there before I went there, and I took her as being handy.</p>

                  </hi>.—I live in Beaufort-place, Chelsea, and am a silk-printer. On the 21st of January I paid the prosecutor a £10 note, and five half-sovereigns—I do not know the number of the note, but I know it by the name of a relative of mine written on it—this is the note—the prisoner has been in my employ eighteen months—with one little exception, I never knew any thing wrong—she has been very badly off not having full employment—the trade is precarious, and unless they get something else to do, they are without the means of living.</p>

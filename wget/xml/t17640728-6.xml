            . The house where the prosecutor lodges belongs to me: I let it out in tenements. I was lying ill on my bed, and was informed the prisoner was stopped with some things coming out of that house, and I went and found him at the door. He was searched, and the things mentioned in the indictment were found upon him. I delivered them to the constable, and the constable delivered them to the prosecutor at Hick's-Hall.</p>

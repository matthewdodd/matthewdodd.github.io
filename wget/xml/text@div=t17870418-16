               <p>On the 8th of March, the prosecutrix came to me; I went with the prosecutrix, and in searching about under the table of the prisoner Barrington, there were two old bed gowns, quite rags; I took her into custody, and in the other room, I found the prisoner Clarke, but there was nothing in that room.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These are mine; I found this pocket under Clarke's bed, which is mine; and she said it was hers, and belonged to her child.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Barrington. I lodge by myself; my daughter does not lodge with me; I have no fastenings to the door; it is six-pence a week; and under the straw and hay which I had to lay on, these things were found; I was out in company with this woman, and had part of two pints of beer, and when we came back, she said, she had been robbed, and suspected us.</p>

               <p>I am very innocent of the affair; my child used to run in and out of that good woman's room, and she used to give him oysters; we all lodged in the house, by that means the pocket might come; I have known the prosecutrix a great while, and she has known me, and she offered to make it up for ten shillings; I have not ten farthings; she came down to a crown, and offered for that since I have been in Tothillfields.</p>

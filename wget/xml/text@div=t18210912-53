On the 15th of August, the prisoner came to the shop and asked for four yards of Kerseymere. I asked who it was for; he said Mr. Newman. I told him I thought he must be mistaken. He said, No, he made no mistake. I said, Mr. Newman, where? He said, "Mr. Newman, Air-street." I said, "Air-street, Piccadilly?" - he said, "Yes." I told him we had no account with any such person; he replied, "I am going to pay for it." I shewed him the kerseymere; he asked the price; I said 12 s. a yard; he said he was to have one about 10 s., I said we had none at that price, but shewed him one at 11 s.; he said, I will take two yards of each. I then asked if he was correct, as the length of two yards was fit for nothing - he then said, "Cut me four of that at 12 s." I said, "Am I to cut off four yards?" he said, Yes, cut it off; he tendered a 5 l. note, which I suspected to be bad. - I asked if he would like to have a bill; he said "Yes." I went to the desk to make the bill, and looked at the note, but did not endorse it. I called

While he was gone, I asked the prisoner in what part of Air-street Mr. Newman lived; he said, a little up on the left hand side. He said Mr. Newman was a tailor. I asked if they were busy, he said Yes.

               <p>Q. How did he hesitate - A. When I asked him if I should send for Mr. Newman, and said what number, where does he live - the prisoner gave no answer. I asked him why he should hesitate, as he said he came from Mr. Newman; he then said Newman was waiting for him at the corner of the street.

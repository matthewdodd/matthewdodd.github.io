               <p>Can you be quite sure that these are two of the men that stopped the carriage, and robbed you? - Yes, I am quite sure; I never saw them before, I saw them again the 9th of September: We gave an alarm at every turnpike, and to the gentlemen and carriages we met in the way; we took no steps to apprehend them, but I was sent for to see them at a public-house, near Sir Sampson Wright's, I went over the way to see if there was any body I knew, I went into the tap-room, and I saw nobody there that I knew, the patrols were with me; they came in a hackney coach, and I was called from the public-house, to Sir Sampson Wright's, I did not see them at the public house at all; some of Sir Sampson Wright's men, pointed to the prisoners, and asked me if they were the people, and I said they were two of them; when I saw them, there were three men; I was sure the prisoners were two of the men; I could not swear to the third, and I said so at that time; I observed Charrington's face, and Wright went by the side of me to look at me, to see if I had any arms, that could make any resistance, and then I observed him go to the horses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are a foreigner? - Yes, been in England two years, I am servant to the Marquis D'Haulefort; the Marquis and a lady were in the carriage, I saw the people go to the carriage, but I did not see the things taken.</p>
               <p>The Marquis is not here, nor the lady? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the Marquis at Sir Sampson Wrights? - No, not since he came from the country, not since the people were taken, he went there soon after the robbery, the lady has been there; the lady is not here; the coachman is here.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may have heard, that in this country, there is a reward for taking up these people, and prosecuting them? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090073"></xptr>A reward; I have heard since I swore to them, that there is a reward, if they were found guilty.</p>
               <p>Who told you? - Some of the people at the public house, and I heard it at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>However, it was not till after you had swore to these men? - It was not; I did not swear to the third, because I was not sure.</p>
               <p>There were three put to the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Besides being put to the bar, and shewed to you as the men, I take it for granted they had irons on their legs? - They had.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal frightened? - I never was robbed before; I was frightened when I saw the pistol to my breast certainly.</p>
               <p>You know the lives of these two people are at stake on your evidence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean still to say they are the persons? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wright. Sir Sampson asked him, what he could swear to me by, he said by the colour of the coat, and said I ran up to the horses heads? - I said I swore to him, that he was gone before me, and he looked at me, and then he ran at the horses; I looked to his face, and to his coat, he had a green, or dark coloured coat, and light coloured great coat.</p>
               <p>Did you not at first, when you saw these men at Bow-street, speak doubtful of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wright. My Lord, at the first examination, he said he did not know whether we were the people or not? - I did not.</p>
               <p>In the office Mr. Macmanus said, you have no occasion to make any doubt of it, for they are the men; and if you will stick to it, you will do them? - He never said any thing like it.</p>

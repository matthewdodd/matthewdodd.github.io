On Monday morning, 21st Sept., between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was passing along St. Leonard Street—there is a quickset hedge on one side, and a wall on the other—there is a gap in the hedge over a piece of piping—I saw Driscoll come out first and seat himself in a corner, and close after him in a fierce manner I saw Fearcey come up, and rush up at him as if he was going to claw his eyes out, as if Driscoll had got something belong<lb></lb>ing to him—he had scarcely got up to him, before he called out, "Oh!" three times, and I immediately saw him stagger backwards for about four yards till he came to the side of the path and then he fell on his bottom first, and then on his back—I helped him up, and placed him in a cart, and he was taken to Mr. Garman's—the prisoner followed the deceased boy, and said to him, "You are not hurt"—I did not hear the deceased say anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Bow. On 21st Sept., a few minutes past 10 o'clock, the boy Pearcey was brought to my surgery—he was not then dead—he died in about eight or ten minutes afterwards—the cause of death was a wound in the <hi rend="italic">aort A.</hi> which is a large vessel emerging from the heart—the wound was caused by a sharp pointed cutting instrument with one edge only—a small bladed knife might do it—it was from about an inch and a quarter to an inch and a half in depth—it entered between the second and third ribs—I do not think it would have required any force to pull the knife out again—in my opinion, the boy could not have walked or run six yards after the blow was inflicted—I do not think he could have spoken afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That is assuming that the knife first went into the heart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Assuming that it went into a more important part than the heart, that is the <hi rend="italic">aorta</hi>—I do not think that a vital part might not have been reached at first, and that by the exertion of running or jumping the laceration might have extended, and thus reached a vital part—I will not pledge myself that it could not have been so, but I should think not—the boy had on a linen blouse, and a linen shirt, no waistcoat—the blow must have been inflicted with some violence—the direction of the wound contra<lb></lb>dicts the assumption that it was done by the one boy running against the other—it does not so positively contradict the assumption of his falling upon the knife—the superficial wound was upwards, and the direction was inwards and downwards—if it had occurred in a fall together from a plank, I do not see how it could take that direction—it would be possible if they were pitched almost head foremost, but I think under such circumstances the wound would have been of a different character, there would have been more laceration—it is scarcely possible that it could have occurred from a fall on the knife—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260149"></xptr>
               <p>is barely possible—I think a little boy like the prisoner could have in<lb></lb>flicted such a blow—his arm must have been raised to do it.</p>

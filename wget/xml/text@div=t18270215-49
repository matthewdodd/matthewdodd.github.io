            . I am landlord of the Three Kings, Thomas-street, Bristol, and take in horses to bait. The prisoners, on several occasions, brought horses to my stables - the first time was about two months ago - I have my stable-book here (looking at it) - I find the mare claimed by Mr. Maides, was brought on the 17th of January - Oliver and Johnson came with her; they remained there till the 23d of January - Oliver then left the mare in my care, desiring me to take care of her till he came again, unless a person, whom he had been speaking to, came to purchase her; that I might sell her for 26l., but if I could not get more than 24l., to take it - while she was there Johnson rode her at times; I do not know that Oliver rode her - several people came to look at her; Johnson showed her in the yard, and Oliver attended also; they both left on the 23d of January, and both returned on the 1st of February - Laycock was with them then; Oliver came first, about eleven o'clock in the morning; the other two arrived about half-past five or six, and brought four more horses.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bristol. In consequence of information I took the prisoners into custody, on the 1st of February, about seven o'clock in the evening - Oliver was in the parlour at the Three Kings public-house; the other two were in the stable, feeding the horses, which appeared very much out of condition, as if they had been rode very hard. Mr. Maides claimed a bay mare that was there.</p>
               <p>OLIVER's Defence. I bought the mare on the 13th of January, at the Wheat-sheaf public-house, kept by Mr. Noon, for eighteen guineas - Laycock can prove it; I slept in Noon's house on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON's Defence. Oliver hired me to go to Bristol with him, to take these horses down - I took three and he one.</p>
               <p>There being no evidence against Luycock, the Jury here found him Not Guilty.</p>

            . I keep the Wheatsheaf public-house-, at Rotherhithe. Oliver first came to lodge at my house about six months age; Laycock joined him three days before Christmas, and continued to lodge with him; they spent the Christmas week at my house; Oliver had stables at the top of the street, but lodged and boarded at my house, and the boy, Laycock, with him. I remember a man offering him a mare for sale - to the best of knowledge it was about the 13th of Jan. on a Saturday; I saw the mare in the street for half an hour before it was bought; it was a bay mare, about fifteen hands high; there was nothing remarkable about it, only I have one about the same sort, and they said it would match mine very well - it had a nagtail; it was rode up and down before my house for half an hour, and then they came to a bargain; he put her into his own stable, and went away the next day, leaving Laycock behind; I did not know that Oliver was going - Laycock continued to lodge with me, and left last Friday three weeks; I am sure that was the time he left - I did not see him go away. Oliver passed all his evenings at my house while he was in town; I never knew him miss one night; he went very regularly to his bed, about ten or eleven o'clock. I do not recollect his being absent one night or morning while he was with me.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you go to Oliver's stable at the top of the street? A. I went twice - he had no horses there then. Laycock came three days before Christmas; that would be twenty days before the mare was bought - the stable is better than one hundred yards from my house. Nineteen sovereigns were given for the mare, and 2s. returned; Oliver went away next day - I did not see him go, and cannot say whether he rode the mare away; it was not left in the stable. I never saw any other horses there - Laycock was there when the mare was bought, and rode her about, to show it, while Oliver stood and looked at her - it was between eleven and twelve o'clock, before twelve, I think; it was before dinner - I never saw the man before who sold it; I have seen him once since - he called at my house last Thursday three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of Oliver being taken? A. Mrs. Hall came down and informed me of it - I think it was the week before last. The person who sold the horse came last Thursday three weeks, to inquire for Oliver - he did not leave any address.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, last Thursday three weeks was the day before Laycock went away? A. Yes - the man saw Oliver; he had come back again, and was at my house - he slept at my house last Thursday three weeks, and went away on Friday, with Laycock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on the Thursday did Oliver come? A. Between six and seven o'clock; the man who sold him the mare called to see Oliver on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before it was Thursday three weeks? A. It was Friday three weeks, about eleven o'clock, the day Oliver went away - Oliver had come the night before, about seven o'clock - they might be together for an hour; Oliver and Laycock went away in the afternoon - I understand they both left together, but I did not see them go.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they might have gone earlier - how late did you see them? A. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LAYCOCK (the prisoner). I was Oliver's servant. I went to live with him at Noon's, on the Sunday as Christmas came on the Monday. I was present when Oliver saw a mare at Mr. Noon's; I tried her - Noon was present; it was brought between eleven and twelve o'clock, I think, by a tail fresh-looking man; I knew him by sight, but cannot say whether my master knew him; I came by, and saw my master paying some money for the mare, but do not know how much. I took her into master's stable - she remained there till Sunday afternoon, when Howard took her away, as I was not well, and could not take her; while I was at Noon's with my master he regularly slept at home every night - we did not sleep in the same bed - he always passed his evenings there. I never knew him out after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q, You went on the Sunday before Christmas day, which was Monday, now understand my question before you answer - how soon after you had been at Noon's, with your master, did the man come and sell the mare? A. I cannot say - I suppose it might be a fortnight; my master was in the house when the gentleman brought it - it was shown out before the house; I rode her: the man stood by the side - it was about an hour before master bargained for her. The man went away soon after he was paid. I think she staid in the stable nearly a week - I think it was a week after she was brought; Howard took her away because I was not well, and could not ride; master went away at the same time, leaving me - I do not know what day of the week this was. I staid until my master returned - I do not know what day that was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay after your master returned? A. Several days, before we went into the country; my master staid several days, and we went away together, on a Monday morning, about nine o'clock. I did not see Howard when my master returned at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went away, on your master's second return, did any one call on your master? A. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man who sold the mare afterwards? A. Yes - nearly a week afterwards he came to Mr. Noon's house one morning - my master was there then; he staid with him an hour or so - the man did not come again at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150036"></xptr>any time - the man came on Friday morning, and we went away on the Monday following - I had seen him two or three times before he brought the mare, but have not seen him since the Friday he called on my master at Noon's - I do not know his name - I did not hear him give master any name.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you and your master continue to lodge at Noon's every night till you went away? A. Yes.</p>

Between eleven and twelve o'clock, or about twelve one day, I saw Oliver looking at a mare, which was shown backwards and forwards by my house for half an hour; there was a man on it - Oliver had a boy with him as a servant - whether the boy was there then I do not recollect - this was about the 13th of January - Oliver went into the house with the man, and I saw him paying some money - I never saw the man before nor since.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When were you applied to about this? A. Last Wednesday, I think - it was a bay mare; I have not seen the one which Mr. Maides claims, and cannot say whether it is the same - I should know it if I saw it - it might be another.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS to E. LAYCOCK. A. Is the mare which was brought from Bristol the one which your master bought? A. Yes.</p>

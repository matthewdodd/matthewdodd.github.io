               <p>JOHN-THODY BIRKETT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. 
               <persName id="t18020602-62-person490">Q. </persName>
            Please to name your partners, and state the particulars of this robbery? - A. My partners are, Robert Wyatt, and Clement Wyatt: The prisoner was in our employ about thirteen or fourteen years; and, on the 10th of May, I cut out fourteen pair of calf-skin boot legs; when I returned from breakfast, I missed one of those pair. In consequence of information, when the prisoner went out to dinner I sent for him back, and desired him to walk into the accompting-house; a constable searched him, and this piece of calf-skin was concealed under his waistcoat, the value is five shillings, and I know it to be one of the pieces I cut out in the morning; he denied having any thing at first, but afterwards, he was asked for what purpose he had taken it, and he said, to cover a chairbottom; I gave no permission to him, or any of our servants, to take any leather.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You would not have kept the prisoner thirteen or fourteen years unless you had a good opinion of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not add, that he meant to have brought it back, and applied to you to purchase it? - A. He did; and said, that he took it as being the cheapest leather, but it is the very dearest, he had no business in that part of the room where it was; there were other workmen in the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAMPBELL sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Birkett and Co. I was desired by Mr. Birkett to watch, which I did, and on the 10th of May, between the hours of twelve and one, I saw the prisoner take this piece of leather from where it was concealed, and put it under his waistcoat, near the place where he was at work.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Gentlemen, I have worked with Messrs.

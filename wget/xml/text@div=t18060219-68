               <p>Q. Who was it that staid behind. - A. I think it was the prisoner, there were three tea spoons laying on the tea board in the first floor front room, I perceived the gentleman did not come to follow me, and the other to go up into the second floor room, and when he came out and attempted to go down stairs, I heard the spoons gingle in his pocket; I said you have got my spoons, sir, come back again, he went back in an instant, and he husstled them down upon the tea board, he then asked me to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any man with you. - A. I had not, I was too much frightened to search him; he went away down the street, and I followed him; he turned the corner and went into Perott's Hotel where he was taken, he had not on the same coat when he was there as when he was at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you loose sight of him. - A. While he turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he pulled off his great coat when you saw him again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man that was with him. - A. He ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this man before. - A. I never saw him before nor since, I only saw him that night he was taken to Marlborough-street; I have been ill ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did loose sight of the persons whoever they were. - A. I must of course, I could not see them when I was in the street, and they had turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say two gentlemen came to your lodgings for the purpose of hiring lodgings. - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You let lodgings, and they coming to look for lodgings, you went about with them to shew them. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever the person was (and you say you believe only) that you spoke upon the subject of the spoons, he immediately turned back. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The spoons that were in the tea tray were to be made use of by the person who hired the lodging. - A. Certainly, but they were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you come back you found them on the tea tray. - A. I saw him put them on the tea tray, I never saw the tea tray at all till the gentleman returned, and put them on the tea tray.</p>
               <p>Court. Whoever that person was, he was on the top of the stairs, and you both went into the room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him turning the corner of the street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the person that you saw at the hotel the same person that you saw in your house. - A. I took my oath of it before the magistrate; I have been ill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190056"></xptr>since, it affected me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person that you saw at the hotel the same person that you saw at your house. - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it. - A. I did not doubt then.</p>
               <p>Q. I only want to know at the time you was at Marlborough street, whether you had any doubt then. - A. I had not.</p>

             sworn. I live in Mrs. Wilkinson's house, as clerk to a gentleman; on Monday the 20th of January, about five in the evening, I had occasion to clean myself, I went down stairs; after I had been there some little time, I heard some noise, I thought it might be Mrs. Wilkinson speaking to the children loud, it did not strike me at first what it really was; in the course of a moment there was cry of Stop thief; hearing the door open, I ran to the door immediately, and Mrs. Wilkinson pointed to the prisoner at the bar, saying, that is the man that has got my spoons, he had got into the street, about three doors off. (There was then another man who ran out first, that was the one that went into the second floor, he stood at the corner peeping by a watchman's box, immediately he saw me run he made off.) I pursued the prisoner into Perott's hotel, where there is a glass door exactly opposite the street door; when I opened the glass door he came up to me and asked me what was the matter.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he drest going into the hotel. - A.He had a great coat on and boots with tops, and when he came to the glass door and asked me what was the matter, he was without his great coat, I then looked him in the face, seeing him without his great coat, I turned him round, and by turning him before me, I knew his boot tops again, I turned him round and looked at him again, I said to him, you are the fellow, and I laid hold of him by the collar; immediately then Mr. Perott came out, and asked him what business he had there (Mrs. Wilkinson was at the door); I said that he had been robbing the lodgings of some spoons, the girl brought his great coat to him (they found it in a back room under a bed), he put it on, he had the same under coat on, as he has now. (Mrs. Wilkinson has swore to him, but people coming to the house and frightening her is the occasion of her being so ill); Mr. Perott held him while I fetched a constable.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutrix) You have done what is very right.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. (to Williams) At the same time that you took that man in custody he had the same coat on then as he has now. - A. Yes, if he was in any disguise whatever I could swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You in consequence of what Mrs. Wilkinson said to you, followed a man. - A. I followed that man.</p>
               <p>Q. She pointed to somebody, and you followed him, and he had a great coat on. - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a long coat or a short coat. - A. A long coat, it did not cover the top of his boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he out of your sight at all. - A. Not at all till I got to the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that you saw at Perott's hotel had no great coat on at all. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Perott's hotel from Mrs. Wilkinson's. - Q. Just thirteen doors.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you pursued had a pair of boots on. - A. Yes, top boots.</p>
               <p>Q. If the boots were produced to you, could you swear to the boots. - A. No, I swear to the man, the boots may have been disfigured; I am swearing the truth.</p>
               <p>- PLANK sworn. I am a constable, I was sent for to Mr. Perott's hotel; the prisoner at the bar was given into my custody, and Mrs. Wilkinson gave me the spoons; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix They are my spoons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed (to Plank) Was the prisoner searched. - A. Yes, nothing was found on him but a few halfpence, and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix I would not wish to be too positive to his person, I had lost sight of him, I would not positively swear that is the man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

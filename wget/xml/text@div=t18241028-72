I was at work with Andrews, and left some tools in the house on Friday, the 10th of September, while we went to dinner - we returned at one o'clock, and several of my tools were gone, and a square among the rest. Those I lost were worth about 18 s. or 1 l. I have seen the square since at Mr. Capel's. There was a basket of other tools taken at the same time. The value of the whole was from 2 l. to 3 l.</p>

I detained him on the Wednesday following, when he came to pawn another saw and square - those he pawned on Friday, the 10th, were claimed by Anderson and Fisher.</p>

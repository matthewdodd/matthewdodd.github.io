            . I am a Police-man. -On the 21st of January I saw the prisoner with another person - there was a crowd; the prisoner put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and I caught him by the collar- his companion had then gone away; the prisoner threw this handkerchief on the ground - I touched the gentleman on the back; he went on, and said he would meet me, but he did not come.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shepperton-place, New North-road, and am a surgeon. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 2nd of October, I met Johnson, in the Strand—I walked home with her to No. 1, Little Catherine-street, where she stated she rented a room—I went into a room, on the first floor—I had in my pocket about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, I do not know which, and silver to an unknown amount—I gave her a half-crown for wine and water, and immediately after, a half-sovereign, and a little after, I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get brandy and water—I partook of it—half-a-crown was the charge for one glass of wine and water—my purse and money was in my right-hand trowsers' pocket—I was going to leave, when she made a demand of more money, for the use of the room, which I refused to give—the half-sovereign was for her—I thought I had paid enough—the prisoner Abrahams came up, stood between me and the door, and talked a great deal—at last, I gave her a sovereign, on condition that Johnson was to refund a part of the money, and she brought me back 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then sent for more brandy and water—we all three drank it—that cost half-a-crown—brandy and water was sent for again—that was another half-crown—it was then approaching to two o'clock—a man made his appearance, who was stated by Abrahams to be her husband, and he joined in consuming the brandy and water—I sent again for brandy and water—the man then left, and I undressed and went to bed, by myself—I was considerably drunk—I was very sick—I was lying quiet in the bed, when something attracted my attention, and I saw Abrahams in the room, with</p>

               <p>my trowsers in her hand—Johnson was about two feet from her—my purse with the remainder of the money, was in my trowsers—I got out of bed, and said to Abrahams, "It is too bad to be meddling with my trowsers, "and I took them into bed with me—I did not look to see whether the money was safe then—I fell asleep, and did not awake till nine o'clock—I found a strange woman in bed with me, and found all the gold was gone—there was a shilling at one end of my purse, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the other—I went down stairs, and charged Abrahams with the robbery—she denied it, and said that the other girl had left—she did not know where she was—I got an officer, and returned—I found both the prisoners there—the officer searched up stairs, and found three sovereigns, and Abrahams offered to give me two sovereigns in addition, if I would say no more about it.</p>

I should think about two wine glasses—I think I sent down half-a-crown each time—I was then getting tipsy—I was drunk—I do not remember how much of the raw brandy I drank the first time—it came up in a small bottle or a small jug—I do not know what I drank it out of—I certainly did not put the bottle to my lips and drink the raw brandy—I drank either out of a wine glass or a tumbler—I did not deny before the Magistrate that I had connexion with Johnson—I remember denying having any connexion with the second woman—I gave her the half-sovereign before I was with her—I gave it her when she came in with the wine and water—I sent down the last sum of money after the gentleman came up—he had not gone down stairs before I sent down the last money, as far as I can re<lb></lb>member—I found 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my purse in the morning at nine o'clock, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>from there to this house—I had never been at Covent Garden Theatre before—I went first to a coffee-house in the neighbourhood—I had there a glass of ale and a glass of whiskey punch—a gentleman was with me there, whom I met at the Theatre—I had never seen him before—I staid with him about half-an-hour and drank with him—I think I paid a shilling, but I do not know—I had a pint of ale, but I left part of it—I am not positive what the bill was.</p>

                  </hi> I am porter at Fenton's hotel—the prisoner arrived there on 29th October—he stayed about thirteen days—he gave me a piece of paper folded up—I asked him what it was; he said, "It is my bill," or "The amount of my bill; give it to the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>"—I gave it to one of the waiters—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "Messrs. Seawards. Please to pay the bearer</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and place the same to my account").</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to stay at Mawrigg's hotel in October, and had been there six days when the waiter presented me with my bill, asking me if I would give a cheque for the amount, and not having sufficient cash on me to discharge it, I wrote a cheque for the amount on Beckett and Co. knowing at the same time that they could not get it cashed, because I kept no account at the house; but the reason I did it was this, a person in the City, who is indebted to me upwards of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had promised me the amount in three days' time, and when I was asked, I did not like to say that I had not got the money to pay it, but I thought I should be able to make all</p>

               <p>right when I got my money. The next day I was in the Strand, and hap<lb></lb>pened to meet my friend; I told him what I had done. He said he was going to Aldershott the next day, to receive some money, and when he got it, he would pay me without fail; when the next day came, I thought if I could be there when he got the money, I could get mine at once; I accord<lb></lb>ingly went to Aldershott, but before going, I left word at Mawrigg's where I was going, and if there were any letters for me the next day, to forward them to me, and also saying that I expected to be back in one or two days. When I arrived at Aldershott, I found my friend had been and had gone away an hour before I arrived; so I came back to London, and not liking to go back to Mawrigg's, as I had not got the money I expected, I went to Fenton's hotel, in St. James's-street—the third day I was there, I met my friend, when he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I told him that was no use to me; he said it was all that he had, and he had a bill due on 10th November, when I should have the whole amount. On 5th November, Fenton's waiter presented me with my bill, when I wrote him out a cheque on Seward and Co. knowing also when I did it, that they could not get it cashed, as I kept no account at the bank, but as I was going to receive my money in five days, I thought I should be able to make all satisfactory. To prove that there was not the slightest intention to defraud any of the parties, when I had done it I did not leave the hotel, as a person would have done had he meant any wrong; but I was in the hotel three days after, expecting my money next day, when I was fetched by a detective. Had I known it would have turned out so serious a case, I should never have attempted it, as I had not the least intention to defraud any one.</p>

               <p>EDWARD TURBILL. On the 10th of March I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock at night - I made all my doors fast; I got up about twenty minutes before six the next morning, and found my front street-door open-it was light then - I heard no noise in the night. I immediately missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were in my shop when I went to bed. My till contained about twenty shillings in copper, and a few shillings. The two sides of bacon were worth 3l. 18s. About eight o'clock that morning the prisoner came to my shop for some pickles, and appeared confused, which made me think she knew something of the robbery; I got a constable, and told him the prisoner had been for some pickles, we went to No. 12, Little James-street, Lisson-green, to a room where she lodged, and found most of the property there. The constable took her. There was a T chalked on the bacon, by which I knew it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 10th of March, at ten o'clock at night, I was at a public-house near the prosecutor's, the prisoner came in about eleven, with three or four men, one of them called for a pot of beer, the landlord refused drawing any, it being late, but he drew it at last. When they had drank it he told them he was going to shut up, and all went out; I followed them, the prisoner went into the middle of the road, and talked to a man named Cox. Next morning I heard of the robbery, and examined the house; I found the front door had been opened by lifting up the iron bar - They are folding-doors, and which might be forced open far enough to lift the bar up. The last time I saw the prisoner was about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock at night - She knew me very well to be a constable. I went to look for the men. In about half an hour the prosecutor said he heard the things were concealed in her room; I went there with Smith, to No. 12, Little James-street, in the one-pair back room, she lived in that room; I found the door padlocked - She was gone out; we forced the lock, went in, and found most of the property, covered over, some of it in the bed, and some under-part of the bacon had been cut off and fried - I found the remains of it in the room, the prosecutor claimed it. I went to look for the prisoner, and met her about a hundred yards down Lisson-street, and told her I wanted her, as she was suspected of the robbery. I took her to the watch-house and searched her, I found the padlock key of her own room in her pocket, and two shillings upon her; she said she did not take the bacon. She said she had been to the prosecutor's for some pickles, and went our again for some starch, and intended to tell him where his things were, but did not.</p>

            . I saw T marked on the two whole sides of bacon; some bacon had been dressed in the frying-pan, the remains of it were in the frying-pan, and one piece appeared cleaned ready to go into the saucepan, which was on the fire. There was 56lbs. of butter in a cask under a cloth, which the prosecutor knew. The prisoner sent me to a woman, whom, she said, had slept in her house the greatest part of the night.</p>

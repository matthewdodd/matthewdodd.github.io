On the 2d of April I saw the prisoner, with two more young persons, between five and six o'clock in the evening; I stood at my father's door, and saw him put his hand into a gentleman's pocket - he took out a handkerchief, put it into his bosom, and walked away with it; the other two were with him at the time: the gentleman was a stranger to me - as soon as he had taken it I stepped from the door, collared him, and took him into the shop; I went to look for the gentleman, but could not find him - I have not seen him since: I do not think I should know him; the prisoner threw the handkerchief down after I had collared him - he said he had picked it up; that could not be true.</p>

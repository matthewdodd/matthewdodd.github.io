(The dies and sheet skeleton copper produced. The halfpence correspond with the dies; Storer's hands appeared black, his sleeves tucked up; he was dressed in a brown waistcoat and slippers on; the women's hands were dirty and appeared to be at work, I believe the woman who opened the door had a candle in her hand, the candles lay on the ground.</p>
               <p>What quantity of halfpence did you find? - I suppose about half a bushell of half-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You are sure these dies that you produced are not the same that was here on the last trial? - As much as your brief is the same as that on the last trial.</p>
               <p>It was the evening when you went to the house? - It was not dark, but sufficient to have candles lighted.</p>
               <p>There was a glimmering light? - The light was from her that I saw the parties, sh e held a candle in her hand.</p>
               <p>Just now you said you did not know that she had a candle in her hand? - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Yes you did. - I believe she had; I got a fall there, I fell about three or four stairs towards the cellar.</p>
               <p>What did the good woman do at the door? - She was in the passage; Payne carried her into the parlour, but not before I had a sight of the parties.</p>
               <p>Nobody was below in the cellar? - Eight or nine candles there were; I tried the nearest and pinched it, then I put my hand on the rest as they lay on the ground, and they all appeared to be warm.</p>
               <p>Then the tallow was hot? - I did not try the wicks, I put my hand on them as I took them up, there were eight or nine.</p>
               <p>This woman is a servant? - The person said so, her hands were dirty, and she was quite in a flurry.</p>
               <p>Well she might, seeing you gentlemen come into the house; how soon was it afterwards that Payne got sight of the man? - Payne had the man, I told him to take care of the man and the woman; and he kept in the parlour all the while.</p>
               <p>Have you got all the instruments for coining here, or in the yard? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prosecution. There was every thing compleat for the business of coining? - Every thing; it was supposed to be the best press in London.</p>

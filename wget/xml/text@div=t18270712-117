            . I am an officer. On the 19th of June I saw the prisoner running in Frith-street; I inquired what was the matter - a lady said he had robbed a gentleman of his handkerchief - I took him, but found nothing on him; a gentleman named Robert Farquhar came to Marlborough-street office afterwards, and said he had been robbed of his handkerchief; the prisoner did not deny it, but begged him not to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Did he say it was the prisoner who took it? A. No.</p>

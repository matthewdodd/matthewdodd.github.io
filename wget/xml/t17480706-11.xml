               <p>Mitchell. Yes; I gave her away.</p>
               <p>Q. At what church?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. At St. Botolph, Bishopsgate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would have put this off, and I would not have married; and she told me, if I would not marry her soon, she would not have me at all. I told her, I had a woman that I had kept company with sixteen years; but I never said any thing of marriage to her.</p>

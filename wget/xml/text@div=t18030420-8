             sworn. - I am an officer; the prosecutor's brother called on me, and we went to the prisoner's room, where we found her and the prosecutor; I asked her if she knew any thing of a watch; she said, no; I searched her pockets, she said it was no use; we got a light, and I observed her mouth going, as if she was eating; I said she was eating the ticket; I took hold of her hand, and gave her a tap on the cheek, and as she was resolute with the other hand, I took hold of it, and found part of the duplicate in her hand, and part on the ground, wet.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor took the watch out of a handkerchief, and told me to sell it; I said, I would pledge it, which I did, at Mr. Davison's; I returned with the money; he took the shilling, and gave me the one-pound note to do as I pleased with; I bought some things with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200023"></xptr>it which the officers took. (The watch produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

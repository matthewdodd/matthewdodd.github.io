                  </hi>. I am manager of the upholstery department of Messrs. Charles Hut ton's establishment, in Newgate-street—they are Berlin wool merchants—on the 4th of April Thompson brought an order purporting to be signed by Messrs. Atkinson and Co. of Westminster Bridge-road, for some goods—he selected some, and took them away—they were customers of ours—he represented himself as coming from them, and mentioned people whom I knew—it was on the faith of that representation that I let him have the goods—he had a quantity of lace, worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 10th of May he called again, and obtained six gross more, with a similar order—on the 18th of May I went to the Woolpack public-house in Monkwell-street—Gleed was standing at the bar—I sent a man named Metcalfe in first, and he introduced me to Gleed—he said "Here is a gentleman, R. M." (meaning ready money) "who can buy that lot of stuff"—Metcalfe and Gleed went into the yard, and after they had had some con<lb></lb>versation they beckoned me to follow, which I did—Gleed pulled these patterns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of curtain lace out of his hat—I recognised them as being the property of Messrs. Walters—they had their mark upon them—I said, "What quantity of this have you for sale?"—and he said, "There is about 1,300 yards"—I asked him the I rice, and he said 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I asked him if he had any other class of goods like these, as I was open to buy anything of the upholstery description—he said, "Oh, yes, I have several other lots"—I wanted to find out if he had any of our property, and asked him whether he had any "Paris bindings"—he said, "Yes, I have a lot, six gross, and also seven pieces of damask, but we will finish this transaction first"—I then went in front of the bar, and called for something to drink, and while there I told him I was a buyer of this description of stuff, and had a market for it, as I travelled round the country—he said, "I suppose you are all square, as these lots are crooked; there are only two manufacturers of them, and this lot has the initials on, which you can cut off as well as me"—I then showed him my purse, that I had the money, and asked him when he could produce the bulk—he said, "Any time to-morrow, if you can name a place"—I named the Portland Arms, in Long-lane, at a quarter to 1 o'clock the following day—I went there, and the prisoner brought a parcel of lace—I asked him upstairs, and upon opening the parcel I found 812 yards instead of 1,307, so I asked him where the remaining quantity was; he said he could</p>

               <p>not produce it then, and then I told him I was employed to detect this matter, and said, "You must consider yourself detained—he gave me this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then asked him if he would render me assistance in finding out the actual thieves concerned, and he said he would—I commu<lb></lb>nicated with Messrs. Walters, and they came and identified their goods—after<lb></lb>wards I went with Gleed to the Waterloo road, and then he said, "I will take you to the place where Morgan (meaning Thompson) resides"—we went into a coffee-house, and I got him to write a letter to Morgan, and make an appointment at the York Hotel, Waterloo-road—we then went to Kenning<lb></lb>ton-lane, at the end of which Gleed pointed out a low beer-house as the residence of Thompson—we returned to the city, and Messrs. Walters gave Gleed into custody-dooming over the bridge I asked him what had become of the lace—"Well," he said, "I have sold 9 grots to Nicholson's in Shore<lb></lb>ditch, and there is another lot 'fast,' and some other which Thompson knows about"—I afterwards met Thompson in Stamford-street, according to arrangement, and gave him into custody.

Atkinson, of Lambeth, are our customers, and it was on the faith of his representations that I let him have the goods—he took the paper with our name on away with him—I identify these goods as the silk borderings that were ordered on the 15th April—the value is 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should think there were about 812 yards in this quantity.</p>

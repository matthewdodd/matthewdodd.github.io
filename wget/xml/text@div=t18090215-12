            . Q. On the Saturday morning about what time was it that this transaction took place - A. Between eight and nine, before my mistress came down stairs. I heard the customers come in, and I came down stairs, as I did on the Friday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Then they were customers that came in before you shewed your slate to your mistress - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay during the time that they dealt with this young man - A. Yes; I heard the bargain, and saw the money paid in both instances.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enter these bargains on the slate - A. Yes, separate as they occurred. I shewed the entry on the slate to my mistress; it was copied by my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person take a copy of it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look over your mistress's copy - A. Yes; I saw it was correct with the slate.</p>

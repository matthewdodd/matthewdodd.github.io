                  </hi>, Esq. I am the chairman of Magistrates acting for the Kensington division, and a Justice of the Peace for the county of Middlesex—this is the nineteenth or twentieth year I have acted as chair<lb></lb>man of the licensing meetings—the annual meeting this year was 5th March—it was adjourned to the 19th, and again to the 26th—I presided at each of those meetings as chairman, and was present from beginning to cud—I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge before 26th March—I know that he had made former applications, and I had visited his house in 1864—he was then an applicant—I visit all the houses every year, and he was in the printed lists—I did not see him on 19th March, his case was adjourned to the 26th—on 11th March this letter was handed to me by my servant—this is the envelope of it—it contained six bank notes, two for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and four for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>—"March 9, 1867. Private. Honoured Sir,—Trusting you will not feel offended, but par<lb></lb>don the very great liberty I have taken, having struggled very hard in my house for eleven years to maintain my family, without any complaint being made by the police. If you will take my case into consideration, and be my friend at the coming licensing day, it will be for ever felt by your most obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">G. E. GURXEY</hi>. Robert Tubbs, Esq.") After that I received another letter—I think I received it on 10th April—it is dated the 8th—the prisoner applied on the 26th by attorney; he was present; the matter was heard, and his licence was refused—before I re<lb></lb>ceived the last letter I had communicated with my brother Justices, in consequence of which I made a communication to the Secretary of State by letter on 29th March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose sometimes you are not able to attend? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am very seldom absent when I am in England; when I am absent they elect a chairman for the day—that has happened once a year if not twice—no one was appointed in that way in 1866, I was in England the whole year; I do not think I was absent a day from the Sessions—the Hon. Mr. Curzon was, I think, generally appointed as my substitute if he was there—I do not know when he sat last—the chairman is, gene<lb></lb>rally speaking, the most important member—he has not the casting vote—the licence is signed by a majority of the Justices present, and if they are equal there is no licence—on the 26th about twenty applications for new licences were heard, and we were kept very nearly the whole day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100025"></xptr>
               <p>from eleven o'clock—it ought not necessarily to have come on on the 19th—the whole seventy applications were down for hearing, and a large majority, nearly fifty, were heard on the first day—we did not begin the new cases till the second day, the 19th, and finished them on the 26th—there is a list, but very often, when Counsel are on circuit, we take them out of their turn, it matters not to the Justices which they take—appli<lb></lb>cations I dare say were made to take cases out of their order, and very likely we took some which were low down, which, if application had not been made, would not have been heard till the 26th—these licences are I think very troublesome to the Magistrates, I have an instance of it here to-day, and very troublesome to the applicants, from the opposition of other neighbours and publicans, who do not like the monopoly to be interfered with—speeches are made by Counsel on both sides—your friend Mr. Poland does not generally appear for the Justices, he cannot—I have seen him there very often—the petition of the applicant is read, and is sometimes taken as read, and Counsel state the case—I do not think we ever have witnesses called unless there is some ill-conduct alleged against the applicant—they are called at the Sessions, but not at Petty Sessions, we are all so well acquainted with the neighbourhood—we are bound to hear everybody—if there are three Counsel I do not see how we can avoid three speeches—the Magistrates do not retire, we consult together—I have not known such a thing for years as our going out of Court—we do not make up our minds beforehand—I generally take the votes, and if there is a majority or not against the licence I declare it—I generally vote, but sometimes I do not—when an application is made to take a case out of its turn, it is generally addressed to the chairman, and I accede or decline, but if any gentleman on the Bench thinks it is wrong he would say "I do not think we ought to do that"—if the chairman says, "We had better take it," the Justices will consent—there are very often applications against the decision of the Justices to the Quarter Sessions—the Magis<lb></lb>trates for the county sometimes decide that the Magistrates for the petty sessional division have decided erroneously—I have sat on appeals—I got this 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 11th March, and about an hour afterwards I went to Mr. Cornell, the clerk, and next morning I communicated with Mr. Curzon, the Magistrate, and mentioned having received the money—on the 19th I took the opinion of the Justices generally at the first meeting—on 27th March I went to see the Secretary of State, but Mr. Waddington was unwell and absent—I saw Lord Belmore, the political under-secretary—I know the prisoner's house, the Earl of Cardigan, Marlborough Road, Chelsea—he says that he has been in it eleven years—rl do not recollect the name of the great opposition house which petitioned against him—it is a very short distance off, 150 or 200 yards—I should say that it is not an increasing neighbourhood, and that there are no new houses in the dis<lb></lb>trict—I recollect his making an application in 1864, but not in 1865 or 1866—I have looked at my papers—I was present in 1865 and 1866—I have not been absent one licensing day during the time I have been chairman—I did not understand your question before to apply to licens<lb></lb>ing days—I said that it might be twice a year I was absent—I mean to say that for twenty years I have never been absent on the day that applications were made for new licences—I cannot recollect whether any appli<lb></lb>cations were made for any other houses in the neighbourhood that Jay, but the clerk is here—my servant received the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Justices of the Kensington division, and have been so several years—a petition in favour and a petition against the licence has to be filed before the general annual licensing meeting—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the petition filed by the defendant—whether it was delivered by himself or his attorney I do not know—Mr. Martin, the solicitor, advocated the prisoner's case on the 26th for a licence for the Earl of Cardigan—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the counter petition by W. S. Smith—the defendant appeared personally on the 26th at London, attended by Mr. Martin—I saw him in Court before the matter was gone into or the notice proved—he was sworn and I examined him as to the due service of the notices—he swore that he had properly served them—the case was then heard in the ordinary way—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of the notice which was proved, I drew the notice myself in my own office—I have known the defendant very well in previous years, and have heard his case discussed when he has been present—the licence was refused, and he has never appealed against that decision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say that in previous years he has applied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in 1864, I think—I am sure he made three former applications, all of which were heard by the Bench and discussed—I had frequently seen him there—the last time-was in 1864, I think—to the best of my belief, he made no application from 1864 to 1867—he made two or three before 1864—I have to make a record of them—I am not aware whether the prisoner applied in 1863. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's petition, being produced, contained ninety-five signatures.</hi>) There has not been a licence granted in that immediate neighbourhood for twelve or fourteen years, the last was a house within a few doors of him, the one that opposes him now—there is only one signature to the opposing petition—there is no petition of the inhabitants against him—notice was given that the inhabitants would petition against him—the purport of the notice is, that the inhabitants may know that such an application is about to be made, and may oppose the petition if they please, and they do frequently oppose, but they did not in this case—the neighbourhood has not increased for the last ten years—the prisoner has had a beer-house eleven years.</p>

I know the defendant—it is twenty years since I saw him write, but, my memory being refreshed, I have no doubt these letters are his writing, and the envelopes as well—I was present when the warrant was executed—when it was read over the prisoner said, "Yes, I wrote the letter, and took the letter and money myself; I did not intend it as a bribe, I made him a present; I did not know I was doing any harm."</p>

The indictment averred," well knowing that the said Edward Tubbs, Esq., would be chairman," which it was impossible to prove, it being in the nature of a prediction. The point might be immaterial, but by averring it it became material. <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> considered the allegation unnecessary, the indictment being perfectly good without it, and informed the Jury that if the prisoner sent the money with the intent to produce any effect upon Mr. Tubbs's decision, that was an attempt to corrupt. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant of 5, Leicester-square—I have known the prisoner for several years. On 12th Feb., 1849, he called at my house, and asked me to cash this check for him(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I saw him write it—I gave him two sovereigns for it, supposing he had assets at the banker's.</p>

            's house. I looked at my box the very same morning, the 4th of April; it contained a black superfine coat; I paid four guineas for the coat: a shirt two pair of pantaloons, I value them at eighteen shillings; there were four handkerchiefs, I value them at eight shillings; two pair of worsted stockings, four shillings. This hat was there, but it was left; and there was a pocket-book, it contained papers of no use, but two duplicates, one of a watch, the other a quadrant. I had pawned them. I saw the pocket book containing these duplicates the very same morning. I am sure of that. I unlocked my box that day, and took a handkerchief out of the box in the morning, about seven o'clock; then I locked it; I took my key with me on board a ship. I returned to my lodging about half past six o'clock in the evening; I then found my box lid forced open. The lock was forced off the lid. It was fast below, but forced from the lid. I missed all my things in the box except a hat, a pair of pantaloons, and some papers. I believe I have not mentioned two shirts. I missed all the other articles except a hat and a pair of pantaloons. I left my lodging that morning about seven o'clock; I left the prisoner in the room in bed on that morning. A quarter before five the prisoner called me, and told me to rise, or else I should be too late; it had already struck seven o'clock, he said. I went out before him, and left him in bed. When I returned the prisoner was not in the room. This was on the 21st. I did not see him afterwards until the 4th of April. I met him in the street. He did not return to his lodging from the 21st of March to the 4th of April. On the 4th of April, when I met him in the street, I asked him to step into the house with me; he rather objected; he said he did not know me. I took hold of him, and went into a house with him, and left him in custody of the gentleman that keeps the house, and I brought Hall, the officer, and gave him in custody, Mr. Hall searched the prisoner in my presence. I saw found on the prisoner my two duplicates. I have never seen anything of my coat and waistcoat.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of April, Plaen came to me; I went to where the prisoner was. I took the prisoner into another room and searched him. In his trowsers pocket I found these two duplicates; he said they were his own. I shewed them to Plaen; he said they were his, he had lost them out of his box. The prisoner, after Plaen said they were his, said that he had picked them up in the room after Plaen had gone out that morning. I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up in the room. There were other people in the room besides myself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Plaen. Did any body else lodge in the room besides you and the prisoner - A. No. The landlord of the house is here.</p>

            . Q. Do you happen to know when the prisoner went out of his lodging on the 21st of March - A. Yes, about a quarter after seven o'clock in the morning. He did not return to my lodging any more. He owed me for the last night's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200021"></xptr>lodging and two pints of beer.

               <p>Q. Did they make their own beds - A. No; there is a servant to make their beds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was another man in the room before I got up; I got up, went out, and returned; the same man was in the room. I asked the man if he had lodged in the room before; he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Furness. You told me just now, that the prisoner went out a quarter after seven o'clock - A. Yes; he did not pay for his nights lodging, and two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect in the morning when the prisoner went out, that there was any other man in the room - A. Only them two; Plaen and the prisoner slept there. I saw the prisoner going along Montague-street, Whitechapel. No stranger came to my house that morning at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Plaen. Look at the duplicates produced by the officer, and tell the jury whether they are yours - A. They are mine; they have my name written by the pawnbroker; I am quite clear they are mine.</p>

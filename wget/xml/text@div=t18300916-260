            . I am a tailor, and live in Grafton-street, opposite the prosecutrix's; I saw John Marshall coming out of her house five minutes after six o'clock, with a bundle across his shoulder - she immediately followed him, tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Now I have caught you in your villiany," and she gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I found six 2lbs. loaves in the bag; I showed them to the prosecutrix at the watch-house, and she said they were hers - I went to her house, and she gave me charge of Adam Marshall; he went on his knees, and begged forgiveness - he said he had committed an error, and robbed a good mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you state this before the Magistrate? A. Yes; Adam handed me 2s.; I did not go into the shop; I went into the bake-house - the prosecutrix said, "John Marshall has taken out six loaves, and this man gave them to him;" I said he had better put on his things and come with me - he said,"I am very sorry, I have taken 2s. of the other man for them; here is the 2s. which the soldier has given me - I know I have committed myself;" he did not say he took the 2s. for the bread.</p>
               <p>MRS. FITTOCK. I saw some loaves at the watch-house, but I could not swear they were mine; the price of them was 2s. 0 1/2d., and Adam Marshall laid that money down to pay for them - the Policeman took up the 2s., and said, "Never mind the 1/2d.;" he said he was very sorry he had committed himself that morning; he said he had served the soldier with six 2lbs. loaves, and he had paid him for them - he begged me to forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the value of them was 2s. 1/2d.? A. Yes; it was taken from the dough-trough, and the soldier was a customer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the soldier tell you what he had in the bag? A. Yes; he said bread, but he had paid for it.</p>
               <p>Adam Marshall's Defence. The soldier was taken in charge before I knew any thing about it; if the woman had come down I should have given her the money - he used to come and have the bread out of the bake-house; I said, "Here is the money for the bread."</p>

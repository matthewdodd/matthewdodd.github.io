               <p>Did you see it taken out of his pockets? - No.</p>
               <p>Had it your mark upon it? - Yes; one half-crown piece and one shilling I know of, the officer has the money.</p>

               <p>I am the officer, I have two half-crowns and a shilling, I was called on November the 22d to take up a suspicious person, I went to Mr. Womersly's shop, and he charged the prisoner with taking money out of the till, and insisted on seeing what money he had in his pocket, he made no hesitation, he put his hand in his right-hand pocket, and pulled out three guineas, four half-crowns, and three shillings and put down; among the money were these two half-crowns and this shilling, that was marked; his master said then, John, I am afraid thee hast not done right; he is a Quaker, says he, here is some of the money that was taken out of the till, says the prisoner, Sir, I have taken seven shillings which you borrowed of me in the morning, and had repaid myself out of the till, he said, John, I paid thee that in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the master here? - No, he is a Quaker, and he will not swear.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. As it depends on the prisoners asserting on the one side, that his master had borrowed money of him, and his master asserting on the other side that he had paid him again, and as the master does not come here to swear it; it would be a great deal too much to convict the prisoner.</p>

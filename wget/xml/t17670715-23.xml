I worked at a tin-shop in Old-street-road; coming from there to Whitecross-street for my dinner, I met the boy at the bar with another with him; (he is not taken;) I know the other boy, because he lighted lamps for my master where I served my time; he asked me if I would buy a watch; I said no; he always bore the character of a pickpocket; he told me, he had left it in the hands of Mr. Griffin in Cowheel-alley, otherwise Swan-alley, for victuals and drink; I thought he could not come honestly by it; I went to Mrs. Griffin, and asked her for it, and she very honestly parted with it, and said, she did not care to have any thing to do with it; the prosecutor came to me at the White Bear, next door to where I work; he asked me if I knew of a watch; I said I did, and asked him if he knew the name or number; he said he did not; I went to Justice Girdler, and told him of it; he ordered me to advertise it; I did in June; then there were several people came after it, and the best description was by a man in East Smithfield, but he could not tell the name nor number, but he mentioned a bruise; then the prosecutor came, and said he would sue me if I parted with it; then I took the prisoner up; then he owned that Kingston took it.</p>

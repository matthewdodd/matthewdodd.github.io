            . Q. What money had you? A. Three sovereigns, a five shilling piece, and a bad shilling; I changed the five shilling piece for drink- I had the three sovereigns, and the remaining silver, together in the same purse; the silver was left, and the gold gone - this is the purse; there was the bad shilling, and 3s. 6d. - I had changed the crown piece, and treated her with a glass of rum; I had paid for the beer with some other silver - I opened the purse, and the prisoner was by my side; I do not know whether she saw it - I took out the purse to give her a shilling, and put it into my pocket again; I did not mention to her that there were any sovereigns in the purse - I pulled her hand out of my pocket, and felt the purse in my pocket then; it was just before I parted from her - I did not treat her with a gill of liquor after I changed the crown piece; I had 4s. 6d. and the bad shilling left.</p>

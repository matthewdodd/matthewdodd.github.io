                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant at Twickenham. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, the 21st of April, about six o'clock, I went to a skittle-ground to play at skittles—I had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in six half-crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences, in my left-hand coat pocket—I pulled off my coat, and put it down with the money in it—while I was playing skittles the prisoner came and asked if I had got arty beer—I said, "Yes," and told him to drink—I still kept playing—when I had done I put my coat on, and was going home with my horse and cart, when the witness West asked me if my money was right in my pocket—I told him I did not know, as well as I knew it was right—I then looked and missed three half-crowns—I ran after the prisoner, and asked him for it—he denied it—I said there was a policeman there, and if he did not give it up I would give him in charge—he then gave me the three half-crowns, and said he did it for a <hi rend="italic">lark.</hi>

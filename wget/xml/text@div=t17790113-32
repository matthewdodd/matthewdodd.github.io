               <p>You did not see the gown and shift in her hand? - No; I went after her with a constable to take her for an assault; she came back with new shoes and stockings, and a lap full of mutton chops.</p>

               <p>What became of the mutton chops; they were for your mistress's supper were they not? - No; my mistress was not within.</p>

               <p>I have lived with Mrs. Lloyd, off and on, sixteen years; I could not get any wages of her but six shillings. I went to Mrs. Fielding's to enquire after her; Mrs. Feilding said she was not there. I said I knew she was for I heard her voice. She then came out; I told her I was in danger of being taken up for things I had pawned for her out of her ready furnished lodging, and that I had no lodging; she said they could not hurt her as they turned her out. Mrs. Fielding said I might stay there; I asked Mrs. Lloyd to give me some shoes, she said I might take some of her sister's things, and say nothing to her; she would fetch them out without telling her of it. The maid and I had a quarrel, and she told her mistress I had taken the things; Mrs. Fielding said if I would give her sister a receipt in full she would not hurt me.</p>

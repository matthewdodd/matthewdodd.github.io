               <p>Q. You could not discover what was in the bundle? - A. No; it was just dark, in the evening; I followed her to Carnaby-street; she went into Mrs. Trussles, a fur-shop; the Wednesday afterwards I did not go into the room, because she paid me the rent; when her week was up again, on Wednesday or Thursday night, I did not set sight of her; I went up, and discovered all the furniture of the bed and the bed-clothes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find your property? - A. Some I found at Mr. Sanderland's, Vigo-lane; I took her up out of her lodgings, in Carnaby-street, on Friday; a week after I followed her with the bundle; I found nothing there but a piece of the curtains; and the other part I found at Mr. Sanderland's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I took this woman in out of charity (Mrs. Herbert), as she had a helpless infant, and was out of work; I employed her in work; my work is the army-work; I took compassion on her, as she was without a lodging; I took the blankets from my own bed and lent her; she went to Warwick-street, to that good lady; she came back and said to me, I have got a lodging, will you give me a character; I said, Mrs. Herbert, I will give you one; that very day the lady came; Mrs. Herbert was washing for me; she answered the door herself, and said Mrs. Boulton was very ill in bed, and could not be spoke with; she went out of the door, and gave herself a character, and the good lady took her for a tenant; she lodged with her about a week, when Mrs. Herbert said to me, my good lady, it is out of my power to pay so much a week; if you will only let my child set by your fire-side, I shall be very happy, and Mrs. Harrison and my landlady are witnesses of the child coming to me; the child was very bad in the hooping-cough; she has brought the child to my apartments, and perhaps in half an hour she has brought in two medicines, one to anoint the child outwardly, and the other to take inwardly; I was astonished to know how she got the money; I gave her leave to bring the child in a morning, and to have water for her breakfast; she has brought the child totally undressed in a morning, merely for the child to have the warmth of the fire; she clapped the key upon the table; she seemed to put the child's damp linen on the table, and sometimes she has brought the key in the morning, and has sat by my fire all day; it was entirely out of humanity that I gave her the liberty; I told Mr. Slade, the officer, and my landlady, where Mrs. Herbert was gone to lodge; I told them, in a three-pair of stairs front room; they did not chuse to seek her; I was in the New Prison, Tothill-fields, from Friday to the Wednesday following; on Wednesday following, this Mrs. Herbert's week was up again; during that time, my friend went to enquire where the second lodging of Mrs. Herbert was, and when she went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150031"></xptr>there Mrs. Herbert was gone, and I have never seen nor heard of her since; I have it not in my power to have a Counsellor; there was a young person that came to my landlady, where I have been taken from, to enquire after me; my landlady told her, she had a right to detain any person that came after me, which was this woman that had robbed the lodgings; since I have been in confinement, I could not see any of my friends; when they took me to Marlborough-street, they had all my duplicates and the key of my room; and they did just as they thought proper; there were three pawnbrokers at Marlborough-street; they came forward when I was examined; they could not say I was the person; I am truly innocent; I leave it to the honourable Judge and Jury.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

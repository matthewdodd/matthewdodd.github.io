On Thursday, 26th June, about a quarter to 11 o'clock at night, he came in, called for a pint of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, and wanted change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he laid what I thought to be a of note on the counter—I asked who it was for—he said, for Mr. Richardson, at the Lime-wharf, Wharf-road, Paddington; that they wanted change to pay the men; they had just been emptying a lime barge, and the men were waiting for their money—I told him I had not got it—he said, "I won't have the ale then"—I said, "Oh, never mind about that; you can pay for that another time"—he then went away—he returned is about ten minutes, and said, if I would put my name on the back of the note, he could get it changed—I did so—I think I pat "Temple," in pencil, and the date—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he then went away—he afterwards came back, and paid for the ale, and had change for a sovereign—on Saturday, 28th, two days afterwards, Mr. Sellick came to my house with the note—I was in the cellar at the time—Mrs. Temple was in the bar—he asked for change, and she asked if she should give it, and I said, "Yes," seeing my name at the back—I paid it away to Mr. Burton, half an hour afterwards—I saw the prisoner at my house two or three times afterwards—I said it was rather too bad of him to bring that note to me, I had had it back again—I was not then aware that it was forged—he replied it was all right.</p>

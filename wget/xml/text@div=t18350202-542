                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Kilminster. On the 10th of January, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Milton-street, carrying a bundle, containing the articles stated—when I got to Sun-court, it was snatched from my arm by a man who stood at the corner—he ran up the court—I followed him—I believe it was Young, but I will not be positive—I had a slight glance of his features—he put the bundle under his left arm—as soon as he turned the first corner, a person joined him, who had a flannel jacket on—they seemed talking, but I could not hear what they said—that was about fourteen yards from the place where I lost my bundle—they then ran, and I followed them, till I fell down some steps—the one in the flannel jacket then came back, and spoke to a woman—I lost the bundle entirely—the prisoners were taken in about a week—I believe they are the men.</p>

On the 8th of August, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in a house which may be deemed a lodging-house; it is a private house, and has been mine for upwards of twenty years - I had lived there one night- there had been soldiers quartered there upwards of eleven years; I had recently come out of trouble, as I was convicted illegally; I went to my house, where I found the prisoner; I had known him before; I gave him a bottle, and he got some gin. I begged him to dine with me, which he did - there were four persons in the house. After dinner I laid down on the sofa, and fell asleep; I had four sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and fifteen or sixteen shillings in my purse, in the left pocket of my small clothes; it appears I could not have slept two minutes before the house-keeper,

            . I lived servant with Mr. Parr. I was hired by Mrs. Jenkins, the house-keeper - I have often seen the prisoner - he was an acquaintance of Parr's, and he knew Mrs. Jenkins; on the 8th of August, tween six and seven o'clock in the evening, Parr came home - the prisoner was there - they shook hands and Parr asked him to dine, which he did; Mr. Parr laid down on the sofa - I went into the kitchen, and when I returned, the prisoner was lying upon Parr, and his hand in his left trouser's pocket, and his waistcoat was unbuttoned; I said"What are you doing, Sir;" Nothing, said he, and he gave me a push with his arm, and put a brown purse into his pocket - he said, "I am in haste, I can't wait any longer;" I called the house-keeper, and said, "I will not move out of this place till you send for an officer;" the officer came, and I was searched; I did not know but what his roguishness might have said (as there were nobody in the room but him and me,) that I had taken it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You would not for the world be in a house with a bad character? A. I am forced to do many things I do not like for a bit of bread; this is a lodging-house; I do not know whether they let lodgings for an hour.</p>

            . I am an officer. The housekeeper was accused of the robbery by Parr - she wished to be searched, and I searched her very strictly - she then informed me that Chatterton had gone off with the money; I went to his house and searched him, but found nothing.</p>

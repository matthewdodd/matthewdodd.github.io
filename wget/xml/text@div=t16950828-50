            </rs>. And having a Correspondence in Norfolk, they did drive this way of Trade for some time, and some Canting Letters each to the other, to the end that there might be no Discovery made: But it hapned, that on the said 30th of April, the Commissioners of the Customs coming to search Mr. Southgate's Warehouse, the Norwich Wagoner at the Green Dragon in Bishopsgate-street, did light upon a Wooden Box marked A. L. directed to John Goodall, and opening it, found it stuft with Straw and Litter, and a Bag of money with Notes in it tied in the middle, wherein it did express that there was 45l. Best, and 7l. Midling. The Commissioners suspecting the matter, ordered that if any person should come for it, they should not deliver it till they came. In the Afternoon Mr. Goodall came to demand this Box, but was stopt and searcht, and a Letter was found in his Pocket dated the 25th of April, and subscribed by two Letters J. G. in which it was exprest, that he had sent Mr. Goodall 45 of the best Silk Naps, which was construed to be the 45l. of Broad old money, with seven middling Naps, which was likewise construed to be the 7l. of middling money, in a Box marked A. L. It farther appeared by his way of Corresponding, that he had received above 550l since the 11th day of January last, to the 21st of March. There being not Evidence sufficient to charge him with the Fact, the Jury took it into consideration, and <rs id="t16950828-50-verdict281" type="verdictDescription">

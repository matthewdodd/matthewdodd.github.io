                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Field. The prisoner was in our service five months—on Saturday, the 17th of October, I observed a pair of ear-rings in her ears, which I thought were not here—I asked her how she got them—she said she found them in the street—I asked her se<lb></lb>veral times were she got them—she still said she found them in the street—I said if she would tell me, and be a good girl, I would forgive her—she afterwards went up stairs, and put my children to bed, and in about had an hour, I called her down, and she made a confession—she afterwards left the house—on Saturday, the 17th, I missed a shawl, and on Tuesday, the 20th, I missed my watch—her mother and sister brought her back to me on Tuesday, the 27th, and I gave her in charge.</p>

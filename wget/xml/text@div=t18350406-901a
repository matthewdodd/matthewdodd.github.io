                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mark Cohen, and live in Great Prescott-street. He is a traveller—on the 7th of March, I and my little boy were going to the theatre—I had in my pocket two sovereigns, a crown, five shillings in silver, and an order for the theatre—they were in my purse—when I came to Leadenhall-street, I took an omnibus—I put my pocket between my petticoat and gown, on my right side—I am certain my pocket and money were safe—there were two persons in the omnibus, one on my side, and one on the opposite side—I did not know those per<lb></lb>sons—a gentleman sat on the opposite side, in the corner, reading a book, or paper, and next to me was a man, who, to the best of my belief at that time, was the prisoner—on going down Fleet-street, the omnibus man gathered many passengers—a person said to him, "Here is sixpence, let me out at Temple-bar;" and, at that moment, the person who sat next to me ran out of the omnibus—I had felt a pressure on my right side more than once—the man had spectacles on, but whether green or blue, I could not positively say—they were coloured spectacles—I called out, "Good God! stop that man; my pocket is cut!"—the omnibus man said, "You had better get out, and get a policeman"—I believed the man with specta<lb></lb>cles was the prisoner—I thought him rather rude, but took no further notice—I got out of the omnibus, and went to my friends at the theatre, thinking the order would be presented—I told a policeman what had hap<lb></lb>pened, and he fetched an officer, who took me to a house in Wych-street, where I saw the prisoner—I said I thought he was the man—on the Satur<lb></lb>day following we had him before the magistrate—my child was then with me—he said, "Mamma, you have made a mistake; the man in the omnibus was not pock-marked," and I cannot say that is the man—on that statement of the child, I consider I may have made a mistake—I pointed him out to the police as the man, because he had spectacles on—I have since seen a man so much like him, that if the prisoner had not been in custody, I might as well have said he was the man—that man had spectacles on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prosecutrix at Co<lb></lb>vent-garden theatre—she told me she had been robbed by a little thin man, wearing spectacles—I took her to a house in Wych-street, and found the prisoner, and three others, drinking at the bar—he had spectacles on—di<lb></lb>recttly</p>

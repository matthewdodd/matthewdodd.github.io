               <p>About half after five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner Usher standing, and when I returned he stood in the same place; I stood about ten minutes, and he walked backwards and forwards, and looked in, and now and then put his elbow against the window; then there came by some drays, and then he crossed the way to the other, whom I had seen opposite, and I heard him whistle for him; he then stood about three minutes, and then Allen crossed over to the shop, and Usher stood in his place, and Allen likewise walked backwards and forwards two or three times, looking in at the window; then a waggon came past and he knocked in the window, and took out five pair of stockings, and put them under his left arm; I saw him do it; I ran to stop him, and I could not, he ran too fast; I cried out stop thief; and immediately Mr. Hanwell's man came up and took him; then Usher ran after Allen, and I took hold of him also.</p>
               <p>Before this, did you see the prisoners talking together? - Yes, Sir, I did; but I did not know what they talked about; they might be about three or four minutes together; I did not see him drop them.</p>

               <p>As I was coming along with my horses and waggon, about six in the evening, I saw a man stand opposite the window, and just as the waggon came on, the man broke in the window; that was the prisoner Allen; I saw him drive his elbow through the window, and take up a bundle of stockings; I stopped my horses immediately, and ran after him, and caught him, and when I was within five yards of him, he threw down the stockings on a dunghill; I saw him throw them down, and he ran into a corner, and hid himself; I saw a man pick up the stockings, and deliver them to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100065"></xptr>Eley; I saw them brought to the door to him; the prisoner had them under his waistcoat on his left side; and he took and threw them down; he never was out of my sight after he dropped the stockings.</p>

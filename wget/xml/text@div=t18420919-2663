                  </hi>. I am servant to John Perkins, a jeweller, in North-place, Gray's-inn-road. The prisoner left a bag with me on the 8th of August—he called for it again between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th—I went into an adjoining room for it, and left him in the counting-house—when I came in again I missed a breast pin and locket, from a tray on the desk—I had seen them safe five minutes before—he was standing against the counter, a little distance from the desk—I sent for a policeman—I told him I missed these things—he searched, and the pin was found on the floor where the prisoner was sitting—the locket has never been found—I had the prisoner searched—he said he knew no<lb></lb>thing about it.</p>

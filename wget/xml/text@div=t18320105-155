I lost 4 lbs. of bacon on the 9th of December, did not see it taken, but I had lost a piece before which made me notice my bacon - the prisoner was in my shop, and he said to a man who I bought baskets of,"I shall go;" I missed the bacon, and the man said, "I will go and see for him;" he pulled a basket off the prisoner's shoulder, and my bacon was in it - he had not got two dozen yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Was not the prisoner also selling baskets? A. Yes, and he put down his basket to wait while the other man sold me one - the bacon was on a sideboard close to him; he could look at me, and put the bacon in the basket - the other man was near the bacon; I did not see the other man turn his head; the prisoner did not deny that he had taken it to me; but before the Magistrate he said he did not know that it was in his basket - when the basket was taken from his shoulder he ran down a narrow street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the shop, and a young man was buying butter scrapings - I got fifty of one hundred yards from the place, and the man came running after me, pulled the basket off my back, and took the piece of bacon.</p>

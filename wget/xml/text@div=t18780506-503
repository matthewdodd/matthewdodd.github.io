                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp, and Co., of 6, Old Jewry, who are solicitors to the Agra Bank—I was sent for to the bank on 1st April between 12 and 1—Lord Cranworth, Mr. Richard<lb></lb>son, and Mr. Duncan, directors, were present—the prisoner Wynn made a voluntary statement—I warned him that any statement that he might make must be unconditionally made—I reduced to writing what occurred the same evening, with the exception of one or two blanks which I filled in the next morning—this is the memorandum I made; it states that Mr. Wynn offered explanations as to the account between Waud and Graves and the bank, that the overdrawings were not brought to the attention of the chairman, that he had allowed the overdrawings to serve Waud and Graves, that he had spoken of them to the clerks Green, Carter, and Martin, and had induced them not to notice them, telling them it would be all right, that the over drawings had been going on for several months past, and that 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been drawn out on 28th March, the day before Waud and Graves's stoppage, that he handed the amount to Graves at his counting-house and received cheques as if it had been paid in cash over the counter, and was afterwards entered by him, that Graves promised to give him cover, but failed to do so, and he threw himself on the mercy of the directors; that as to the previous transac<lb></lb>tions he could not identify the circumstances of each of them, but they were generally carried out in the same way, the cash being taken out at lunch time and handed to Graves at a meeting-place in Lombard Street or at Graves's own counting-house; that Waud was present at some of the overdrafts and was acquainted generally with what was going on, but did not take any active part; that as to Mr. Green he said he was sorry to compromise his fellow-clerks, but that they accepted his assurance and did not know anything was wrong, and that cheques for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be</p>

Waud and Graves's pass-book from our bank—the pass-book is made up from the ledger and the entries checked off by the cheques—no customer should have any debit cheques until they are entered in the pass-book—the 58 cheques found at Graves's, I believe, were not entered in the pass-book—the account was not in credit again—a debit balance-book is kept for the information of directors—it shows when a customer over<lb></lb>draws—I kept that book—I have spoken to Wynn about Waud and Graves's debit—Wynn asked me not to put it in the book, because he had a credit for the amount in the ledger—that is cheques may not have come in time to get paid—I was satisfied with that explanation and omitted to put the amount in the debit balance-book—I was aware of the relationship between Wynn and Waud—I did not know anything about Wilton and Co. being the same firm as Waud and Graves.</p>

I live at Hackney, and am a cashier in the Agra Bank—I have been employed there since 1867—it is not a Clearing House Bank—we clear through Glyn's—the latest time we send cheques to Glyn's is 3.45—we get our Bank of England notes from Glyn's—there is daily about 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of notes in the bank—about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes was under the control of Wynn in till No. 2—I and Mr. Green had charge of till No. 1, the general cash—it was Wynn's duty to make up on a slip of paper the contents of his till—for my balance I got from him the total figure, and copied it first on my own slip, and then in this book which is ruled in two columns, one for general, and the other for Wynn's cash—the last time Wynn wrote the figures of till No. 2 was on the 20th March—on the 21st March I got Wynn's total as 611<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 22nd 615<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 23rd 647<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 25th 563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 26th 659<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 27th 693<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 28th 735<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 29th 639<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 29th was the last day Wynn was at the bank—J1 and J7 contain Wynn's figures—I saw Mr. Green take them from Wynn's drawer on Saturday, March 30th—these figures tally with my entries, except that I wrote 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and represented the contents of till No. 2 on those days—when the contents of the till was counted I found cheques marked C1 to C4—the amount of moneys was 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was no 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—C3 and C4 have not been can<lb></lb>celled—C3 is taken from a cheque-book kept at the bank for the use of customers commencing No. 247, 381—it is the second cheque—the cheque of 26th March for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is taken from the cheque-book of Waud and Graves—it is in Graves's writing, and there are two small crosses on the counterfoil—looking at this book, in Graves's writing, I find two little crosses and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. carried out as a total on 26th March; and on 12th March the same little crosses and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. carried out, corresponding with the amount of the other cheque—I have several times spoken to Wynn about the unsatisfactory state of Waud and Graves's account—within three or four months of his leaving my attention was directed to it—Wynn's reply was generally that there had been a lock up of capital in machinery, and that the overdraft would probably be put right in a few days, possibly hours—on 25th March I noticed a very heavy over<lb></lb>draft, and told Wynn it was very wrong, and could not possibly be allowed, and I should have to represent the matter to the chairman—he assured me in the most solemn manner that the account was right or would be right—that was three or four days before the account was in credit 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on seeing the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. credit I said to Wynn I was very glad that the account had been set right and hoped it would be kept right—about three or four days before this credit Wynn said "Carter, we have worked together for 25 years, have I ever deceived you in any way?"—I said "No, certainly not"—he said "I swear to you, before my Maker, that this account is right; I test it in every way, I know the whole ins and outs of it, and the thing cannot go wrong"—he then said "Would you mind advancing 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Waud and Graves on the faith of what I tell you?"—I said I did not feel justified in doing it, it was a large sum of money for me to part with—he said Graves was coming to speak to me about it—I said "How comes it that Graves knows anything of my private matters?"—he said "I told him"—I saw Graves alone immediately after in the street outside the bank, and he renewed the application—Graves said "Waud and Graves are temporarily pressed for money, could you oblige me with the loan of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I</p>

               <p>said that I could not, because what money I had had came from my wife and I could not deal with it without her consent, and there the matter dropped—Waud very rarely came to the bank, and very few cheques are in his name—after the credit of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been drawn out in cheques cancelled by Wynn, except two cheques of my can<lb></lb>cellation, one for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware I had cancelled the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till I saw it at the Mansion House—I showed the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to Wynn before I paid it—we do not refer to the ledger on paying cheques except in rare cases—I was not aware of the 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank<lb></lb>notes being taken out of the bank by Wynn on March 28th, nor of Wynn's taking notes away at any time—I never heard of it till Wynn's statement on 1st April—I did not know that Wynn was not coming to the bank on 30th March—I walked with Wynn to the railway station on Thursday, the 28th, when he told me he had been disappointed of cover from Waud and Graves, and the amount was overdrawn, but I do not think the amount was mentioned—he said there was some fear about it—that was the first I heard of any danger—he mentioned there had been a connection with a Mr. Wilton which had led to Waud and Graves's proper moneys being taken from the account—I had then no idea of a partnership with Wynn and Wilton, but thought Wynn referred to advances from one firm to another—the credit in the ledger on the 27th March of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was made up of three cheques, one on the Metro<lb></lb>politan Bank for 248<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two on the National Provincial Bank for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 251<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were paid—on 28th March, amongst other notes from Glyn's, we got 20,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes they included the numbers 62342 and '3—they are on Wynn's slip, only the 3 is accidentally transposed with the 2—we also received from Glyn's 25 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, including No. 38203—these two papers L and L 1 show the numbers of the notes that make up the 1, 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 27th we received from Glyn's a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 28121—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 38206, and two 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, Nos. 63242 and '3, are in Wynn's writing—Nos. 38206 and 63243 were amongst consecutive numbers of notes received from Glyn's—those are set against the cheque for 364<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—against another cheque for 293<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., No. 62164, a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, is set—the remaining 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid in gold—the next cheques are for 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 316<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., against which is entered a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 28121, a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 62163, and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 38203, and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cash—the numbers on the paper L1 correspond with those numbers—I got this letter and Wynn's keys from Wynn jointly with Mr. Green on the Saturday, 30th March, it is dated 31st by mistake: "My dear Green and Carter,—I find matters are quite without hope. They must stop. Enclosed you will find my keys. I am quite beside myself. Forgive me. Yours truly, J. R. I. Wynn." I did not see Wynn after that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 1st April I was Sent for to go to the Agra Bank—I got there about 4.30, when Wynn was given into my custody by Mr. Morris—he was charged with stealing 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., moneys of the Agra Bank—on the way to the station he Said "I ought not to be here; they have left me like a stranded ship"—I searched him at the station and found the letters marked "D" and "E". (<hi rend="italic">These were letters from Wynn, one stating that he would come to the bank on</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st of April, the other being addressed "My dear friends," and containing the passage</hi>, "If you can see the position you have placed me in, nothing but the Mansion House, unless I receive the forgiveness of the board.

I went to Crown Court the same evening and took Waud and Graves into custody—Graves said, on going downstairs, "I did not think the bank would take this action"—I and Gilbert took them to the station—I found this pass-book in a desk, the key of which I got from Graves—these fifty-eight cheques, marked "F", were in the pass-book—I also found this memorandum book, marked "G", and a diary, a press copy of a letter in Graves's writing, these articles of partnership between Frank Wilton and Waud and Graves in relation to a "Tourist's Guide" and a "Trade Gazette." and a press copy of two letters, one signed by Waud and the other by Waud and Graves. (<hi rend="italic">The one by the firm was dated</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">and addressed to Mr. F.

The one signed by Waud was dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd March</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">addressed to F.

Can I come in? How are matters? Send a reply by bearer. J. W." There is no date on it—I also found books connected with Wilton and Co.—they are not here.</p>

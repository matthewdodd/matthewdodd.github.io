               <p>Q.Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you laid down? - A. Somewhere about nine o'clock, it was about eleven o'clock or more, when I awoke; I went and searched all the pawnbrokers; I found it in pawn at Mr. Tyler's.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know it by? - A. The chain was part of a woman's scissars-chain; I have the other part of it in my pocket; the bolt of the inside case is broke, the picture on the inside of the out-side case, is the picture of St. Paul; after I had found the watch, I went in search of her, and found her at the Unicorn, in shoreditch; the same evening, I took her to the watch-house, and gave charge of her. (Produces the watch.)</p>

                  </hi>. I was a horsekeeper in the service of Thomas Souter, a brickmaker, in Ball's Pond—he has also a wharf at the basin in the City-road—the prisoner was his carter. On the morning of the 14th, about six o'clock, he came to me for some hay and straw, and said he was to take it to his master's, at Wenlock Wharf—I always gave him hay and straw—he also asked me to let him have some oats—I gave some in a small sack—I did not measure them—there was a bushel, or it might be two bushels—the sack was not full—I was accustomed to give him oats—the sack was dirty, and tied round with a string—it had no mark outside it—he put that in the cart, and said he was going to take it to the wharf for his master's horse for the night—that was the reason I let him have it.</p>

I said that when the bank opened I would pay him. He said "My dear fellow, I will run upstairs and see what the mistress has got," and he lent me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I went to his usual haunts, but could not find him either in Ascot or Windsor. If I had intended a fraud I should have pressed for the whole amount or, at any rate, have forged the cheque for a larger amount. I know nothing of the cheque-book; the witness has been coached up about that.

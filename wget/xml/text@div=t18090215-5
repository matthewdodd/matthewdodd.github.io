            . Q. Were you robbed on the 8th of February last - A. Yes, about ten minutes before six, just this side of <placeName id="t18090215-5-crimeloc20">Chalk farm</placeName>

               <p>Q. What day of the week was it - A. On Thursday last. I was coming along by myself, I heard some people before; I could not see; I came on further, I saw one laid in the road, one next him, and one of the side of him; they were all in the road, I came by them as they were there; one jumped on the path and ran by me, he seemed to have something between his legs, so that I could not see what it was; he sung at the time rumti-de-udledy; he said, Jack, put your hat on, you'll catch cold; that was to one of them behind; then I began to be in fear; I came on, looking over my shoulder, I gained ground upon them; I had not gone many yards before he called out Stop; I took no notice, but went on, looking behind me; he holloaed out Stop, the second time; I kept on my pace as usual, and the third time he holloaed out Stop, the person by the side of the watch box sprang out; they had all three pistols, which they all three cocked against my head; then they demanded my property. I told them I was only a working person, I had nothing to lose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop - A. I was compelled to it, they demanded my property; they said there was no time to be lost; they said they must have it. A person in a great coat pulled out my watch from my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a great coat had he on - A. A light coloured great coat, seemingly to me like a soldier's.</p>
               <p>Q. The man in a light coloured great coat pulled out your watch - A. Yes; having done that, they took hold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150007"></xptr>of me by the shoulders, swung me round, and told me to go back to Hampstead. The same man that had the great coat on took the watch; took a seven shilling piece, two shillings, and a sixpence, from me. I went back; they told me there was a party more in the road, and if they stopped me, to tell them that my business was done, and they would let me go. I went nearly about thirty yards back. I met some gentleman, I said are you going to town; I came to town with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner was one of the three that you saw - A. I think he is by his person, and his dress, and his height, I think he is the person that holloaed out stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at that time make sufficient observation, to be able to speak to him - A. Not further than by his dress; I was in too much fright when I saw the three pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner at the bar - A. On Friday, in the same dress that he is in now. When I came down the road, at the pound, I saw some of the gentlemen of Bow street. I told them what happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen any of your property - A. There is a sixpence in the hands of Mr. Frost, which I think is the same I had, but I cannot swear to it. I never saw the watch afterwards.</p>

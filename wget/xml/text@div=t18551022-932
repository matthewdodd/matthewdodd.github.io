I saw him on the morning of 25th Aug. about half past 7 o'clock, or a quarter before 8 o'clock—I delivered to him two half sovereigns and a sixpence to get me a money order, payable to Mr. H. E. Hartley, No. 11, Welbeck-street, Cavendish<lb></lb>square—I gave him the money to get the money order, and send it by the next post—I gave him this card as a direction for the money order—he undertook to do it for me, and he was to have 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his trouble—the sixpence was 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for himself, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay the money order with—</p>

About 26th Aug., I expected a small remittance from him, and not receiving that, I wrote to him on Monday, 3rd Sept—these pieces produced formed part of the letter that I wrote on that occasion—I addressed it to Mr. Pestle—I put the letter in the post myself, I think between 8 and 11 o'clock—on the 5th, Mr. Pestle came to my place, and I had a conversation with him on the subject of those letters—I did not find either of the letters at that time—the letter that I put in the post was in an envelope—it was an old enve<lb></lb>lope that had been used before, and that it might be secure I put two small wafers in it and pressed them down—I addressed it to Mr. Pestle, at Colonel Carpenter's, Potter's-bar, Middlesex.</p>

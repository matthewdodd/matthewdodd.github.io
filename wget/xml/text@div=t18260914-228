The prisoner was in my service, and left it in August; I did not go over the stock - but on Tuesday, the 5th of September, the officer called to know if I could identify any of these things - I am sure they are all mine- I have the remains of the same articles.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS Q. If they had been sold you would have had the remainder? A. Yes; I considered the prisoner a highly respectable young man, and we parted very good friends; if a servant wants any article, it is cut off by another person, and placed to his account. - Here is one piece of ribbon, which I can swear had not been cut - there were eighteen yards of it; he has twelve yards, and I have six - I had been at Margate. He did not say that I had had a very bad business, and he had cut off these goods to make it appear better.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and I live in Whitecross-street. On the night of the 4th of September the prisoner came to my shop with a piece of linen, which he offered for 2s. a yard; he said, he wished to sell it as he was going into the country - he said, he got it from a man in Houndsditch; I told Hanley, and while I was talking to him, he came back again and was taken, he said, his name was Thomas Smith.</p>

            . I produce these articles; I took a key out of the prisoner's pocket, and took these articles out of his box, at No. 127, Wood-street, Cheapside - I found two handkerchiefs in his breeches pocket; he told me he lived at No. 9, Wood-street; and that he bought the linen in Houndsditch, - that he had bought the handkerchiefs, but could not tell where - I found a direction in his pocket of the name of Jones - I asked him if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140107"></xptr>that was his name; he then said, it was; I found in his desk a letter, directed to Mr. Hadley, Woolwich; I told him there were a great number of articles found in his box at Mr. Nicholls' - he said, he had bought them at different places.</p>
               <p>JURY to Mr. HADLEY. Q. Was there any entry made in your books of these things to his own account? No; he left me about the 20th of August.</p>

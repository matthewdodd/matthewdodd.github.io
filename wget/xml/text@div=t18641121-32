I am a clerk and book-keeper, residing at Mary's-road, Lambeth—I have known Wright since about 1848, and De Witt since January, 1864—Wright brought me up from Liverpool in May to go into his service—De Witt used to come to the office, and they were frequently there together—"J. Stuart &amp; Co." was painted up over the office by Wright's directions—they remained there about two months, and we went to Crutched Friars in September, where "J.

Smith, Payne, and Smith, as to John Stuart &amp; Co. of Manchester—I went to Smith, Payne, and Smith, and inquired about the respectability of the house—I sold De Witt wines two or three days afterwards to the amount of 2,107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first transaction was concluded on 2nd September—I gave De Witt delivery orders and warrants—I believe that was on the last day of September—it was as soon as the transaction was closed, and two or three days after that, which would be September 4 or 5—De Witt brought the bill in question to me with other bills, and told me to, draw for the balance, 562<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on John Stuart &amp; Co.</p>

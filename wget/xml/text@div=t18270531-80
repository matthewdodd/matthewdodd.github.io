            . I am the prosecutrix's son-in-law, and slept with her on this night; I awoke when my mother was coming to bed, and saw the prisoner with my mother's pockets in her hand; I had been in bed about two hours; she asked my mother where she should lay them; my mother said at the bed head, and I saw her lay them there in about two minutes; I saw her rather rumpling about them; she went up to bed. On the Sunday, about nine o'clock, she went out, and about eleven or twelve my mother sent me to Mrs. Davidson's - I returned, and saw the prisoner, and said, "You have not been to Mrs. Davidson's;" she said she had - I said she had not; she said I was a liar. I said the things in the bundle she had bought with my mother's money, and that Mrs. Davidson had not moved; she said she had. We set out to go to King-street - she wanted to go to the smack, but I would not let her. I went to No. 23, King-street, where she said Davidson had moved to, but could not find her - I then called the prisoner a thief, and said she had stolen my mother's money; she told me to hold my tongue, and asked my mother into a public-house, and she would tell her all about it; she told my mother to give me a penny to get some cakes - I went out, but stood by the door, and heard her say the servant had given her 2l. of the money, which she bought the things in the band-box with; my mother called in the landlord; I said I dared to say there were more things at the smack; she went to the door, to prevent my going out - I got out of the window, went to the smack, and got a trunk full of clothes, a piece of linen, and a shawl; I showed them to the prisoner - the officer asked if she had the key of the box - she produced it, and he opened it, in her presence; there was some linen, a new hat, and other things in it. I had been on board the smack before with the prisoner. There were two sovereigns, 7s. 6d., and 7d. in copper in the box.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On Sunday, the 29th of April, Mrs. Ayer called me into the Ship and Green Dargon public-house; the prisoner was in the passage - Ayer gave her in charge, and said she had robbed her of a 10l. note; she said she had not, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310052"></xptr>Martha Taylor had robbed her of it. Wallace delivered a box to me, which I took to the prisoner, whom I had left in custody in Maidenhead-court, and asked if it was hers - she said it was, and gave me the key from her pocket; I opened it, and found two sovereigns, 7s. 6d., 7d. in copper, and a quantity of linen-drapery; I left Cromarly to examine it - she had a hand-box in her hand, with a Leghorn bonnet, six yards of cotton, and a new gown - she said Taylor had bought it her, and if I could find Taylor I should find eight sovereigns about her, as she had given her two - she was dressed in a Scotch cloak- I do not think it was a new one. I apprehended Taylor on the Monday.</p>

            . I have been more than eight years in Mrs. Ayer's service. On the night in question I took the prisoner's child up to bed, as she complained she was so much in liquor, she could not carry it - she was in mistress' bed-room when I went in, and when I came back she was sitting by mistress' bed-side; mistress called me down to look for the tinder-box, and I went up-stairs directly. I slept with the prisoner - I went up to bed in ten minutes; she had then undressed her child, but laid on the bed, pretending to be tipsy; I undressed her, and when I got her into bed I pulled down the quilt, and found a sovereign and a dice on it; I laid them on the mantel-piece, and in the morning, when I got up, I found a Duke of York's medal on the floor; I took them all down to mistress before she got out of bed; my mistress afterwards asked her if she had got the 10l. note, and said if she would give it her she would forgive her - she at last laid all the blame on me. I never had a farthing of the money, or ever gave her a farthing in my life. I never bought her any thing.</p>

               <p>The prisoner delivered a Defence in a very inaudible tone, the substance of which was, that both she and the prosecutrix were intoxicated; and she supposed her child must have taken the sovereign up to the bed-room in its hand.</p>
               <p>MRS. AYER re-examined. I lent her the things, because her husband had left her without a penny - I kept her and her child in victuals and drink for nine weeks, because she had no money. My house is in the parish of St. George.</p>

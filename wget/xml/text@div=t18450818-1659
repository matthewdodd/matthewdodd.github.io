I was in the habit of sending him to work for other persons and if they paid him he was to bring the money home to me—this was a job of his own getting—he had worked for this lady before, and he said to me, "An old lady is anxious for me to do a job, and if I do it, it must be on my own account, and in my own name, she will have nothing to do with any nurseryman"—he said she was an old lady, whose brother was an invalid, and it was not convenient for her to pay only once a quarter, and then I was to make out the bill, and he was to take it—it was my money, and it was the prisoner's duty to pay it to me—I am sure of that—if she paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 28th of Feb. he has not given me that—if she paid him 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 31st of March, or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 31st of May, he has not paid me them—he ought to have paid me all three sums.</p>

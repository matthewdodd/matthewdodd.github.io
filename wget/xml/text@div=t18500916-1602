                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, in the employ of Mrs. Catherine Mor<lb></lb>rison, a builder, of Denby-street, Pimlico. We had some barges of bricks at Mr. Cubitt's wharf, Thames-bank—they ought to have been delivered from the barges, 500 into each cart—we employed Charles Innes, a contractor, to deliver the bricks at Elliott's-park—Marks was in Mr. Innes's employ—I received some information; I knew there was a load of bricks missing—I went to Luscombe's yard, and found 500 bricks there, worth about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took one brick as a sample—the prisoner Luscombe works for his brother, who is a builder.</p>

I assisted in tracing these bricks—I found them about eight o'clock in the evening, on the 22nd Aug.—they had been missed two or three hours before—in about twenty minutes the prisoner Luscombe came—I was on the watch and spoke to him before he got to the house—I asked him if he had had any bricks delivered on his pre<lb></lb>mises that day—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you paid for any?"—he said, "No, I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station-house—when I got there Marks was there, and he said, "That is the young man that asked me to leave the bricks"—Luscombe said he knew nothing about it—Marks said, "Yes, you asked me to leave them; a female gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I was to have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more the next day"—Luscombe said, "I remember seeing you leave the bricks; some female gave you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I do not know who ordered you to leave them."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>).

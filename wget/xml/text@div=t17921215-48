               <p>Q. How much was in that pattern? - About three quarters of a yard; there was originally six yards of it; I had my private mark on it; I took the prisoner before a magistrate, and swore to my mark there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your mark is very near the end? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q If any person had been indiscreet enough to match it in your shop, could they not have cut that mark off with great ease? - They certainly could have done that.</p>
               <p>Q. How much would they have wasted? - About half an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. So that this young woman with your mark on it brought it to your shop, I observe gentlemen, (of the Jury) you do not think it needful for me to put another question if I don't misread you.</p>

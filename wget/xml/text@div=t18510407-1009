                  </hi>. I am an inmate of Camberwell Workhouse. The prisoner was a nurse there—on 25th March I went into the ward where the prisoner and the children were—the deceased child, Henry Greenaway, was then suffering from diarrhoea—he was about two years old—he had been taken from his mother, in consequence of being ill—she came to see him that day—she asked the prisoner to give him some tea—she gave him a little drop, and he cried for more—she would not give him any more, but hit him a blow in the back with her double fist—the mother was not present then—the prisoner put him into bed, and he went to sleep—it was then between three and four in the afternoon (I was sent there because the other wards were so full, not as nurse)—I slept close by him at night—he was very restless, and awoke frequently—there were five children in his bed—he slept in the middle—he got out of bed and fell over two of the children, and knocked his forehead against the iron of my bedstead—I then took him from the ground—in about five minutes the prisoner came and took him—I said, "Let me have the child"—she said I should not have him, she took him from me, and threw him back to his own bed, saying, "You little villain, lie there!"—I said, "You will kill that poor</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of Camberwell Workhouse, and have been employed as nurse for five years; the deceased was under my care—the prisoner was sent to be nurse to eight children; he was one of them—I was sent for by Bailey, and found him in convulsions—I examined him, and found a black bruise on his forehead—I sent for the head nurse—the child died the same night—two days before, the surgeon came to see the ward, and asked the prisoner how the child was—she said it was better, and a few hours afterwards this happened—I slept in the next room on the Wednesday night—I used to hear the children cry, but never thought anything of it—I never heard any beating.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner Q.</hi> Were not the two bedsteads pushed together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: the heads were against the wall—a bolster goes along the wall, the length of the bed; it covers the iron—there was just space between the bed where Bailey slept and the other to pass between them.</p>

                  </hi> I am surgeon in Camberwell Workhouse. I was called to see the deceased—he was just recovering from a fit of con<lb></lb>vulsions—(I had seen him two days previous, and had directed remedies for a very slight diarrhoea, and he had a slight eruption on the head of no</p>

               <p>importance)—he was in a state of considerable excitement and fever; the skin was very hot—there were several livid marks on the forehead and tide of the head and face—both arms were covered with bruises and livid marks—there was a contusion on the upper part of the chest on the left side, also a severe bruise on the lower part of the abdomen and the pubis, and several bruises on the anterior and internal part of both thighs—both legs were covered with livid marks, and there were some trifling bruises on the top, and a slight scratch on the back of the head, an abrasion; the skin was broken; it was not bleeding then, it might have bled—he died a short time afterwards—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; the brain was healthy, but there were five or six ounces of blood extravasated on the back-part of the head—a severe blow on the front of the head would have caused that quantity of extravasated blood at the back—I do not think it would be caused by the bruises on the front of the head themselves; they teemed to be simply pinches—I think if the child had been thrown on the back of its head on a hard substance, that would account for the extravasated blood—I have seen the bolster in the workhouse—if the child was thrown with great violence upon one of them, it might perhaps account for the coagulated blood—after a shock of that kind, the child would appear drowsy and stupified—all the other parts of the body were healthy—in my judgment, the cause of death was the rupture of a blood-vessel, caused by the child being thrown violently against the bed, and striking its head against a hard substance—none of the other bruises would account for death, they might accelerate the circulation a little; that would be merely accessary.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The child fell out of bed five times on Wednesday morning, and fell on its head each time; it was not sleeping on the double bedstead, but on the single one when it fell.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose dwelling is that - is it your's exclusively? - A. I am the only person who resides in it, except my own domestic servants.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 5th of November last, did any thing happen to that house? - A. On the night of the 5th of November, I was in the office till near eleven o'clock, the clerks had quitted their office about nine o'clock; when the clerks had quitted their office, I was sitting in my office with the door open, and my groom came in, from the door in Tudor-street, to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the door fastened? - A. I heard the door shut, and the groom came in, and had some conversation with Mr. Le Blanc; I heard Mr. Le Blanc go out, and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. He went out at the door in Bridge-street? - A. Yes; I went to bed about half past eleven o'clock, I got up the next morning about half past seven o'clock, when I received some information; I went into my own office, and found the uppermost drawer on the right-hand side of the desk broken open, the lock had been attempted to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090014"></xptr>forced, and the mahogany that the lock was fastened to had been cut out; they had forced it open by a poker, or some such instrument, and in that part of the mahogany that had been forced away I found this screw, (producing it); I observed on my desk a number of papers that were in the drawer when I went to bed the preceding night; on my examining the drawer, I missed the several articles mentioned in the indictment, and some others.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen this drawer the night before? - A. Yes, I had only occasion to pay money out of the drawer; I had left it locked the preceding night with these articles in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a miniature picture set in gold, a pocket compass, a leather bag, and a canvas bag? - A. Yes, and eleven half-guineas; there were more seven-shilling pieces than the number in the indictment, but I am not really certain how many.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there any crown-pieces? - A. Yes, and half-crowns, and about three pounds in shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a French crown? - A. Yes, and French half-crowns, and there was a foreign coin that passes in the East-Indies, called a Macarony.</p>
               <p>Q. Any Bills of Exchange? - A. One of 3007 l. 8 s. 11 d. another for 500 l. another for 434 l. 14 s. another for 100 l. another for 25 l. one for 500 l. and another for 360 l.; three Bank-notes of five pounds each, and two of two pounds each; a great number of one-pound notes, and certainly more than is in the indictment, and one note of twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property were these? - A. The whole of these bills, notes, and cash, were my exclusive property, except five shillings in silver, and a twenty-pound note; and there were two Bills of Exchange, one for 3007 l. 8 s. 11 d. and one for 500 l. were the property of Mr.

               <p>Q. Do not mistake me; I am not asking you of your either being in or out of the house; have you seen him seldom or frequently? - A. Very seldom, I take it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Only going by two or three times a week, and taking a glass of wine? - A. Sometimes I rode by two or three times a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect you are upon your oath, and do not give your evidence in this slovenly way.

I rode by there two or three times a week, but not drank there every time I rode by,</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you swear it just now; you should mind what you say? - A. I know what I say very well.</p>

               <p>Q. You would not have gone at all but upon her solicitation? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the cook, or you, any opportunity of going there on other Sundays? - A. No.</p>

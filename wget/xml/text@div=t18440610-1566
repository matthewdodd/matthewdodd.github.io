                  </hi>. I live at No. 29, North-street, Lisson-grove, and go out as a waiter. I have the house in trust under the prisoner's mother's will—the prisoner was jointly to have the property when it is out of debt—he is nineteen years old—on the 3rd of June he was in the parlour with me about five o'clock, and left soon after five—these four coats are my own—the Nor<lb></lb>wich crape belonged to my wife, who is dead—the spoons are my own—the two watches were under my care for the prisoner—he did not return at all—I went out to attend a dinner, and returned about half-past eleven—the parlour where he slept was locked—I went up to my bed-room, found a false key in the door, found the drawer and nine more locks broken open, and missed the articles stated—I have found the four coats, a shawl, and Norwich crape.</p>

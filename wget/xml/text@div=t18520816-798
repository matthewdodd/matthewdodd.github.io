                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and live in Long Acre. On Saturday, 24th July, between 8 and 9 o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my house, and two other persons—the prisoner asked for a quartern of gin—I served him—he tendered in payment a counterfeit half crown—I examined it, found it was bad, and returned it to him—he said, "I know where I took it," and he put it into his waistcoat pocket—he gave me a good half crown—I took two shillings from behind, placed it on the counter, and turned to the copper till to give him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and while I was doing that the two shillings had disappeared—I put down the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he said, "Do you call that the proper change out of a half crown for a quartern of gin?"—I said, "Certainly not; but I gave you your change, my good man"—on his denying it, one of the other two persons that were there said to him in an under tone, "You took up the two shillings, and put them in your waistcoat pocket"—I then said, "I will see what you are made of," and called a policeman—the prisoner and his companions then rushed out at another door into the street—when the prisoner came out I seized him and gave him to the policeman—the others got away.</p>

            . On the 29th of March between 8 and 9 at night, Lupton, Flack, and I went out to see what we could get. Flack carried us to Mr. Wheeler's house in Denmark-Court, and said it was a brave chance if we could but nail it. The Prisoner pull'd open the winder-shutters, and somebody coming by, we were obliged to keep at a distance for a little while till they were gone, and then I push'd up the sash window, and endeavour'd to take down the blinds, but I not being able to do it, Flack said he would get in, or the Devil should have it, and accordingly he unbolted the blind and put it on 2 bureau, and he brought out a silver pint pot, a silver quart cup, a pepper box and a punch ladle, and put them into my lap. I stood a-cross the window at the same time, and Lupton was standing at the end of the court to tip him Peter. When we had got all these things, a child came out of a chandler's shop with a candle, and that surpriz'd us so much that we let a spoon drop on the floor, and we never staid to take it up, but ran into the Strand, where we took coach and drove to

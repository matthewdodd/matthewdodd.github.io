                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in William-street, Pimlico. The prisoner lodged in the same room for about a week—on the 28th of July I went to bed at about a quarter after ten o'clock—I looked at my money—I had one sovereign, one shilling, and two sixpences—I marked the sovereign with my teeth, as I had suspicion of him—I had missed nothing—I tied my money up in my pocket-handkerchief, and put it into my coat-pocket, in a chair by my bed-side—I did not hear the pri<lb></lb>soner come home that night, but the next morning I got up about half-past five o'clock—my handkerchief was on my hat "on the table—I searched my pocket, and the money was gone—I said nothing to the prisoner, but went and told the landlord—he came to the bed-room with me—I accused the prisoner of robbing me—he said I was a d—d liar, he was as likely to have a sovereign as me—I said, "Will you allow me to look?"—he said yes, for he had nothing—I took the sovereign out of his trowsers'-pocket—I would swear to it—I told the landlord to wait—I got an officer, and gave him in charge—the shilling was found in his other pocket, at the station-house—we went back, and found one of the sixpences inside the bed-clothes, where he had been lying.</p>

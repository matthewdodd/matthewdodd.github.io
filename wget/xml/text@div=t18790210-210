                  </hi>. I am a trimming manufacturer of Clapham—I had business transactions with the prisoner, but not personally—he owed me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 14th December, and tendered me this crossed cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by Gudalga and payable to Witsenhausen—he said it was all right—I took it and sent it to Mr. Stobbold, to whom I owed some money, got the change from him, and gave it to the prisoner—I afterwards endorsed it at Mr. Stobbold's request—I knew the drawer—I was afterwards given in custody for issuing the cheque and went with Stobbold to Mr. Gudalga's house, but only saw Mrs. Gudalga—I was subsequently discharged—the prisoner said that he was angry about the cheque being crossed, and asked me to change it, and if not he would take it away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. You told me a few days before that you were expecting 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I came to the City expressly on that day for the purpose of getting the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the club in the morning—you told me you had no money then, but expected some to be brought at 12 o'clock, and asked me to go to your place at 12 o'clock, but I said that I preferred that you should bring the money to my place—it was 4 o'clock when you came to see me; you told me you had no money then, but you had a cheque, and produced it and said, before I knew the amount of it, that you were going to the West End to get change for it, and I. said that if you went to the club you would accompany me—I introduced you to my wife and showed you over my house—I did not make you wait as much as two hours, saying that I was engaged—you said that it was then too late to go to the West End to get the cheque cashed, but you would go to-morrow and I should have my 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we then went out together, and then for the first time I asked you for what sum the cheque was, and you showed it to me for the first time, and I said "It is very late to go to the West to cash it," and seeing that it was drawn by Gudalga I offered to pay it to my manufacturer—you did not ask how long it would take before the cheque would come in for payment going through two or three different hands, nor did I say that if it was not crossed it would be payable at once—I do not remember you saying that you were very vexed that it was crossed—we are both in the leather trade, and I have obliged you—we had spoken of your living with us and paying 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—you did not owe me the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. originally, somebody else did, and you took the debt upon yourself—you were arrested 10 days after giving me the cheque, and in the interval I saw you two or three times a day, but did not know then that the cheque was forged—when you were arrested you offered to pay the cab fare and take the officer to the man you had the cheque from, and you offered at once to go to Victoria Street to get the money to pay the amount—I have not said to Stobbold that you are the person who crossed the cheque.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The prisoner did not lead me to suppose that he wanted me to keep the cheque in my hands—he took over the greatest part of the debt of a friend, and he had goods too, but not before I received the cheque—the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was partly a debt from another person and partly due for goods—I did not have the prisoner arrested.</p>

               <p>Road—I have had dealings with Mr. Hirsch, and he owed me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 14th December he offered me this cheque and I gave him the change and a receipt for his bill—a few days afterwards I asked him to endorse the cheque because it was returned marked "No account"—I went with him to the drawer's house, and afterwards went with the prisoner—he said at first that he took the cheque from Gudalga, and afterwards from Mr. Sidovre, at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. You made both those statements; you said that it was a good cheque of Mr. Gudalga's, and I think you gave me to understand that you received it from Mr. Sidovre—I cannot say that Mr. Hirsch seemed surprised at that—you begged me to go with you in a cab at your expense to Sidovre's; you said that you would pay for my lost time, and entreated me to do so—I did not do it because the case was out of my hands—I asked you to go to Queen Victoria Street to pay the cheque, and that was refused.</p>

I am manager of the London Trading Bank, Limited—they issued this form—Gudalga and Co. have no account there—the cheque came to us through the Central Bank, and I marked it "No account"—the cheque-book of which this is one was issued to Messrs, Fournier, who opened an account with us, and the junior partner was Mr. T. Sidovre, who is like the prisoner, but they are not the same person—the account was opened on 9th November and closed on 4th December at our request.</p>

I did not swear to your being Mr. Sidovre; he is taller than you, and has curly hair and a yellowish face—he did not look as if he came from Spain—this cheque is not his writing—one other cheque has been presented coming from the same book as this, but I do not know who it was signed by; we have about one cheque every day which we have to mark "No effects."</p>

I should have given it to you, or if you had sent me a telegram asking for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I know several people who would have given you similar sums if you had asked them—this signature is like mine, but not like my private signa<lb></lb>ture—you led a very simple, quiet life—I often came to your house in the evening and found you at home—I do not know Sidovre.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

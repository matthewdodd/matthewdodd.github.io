                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 87.) On the evening of the 27th of April I received information, and watched the premises of Mr. Herring, in Trinity-street, Southwark—about half-past seven o'clock I saw the workman leaving and saw the prisoners coming out with the others—they went down Trinity-street—I followed them down several streets to the Waterloo-road—I noticed White had something bulky about his person—he had a jacket on, and walked heavily—I called Brown—I stopped White, and saw something fall from Williams—I took White to the station, and found this lead on his per<lb></lb>son inside his trowsers, suspended to a belt round his loins, and there were two nails to fix it to the belt—I found on him a knife, some money, and a key.</p>

I was on the spot, and Golder called my attention—I saw the two prisoners—I took hold of William at the corner of Baron's-building—I said, "You have some property about you that does not belong to you"—he unbuttoned his flap, and this piece of lead fell from him—I called a boy who took it up, it weight 38lbs.—the piece found on White weight 34lbs.—Williams had a belt.</p>

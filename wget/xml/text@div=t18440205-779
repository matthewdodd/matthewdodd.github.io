                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 137.) On 4th Jan. I was on duty in High-street, Deptford, and saw the prisoner walking up and down High-street—he stopped at the corner of Union-street, by Mr. Goodwin's shop, and Isaw him take this print down from inside the shop—I followed him and found it on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He saw me take it from a female's hand, a Miss Grey, who owed me some money; she said she would go to Mr. Goodwin's, get a shawl on trust, as she had done before, pledge it, and pay me part of what she owed me. I begged of the officer to go into the shop, as the lady was there thai gave it me, but he would not. I was very tipsy. She brought it to the door and gave it into my hand. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, I did not see any female, or anybody but the prisoner—I was noticing him for five minutes before—there were two or three pieces hanging there—he felt the quality of each, and took this off the line, put it under bis coat and walked across the road nearly to where I was standing in the dark—he appeared quite sober—he did not ask me to go</p>

I am an up<lb></lb>holsterer at Speilinghurst, near Tonbridge-wells; I came to Deptford for some money owing to me. The inspector sent the policeman out, he was away two hours, and when he returned he said there was such a person in the New-town, but he could not find her; an officer there said he could find her directly. The officer speaks very falsely; I received the shawl from Miss Grey's hand.</p>

               <p>Q. He came to your house on the 29th of December, about what time - A. About six o'clock in the evening, and about seven o'clock the prisoner went to bed. I locked the door, and went out to a little needle, and between ten and eleven o'clock I returned. I found the door broken open, and the lock broken off, and on my looking round, I missed the things out of the apartment; a bed, a bolster, a sheet, a blanket, two quilts, the bed furniture, a gown, two linen petticoats, and one flannel petticoat. All these things were in my apartment when I went out. Part of them things were afterwards found at Mrs. Treadaway's, by the officers, Brown and Butler.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell office. On the 6th of January, I went to Mrs. Treadaway's. I took Wasko up on Mrs. Lindsay's charge. Mrs. Castle came before the magistrate. She said, Wasko was the person that broke out of the house. Wasko then said, before the magistrate, that the woman might have the things again. He acknowledged the several robberies he had committed. He acknowledged this, and told us where to go and fetch the things. I found the things where he told me at Mrs. Treadaway's. As soon as I went into Mrs. Treadaway's shop, the prosecutrix told me that Mrs. Treadaway had got her gown on her back, and looking over some flannel petticoats in the shop, Mrs. Castle pointed out one of her flannel petticoats, in the shop. We searched about the shop. I found this bed furniture in the shop; and locked up in a box in the cupboard in the back room, we found two white petticoats. The prosecutrix said, one of the petticoats had some lace on. I told Mrs. Treadaway, I had found the petticoat, and she must give me the lace. She said, she could not tell me where it was; at last, she pulled it out of her pocket. In the cupboard, I found the piece of old blanket. Then she sent her niece out in the yard; she fetched in a quilt in a wet state. It was hanging out to dry I asked her how she came by them. She said, she had bought them of a man, he said he took them away from a girl's house that had made away with above seventy pounds of his money. I told Mrs. Treadaway she had done wrong in buying these things; some of them were new. I said, how came you to buy them of such a man. She said, she had bought of him three times; she did not know what she was buying of; it was early in the morning, hardly light; she did not know but what they were old things until she came to look at them in the day. Wasko said, she gave fifteen shillings for them. She said she did not give so much. Butler was with me all the time.</p>
               <p>Wasko's Defence. I have slept in the house, and I have lost seventy-five pounds there.</p>

               <p>Treaddway's Defence The first thing I ever bought of him was two sailor's jackets. He told me he need not sell his clothes, but a woman had robbed him of seventeen pounds; and the second time he came was about ten days after.</p>

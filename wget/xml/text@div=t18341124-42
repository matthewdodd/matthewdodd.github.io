                  </hi>. I live at North Minims. I was at the Alderman's Arms, Enfield, on the 20th of October, about six o'clock—I had a coat, which I took into the house, and when I had done my business, I told my son to put it into my cart—I saw the two prisoners there, and Scambler, who is not in custody—they were drinking together—they asked me to give them some beer, which I did—I afterwards missed my font, and had them taken—this is my coat.</p>

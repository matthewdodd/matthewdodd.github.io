On the 13th of April I was drinking at the Maidenhead public-house - I came out for a short time, and was sick; I sat down, and saw the prisoner there - he offered me help, and advised me to give him my watch to take into the bar, or perhaps I should be robbed of it; I did not give it him - he unbuttoned my waistcoat, and said by getting the air I should be relieved: he then unbuttoned the band of my trousers: I looked down, and saw my watch hanging, (I believe.) by a button; I grasped at it, but he was too active - he got it, and handed it to another person, who got off; I seized the prisoner, took him into the house, and charged him with stealing it - he opened his waistcoat, and pleaded innocence; he said he was not the man - he then attempted to run away, but he did not escape my notice; I saw an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. When was this? A. On Tuesday afternoon - I am sure it was not Monday; I believe I had drank a small glass of gin at another public-house in the morning - I might have some porter at eleven o'clock; we had some ale at the Maidenhead - this happened between four and five o'clock; the ale had not impaired my intellects - I went into a corner which was parted off; I did not sit down in the fifth, there is a stone on which I sat - I was almost asleep when he aroused me; I looked at my watch after he came up - I was not in such a state that I did not know whether I had my watch; he came to me two or three times - I was not asleep, I was heavy.</p>

            . I saw the prosecutor on the 13th of April, against the Maidenhead - I saw the prisoner take something out of his pocket and give it to another, but what I cannot say; the other ran away - the prosecutor seized the prisoner, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do? A. Nothing -I did not go after the young man who ran off; he turned too quick for me - I did not see the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, but I saw it against the band of his breeches; I think he was unbuttoning it.</p>

On the 10th of November last, in consequence of suspicion, I, accompanied with Mr. Armstrong, sent for the prisoner into the house. We charged her with having robbed me of paper; I had missed a quire in the forenoon; she denied it; the officer and myself, together with the prisoner, then went to her apartment, and between the bed-clothes found two quires of this paper: it was of the same sort that I had been telling out and making up in the forenoon: I missed only one quire.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quire worth. - A. Nine pence. The prisoner was taken to the office: she there said she hoped I would be favourable to her, as it was the first time.</p>

            . I live with my father: he works for Mr. Arnold. I saw the prisoner in Mr. Arnold's mill: she looked about her, and then took a quire of paper off the bundle of paper where my master was telling it out: she put it before her, and went out with it. I went home, and told my aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Arnold. From whom did you receive any information of this. - A. From the reputed grandmother of this child: the prisoner and all of them were in my employ.</p>

            . On Friday the 10th of November, I went to Mr. Arnold's house. I then went into the workshop, and brought the prisoner out, and told her the charge: she said she was innocent, and knew nothing about it. I then said,</p>
               <p>'Mrs. Connor, I will go and search your room.' I went with Mr. Arnold and the prisoner: she unlocked the door, and in the bed-clothes I found these two quires. I believe she said before the magistrate it was her first offence, and hoped Mr. Arnold would forgive her.</p>

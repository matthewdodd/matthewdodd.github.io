I wish I bad the chance"—he asked me if my father blotted the cheques or not t—I said, "That is quite immaterial"—after I had written the second one, he said, "You can practice on all the cheques, to make sure"—the first one I wrote, I spelt "forty" wrong, and then I wrote another—he called for the blotting-paper, and then I gave him the cheque—it was white blotting-paper—Geeson went out with the cheque, and we were to meet him in Bishopsgate Street—I walked down Alderman's Walk by myself—I afterwards saw Geeson coming with one of the banker's clerks—I then turned back again and went down Alderman's Walk—I saw Crane in the evening, at his brother's house, in Lower Marsh, Lambeth—I asked him if he had seen anything of Geeson—he said, "Yes; I saw him twice; he nudged my arm three times as he was going along"—when we had tea, we went up stairs; I took out the cheque-book and said to Crane, "Will you put this in your trunk for me?"—his brother was up in the room with us—Crane said he would burn the book, and he put it in the front of his drawer till he came back—I believe it was afterwards burnt—I left it there, and have not seen it since—I heard that Geeson was in custody on the Tuesday evening—my father spoke to me on Wednesday morning, and I went to Mr. Mullens and gave myself up—Crane was taken soon after; he was standing outside the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at a coffee house, at 3, Camomile Street, City—it is kept by Mrs. Tomlin—on Tuesday, 17th November, I saw Geeson there with two others—I don't know who they were—they stayed about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I took them a pen and ink and blotting paper—after they had left, someone came and made some inquiry, and I gave them this piece of blotting paper which they had used.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>.) On Wednesday morning, 18th Novem<lb></lb>ber, I was at Mr. Mullens' office, 68, Cheapside—Crane and Bagot were there—Crane said that he was at his brother's house, in company with Bagot, the night before, and his brother was present—he also said, "Bagot took from his pocket a cheque-book, and said, 'Take care of this cheque-book for me; my brother said, 'You sha'n't leave it here, I will have nothing to do with it;' Bagot said 'Then I will burn it,' and handed me the cheque-book, and I put it on the fire."</p>

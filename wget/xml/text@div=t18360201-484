                  </hi>. My brother William is a linen-draper, and lives in Shafts<lb></lb>bury-terrace, Pimlico. The prisoner was his shopman, for nearly four years—on the 7th of February, I had occasion to go to my bed-room, which leads through his, and saw him come into the room with a parcel under his arm—he went to his box, by his bed-side—he put his hand into his pocket for the key and unlocked his box—I said, "How long shall you be in the room! for I will wait for the key of the room, and take it down"—he said, "shall not be many minutes," and he unlocked the cupboard and threw the parcel in—I locked the door, and came down stairs—I told my niece what had taken place—my brother spoke to him in my presence—he brought the parcel into the counting-house—took the books up stairs, and asked the prisoner, how it was no entry was made of the parcel, and said, he was going to take it home that evening to show it to his mother, and if she approved of it, he should enter it next day—there was a bill of the articles in the parcel, and on it was written, "Paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—I said, "Who have you paid this 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to?—he said, "I have paid it to nobody; it means nothing"—we searched his boxes, and found a silk handkerchief, a towel, a pair of half hose, and a pair of drawers—he said, he believed, those things were paid for, but he did not know who to.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the dining-room, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 1st of February—my daughter brought down the cloth and lawn, in a parcel—I opened it and took it up stairs to the counting-house—I called in the prisoner, and asked what he meant by taking goods out of the shop without having them entered—I said, "I fear this is not the first time you have done this; I have long suspected you, and at last have caught you"—he said, "It is the first time I did it, and I only intended to show it to my mother"—I said, "What did you cut it from?"—he said, "From a piece at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard"—I asked what he meant by the bill, with 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid, and said, "To whom have you paid the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

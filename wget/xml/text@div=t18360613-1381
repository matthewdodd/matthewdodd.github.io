                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 24th of May I was on duty in Battersea-fields about half-past one o'clock in the morning, and saw the three prisoners in Sleaford-street, Battersea-fields all together going towards the prosecutor's house—about then minutes after that, I saw Swinford stand<lb></lb>ing at the back of the prosecutor's house—I asked him what he was standing there for—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183606130007"></xptr>
               <p>said he had been to Greenwich fair, and got drunk and lost his way—asked him where he came from—he said from Chelsea—I asked him where his two companions were gone—he said he had bees asleep, and did not know where they were gone—I directed him to Chelsea, and he went on—about twenty minutes after that, I was at the top of New-street, Battersea-fields within about twenty yards of the prosecutor's house, and heard a call—I immediately ran to the place and found the three prisoners walking along the road together, in quite a contrary direction to where I had directed Swinford—I asked them where they came from—Brown said, "From Lambeth"—Swinford immediately ran away, and I took the other two into custody—I saw something under Hawkins coat which appeared a lump at his breast—I asked him what it was—he said it was key of his box—I put my hand in his pocket and took out a lot of keys—as I was taking the keys from him, I saw Brown throw something away—that was in the high-road—there are no houses near—there is a pale-fence and a hedge—he threw it into the hedge—when we got about sixty yards they said they would go no further—part of what Brown threw fell on one side of the hedge, and part on the other—I saw the police sergeant pick up one spoon, and Pace picked up another on one side of the hedge afterwards—I could not see what Brown threw away at the time, but it jingled like spoons or keys—I got assistance when they refused to go further, and took them—as they were sitting down, after throwing the things away, I saw some<lb></lb>thing in Hawkin's hand—I asked him what it was—he said it was a bit of rag—I took it from him, and it was a piece of candle wrapped in piece of rag—I asked Brown if he had any thing about him—he said he had not, but he would not be searched, he would go to station-house—I took him to the station-house with assistance, and searched him there, and found on him a pack of cards, a lucifer-box, three combs, a hand<lb></lb>vice four skeleton keys a latch-key, a handkerchief and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—he said he had found them all tied up together in a handkerchief lying in the road—when I first saw the three prisoners together they all hand their shoes on, and when I took them into custody, Hawkins had no shoes on, and Brown had only one shoe on—I afterwards apprehended Swinford on the 28th of May and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a pocket-knife on him—I had never seen the prisoners before to my knowledge—it was getting quite light when I saw them the last time—it was a light morning when I first saw them, at half-past one o'clock—it was very light all that night—it was by moonlight, I saw them—there were no lamps—there was sufficient light to see their countenances—I was so near them that I could have touched them—I spoke to Swinford afterwards, and walked a considerable distance with him—and some time after when I had heard the alarm, I saw them all three together again—I have no doubt whatever the prisoners are the men.</p>

            . I live at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. On Saturday, the 9th of August, I was in <placeName id="t18230910-65-crimeloc367">Brick-lane, Whitechapel</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230910-65-crimeloc367" type="placeName" value="Brick-lane, Whitechapel"></interp>

               <p>"You shall give me some gin, or pay me for being here." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, I shall not give you gin, nor yet pay you." She said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, I will have some." One of the women held the door, while the prisoner and another woman took my money from my pocket by force; they took altogether twelve sovereigns and twelve shillings; one caught hold of me by the side and tore my pocket, and the prisoner took the money out of my side pocket. I was holding the door all the while, trying to get out, being alarmed; they let me out directly they robbed me. I noticed the house so as to know it again. I went before the Magistrate immediately it happened, and went to the house with an officer, but could not find her. I saw her in Whitechapel on the Thursday afternoon, and shewed her to the officer, who took her. I am positive she is the woman - I never saw her before; they tore my breeches on getting the money; they could not get it without.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you - A. I buy hay on my own account, and sell it again. I have worked for Mr. Owen, of Cheshunt, for five years. I went to this house about four o'clock in the afternoon, and was quite sober, and only had a pot of beer since breakfast. I was not there ten minutes, before I tried to get out; the passage door was shut, but it was not dark. I was robbed close by the door; the prisoner came to the door when I was trying to get out, the other two held the door till she came in; as I was pulling to get out, she put her hands into my breeches pocket and took the money. I charged nobody but her with it. When I saw her, she stood tossing up for oysters; I did not speak to her, but fetched the officer; there was light in the passage; one Sweden had paid me the money.</p>

            . I am an officer. Dorkins pointed the prisoner out to me. I said,</p>
               <p>"It is you, is it, who has robbed this countryman?" She said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! he don't want me, I had none of his money - I am quite innocent of it." I told her she knew all about it. She said she had none of the money, but knew who they were. I said,</p>
               <p>"Who are they?" - she said, she knew, but she had none of the money, and did not know where they were then.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

            . I am a turner, and live in Motley-court, Chapel-street, Holywell Mount. I was directed to go to this house to see if it was a light passage. I went there in the middle of the day, and when the door was shut, it was so dark I could scarcely see my hand - it is a winding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100042"></xptr>stair-case, and there is no light. I could not know any person whatever out of the place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you know of this woman, how came you to go there - A. I was desired to go by her mother and father. I saw no window on the stair-case, I did not go on the stair-case - I could see no window any where as I stood - I found the door ajar I believe, and opened it, and was directed to take a view of it on behalf of the prisoner. I shut the door, and saw that it was so dark it was impossible to see a face - I saw nobody there. I recollect now that a woman came from above.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you there - A. The mother pointed out the house to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this young woman lives there - A. I cannot take on myself to swear.</p>

             re-examined. I went into the passage, but do not recollect whether there was a window in the side - there is an open slip where the people live - it is light enough with the door shut to see a person's face.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You would call it a dark passage - A. It would be totally dark, except for this slip which is near the street-door, and communicates with the room below, which has a regular side sash - if I met a person there, I should know him again, there may be a sliding shutter to this slip.</p>

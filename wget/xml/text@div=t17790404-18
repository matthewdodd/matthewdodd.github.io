               <p>I keep the Kilbourn-wells. On the 29th of June, about six o'clock in the morning, when I came down, the mare was at my door; the prisoner was drinking with some others; he was offering the mare to sale; he asked twelve guineas for her; I had seen her several days on the common. The mare had a sprain in her leg; the prisoner said he had put a rope round her neck and tied it to her leg, by which means she got the sprain. I said twelve guineas was too much for her; he said he would not sell her to me. I desired Mr. Carr to look at the mare and buy her for me; he agreed for eight guineas; I paid the eight guineas. That is the mare the prosecutor claims.</p>

               <p>I was at day-work at Clapham. A man left a mare there, and desired me to take it to Smithfield and sell it for him. A gentleman asked me whose mare it was, I said it was none of mine, but it was to sell. I said the price was twelve guineas, he bid me eight guineas; I turned it away. I asked the young man if he would take the eight guineas; he said he would, and I took the eight guineas directly. He wanted me to turn king's evidence, when they found I did not belong to the mare.</p>

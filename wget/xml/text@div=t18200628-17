I have never found my watch; it was safe when I went backwards, and was worth 3 l. I was informed by the crowd that the man had run to the left. I had seen the prisoner walking up and down the street about half an hour before - he came as far as my door, then turned back twice, and sometimes he went by. I knew him before, and knew him to be the man I saw.</p>

            . I am housekeeper to Draper. He went up the yard between nine and ten o'clock; I was in the wash-house, turned my head, and saw a man reaching the watch from the mantle-piece - it was the prisoner I am certain - I had seen him before, he had come into the shop and asked the price of charcoal. On seeing him take the watch I called out,</p>
               <p>"Thomas, the man is taking your watch!" He turned round, looked me in the face, and then walked out and turned to the left. I saw him lift the watch off the shelf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell O'Brien that you saw two men in the street, and accused one of them of it - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH O'BRIEN. I am a hair-dresser, my house is nearly opposite Draper's, about four doors lower down. On the 28th of May I was in my parlour between nine and ten o'clock, my wife said</p>
               <p>"There is somebody in the shop!" I went in and there saw the prisoner, I drew a chair for him, thinking he wanted something in my way. He sat down, then jumped up, asked me if I had got any paper, and said he wanted to go backwards. I gave him some paper, he went towards the front door instead of going backwards; I told him that was not the way, and shewed him the way backwards. He said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind now." He went out, and ran up the street past the prosecutor's house again. I thought he seemed confused, which made me go to the door to see which way he went; he turned the corner of Little Smith-street - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not Waller accuse another man of it - A. She did accuse a person of it on Sunday, and said he was the man who took the watch - he was dressed like the prisoner. I said he was not the man who came into my shop.</p>

             re-examined. I went after another man, who had the same sort of coat on, but when I saw his face I knew he was not the man. I will swear the prisoner is the man - I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH O'BRIEN re-examined. I did not see her when she first stopped the man; the people said she had accused him, but I heard her say nothing. When she was at Queen-square, she said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man, is it not?" I said he was the man that was in my shop. I dare say she doubted it by asking me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On Saturday, the 28th of May, I received information of this robbery; Draper and O'Brien described the prisoner, but I could not find him. On the Monday I found him at a house in Milbank-street, at Mrs. Trotter's, up one pair of stairs, dressing himself. Under the pillow of the bed on which he lay I found a dark lanthorn and a picklock key - his wife was in the room. I found eleven skeleton keys in her pocket, which he afterwards admitted that he gave her. On the chimney-piece I found a phosphorus-box and matches; he said he knew nothing about the watch. Next day I found another skeleton key in the pocket of a black coat in his room, which I had not searched before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not out of the house that day, and as to the keys I took a shed for my business, and when I cleaned it out I found them - they were not in my wife's pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live at Stratford. I am one of the overseers for the parish of West Ham—Mr. Crockford and Mr. Stannard are acting with me—on the 6th of Feb. we had our usual fortnight meeting in the vestry room—Mr. Lowden, in company with the prisoner, was present—Mr. Lowden produced two receipts in presence of the prisoner, and placed them in my hand—I examined them very carefully—they were both purporting to be for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I examined the one for Oct., 1844—I said, "I believe from various circumstances, that this is not a genuine receipt; we will not relieve the prisoner, but it must go back to the Magistrate"—I gave the re<lb></lb>ceipt to one of my colleagues, I believe into the hand of Mr. Stannard—he examined it, and gave his opinion the same as mine—I had it back again, and was holding it in my hand while I was making an observation, and was about giving it back to Mr. Lowden—the prisoner came up, reached across Mr. Lowden, and said, "Let me see it"—he took it with his right hand, and tore it, I keeping part of it in my hand, and he took the other part—this paper, which is in my handwriting, is very nearly a copy of it.</p>

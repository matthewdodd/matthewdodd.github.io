                  </hi>. I am a boot upper manufacturer, and live it 1, Angela Gardens, Columbia Square, Hackney Road—on 2nd February, about five minutes to nine at night, I was going along Chiswell Street, from Finsbury Square; I had to pass Milton Street—soon after pawing Milton Street I saw a crowd, but I saw the prisoners first, standing with two other men at the corner of a public-house—I observed them—there was light from the large gin palace where they were standing with their backs to it—I could see the faces of each of them as I passed—I observed these two men, and am positive they are the two men I then saw with two others—I passed them; directly I passed them they turned towards me; they were not standing more than eight or ten yards from the crowd; they came after me, and the moment they got close to me they made a rush; I turned round and faced them, so that they might pass me if they wanted—there was a fire nearly opposite; there was plenty of room for them to pass me and to go outside the crowd—when they pushed me one of them went past me, the other three kept behind me, between me and the shops; the one that passed me kept close to my side to the front of me, and the others from behind made another rush forward; one of them appeared as if he slipped; I directly felt myself clutched by my left pocket, and found my elbows fixed so that I could not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250067"></xptr>
               <p>move; the one that picked my pocket was behind me, on my left side—it was the one that had first passed me, a short man—he held my pocket I should think several seconds—I tried to move my legs, so as to release myself from him, but could not; I could not move either my arms or legs, I was regu<lb></lb>larly pinioned—I should think it occupied about fifteen seconds, sufficient time for me to think about what they were doing; the man who clutched my pocket held on for about fifteen seconds, then he made a dreadful jerk, and pulled out my purse; directly he got it out, he moved and forced himself back from me to get away, which gave me an opportunity of putting my left hand down—the jerk he gave me was so great that it was almost like pulling the leg of my trousers off—he tried to get away, and worked himself a little distance from the crowd—I know who that man was; he is not in custody—I did not remain pinioned an instant after I got my hind at liberty; I did not feel in my pocket, I felt the purse go; it was a large lump, and I felt that my pocket was empty—I tried to get hold of the one not in custody, but the others prevented me by closing and getting between me and the man; each effort I made they foiled in that way to keep me back—eventually I got loose, and got right out into the road—I am quite sure the prisoners are the two men that were pushing me behind—after getting away from the crowd I pursued the one that picked my pocket—he went in the direction of Milton Street—when he found I was pursuing him he returned back to the crowd and whispered; the moment he said something to his companions they looked at each other; something was said, and away they passed from the crowd, and he went into the crowd—I then turned as if I was going to pursue him, but immediately afterwards I followed them, I followed them for about seventy yards, I should think, from where the crowd was; they turned into Milton Street, and then into an entry in Milton Street—I followed them, and saw the two prisoners there—the nearest I was to them was within a yard; they were dividing the money, Nagle had got my purse in his hand, counting the money into Whelan's hand—I approached them, and said, "That is my money"—they seemed quite astonished for the moment; they never spoke a word for a second or two, they looked at me, and then Whelan recovered himself and made a dash at me, and said he would knock my b—skull in, or my bones, or some thing like that—my seeing them in this entry or court was within two minutes of finding the man's hand in my pocket; it was done almost instantly; one thing followed the other as quick as could be—the alley was lighted from the shops opposite—there was sufficient light to see on the ground—I looked to see if I could find the purse after<lb></lb>wards—they were only about a yard up the entry, one step—there was light in the street and in the shops—they gave a light as far up the entry as I bad occasion to go—I could see their faces distinctly—I told them so—when Nagle aimed the blow at me I threw up my left arm and stepped back and said, "Mind, I know you both; I shall remember you again"—they then ran away into Chiswell Street—they ran past me, as I stepped out of the entry they rushed out—I followed them—they went into a public-house in Smith Street—I went to find an officer, and when I came back they were gone—a little delay ensued—I had about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the purse, there might be a shilling or two over or under, it was in gold and silver, fourteen or sixteen postage stamps, and a gold chain with the swivel broken off, and a few memorandums—on 9th February, seven days afterwards, I went with Elliott the constable to a beer shop in Whitecross Street, about ten o'clock at night—there were people sitting there—it looked like a</p>

               <p>concert room—there was no singing—I saw Nagle there and five others, I think—I recognised him at once—I had seen him an hour previously—I am quite sure he is the man I saw on 2nd February who was behind me in the crowd, and who I saw counting the money—I charged him with robbing me—he said nothing; he got up at once—before he got to the station-house he said to Elliott, "Tell me what time, and I will tell you where I was."</p>

Q.</hi> Where had you been in the course of the after<lb></lb>noon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sitting at home reading till half-past eight—I went from home straight to the spot where this happened—I first saw the men standing by the gin palace—there was a good light—their backs were to the gin palace, and they were looking at the people passing into the crowd—the light was good in any part of the road, you could have seen to pick up a pin—I always take notice of persons when there is a crowd and there are suspicious-looking characters standing at corners—I am rather a suspicious man—I was dressed precisely as I am now—my purse was in my left trousers pocket—I have been out of London many years, and just coming back makes me rather suspicious, reading so many queer cases—I took particular notice of these men, because I thought I had reason to be suspicious—at a rough guess, the crowd might consist of from 100 to 300 persons—I was a little excited—there was a fire in Lamb's Passage—there was nothing like so much confusion as I have seen at fires some years back—I was looking at the fire, and listening to the conversation of the prisoners as they were surrounding me—it was a very few yards from the crowd to the gin palace, probably from six to twelve—the moment I passed them they followed me; that excited my suspicions, and just as I approached the edge of the crowd they pushed me, and I turned round and looked at them—they what is termed <hi rend="italic">hustled</hi> me—I tried to get away—I stood to let them pass, and then they rushed at me again, and one man put his hand in my pocket—my coat was not unbuttoned, but it opened behind easy enough for any one to put their hand in (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—I had no under-coat on—the man who put his hand in my pocket was at the side of me—he had been in front of me—he held his hand there several seconds, perhaps fifteen, before he pulled it out—I did not call out—I never spoke—I did not see the man's hand when it came out of my pocket—I did not cry, "Stop thief!" or ask any of the crowd to assist me—I think it was the wrong neighbourhood to ask for help in—the entrance to the court where I saw the two men in is a wide entrance; I don't think it is a thoroughfare—I don't know whether there are any houses in it—there was quite sufficient light for me to see all that I have stated—the light proceeded from the shops opposite—there are several shops—I think I saw one lamp at the entrance of the court, but I would not swear to it—I gave information to the police within half an hour of the robbery—I went several times to look after the men, with a plain-clothes officer—I have not to my knowledge been into any place where they were, and come out without identifying them; if they were there they concealed themselves.</p>

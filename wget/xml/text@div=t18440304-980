                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On Sunday morning, the 3rd of March, I was at the prisoner's house—she keeps a night gin-shop in George-yard, Golden-lane—I went there to drink gin—I saw Hosty lying on the bed, and the prisoner picking his pockets of some shillings and sixpences—I saw it in her hand—I do not know what she did with it—I thought Hosty belonged to her—when he awoke, he put his hand in his pocket and said he was robbed—I told him I had seen her picking hit pocket—there was no search for the money—he went to the station.</p>

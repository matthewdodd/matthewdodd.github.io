            . I live in Somer's-place, Somer's-town. On the 10th of November, about half-past three o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18231203-22-crimeloc123">Bridge-street</placeName>

I thought it might be an accident, but saw the prisoner shuffling about, and took particular notice of him, felt in my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone. I followed him as far as Fleet-street, and charged him with the theft; he denied it. I said I was confident he had it, and in a short time he took it from his pocket, and threw it into my face. I laid hold of him, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was in Fleet-street. The prisoner was pointed out to me. Haydon gave me the handkerchief. I searched him at the Compter, and found a silk handkerchief and pair of shears in his pocket. He said it was his first offence.</p>

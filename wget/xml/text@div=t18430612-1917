                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Demaid, of Southampton-rot, New-road. About half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 5th of June, Essex came down the area with some fish which had been ordered—he asked for some water—there was some beer in a jug, and I gave him some—I had occasion to turn round for it—he took the beer, and said he would wait for orders—I said I was sure there was nothing wanted—he said he would was and see, till the lady came down stairs—a lady came down, and asked for a glass of beer—I went away with her, leaving Essex in the kitchen—I came back in about two minutes—he then said he would go—I then missed a watch, which I had seen on a nail on the dresser about half an hour before he came in—no one else had been in—it belonged to Mr. Demaid.</p>

I keep the house, No. 8, Southampton-row—I missed the watch from the kitchen when I returned home on the 5th of June—I went with a policeman directly to Essex's master, Mr. Rowell—I said to him, in Essex's presence, "I accuse him of robbing my kitchen of a watch, guard, and chain, and I give him in charge"—Essex said, "You may, and welcome, if you like; I have not robbed your kitchen"—the policeman un<lb></lb>buttoned his jacket, and out fell a lobster, which was bis master's—he then found on him this guard-chain and key of my watch.</p>

I went with Mr. Demaid to Mr. Rowell—I found this guard-chain and key in Essex's waistcoat-pocket, and a lobster in his jacket—I felt something in his pocket, which proved to be a bag, with buttons in it—I said, "Here is the watch"—he said, "No, it is not; the other boy has got it; a boy named Warren, you will find him is the mews"—I then watched for Warren, and Hooper brought me this watch—I afterwards found Warren—I said, "Your name is Warren"—he said, "Yes—I said, "I apprehend you for a watch"—he said, "Yes, I know that"—I said, "The charge against you is for being with Essex, and stealing a watch"—he said, "That is a lie; he gave it me to take care of; I was always told I should be transported for seven years, and if I am I must serve it."</p>

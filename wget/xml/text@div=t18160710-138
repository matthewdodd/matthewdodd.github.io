            . On the 18th of June, I lost a five-pound note; it was in the kitchen; it was my own; I kept it in a small desk in the kitchen; that desk was not locked. I missed it at about half past four. I enquired of the other servants. The prisoner was our <rs id="t18160710-138-deflabel743" type="occupation">fish-monger's boy</rs>

I learned that the prisoner had been there; I saw him going out of the door; he had brought fish. Nobody was in the kitchen when he came out. When I missed the note, I went to the boy's master, to enquire of the boy's character; the boy was not to be found. I then returned home. I got a constable at one o'clock, and took him up suspicion, at his mother's house. I told him it would be better for him to confess, and if he would, I would forgive him. In consequence of some information, we went and found the note.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. George's Hanover-square. On the 18th of June, the prosecutrix applied to me. I apprehended the prisoner in consequence of what she told me. I got the note from him. I had a conversation with him before Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100046"></xptr>Martin spoke to him. I asked him if he had seen a five-pound note, and he said, he had not. I asked him where he had been in the course of the day, and he said, only to a cobler, I asked him where he got his dinner, and he said in the street. He said, he had some provision given him at a gentleman's house. This is the note. Afterwards he said, he would shew me where the note was, and he gave it to me.</p>

               <p>JOHN BOWEN. I am a poulterer. I gave this note to Mrs. Martin. I always endorse my notes with the name of the person from whom I receive them. I had endorsed this with the name of "Hasherton;" this is my hand-writing.</p>

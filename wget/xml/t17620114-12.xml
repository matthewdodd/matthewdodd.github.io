            . I am messenger to the office for sick and old seamen on Tower-hill. I apprehended the prisoner on suspicion of his being a prisoner of war. He was sent to the marshalsea, and the next morning examined before the board. Some of them had read an advertisement, and said the prisoner answered the description in it of a person that had robbed Governor Pownall of a dressing-box. Then the prisoner told me, he would tell where the box was. I went with him; he took me to the Ship, and there it was produced. [Produced in court, and deposed to by Butler as his master's property.]</p>

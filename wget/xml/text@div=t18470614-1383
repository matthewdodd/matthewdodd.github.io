On the 4th of May I was down in the kitchen; I was called by the barmaid to go and take these things to Mr. Duro, No. 22, Stonecutter-street; I went the nearest way; I found my mistress there, she said, "What have you got some China, George?" I said, "Yes," I have; Mary Ann told me to get down as soon as I could, because your daughter wants to go to bed; she said, "I am going home I will walk with you;" we did, and she said, "Hold this while I get my handkerchief out;" she gave me the saucer, and the officer came and took me to the station, and they found this duplicate on me, which I got</p>

               <p>when Mary Ann one afternoon was going out, she gave me a sugar basin and asked me to pawn it for a shilling at Mr. Clark's; I did so, came back, and she said, "Never mind the duplicate, let it be;" and that is how I came to have it. I pawned these things by the order of my mistress or the bar<lb></lb>maid; I gave them all the money and duplicates. After I had been a great many times, I said to my mistress, "How is it, that this lad (meanings Walters) gets so much property;" I understood it was from his executor or trustee, he had these goods instead of money coming to him, and he will state the same because I asked him about the things; I took the things directly to the pawnbroker's from the house; what I have done was entirely through my mistress's order; I have had a good character; Alderman Challis knows I have lived in respectable situations. I had not any knowledge of how Walters got these goods; it is a most cruel thing for me, as a servant, to be answerable for the iniquity of a mistress or master; I have concealed nothing, I have stated everything straightforward.</p>

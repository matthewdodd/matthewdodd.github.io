The Prisoner in his Defence proved, That the Officer and others came to his Chamber door and broke it open, and assaulted him in a violent manner, making a pass at him and wounded him, running him in at one Breast and out at the other, before they gave the word of Arrest to him, and then he made haste to get his Pistols in his own Defence. This Mr. F proved for himself.

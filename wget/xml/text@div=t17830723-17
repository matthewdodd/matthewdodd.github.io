            .</p>
               <p>Can you swear positively that is the man that struck you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barker. You swear very false, you said before the Justice nobody struck you.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he strike you with? - With a club stick.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts? - On the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Did either of them say any thing to you? - They stopped me and asked me what money I had about me, I told them not to use me or the woman ill, and they robbed us both, they robbed me of one guinea.</p>
               <p>Did you see either of them rob the woman? - I saw one of the men stoop and unbuckle her shoe.</p>
               <p>How soon after this robbery did you see them? - I saw them the Thursday following at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - It was rather inclinable to be cloudy, I think there was a moon.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of the other men? - I know them all three, I can swear positively that they were all three in company.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said before the Justice that you did not know any of us.</p>
               <p>Was it so light you could be sure of their features and countenance? - Yes, I am clearly positive that these were the three men that were in company that evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Be cautious, their lives may depend on what you swear now, how did they come to you? - Two seized me and one the woman, she was not more than two yards from me.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to a man's countenance at the distance of two yards at ten at night? - They were all together when they first came up; the Thursday following I saw them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did you know them immediately? - I was positive in my own breast that they were the men.</p>
               <p>Did you say so at the time? - No, my Lord, I did not.</p>
               <p>Were you asked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you sent for there? - The way I came there, I took it from the advertisement in the daily paper, that such and such people were taken on suspicion, and I being robbed, I attended there to see if there was any of my property.</p>

               <p>You did not say so at that time at the Justice's? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not say at the Justice's that these were the men that robbed you? - No, I believe I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you go away from the Justice's without saying so? - Yes, I believe I did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230038"></xptr>How came that? - The reason was, though I was positive in my own mind, yet I rather chose to see them again before I made oath.</p>
               <p>When you saw them at the Justice's were they under examination a t that time about any other charge? - No, only the said

               <p>How soon after was it that you became positive? - I was positive at the time.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this that you expressed yourself so, that you charged them with being the men? - At Hicks's-hall on Monday last, I never saw them only once at Bow-street from the time I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When we was all at the office under examination that gentleman was there, and they asked him in what manner he was stopped, and he said he could not tell, for they put his hat over his eyes.</p>
               <p>Is that true? - They did put my hat over my face after I was stopped.</p>
               <p>Did you say at the office that they put your hat over your face so that you could not swear to any of them? - No, I said they put my hat over my eyes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barker. The woman said the same, but the man said at the office that we held his hat before his eyes, and he could not distinguish one from the other, and they asked him if he could swear to us, and he said he could not.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I believe I did say I did not chuse to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Did you give any reason for it? - No, my Lord, no reason particular.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time was it that he was robbed? - I think it was nearly about ten minutes before ten.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barker. He said at the office he was robbed at half past nine? - I do not remember I said any such word.</p>

               <p>My Lord, the prisoner Barker and me were drinking together all the afternoon, at the Three Tuns, in Brook's-market, and a young fellow who parted from us in Gray's Inn-Lane, one of our trade, a shoe-maker; he said he was going to Paddington to take leave of some of his friends that were going into the country, he asked us to come about six or seven to spend the evening, accordingly we staid rather longer at this publick-house, we staid there till ten o'clock, and ten o'clock we went from this publick-house to Paddington, and going along<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230039"></xptr> Tottenham-court-road, we turned down the left-hand from the road to go to Paddington, and just as we went between the turnpike and the work-house, we kicked something before us, and Barker picked it up, and he undid it, and in that silk handkerchief were rolled up these buckles, and some duplicates and other writings, and some gloves; he put the rest of the things in his own pocket, and granted me the favour of wiping my nose with the handkerchief, that was about half-past ten; then we went to the Crown at Paddington, and there we were to meet this young man, and when we came there he was gone; upon which we sat down to drink a pint or two of beer, and smoaked a pipe; and talking that we must go home; this young man and another man were sitting in the same box drinking, and they hearing us say that we must go to Gray's Inn Lane, this young man said, Gentlemen, I will walk along with you, if it is agreeable, I am going the same way; we all came out together, the fourth man left us, and went by Tyburn turnpike, and the patrol stopped us.</p>

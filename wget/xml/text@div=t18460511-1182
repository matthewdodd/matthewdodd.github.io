               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110148"></xptr>
               <p>Marsh's test is burning hydrogen gas in a tube—that produced a black ap<lb></lb>pearance on glass; and subsequently Dr. Leeson applied other tests.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose sulphate of copper was applied to a body dying by fair means, not infected by poison, can you tell me what would be the result? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not able—nitrate of silver might have been similar to what I have stated—in Marsh's test I do not think the result would be the same—there would be no mark at all upon the glass—I have tried that before in one case, and there is no appearance whatever on the glass, not even a cloud—on the other was this dark cloudy appearance—it was seven or eight years ago that I tried the experiment, and found no appearance at all—I recollect seeing the experi<lb></lb>ment tried—it was to test the accuracy of Marsh's test in detecting a small portion of arsenic—it was tried on some fluid which had been brought by a medical man to be tested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned Reinsche's test, which is considered, I believe, the best? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is different altogether—it is with copper—we boil the bright copper and the suspected liquor, and the copper comes out a dark colour, these ex<lb></lb>periments led me to that conclusion—I never tried Reinsche's test before—the jar, containing the remainder of the body was with me part of the day, till conveyed to Mr. Heisch—it was under lock and key, tied over and sealed—it was delivered to me on the 29th—I took the four pieces of the body to Dr. Leeson on the 30th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant chemical lecturer at St. Thomas's hospital. Dr. Leeson is the principal—on the 30th of Jan. I removed a iar to the hospital from Mr. Mitchell—it was covered with leather, and sealed over—I was present when it was opened the following day—in the meantime it remained sealed up in a small room at the back of the laboratory—when it was opened Dr. Leeson and myself were present—we found it contained part of the remains of a child—we experimented upon them, and discovered a certain portion of arsenic—the first thing we did was to fill the jar with boiling distilled water, with the body in it—the contents of the jar were then washed out in a perfectly clean dish, made of Berlin porcelain—two legs and one arm of the child were then taken out of the dish, as not likely to contain poison—the other arm was so decomposed that the flesh all came off—I could not take it away, and the rest was placed upon a sand bath and boiled for about half an hour—as many of the bones as possible were then taken out, and a portion of perfectly pure hydrocloric acid was added to the contents of the dish, which were boiled, except the bones—it was boiling at the time I added the acid—it was then boiled a short time longer, and filtered through a linen cloth, and a portion of the liquor, which was filtered through the cloth, was boiled with a piece of perfectly pure and bright copper—this cop<lb></lb>per, after being boiled, appeared covered with a dark coating, which coating we believe to be arsenic: but further to ascertain whether it was so, the copper was introduced into a piece of hard German glass tube, which was heated, and the whole of the dark appearance disappeared from the copper, and was transferred to the glass tube—this tube was then heated, and a small amount of air being allowed to pass through it, after the copper was re<lb></lb>moved, the dark stain which had before been on the tube disappeared, and we obtained a white crust, which being examined with a microscope, con<lb></lb>sisted of white octohedral crystals, which confirms the presence of arsenic—a small portion of pure distilled water was then boiled on these crystals in the tube, by which the crystals were dissolved—the liquor was then poured into a glass to one portion of which we added ammonial sulphate of copper, which gave a green precipitate—to another portion we. added ammonial</p>

               <p>nitrate of silver, which gave a yellow precipitate—to a third portion we added sulphurated hydrogen gas in solution, which also gave a yellow precipitate, and from these tests we were able perfectly to conclude that arsenic was present—as nothing but arsenic could have produced all these results—other experi<lb></lb>ments were used, simply with a view of ascertaining the quantity of arsenic present—we separated from other portions of the body which we had, about four grains and one-tenth of a grain of arsenic—I had rather not give an opinion whether that was sufficient to cause a child's death.</p>

               <p>and taking a similar quantity of the muriatic acid employed, and mixing it with an equal quantity of the distilled water previously made use of, I then took the two pieces of the bright copper, and put one into the one liquid and the other into the other liquid, and then boiled them—the one piece of copper which was put into the muriatic acid and water remained bright, whilst the other piece had a coating of arsenic deposited on it—this is Reinsche't test that arsenic was present—to prove that the deposited metal was really arsenic, I placed a portion of it in a German glass tube, as detailed by the last witness, and subjected the end of the tube, containing the copper, to a strong heat, which had the effect of subliming the arsenic from the copper—I put my nose to the end of the tube and smelt the strong characteristic smell of arsenic—I then allowed a current of air to pass through the tube—after removing the copper, the arsenic being sublimed on the surface of the tube, and forming there a dark metallic crust, which is peculiarly characteristic of that metal, this current of air converted the metallic arsenic into an oxide, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the arse<lb></lb>nious acid, which formed on one portion of the tube minute crystals, which are peculiarly characteristic of arsenic being present—when I examined it with a microscope, I ascertained it to consist of small octohedral crystals—I dis<lb></lb>solved the crystals in distilled water, one portion of which when tested with the ammoniac nitrate of silver produced a light yellow precipitate—to another portion I added ammonia sulphate of copper, which produced a green preci<lb></lb>pitate, called Scheele's green—by this method of analysis we get rid of all the fallacies which ordinarily attach themselves to these tests, when organic matters are present, and I consider no fallacies can arise—I took another por<lb></lb>tion of the liquid in which the body had been boiled and subjected it to the action of galvanism, using a platinum pole at one extremity of the battery, and a portion of clean copper to the other and in this manner also obtained the precipitate of metallic arsenic, which I have here—this when first preci<lb></lb>pitated was very bright and silvery, but by keeping it has become partly oxidated—there is now a small portion of white arsenic on the surface, which is also another indication in my mind that the liquid contained arsenic—hav<lb></lb>ing obtained by sublimation from another piece of the copper the metallic arsenic in a glass tube, I subjected it to a further test, which is a modification of a test commonly known as Marsh's, which in the manner generally used is subject to objection—I took a quantity of pure sulphuric acid and water, and a portion of pure zinc—the zinc was placed at the bottom of a tube, and that tube placed in a glass vessel containing the dilute sulphuric acid—to the inner tube was attached another tube, for the purpose of collecting the hydrogen formed by the action of the acid and water on the zinc, and this tube dipped into a second double necked bottle containing a solution of ammonia sulphate of copper—the gas after bubbling through this solution was then passed through the tube containing the metallic arsenic, which was attached to the second neck of the bottle—my reason for doing so was that if any impurity had escaped me as existing in the acid or the zinc employed, the ammomia sulphate of copper in the second vessel would have separated it, and thereby rendered the hydrogen gas perfectly pure—the hydrogen gas thus formed being thus led through the tube containing a portion of the metallic arsenic sublimed from the copper, and the other extremity of that tube being drawn out to a fine point, I held it over this small vessel of porcelain, on which it deposited by burning a portion of the metallic arsenic resulting from the decomposition—I have here the small cup with the black metallic stains, but, from keeping, a small portion of the stain has disappeared—when I first w it, as even now, it exhibited a black metallic stain of arsenic</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your opinion from the various tests of the existence of arsenic which you formed by boiling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not the least doubt that the body contained arsenic acid or common white arsenic—I would explain with regard to the amount of arsenic stated by Mr. Heisch to be present, it is quite obvi<lb></lb>ous that in making a great variety of experiments, and particularly the preli<lb></lb>minary experiments, which I made with a view to discover arsenic or any other poison which might exist, that portions of the liquid must be used for the purpose—the plan I proceeded on was to divide the liquid into several measured portions, and it was by the examination of one such measured por<lb></lb>tion that I ascertained the total quantity present in the liquid to be 4 1/10 of a grain—there were eight or nine portions into which the liquid was divided—I am perfectly sure that from the whole liquid there was 41/10—it must have been equally diffused through all the liquid, and I was very careful in measuring it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that quantity be sufficient to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would in a child—I believe less, but it would depend in a great measure on the state of the child's stomach.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing arsenic to be given to a child whether in food or otherwise, what would be the appearance on the child afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> First of all we might expect very great pain in the stomach—we should probably observe a redness in the throat and the internal part of the mouth—there would be in a short time after small vescicles or blisters about the tongue or throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Something like the thrush? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very much like the thrush, and we should have the general symptoms which attend inflammation of the stomach, such as great thirst, a burning sensation in the throat—vomiting is one of the earliest symptoms—there might or might not be foaming at the mouth—it would be attended with very great pain—I examined some earth which was brought to me by the witness May, to ascertain whether there was arsenic in it—there was none present.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKBON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand that previous tests which have been relied on by the faculty have, by more discerning per<lb></lb>sons, been considered fallacious? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Marsh's test has been much referred to previously, but it is fallacious unless great care is taken in using pure sulphuric acid and zinc—those of commerce both very commonly contain arsenic—I would not rely on Marsh's test alone—it is usual before adding the suspected liquid to try if it produces a stain—if it does not it may be inferred that the sulphuric acid and zinc are pure, but I have found this sometimes fallacious, for, having kept the apparatus at work all day I have found that sometimes it would show arsenic and at other times there was none—this would depead upon a small isolated portion of the zinc containing arsenic becoming dis<lb></lb>solved, although other portions of the zinc might be pure—Reinsche's test is quite a modern one—the faculty principally rely on that now, in conjunct<lb></lb>tion with the further examinations of the crust deposited in making use of that test.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am afraid it must be admitted that in all matters of this kind, notwith<lb></lb>standing unusual endeavours, accompanied by very great acquirements and in<lb></lb>telligence, are employed to discover the presence of poison, there has been found considerable difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory conclusion <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the difficulty you speak of applies to the general imperfection of the vessels made use of—there are some things which in themselves cannot be subject to any fallacy—others again may, if carelessly applied, produce fallacious results.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But in any test arrived at by the use of any metal containing in itself what you are seeking to find elsewhere, does it not necessarily follow that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110152"></xptr>
               <p>there would be great danger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not in the present case—if the articles you use themselves contain poison, then your whole results may be fallacious, therefore I always make it a matter of examination to see the articles themselves do not contain the substance—I made a further examination after Reinsch's test—I examined the copper made use of in the first instance—I took a piece of the whole copper, and ascertained it was pure copper by dissolving a portion of it and examining the solution thus obtained—there was no arsenic in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw none? <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> saw none—I am sorry to say I believe there have been cases where poison was said to be present, but I consider the experiments to be fallacious—as to the individual test of Reinsch's, which consists in the deposition of arsenic on the surface of the copper, I should not be satisfied with that alone: it is by further examining the deposit, and from all the tests used, that I conclude that there certainly was arsenic present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Bridge-street, Surrey. I delivered the female prisoner of a male child on the 17th of Sept.—it was tolerably healthy—I continued to visit the mother for some days after—her health was very good—on Thursday, the 25th, my attention was first called to the state of the child—the mucous lining of its mouth was inflamed, and the mucous lining of the eyelids also—it was quiet, and not at all in pain, when I was there—I had not observed these appearances before the Thursday morning, except that the eyelids were inflamed previously—I remember re<lb></lb>marking to the nurse that the child had the thrush—I thought so at the time—I am not aware that there was any appearance of thrush before Thurs<lb></lb>day, the 25th—I had not seen the child on Wednesday or Tuesday—my last visit had been on the Monday—I was sent for on the Thursday—Mr. Reynolds came for me about nine o'clock in the morning—I sent some powders for the child on that day—I made them up myself—it was mercury with chalk, soda, and the third ingredient was rhubarb, or compound chalk-powder, I am not certain which—I believe the lotion must have been sent previous to the 25th—I have got no entry of it, but think I must have sent it before the Thursday—I have some recollection of calling on Friday, the next day—I</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe at first you thought that the first conversation which took place in which poison was the subject of discussion, was nine or twelve months before you were examined before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I knew then that Mr. Corney was present, and I found afterwards that he had been at Mr. Ritches' shop a much less time than that—I do not think I introduced the conversation about the poison—I will not undertake to say I did not—I do not know by what means it came up—I came from the country on the 12th of Sept.—I know it was soon after my return from the country that the prisoner came to my master's shop—I am quite sure of it—I was not examined till Feb.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What enables you to speak to any given time within a fortnight five months afterwards, when we find in the previous conversation you have made a mistake of three or four months? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am certain of it from my recent return from the country—there is no entry in our books of the sale of this arsenic—we should not enter so small a quantity—it was only two or three penny-worth—I know that from the quantity I saw in the paper—gene<lb></lb>rally speaking, after I return from the country I feel a little unsettled for a week or so, and I was a little unsettled at that time—I mean unsettled in business—I had not got all things square in the shop, and was in a state of comparea<lb></lb>tive confusion.</p>

The male prisoner made a statement, which I tendered to him for his signature—he said, he would rather not sign it—he gave no reason—I read it to him, and asked by the direction of the Magistrate, if it was what he wished to say—he said, "Yes"—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—The prisoner William Richardson says, "I wish to speak the truth, however much the awful circumstances are against me; I never wished to conceal the birth or death of the child; I could have had it buried in London for a few shillings much more secretly: my desire was not to have the remains of the child disturbed: in June last my daughter was unwell, and Mr. Sturton was engaged to attend her; I went away, and when I returned I found she was pregnant, and I withheld any medicine which would tend to procure abortion; there was no concealment; I engaged a nurse and a doctor: on the 15th I took my daughter to the apartments I had engaged, and I returned home")—he then read this letter—I have no doubt it is the same—it was handed to the prisoner, and subsequently came into my hands—"No. 3, Weston-place, Weston-street, Sept. 16th, 1845,—My dear William,—Ann has passed a sleepless and miserable night, slow wretched pains almost reaching each other has never left her. We had the doctor this morning about ten o'clock. He said it was her labour, and that all was right; but, that it would be some hours before she would be out of her trouble. She is very much exhausted, being three nights without sleep, and never free from pain. I shall remain until she gets it over. The doctor is going to call again at two o'clock, bnt he said it might be midnight, or even longer, before it would be over, but I can say no more, hoping all is well at home, with kindest love to your<lb></lb>self and children. Yours A. R. Mind dear Billy." The prisoner then went on and said,—"This shows the care which was taken of my daughter, and the infant; on the 17th I heard that the child was born; I believe I went up to see my daughter; on the 25th, I received a letter from my daughter"—(I believe this to be the letter—it came into my hands in the office)—"No. 3, Weston-street, Sept. 25th, 1845,—Dear father,—I wish you would come up this afternoon to see the baby, for he seems very ill. His cold has gradually gotten since you were here last. We had the doctor yesterday afternoon, and he said there was something the matter with the blood, and unless that cleared he would not thrive. He has bad a cold from his birth: it seems to be now on the lungs: his throat is very sore; he can scarcely swallow anything. The doctor sent him powders, and lotion to wash him with. Last night, from about ten to twelve o'clock, he was low and seemed scarcely to breathe. That Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds thought he would not live through the night, but he seemed to get a little better after twelve o'clock. I am very poorly. I have gotten a very severt cold, sore throat, and head-ache. Hoping your cold is better, and the family are all well. Give my love to mamma, and all the dear children—the same to you.

The prisoner further says—"I have never done anything <hi rend="italic">to</hi> contribute to the decease of, or cause the death of the child, and God knows it; my sole care was to preserve the child: I declare be<lb></lb>fore God and this people that I never saw the article, or bought any arsenic; the only thing which caused me to bury the child in my own ground was, that it should not be disturbed; I might have eluded this inquiry; all my children and my wife know that I have ever mourned the death of the child." <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

The latter part of the examina<lb></lb>tion beginning with, "I have never done anything, &amp;c," was taken then—the witness Kersey was present at the examination—he was examined in the prisoner's presence—when he was giving evidence of the purchase of the arsenic—the prisoner addressed the Magistrate—he said, "Why, sir, he says I have purchased arsenic, I have never seen it"—Kersey was subse<lb></lb>quently re-called, and added to his examination, that he had shown him arsenic on a previous occasion.</p>

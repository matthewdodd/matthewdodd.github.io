At about a quarter before six in the evening of the 17th of November, I was employed in sending up the dinner. I had occasion to go to the larder for something, and heard the cry of stop thief; and at the same time perceived a bladder of lard, a half quartern loaf, and a plate of meat on the area steps. When I had gone to the larder a few minutes previous, I had locked it, I am sure; and left the key in the door. This larder is in the area fronting the area steps, and is affixed to the house; but is not a part of it. There is no internal communication from the dwelling house to it.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Challoner. I was very busy in sending up the dinner. There are only a lad and myself employed in the house; so that no other servant could have taken these things out of the larder and put them on the steps.</p>

            . I was in Bullstrode Street, passing by at about a quarter before six in the evening of the 17th of November. It was dak. The lamps were lighted. I observed three boys loitering about, and as they were suspicious looking characters, I determined to watch them. I live at No. 7, and rang our bell to tell my fellow servants to be careful. I saw the prisoner at the bar come twice up to the area steps of Mr. Sorr's house. The other boys were out in the street. I saw him bring first a plate, and then the lard and loaf, and lay them on the area steps. The area gate was shut. He saw me looking at him, and jumped over the area rails. stumbed at the other side of the way, and ran off. I ran after him, and the other two knocked me up against the railings at the other side of the way, whilst I hallooed stop thief. The prisoner was taken soon after. I pursued him and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Challoner. It was dark, but I am sure it is the same boy. I stopped him just at he end of James Street,</p>

            . I was in James Street, Manchester Square. The first thing I heard was stop thief. I knew nothing of what was passing before that. When I heard stop thief, I saw the prisoner running at the other side of the way; I assisted in stopping him immediately. He was taken to Bullstrode Street, and afterwards delivered to the case of the watch-house keeper.</p>

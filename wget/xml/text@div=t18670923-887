                  </hi>. I live at 38, Durham Road, Holloway, and am a brick<lb></lb>layer—about a quarter to one on the morning of the 8th September I waa in the Caledonian Road—I saw the two women and a boy there—the two women came up to me—Nash wanted to know where I was going, I pat my hand up to put her on one side, and she struck me on the breast—Peters then jumped over some railings, struck me on the mouth, and, knocked me down—the prisoners walked away and I followed them—I was carrying a pair of boots under my arm—I do not know what became of them; I lost them when I was down on the road—I followed Peters and gave him charge for knocking me down and robbing me.</p>

Between two and three on me morning of the 1st September I saw Peters and the prosecutor together in the Caledonian Road—the prosecutor said he had been knocked down by the prisoner and two females, who had gone another way, and he had been robbed of a pair of boots—Peters was given into custody, and he said he knew nothing about the boots—I took him to the station—he had no boots with him except what he had on—prosecutor had been drinking, but he knew pretty well what he was doing—the prisoner went quietly.</p>

I took the two female prisoners into custody on the 2nd September—I was on duty at the Cale<lb></lb>donian Road police-station when Peters was brought in—the prosecutor said he had been knocked down and robbed by Peters, in company with two women, whom he described, and the spot where he had been assaulted—I went to the spot shortly after, and I noticed blood in the road, and picked up a piece of shawl, which I produce—I attended the police-court next day, and from what the prosecutor said to me I went into the passage and there saw the two women—the prosecutor said they were the ones that had robbed him—Nash was wearing this shawl, which has had piece torn from it, and the piece picked up corresponds with it—I told them the charge—they said they were there, but they knew nothing about the boots.</p>

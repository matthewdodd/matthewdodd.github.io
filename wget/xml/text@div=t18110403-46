               <p>Court. Was there any peculiar in her saying the words. - A. She spoke in a very saucy manner. After these words he struck her with his fist upon her head and once against her head, and then she fell down. She laid upon the ground about four minutes, I told Fallon he had better leave her if he could not live with her, he told me he would not touch her any more. She got up of her own accord, and Fallon sat down between her and me, I told Fallon that Nance had drank a drop too much, she jumped up at me and said something, I cannot recollect what, Fallon struck her upon her side with his fist, and she fell down in the corner, I told Fallon that I did not like that he should beat his wife. She laid a bit in the corner, and then got up again he struck her again, he was standing by her, and when she arose he struck her two or three times with his fist all over her body, she fell down again. The woman cried out,</p>
               <p>"do not my dear, do not kill me," something like that. When she got up he beat her down by the head, and when she was down he beat her about the head with his fist again, he hit her with his fist clenched very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to hit her with his full strength. - A. I think so, but I cannot tell. She got up again herself, he beat her again that she fell down upon the bed, he struck her upon her head, breast, and all about, and upon her body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman cry out this time. - A. She cried out,</p>
               <p>"do not my dear, do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to interfere between them, - A. Yes, Fallon told me to let him alone, he fell down upon the bed at that time, and beat her while she was laying upon the bed, he struck her upon the breast and body. The woman got up upon the bed again, he beat her again, and she came down from the bed on the ground, Fallon beat her with his double fist the same as he had done before, she cried out,</p>

               <p>Mr. Andrews. Why did you take hold of his arm. - A. I took hold of his arm two or three times before that to stop him beating her. I told him not to beat his wife so hard, he was sure of killing her, he pushed me down on the chair and told me to sit down or he would serve me the same, he put his fist in my face, I looked at the door to go out, and Fallon seeing me want to go out, put himself between me and the door to prevent me going. Fallon went to the other part of the room to beat his wife again, I opened the door and ran out to call assistance, I never saw any thing more after that.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had left the room what did you do. - A. I went up stairs and found three women standing there to hear the noise, I asked the women to come down to stop Fallon beating his wife, they did not come down, and there was a man, I asked the man, the man asked me whose wife it was, I said Fallon's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after this, hear any noise down stairs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030020"></xptr>- A. I heard her cry,</p>

               <p>Q. Did Fallon stay all night with his wife. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After every thing was easy, did you sleep in the same room with him. - A. Yes, for that night I slept upon the stairs, I sat down upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you when you were upon the stairs, hear any noise in the room where Fallon and his wife was. - A. No, not a single word all the night after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into their room the next morning. - A. Yes, Mrs. Fallon was in bed, Fallon came out dressed in his drawers, I said,</p>
               <p>"you are easy now, you are friends after the battle," Fallon said, yes. I went to light the fire, I said,</p>
               <p>"Nance, how do you do to day," she told me she was very sore from the blows, and told me it was my fault, Fallon was in the room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say why it was your fault. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you said any thing to provoke Fallon and his wife, for her to say it was your fault. - A. No.</p>

             came up stairs for some time, and after she went out I heard a great many more blows, it seemed by the appearance to me to be a stick, and last witness shewed me a bit of whalebone afterwards, it was a flat piece, about the breadth of my two fingers, very thin and long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it big enough to have made a person cry out. - A. Yes, it stings very much, I do not think it could have made great bruises. After Lewellin came out, I heard her say,</p>

The next morning I saw her, her face was very bad, her eyes were all black, and her face shocking to look at, on another day she shewed me some black marks on her bosom, I did not see her side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down in the morning did you see the prisoner. - A. Yes, I told him I was very sorry that he should make such a riot in my house, and that he should use the poor woman in the manner that he had done, he said, he was very sorry, but it was his passion, I told him, at the time I did not know which I had best do, stay where I was or come down, he smiled at me, and said,</p>

               <p>"it was well I staid where I was, for if I had come down he would have served me the same, this was on the Sunday.

               <p>Court. Let me caution you to be more humane another time. - A. I am a bricklayer, I am used to these people, they will quarrel one minute, and be friends in another minute.</p>
               <p>MR. LANSKEAR. Q. You are a surgeon, were you called in to attend the deceased on Monday the 11th of February. - A. Yes, about four o'clock in the afternoon, to No. 5, <placeName id="t18110403-46-crimeloc268">Chelsea Market</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18110403-46-crimeloc268" type="placeName" value="Chelsea Market"></interp>

Her bruises were black, they appeared to have arisen from very great violence, her face was black and swelled, I bled her, and at the time that she was bleeding the man came, he was very attentive, he waited upon me, held the bason to catch the blood, and after I had bled her he paid me. I told her as she was so very much bruised it was necessary for her to take something, he said if I thought it was necessary he would come and fetch it, he never did call for it. I called the next morning to know how she was, and to know why the medicine was not sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her. - A. I did not, untill the Saturday following, they sent for me, I found her exceeding ill, her pulse was very quick and exceeding weak, and she was very faint, she complained of a violent pain in her side, I examined it, and when I pressed her rib it gave her a great deal of pain, I had reason to believe that her ribs were broken, I applied a plaster to it. I was sent for on Sunday morning about seven o'clock, she was dying very fast, and by the side of her bed was a great quantitity of blood, they told me she had thrown up in the night.</p>
               <p>MR. READ. I am a surgeon, I opened the body of the deceased on the Tuesday, I examined the body first, there were several bruises, not that I considered of any consequence towards life. On tracing the course of the ribs on the left side I thought I perceived one or more was broken, and having been told that she had complained much of the side, I was induced to open the cavity of the chest, on doing this I discovered a very large quantity of blood effused in the cavity, and on further examination I found four of the lowest that we term false ribs broken, two of them had penetrated the membrane called the pleura.</p>
               <p>Q. The pleura lays at the cavity of the chest. - A. Yes, two of them had penetrated the membrane called the pleura, and indeed the lower and posterior part of the left lobe of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that any quantity of blood had issued from the lungs. - A. No doubt of that, the blood must have issued from the wound of the lungs, occasioned by the penetration of the rib.</p>
               <p>Q. Must a great deal of force have been used to have broken these ribs. - A. Most assuredly a considerable quantity of force must have been used to have broken these ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have been effected with a flat piece of whalebone. - A. Most assuredly not. The fracture of these ribs occasioned her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the examination of her body could you see any other cause. - A. Certainly not, every thing appeared to be perfectly healthy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. - MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY.</p>
               <p>In the awful situation I now stand, poor, and destitute of the means of obtaining the assistance of counsel, I feel it incumbent on me to submit to your attentive consideration, the substance of my defence in writing.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 8th of February, one day previous to this unhappy occurrence. I was discharged his Majesty's service by the Board at Chelsea College, on account of a liver complaint, and had that day only left the hospital, in which I was confined for the last three months. On the next day (the day stated in the indictment) two comrades visited me at my lodging, they staid and drank with me and my wife till past nine at night. We were joined at half past seven by two female servants from the Duke of York's school, who partook of porter and spirits with us until half past ten, when they took their departure. Soon after they had left us I asked my wife the reason of her bringing porter from the public-house instead of spirits, which I had ordered her to fetch with four glass tumblers. At this she instantly flew in a passion, words arose, and a violent quarrel took place. She told me she thought porter was quite sufficient for me, and upbraided me in very insulting language for presuming to send for liquor to make punch. I said to her, if any other person had requested her to bring the spirits and tumblers, there was no doubt but she would have readily brought them. She was rather intoxicated, and I myself was nearly tipsy, provoking words were used on both sides, and at length I slapped her in the face with my open hand. She sat down on the bed and cried, but quickly after got up and abused me in still more gross and irritating language, which urged me to chastise her again. I struck her several times with a small piece of whalebone which I found lying on the floor, such as women wear for a busk-bone, Mrs. Lewellin interfered, but I told her to sit down and say nothing, or probably I might serve her the same. My wife still continuing to provoke me, and my passion increasing in consequence thereof, I struck her again, when, striving to get from me she fell over a trunk that was placed on the floor. She complained of being hurt by the fall, and requested me not to beat her again, I replied I would not provided she would hold her tongue, she ceased scolding me for several minutes, and then began again calling me blackguard and other opprobious names which induced me again to have recourse to the whalebone. At this time a man on passing the door called out and said if we did not make less noise he would fetch the watchman, upon which I asked my wife if she heard what the man had just said, and if she would be quiet and say no more, she answered yes, and in a short time afterwards we retired to bed. On the next morning, (Sunday,) Mrs. Lewellin came into my room and found my wife and me in bed; she wished us both a good morning, and said she was glad to find us reconciled and in good humour.</p>
               <p>In the course of this morning my wife complained of being unwell, I asked her if I should send for a doctor that she might be bled, and she answered yes if I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030022"></xptr>proper, I immediately sent a boy for Mr. Lanskear, who attended himself in the course of an hour and bled her. I enquired of Mr. Lanskear his opinion of my wife's complaint, who told me he thought her in no danger; but if I would send to his house he would prepare some medicine for her. My wife, however, informing me she found relief from bleeding, and saying there was no occasion for any medicine, there was none got.</p>
               <p>I continued at home with my wife upon the most affectionate terms from the Saturday, when the lamentable quarrel took place, until the Friday following, when I told her I should go and seek after some employment, and return home on the Sunday week following. She said if it were not for her black eyes, that rather disfigured her, she would very gladly accompany me. At the time I left her, eighteen shillings was all the money I had; out of which sum I gave her eleven. I did not imagine when I left home my wife was in a dangerous state; she eat and drank as usual, and appeared cheerful. I returned home on the day promised; went to my lodging, enquired for my wife and was told by Mrs. Lewellin she was gone to another lodging. Shortly after I was taken into custody, informed that my wife was dead and buried, and that I was suspected of being the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Whether my dear unfortunate wife came by her death through my treatment or not, is now left for your impartial judgement; but this much I can most conscientiously affirm, that if blame be imputable to me, I had no intention to incur that blame at the time the melancholy quarrel took place. I had no malice in my heart: no premeditated design upon her life; on the contrary I loved her most dearly, nor have I ever ceased to mourn her premature and untimely end.</p>
               <p>Passionate, and given to abuse she certainly was - she had hers: - I too had mine. My passion, by her grossly abusive, provoking language, was wrought to an ungovernable pitch; and in that state, with my senses heated and bewildered by liquor. I unhappily did chastise her with the busk-bone, besides striking her, probably once or twice, with my hand. Whether she received any serious hurt from the fall over the trunk is not for me to say; but sure I am she first complained immediately after she fell. I was told when taken into custody that one or two of my wife's ribs had been broken; now if that be truth, is it not likely they were broke by her falling or stumbling over the trunk.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, if I had beat my wife with the degree of violence that made it reasonable for me to suppose her life was in danger, should I not have implored the assistance of the doctor when he came by my own order to bleed her. Had I been conscious of inflicting a deadly blow, should I have remained at home with her five days and five nights after the unfortunate affair happened; or if I had suspected danger should I have returned home to my lodgings at the time and in the manner I did.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lewellin the witness swore before the Magistrate my wife declared on her death bed she considered herself to blame, and that I would not have beat her at all had she held her tongue.</p>
               <p>The crime of murder I always held in the utmost abhorrence; and my conscience on the present most destressing occasion is perfectly tranquil, and fully acquits me of the offence I now stand charged with at the bar of this honourable tribunal.</p>
               <p>I have served my King and Country in the capacity of a private and as non-commissioned officer in the first batalion of the 62d Regiment for a period of ten years, with honour and credit, and if my health had permitted I should at this moment be fighting with my brave comrades the common enemy.</p>
               <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
               <p>I rest confident you will weigh in your minds with the most scrupulous attention the evidence this day adduced against me; that you will look at the cause and origin of the unhappy quarrel. My motives - the provocation: - the state of intoxication we both were in at the time. My conduct and anxiety the next day when I procured medical aid; the circumstance of my returning home on the precise day and hour I had promised, and the dying words of my dear unfortunate wife when she absolved me from blame.</p>
               <p>I entertain not the smallest doubt but that your verdict will meet the justice of the case; and with this persuasion on my mind, I shall bow with reverence, humility, and submission to your impartial decision.</p>

In the beginning of Oct., 1840, he told me that a Mr. Baskett wanted to borrow some money on a mortgage, and he would give a bill of 8 per cent. for it—I said I could not consent to it myself with<lb></lb>out consulting Mr. Maire—I had not introduced him to Mr. Maire then—I do not think Mr. Maire knew that I knew him—Mr. Maire and I had a joint interest in a sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the 3 per cent. reduced—I consulted with Mr. Maire, and ultimately agreed to let him have the money—the stock did not fetch 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not by 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—before I had ascertained what it would realize, the defendant and I had made an agreement that it was to be taken at 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whatever it realized—the stock was to be sold out, and whatever it fetched, they were to take it at 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid the money to Graham—before I did so he told me Mr. Baskett wanted 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no communication with Mr. Baskett throughout—I was to hare a mortgage as security, on some property at Newington-causeway, for four years at 5 per cent.—no deed was was shown to me before I advanced the money—the deed was signed on the 3rd of Nov., and I believe four or five days afterwards Graham showed me the deed—I saw it was Baskett's mortgage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an appraiser, and live in Princes-street, Lisson<lb></lb>grove. I have known the defendant about eight or nine years, during which time he has been an attorney's clerk—I know Mr. Corner perfectly well—I have known him about the same time—I have been at Mr. War<lb></lb>ren's office at Kennington a great many times on business as appraiser with Mr. Corner—I have not been to Mr. Warren's office on Mr. Corner's business, but on my own—I was frequently there in 1841 when Corner and Graham were together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember Mr. Corner saying to Graham that he had called in consequence of a letter he had received from Graham, and he hoped the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not wanted immediately, for he had been obliged to break into the money, or words to that effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I recollect words to that effect—he said, when he came in, he had come in consequence of a letter he had received from Graham—he said, "I hope you don't want the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. this morning for Baskett; I have been very short of cash, and I have made use of it"—I cannot fix a date for this conversation, within a month or two—I think it was in the autumn of 1840—Graham asked Corner if he had any leave and license from the landlord to mortgage—Corner said no, he thought that he had got it—I recollect Graham saying, "Well, don't be in a hurry to part with your money," or, "I advise you not to be in too great a hurry to part with your money"—Corner, Graham, and I went over to a public-house in the neighbourhood, and drank together on that occa<lb></lb>sion—Mr. Corner paid for the refreshment, which he was in the usual habit of doing.</p>

               <p>Princes-street, Lisson-grove? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven years within a few weeks—I have a shop—my household furniture is in a workshop—I have several things that I use in my business, a work-bench and timber, ten and twelve feet boards, not a great many—I am in a small way of business—I have books—the connexion I have is sufficient—I do not wish to make a show—my name is up, and has been a long while—I call myself a carpenter, appraiser, and house-agent—I knew Mr. Albert Warren, as he had an action to carry on for me—Graham was his clerk—that is eight years ago—I had seen Mr. Warren before, but not to employ him—I was introduced to him through Mr. Graham, whom I have known from eleven to twelve years—the first time I knew him he came to my shop, and purchased goods of me—I supposed he was a gentleman doing no particular business—I found afterwards that he was carrying on business over the water with Mr. Corner—he was not an attorney's clerk then—I have known him ever since—I knew him when he was clerk to Mr. Moody Hill, five or six years ago—I am not acquainted with Mr. Hill, at all—the defendant told me he was clerk to. Mr. Hill, and I knew other people who did know Mr. Hill—I think it was after he was clerk to Mr. Warren that he was clerk to Mr. Hill—I never employed him to bring any action when he was clerk to Mr. Hill—I knew him when he lived about Lambeth in apartments—I have not been a witness before, that I know of; let roe see, yes, I was once on Mr. Corner's occasion—Mr. Warren was the attorney then—Graham was his clerk at the time—that must be eight years ago—that is the only time I have been a witness, the only time I was a witness on Mr. Graham's business—I was in this Court once on a prosecution when my shop was robbed—that is thirteen or fourteen years ago—those are the only occasions on which I have been a witness, to my knowledge—I cannot swear it—I swear I have not been a witness half a dozen times, nor yet four times; perhaps I might be three times—I will not swear it—I do not burden my mind about theft things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you know you were to be a witness in this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think a month or six weeks ago—I was subpoenaed to Bow-street—the subpoena told me what I was wanted for—I did not see Graham—it was stated to be on Graham's business—I did not know on what point I was to be examined—I had no notion till I went to Bow-street—I heard what I was wanted to swear—I did not know that I was to contradict Mr. Cor<lb></lb>ner—I do not know it now—I respect Mr. Corner as much as the other—I do not know the effect of my evidence—I did not know what ques<lb></lb>tions would be put to me, how should I know—I swear I did not know what questions would be put to me—I came to speak the truth, and no<lb></lb>thing but the truth—I did not know on what point I was to be examined—I have not seen the attorney to-day—Mr. Jarvis is the attorney—he has not examined me as to what I was to say—I have never told him what I could say—I wrote nothing down myself—they might receive the ¦ information from Mr. Graham of what I could say—I told nobody—I do not know how Graham came to know all this—I was subpoenaed—that is all I know—I never gave evidence to the attorney, nor said what I would be prepared to swear.</p>

               <p>Graham—he was with them on that occasion—I remember Graham, in Corner's presence, asking Baskett whether he had got leave and licence from the landlord, or words to that effect—that was in 1841—I cannot swear that Graham asked Baskett whether he had got leave and licence from the landlord, but either he or Corner did.</p>

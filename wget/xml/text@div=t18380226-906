                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 76.) On the 17th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Newington-causeway—I know Richard Priest, a publican—he pointed out to me a man who was in company with the prisoner—I took the prisoner from what Mr. Priest said to me—while I was going to the station near the Queen's Bench, the prisoner put some coin into her mouth and swallowed it—I endeavoured to get it, but she had swallowed it—I gave the man in charge of Mr. Priest—the prisoner was very uneasy with her hands under her shawl—I took the shawl off, and then she attempted to swallow another coin, but I took it out of her mouth—it was this shilling, which I now produce—I had some scuffle with her—a person of the name of Haynes called out something, and when we got to the station-house, Haynes produced some more coins, and showed, four bad shillings—this was in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner was searched at the station-house by a woman of the name of Stevens.</p>

I saw the policeman taking the prisoner to the station-house—I was behind her—she was scuffling with the policeman, and I saw five pieces of money drop from under her clothes—I picked up four, and a man picked up another and ran away with it—I went to the station-house—I have kept the four shillings I picked up ever since, and produce them now.</p>

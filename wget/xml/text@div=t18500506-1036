                  </hi>. I am in service, at 30, Regent-square. On 1st May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the Waterloo-road with Eliza Fidge—the prisoner came up by my side, took a purse out of my pocket, and ran away—I lost sight of him two or three minutes—I am certain he is the man—I had seen my purse safe on Waterloo-bridge; it was a knitted purse, with steel beads and large steel tassels—we went to the station, and saw the prisoner in custody—he said if I would not appear against him he would produce the purse in the morning—it contained a sixpence, ten half-pence, and some pieces of writing.</p>

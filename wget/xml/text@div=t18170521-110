               <p>RICHARD HUDD. On the 1st of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the Ship public-house, in <placeName id="t18170521-110-crimeloc556">Bacon-street</placeName>

            . I am a weaver. I was opposite the public-house, and saw Hudd there. As he was going into the house, the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and drew his watch out. I saw him give it to one of his companions. I went for an officer - I did not cry out Stop thief! nor lay hold of him. On the 2d. of May I saw him again; I did not then take him. I told Thompson of it - He did not take him. The next day he was there again, and Dalton took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I only took the prisoner on this charge - I pointed seven others out on another charge. I did not say I would not appear against him for a 1l. note. His father got me intoxicated, and asked me to sign my name to a 1l. note. I took Fenton up for receiving the watch - He was acquitted.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, at the Ship, in Bacon-street - He surrendered quietly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I took seven up in all, by Carey and Duncomb's orders. Two were discharged, and five acquitted here the other day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Carey swore that another man took the watch.</p>
               <p>CAREY re-examined. I have charged the prisoner with two robberies-the other was for robbing Mr. Clarke.</p>
               <p>ELIZA SWAIN. I keep the sign of the Box-tree, in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch. The witness, Carey, was at my house last Friday night-the prisoner's father was there. Carey was sober (looks at a 1l. note) - He gave me this note, and said "keep this; and when Fowler's son comes out of prison you are to give it to me." He put his name on it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. I was employed at the Ship, public-house, to let the people in and out. Carey applied to me on the Friday night; he did not come to me on the Thursday - I was not there. He said, there was a gentleman had been robbed of his watch, and shewed the prisoner to me. I said I should know him. The next night he was taken. I did not think it proper to take him, as Carey could not tell me who the man was that had been robbed. <rs id="t18170521-110-verdict557" type="verdictDescription">

I missed three spoons down stairs, and told the prisoner I was fearful she had left the street door open—I went up stairs, and found the cupboard door broken open and all the spoons gone—I came down and said to her, "Mary, where are the spoons? the cupboard door is broken open"—I got no an<lb></lb>swer—I called again and got no answer—I did not quarrel with her about the chimney sweeps—she showed her airs to me very much, and I was quite afraid of her.</p>

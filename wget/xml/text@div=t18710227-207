                  </hi>. I live at James Street, Kensington—I am a general dealer and costermonger—on Sunday, 29th January, about 12 o'clock, I was at Mr. Pierpoint's public-house, in Elm Street, with the prisoner—there were fire or six other persons in the tap-room—we were larking together, wrestling—it was in fun—I hit the prisoner twice on the head with a shovel—he had his hat on—I don't know whether I knocked it in or not—after that he stabbed me in the side with a knife—we had not had any quarrel—I did not see the knife in his hand—I saw Mr. Pierpoint take it away from him—I bled, and was taken to the hospital, and was there sixteen days.</p>

I keep the "Princess Victoria," public-house, Earl's Court, Kensington—on Saturday night, 28th January, about 11.15, I was called into the tap-room and saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand—I asked him to give it to me, which he did—I kept it in my possession till Monday morning, and then gave it to the police—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On Saturday night, 28th January, about 11.30, I saw Tyson standing at the door of the public-house bleeding from just beneath the ribs—he complained of haying been stabbed, and charged the prisoner with stabbing him—I asked the prisoner if he had done it; he said he had stabbed many a man with a bayonet and he had stabbed as good a man with a knife, and he said "I intended to do it"—he was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at St. George's Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there on 29th January, at 12.50—he was suffering from a small incised wound in the belly, about four inches from the navel, on the left side; that is a very dangerous place—it was such a wound as would be inflicted with the small blade of a knife—I did not probe it—he is quite well now, only suffering from a little stiffness—it was a very fortunate escape; it was impossible to tell at the time whether he was fatally injured or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, William's Court, Earl Street, and am potman to Mr. Pierpoint—I was in the tap-room—the first thing I saw was Tyson with a shovel in his hand with which he struck Clarke twice on the head, as he was sitting on a seat—I had to leave the room—I heard a bit of a squabble and went in again—I heard Clarke say "If you repeat the same as you repeated to me this evening, I will put something into your inside" and three or four minutes afterwards, I saw a knife in his hand—I went to the door and called Mr. Pierpoint, and he came and took the knife from him—I did not see the wound inflicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had the knife in my hand to cut a piece of tobacco and was cutting my finger-nails, when the prosecutor struck me with the shovel. I did not mean to do any hurt with it; I don't know how it was done. The prosecutor had had a row with another man that same night; Mr. Davis's son; and broke his collar bone. I had the knife in my posses<lb></lb>sion three quarters of an hour before it happened.</p>

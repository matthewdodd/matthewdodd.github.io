                  </hi>. I am a soda-water manufacturer, and carry on business in Holland-street, Brixton-road. In March last year I took the pri<lb></lb>soner into my service as bottler, and he continued so up to Saturday, 30th June—I discharged him that day, in consequence of his making use of very insulting language towards me—his wages were 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he lived in a house on the premises, for which he was to pay me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he came to my house on the Monday morning for the keys of the factory—I did not let him have them—I told him he was discharged, and he said, "Then, by God! I will ruin you"—I never had, while the prisoner was with me, a man of the name of John Redding, or any person who went by that name—I do not recollect ever hearing of such a person—the prisoner must have known that I had no such person—I think I can answer that I never had a man whose real name I did not know—on 10th July last I was arrested in Brixton-road in the public street, near where I live, and Mr. Biden of Cheapside, and another gentle<lb></lb>man, became bail for me immediately—I never had the slightest intention either to quit this country or avoid my creditors—I know Mr. Rawlings, of Lothbury—I never sent him any boxes for the purpose of their being shipped on board an Australian vessel—I never sent a man named Redding, or any other person, to carry any boxes to Mr. Rawlings for that purpose—I have not sold my business or property, or had the slightest idea of it, or of discon<lb></lb>tinuing it.</p>

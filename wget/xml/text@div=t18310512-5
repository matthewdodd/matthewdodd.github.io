             - it was a grey mare; I took her in to grass - he was to pay so much a week for it: I put her in my fields, with other horses of my own - I missed it on the 28th of August that year, about seven o'clock in the morning; I had seen it safe about nine the evening before - the other horses were safe; there are two gates to the field, one at each and - I found them shut and locked; I traced the mare over a bank about four feet high, across an adjoining field to the Paddington canal, and there I lost it; I traced it a very little way along the side of the canal - the shoes were smooth behind, and not turned up, by which I could trace it; the mare's legs had been blistered - I had hand-bills circulated, and in consequence of information I went to some stables belonging to Panton, the prisoner, three or four days after; they are at the back of the Grand Junction water-works - he lived over the stable - when I got there he was not at home; I looked for the mare, and saw footsteps corresponding with the shoes the mare had on, within a few steps of the stable door, where the ground was clayey; I did not find the mare - Amelia Harris gave me the information.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Is there not a thoroughfare right by my stable door, where you saw the horse's feet? A. I never knew it was a thoroughfare - it is a sort of passage between some houses; horses and carriages can go along there, but the public thoroughfare is adjoining it - his stable is a mile and a half, or two miles, from my house; I was never there till I went to look after the horse.</p>
               <p>AMELIA HARRIS. I live at Notting-hill, Kensington, at the potteries, with my mother, and work at Mr. Knight's, close to Mr. Wise's. In 1829 I was going through the fields to work, at the second hay-making time - I used to go through there every day; it is Wise's fields - there are a great many horses kept there, and there was this grey mare; I took particular notice of it, because it was generally about the footpaths - it was a pony; I noticed it, because it had bad legs - there was no other grey mare in the field; I saw a hand-bill on Mr. Wise's gate - I did not see the mare after seeing the bill; I went to Panton's stable, and asked his daughter for a book belonging to me -I looked through the key-hole, and saw the pony in his stable; I did not know it was that pony then, not till his daughter came and let me in (the prisoner was up stairs); I asked his daughter for a book, which had been left there for me by a person - I got the book: I saw the prisoner up stairs - they were at breakfast; it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning of the 1st of September, 1829; I had to go through the stable to go up stairs - it is a very small place, and there is a step ladder: I saw Mr. James grey poney in the stable - it was the same as I had seen in Mr. Wise's field; I was not a quarter of a yard from it; I knew it to be the same by its legs, having seen it so often; I had seen it for about a fortnight almost every morning - I said nothing to him or his daughter about it, but went and told Wise what I had seen directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you look at it to see that it was a mare? A. I saw it was a mare - I do not tell you where I looked at it; you hit her to turn her further on, to let me come out of the door, because the place was so small; I saw it was a mare.</p>
               <p>JAMES JAMES. I <rs id="t18310512-5-viclabel31" type="occupation">keep the Duchess of Clarence public-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120006"></xptr>house, in Vauxhall-bridge-road</rs>

Mr. Wise had a mare of mine at grass on the 5th of August, 1829 - it was an iron grey colour, under fifteen hands high; I heard of the loss on Saturday morning, the 29th of August, and went to the prisoner's stables between twelve and one o'clock on Tuesday, the 1st of September, in consequence of information; Wise was not there then - Cooper, the officer, of Queen-square, was with me, and demanded admission at the stable door; the prisoner's wife answered us through the window - we got admission; I saw the marks of the shoes of my pony in the stable - it was a very remarkable shoe; it was flat, and about half an inch wide; the mark came out of the door - it was a very clayer place - I traced it about sixty yards in the clay, towards Tyburn turnpike, just close by the water-works reservoir, between some posts, which a horse could hardly go between; I traced it between the footpaths, and then lost it - I returned to the stable, and found several grey hairs answering the description of the hair of my mare; I can swear the marks were the marks of the shoes of my pony - I had such shoes put on for a very particular purpose; she was a very fast trotting pony - the ground was quite wet; it was a very clayey place, and there was no thoroughfare whatever out of the place without turning back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You swear there was clay at the stable door, and it is hard stones, the same as any turnpike-road - a place where dung carts and waggons may go over. Witness. It is no such thing - it is not a road, only a passage - there is a foot thoroughfare behind the water-works; a waggon cannot go along - it is not above twenty inches wide between the posts, and the place is not above five or six feet wide altogether; it is a complete bye place - I have never found the mare.</p>

            . I am a hay-binder. On the 28th of August, 1829, I saw a grey pony and two men, between nine and ten o'clock at night, on the tow-path, in the direct road to Paddington, just by Wilton-green-bridge, about a quarter of a mile from Wise's - I do not know where the prisoner lived; I passed a joke with the two men, saying, "Where are you three going together?" meaning the two men and the pony; one was on the pony and the other running behind - that man stopped behind, and said, "What is it to you?" I cannot swear to either of the men.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CATTLE. I live in Praed-street, Paddington, in the same street as the prisoner. On Sunday morning, the 30th of August, 1829, I saw a grey mare pony in the prisoner's stable, between nine and ten o'clock - he was cleaning it; the leg appeared to he blistered up as high as the hock - I observed the pony again in the prisoner's stables on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not live opposite to me? A. I did at the time; my window faced his stable - there is a piece of waste groung there, and my carts used to pass his stable to be placed in the waste ground; nothing used to pass by there except our earts - it is not a thoroughfare; there are posts put up at the bottom to stop them from going out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there a road for horses? A.There is a road for horses, but nothing else.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COOPER. I am an officer. In August, 1829, I received information of this mare being stolen from Mr. James; I went to the prisoner's house about the middle of the day on Tuesday, the 1st of September; he was not at home - I endeavoured to find him afterwards: I searched for him in several places, and went several times to that house for him. but he had removed with his wife and family; I apprehended him on Saturday, the 9th of April last.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You was with me at Westminster two months before you apprehended me. Witness. Yes, I was - he was then in custody on another charge of felony, stealing ducks; this charge was preferred also, but Mr. Wise did not appear in time, and he was the principal witness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This pony I never had in my possession - it never was in my place in the world; another thing is, I never saw it, and it never was in my possession first or last; it does not stand feasible for a man to steal a horse and keep it within a mile and a half of where it was stolen from.</p>

On the 24th of February I was in a room adjoining the shop, Mr. Mallard, who lives opposite to me, came over, asked if I missed any thing, and said he saw it taken; I then missed the carpet, which was worth 35s.; he told me which way the men went, and I pursued them-there were three of them together. I came up and looked at the one who had the carpet, it was neither of the prisoners, he dropped it; while I was picking it up he got away across the field - I pursued, but lost him. When I returned I found the prisoners in custody. The carpet was taken out of the shop, I did not see it taken.</p>

            . I am a glazier, and live opposite the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner, Jones, and the other man, who escaped, come down the prosecutor's steps, I did not see them in the shop, Jones had the carpet under his arm. I only saw Eastway in Pond-street when he was taken.</p>
               <p>RICHARD POULSON. I am a constable. I heard the cry, and stopped the prisoners. I saw the one who escaped throw the carpet down, the prisoners were in his company.</p>
               <p>JONES'S Defence. I stopped on the Heath to assist an ass out of a wheel-ruck, and the other man joined my company, we walked on, he brought the carpet out, and asked me to hold the carpet while he wrapped it up. I went on, and hearing the alarm I tried to stop the man, but he escaped.</p>
               <p>EASTWAY'S Defence. Jones and I were together, we fell in with the man on the Heath; when he got to the shop he said he had an order to execute, he brought the carpet out and gave it to Jones to hold.</p>

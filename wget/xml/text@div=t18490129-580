               <p>London and South Western Railway Company. I made this large plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the otherg are similar, but on a smaller scale—this light blue line represents the Old Richmond Railway; it is a single line, and comet up to a shed, which is the station used for trains going from Richmond to London—this darker blue line is the line from London to Datchet—I measured the distance along the different parts of the line; from this point, "E" to where the engines came in contact, is 100 yards; from "E," on the main line, to "M," where you can first see the express-train, is 555 yards—I ascertained where you could first see it, by standing at that point, and sending a roan along the line—I could have seen part of him if ht had gone farther, but I saw him entirely at 555 yards; it was daylight—from "E" you can see the signal-point at New Richmond (<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> "<hi rend="italic">I</hi>"); you can see it from further up, from the departure-platform, but not from the arrival one—Webber, the pointsman, pointed out to me where he was standing (<hi rend="italic">marked "C."</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the locomotive-department of the London and South Western Railway Company. The prisoners were in their employ, Healey as the driver of an engine, and Watkins as stoker—I t is generally the stoker's duty to act under the orders of the driver—on 17th Nov. they were in charge of the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> locomotive-engine, which was allowed to be used by Mr. Brassey, the sub-contractor, for the purpose of ballasting—when done with, it was to be returned to the Company's shed—they charge him so couch a day, and find fuel, and everything—when the engine has done ballasting, it is the duty of the prisoners to report themselves to Mr. Doland, the overlooker under me; they are not allowed to go out again, after having brought the engine home—the books produced are copies of the rules; one is delivered to each of the Company's servants; it is also usual to deliver to the engine-driver a time-table—the 22d rule is, "No engine, truck, or carriage, is to be allowed to cross the main line when a train is due or is approaching, and in no case are trucks to be left standing on the main line; whenever the line is obstructed the proper signal must be exhibited whether trains are due or not, and every person belonging to the Company is personally responsible for this rule being strictly observed"—the 65th rule is, "During the whole journey the engine-man must keep a sharp look-out forward, standing in such a positiou as will enable him immediately to work his engine as may be required, so that he may instantly observe any ob<lb></lb>struction that may be on the road, or signal, to which he must pay instant attention whether be knows or understands the signal or not; the fire-man must keep a sharp look-out forward, and frequently backward, to the train, to see that all is right, and he must be in a position to use the break on the instant appearance of any signal"—the 74th rule is, "No person, except the engine-man and his fireman, shall be allowed to ride on an engine</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184901290104"></xptr>
               <p>or tender, except the officers of the Company, unless authorised by the secretary"—the 79th rule is, "In approaching any station or any place where he cannot see, the engine-man having charge of any engine, whether laden or not, shall slacken his speed, and approach so slowly as to stop his engine without danger"—the Old Richmond line is a little on a curve; in certain positions that would prevent the engine-man seeing fairly a head—I made an experiment with an engine from the Old Richmond station, and placed a man, with a light in his hand, at the same height from the rails as the buffer, in the direction in which the train would be coming at "M," I was on the engine at "E," 555 yards off, and could see him—the line is perfectly level there—I went at the average speed of twelve miles an hour, and stopped at thirty-seven yards; it was a dry night—being on the alert it was a most satisfactory experiment—I told the engineer to go at the usual speed, and from my observation it was so; and when he got opposite the light he was to shut off the steam; it was shut off at "E"—the express-train should have the steam shut off at "N," about three-quarters of a mile from the Old Richmond platform; that would be before it got to "F'—the line from New Richmond to the junction, is on a considerable inclination, which requires you to approach that point cautiously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you try the experiment nearer to the points than "E" after you had passed the points? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not as to stopping, but I satisfied myself I could see the light which I placed at "N" the whole distance from "E" up to the point of junction—I could see it rather better between "E" and "G" than I could at "E"—there is no curve—I used the <hi rend="italic">Southampton</hi> engine, as the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> was too much damaged—both engines are for passenger-trains—I had not been called upon to examine the breaks of the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> before the accident—the breaks do not very often get out of order—it depends on circumstances; perhaps it is once in a month; sometimes not once in two months—if out of order, the length of time is greater in stopping an engine, but it is the duty of an engine-man to report such a case to hit foreman, not to me—when the engine stopped at thirty-eight yards, the engine-man, the fireman, myself, and another were on it—it takes one man to the break—he has not always bis hand on it—he stands by it, except when engaged in other duties—his duty is to throw coke on the fire, and assist generally in anything that has to be done, and to supply water, all of which require him to be standing close to the break—the engine-man opens the fire door while the fireman puts the coke on—water is procured by merely turning a handle, that is the duty of either of them—the handle for the water is by the handle of the break—if one is turning it, the other may put his hand on the break—the engine sometimes gets a little wrong, and then it is their duty to mend it as far as they can—the steam is turned off merely by turning another handle—there is no person whose express duty it is to stand by the break and watch—I made the experiment about six or half-past—I did not take care that the break was in good order, it was an engine which happened to be standing there—the express-train travels at the rate of forty-five to fifty miles an hour—our express-trains are all first and second-class—if leaves Waterloo at thirty-five minutes past five, and would be due at the points about half-a-minute before six—I have not tried the experiment of stopping an engine going at forty-five miles an hour—we have one engine to a train one day, and another on another, we are not particular—the breaks are all of the same character and quality; we are not able to put greater power on express-trains than on others—the time in which we could stop a train would depend on its weight—I think the point "M" is three-quarters of a mile from the station—the break would be put on as well</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184901290105"></xptr>
               <p>as the steam shut off—they sometimes put on the break at full pressure; that is safe, but would cause a little more wear and tear—there is an up-train from Datchet, that ought to have arrived at Richmond at 5h.-40m.—there was a down-train due at the old station at 5h.-50m.—when a train arrives, a bell rings—all trains stop at Richmond, a bell would ring for all.</p>

                  </hi>. On 17th Nov. I was acting as time-keeper to Mr. Brassey, the contractor—I had been out all day ballasting by the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> engine, which Healey drove, and Watkins was the fireman—it was my duty to take an account of the time the engine was employed by Mr. Brassey—when the engine returned from the ballasting, as it pasted the booking-office it was three minutes to five—I saw the ballast-wagons put up, and left the engine standing close in front of the wagons, in the same position as when I first arrived at the booking-office—I left it about a quarter-past five—I left Healey with the engine—I afterwards went with two of my men into the Locomotive beer-shop, which is about 180 yards from the shed—it took us two or three minutes to go—after we had been there ten or fifteen minutes, Healey came in, and about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, Watkins came—we had two pots of beer between six or eight of us—the prisoners were sober—a porter named Pitt came to the door—the prisoners were both there then—Watkins had then been in about half-a-minute or so—I believe Pitt said the engine was blowing off her steam—Healey then turned to Watkins, and said, "Go, <hi rend="italic">mate</hi>, I am coming directly"—Watkins went out directly—I heard Healey say that he was going to Nine Elms station—I went out, and he followed close on my heels—there is a clock at the beer-shop—I did not notice Healey look at it, but I did particularly, and it was then about three minutes to six—the deceased, Richard Perry, and Andrews were with me—I then went to where the engine was, and got on it—Perry was on it before, and Andrews also—all the people on the engine were Watkins, Healey, Perry, Andrews and myself, I being the last the engine was put in motion directly—I went down with it to the points at New Richmond—I did not hear a word said about the express till Healey turned and said to me, "Oh dear, we are running into the train"—I think those were the words he used—Watkins immediately applied the break, which caused me to fall backwards as I was standing behind it—it was put on suddenly, and apparently very hard—it shook the engine so as to make me fall—I did not fall out, I fell on a quantity of coke that was in the tender—a few seconds after that the two engines came together—I was in a great fright, and had my kneepan cut in two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Richmond, and was em<lb></lb>ployed by Mr. Brassey, the contractor. On 17th Nov. I was at work for him at Datchet, and after the work was over I came to Richmond by the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> engine with Perry and Mee—we got the engine to the station at Richmond somewhere about five o'clock—I went home to get my tea—Perry said Healey was going to Vauxhall for coke, and he was going with him—it was arranged that I should also go as far as Barnes—I afterwards went to the Locomotive beer-shop, which is close to the station, and found Healey, Mee, Perry, and several others there, having some refreshment—Watkins came in, and said something about the engine—a little after that Pitt, a porter, came in, and said the steam was blowing off; in consequence of which Healey desired Watkins to go and look at it, and he went—a few minutes after that I observed Healey take out his watch and his time-bill—he then got up and said, "Come, my lads, we must be off"—I went with him and the rest to the station, and found the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> engine there, and Watkins with it—Healey then got up on the engine—I think he was the first to get up, and Perry, Mee, myself, and a man named Suteliffe, I believe a flagman; that was all—I think most of us were at the back of the tender—Perry was nearer the boiler—there was a quantity of coke in the tender—as soon as we had got on, the engine started—after we started a little way up the line Healey blew the whistle, and looked back, and told Mee it was no use talking to all of us, that we were going into the express-train—we were then going round the curve—he called to Watkins to put down the break and jump—I suppose he meant to jump from the engine—I and Mee fell down in the tender, in consequence of the sudden shock of the break, and Watkins jumped off; I think he was not hurt—Perry was standing at the left-hand side of the boiler, on the foot-plate of the engine, next the Datchet line—I cannot say how soon it was after Watkins jumped off that the other engine struck us; it was a very short time—I saw Perry moving from his standing<lb></lb>place, and he <hi rend="italic">lolled</hi> himself, or was thrown round, and I saw no more of him—I believe I was thrown off—I have no recollection of getting off, but I found myself off—I was very much shaken, and cut a little about the head and several places—when I got my senses a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> I went round the tender, and saw Healey and the fireman throwing some ballast, and one said to the other, I am not sure which it was, "This was a bad job," and the other said it was—I cannot say at what speed we were going—I was never on an engine before—I thought we went rather brisk at first starting.</p>

I was a pointsman at the Old Richmond station, at the point marked "C" in this plan—the engine-house is at "A"—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> after it came in from ballasting—I saw Watkins come back to it and move it—the moving it pumps water into the boiler—I told him he must not go up the line, as there was a train coming—I did not say what train—he said, "My <hi rend="italic">mate</hi> is not here: I want a little drop of water in the boiler"—he went up the line for 150 yards, and then returned again to the shed—at that time the down-train, due at ten minutes to six, had arrived—the passengers were getting out about twenty yards off—if a person came from the Locomotive beer-shop to the place where I spoke to him, he would come down the arrival platform—after Watkins had brought the engine back I had occasion to go away, to make arrangements about another engine for another train, and while I was away I heard a rash of steam out of the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi>—that meant that they were coming up the line—I did not know which line it was on—I looked out in consequence, and saw the steam rushing out of the cylinder-cocks, and the engine in motion—that was about two and a half minutes after the engine had come back—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out to Hunt, the driver of the <hi rend="italic">Southamp<lb></lb>ton</hi>, which was the engine which had brought in the train, to hold on—they were on the same line—I had got hold of the points with my left hand, and my lamp was in my right—I put the red light between my hands, ran forward, and held it up to the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi>, to try to stop her—she had gone off down the road, and was near the tank—the buffers of the engine were right opposite me—she would have to pass me—I had showed the red light in front of her—she passed me—I hallooed, and asked where they were going—they passed on—the red light means "dangerous," and "to stop instantly"—I cannot say exactly, but I should think they were going at about seven or eight miles an hour when they passed me—I constantly see the engines leave—she went out a good deal faster than they usually do—I heard the Datchet bell rung, which means that the express-train is in sight, or at the wooden bridge—they get sight of it at the Richmond station, a little on the other side of the wooden bridge—it was after the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> bad passed me that I heard the bell ring—she was then just going round the curve—I was alarmed, and followed the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi>, and then found that the collision had taken place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you from the engine when you ex<lb></lb>hibited the red light? <hi rend="italic">A,'</hi>'Five or six yards the second time—I was between the Datchet and Richmond lines, on the right of the engine as it was going towards New Richmond—I did not see the express-train coming down—I have nothing to do with the express-train—I am on the branch line coming into Richmond—I put up the red light to stop them, because the express-train had not passed—I knew it had not come to the new station—I had not heard the bell, and it has to pass close along beside where I was, and it could not have passed without my hearing it—it was about three or four minutes after the down-train had come in that I first exhibited my red light; that was in the yard—it takes seven or eight minutes for them to collect the tickets, for the passengers to get out, and to pull in the train and back on to the turn-table—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184901290108"></xptr>
               <p>first time I exhibited the red light was to Watkins, when he went up the line 150 yards and came back again—I then said to him, "You must not go up the line, there is a train coming"—I meant the express-train—the other train had then come in—it was five minutes after that that I exhibited the red light the second time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although you have nothing to do with the express-train, can you see and hear it as it goes along? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can see it when it comes within 400 yards of me—I do not know that it is my duty to watch it and to notice the time of its arrival—I have had no orders to see that nothing passes the points to the main line when the express is expected—I stopped the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi>, because I do not like to see them go up there after dark if the trains are due, but I never had any orders to that effect—I was standing on the right side of the Old Richmond line, looking towards London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am point and signal-man on the Richmond Railway at New Richmond, where the Richmond line comes into the Datchet, and where this collision took place. On the night of 17th Nov., at six o'clock, while the Church clock was striking, I saw an engine coming down from the Old Richmond shed towards my points—by the time-bill, the express from London was then due—the Church clock is about two minutes before the Railway time—the express was not then in sight—when I saw the engine coming, I turned on the red light, which is a signal to stop—the engine then went back out of my sight—about three or four minutes after that, I saw the express coming, and rang the bell for some time longer than usual, as the wind was blowing in a contrary direction—when I had done ringing it, I heard a whistle blowing from an engine coming in the same direction as be<lb></lb>fore, from Old Richmond—I then turned the red light to it—they did not appear to take any notice of it, the engine still came on—finding it still kept on, I turned the red signal round to stop the express—almost immediately afterwards the collision took place—the express engine was driven four or five yards off the line—the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> was thrown back, but not off the line—they were about two lengths of metal from the crossing—when I showed the light the second time, it appeared to be about 150 yards from me—they could have seen it distinctly—the train that arrives at Old Richmond at 5h.-50m. must have been in something like fourteen minutes before—that arrived in time, and the express was about five minutes late—I afterwards went up to the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> engine, and saw how Perry was jammed into the engine—he was killed by the collision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it not your duty to give some notice to a man named Newman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he is stationed about 300 or 400 yards up the main line, as a gatekeeper—I ought not to have turned my red light so that he could see it—I had no instructions that any engine was coming out—when I saw the express coming I had not seen the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> the second time—I had presence of mind to turn the signals in a proper way to stop them—Newman has not complained to me, nor of me, to my knowledge—it was a dark night, not foggy—the rails were not very slippery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the Richmond-station, and was there at six o'clock on 17th Nov.—I was there when the 5h.-50m.-train came in from London—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> engine start about six o'clock—about a minute after I saw the red light shown at New Richmond, where Luck is stationed—I did not see any other red light.</p>

               <p>the express-train from London to Datchet. On 17th Nov. we ought to have left the Waterloo-station at thirty-five minutes past five o'clock, but left two minutes late—the train was due at Richmond at six—on passing the Mort-lake-station I looked at my watch, and it was then two minutes past six—it takes three or four minutes to run from there to the New Richmond-station—if we had got there without this collision, we should have been there at about five or six minutes after time—we shut off the steam about three-quarters of a mile before we get to the station—just before I got to the wooden bridge I saw the green light, which means "come with caution," turned from me—that is always shown for us to go by—seeing that turned away, I looked and saw an engine coming out of the old Richmond-station—I then reversed the engine, put on steam backwards, and opened the whistle—that made it go slower, as much as if we had put on the breaks—that was all that could be done—shortly after that we came in collision with the other engine—I have been a driver in this Company better than three years—I know this curve—the time at which an engine can stop depends on the state of the metal and the speed at which you are coming—you can stop at fifty or twenty yards—it is the duty of any engine-man driving on the main line to pay attention to engines coming on sidings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose an engine-driver had three or four persons on the engine with him, would that prevent his having a sufficient control over the engine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is according to where they were—if a person was standing in the way it would prevent him, but a man might stand on the foot-plate and not be in the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of a night was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was mizzling of rain—there were a good many old decayed leaves about the line; we found it very difficult to work the breaks; they would not hold to the line—I have been down several times when I could stop at half the distance that I could that night—from where I was signalled to where the collision took place was better than a hundred yards—I had shut the steam off about four hundred yards before—I was not exactly aware the engine was coming out till I saw the light—I was signalled a hundred yards before I got to the point—the break was on before that, not with much force: it was put on with greater force when we saw the signal—I have been on the line nine years next month, and I think Healey was there when I came.</p>

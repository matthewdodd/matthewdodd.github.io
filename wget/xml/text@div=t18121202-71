               <p>Q. Green said he would fight him - A. Yes. Amos said he would not fight, he did not get his living by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020054"></xptr>fighting. Then Kenyon came up and squared; he said he would fight Amos then. There was Simmonds along with Kenyon and Green. Green came up again and knocked Amos down; he knocked him down two or three times. I saw some papers fall down, some papers fell out, of whose pockets I cannot say. I saw it fall on the ground; I picked it up; I had it in my hands two or three minutes. Kenyon and the prisoner at the bar came up to me. Kenyon said it was his partner's money. The prisoner came to the right hand side of me, he held my right arm with his right arm; he put his left arm round my neck, then he closed my right arm with his right arm. He gave 
               <persName id="t18121202-71-person793">Kenyon</persName>
             an umbrella; then Kenyon passed the umbrella at my eye, and swore if I would not give him the money he would knock my bloody eye out with the umbrella.</p>

               <p>Q. You mean the Bank notes - A. Yes, the Bank notes. I said I would not give it him; then Kenyon took my hand and rushed it out with main force.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner hold of you all this time - A. Yes, he kept hold of me all the time, until Kenyon got the money out of my hand, then they went. Then Mr. Leigh and a young man here traced after the prisoner Kenyon. They took Kenyon and brought him to Marlborough-street office. He was examined there and fully committed to take his trial.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. He got away for that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man - A. Yes, Sir, I can swear to him, because I shewed him to my father twenty times after that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Why did you not take him, an old man like that. One man is convicted, there is a forty pound reward, there is another forty pound reward now - A. I do not want to convict any man.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On the 10th of October I was in Oxford-street. I always go to the Coffee-house on Saturday afternoon. The prisoner Kenyon and Green met me at the corner of Swallow-street. Kenyon came up to me along with the prisoner at the bar, damning and insulting me very much. The prisoner called Kenyon his nephew; he did not say anything to me. That is all I heard the prisoner say; Green proposed to fight me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no previous quarrel had you - A. No. I had seen the three before in Oxford-street in the middle of the summer.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure as to the person of the prisoner, are you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Green wanted to fight, you refused - A. Yes; after some little time I was knocked down two or three times. I tried to make my escape into the Coffee-house; they drawed me out by the waistband of my breeches, then I lost my money. I cried out that I was robbed of six one pound notes, how the notes were drawed out I cannot say; I missed the money when I was drawn out by the waistband of my breeches; the notes were three new ones and three dirty ones. After I got up they said two of them had gone over the way; I made after them, and when I had crossed the road I met them coming back with Kenyon.</p>
               <p>Q. Kenyon was taken immediately with the property - A. Yes, the prisoner went by the name of Owen. I did not know his right name. A gentleman persuaded me to search Owen and Green. When Kenyon was brought back we could neither find Green nor 
               <persName id="t18121202-71-person796">Owen</persName>
             the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not find the other two. Are you sure that the man called Owen, now called Simmonds, was one of the three - A. Yes, that is the man; he had on a black wig then, and he has on a brown one now. I indicted Green and Kenyon last Sessions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You do not mean to say that he took your money - A. No. I was knocked down and senseless, and in a bad state for two or three days. I have had the money back to travel with, it was all the money I had in the world.</p>
               <p>ROBETT LEIGH. I am a servant. I was going up Oxford-street. I saw Kenyon, Green, and the prisoner, Simmonds, together. Green began to abuse Amos, and threatened to strike him with very abusive language. He offered to fight him from five pounds to a bottle of wine. Amos told him he would not fight; he went away directly. Kenyon came up and called back Green, and informed Green that he would fight him. Still Amos insisted that he would not fight. I saw the prisoner come up to Kenyon; the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020055"></xptr>on the right hand side of Delabertouche, and Kenyon on the left. I heard the words d - n it, go it. The prosecutor was knocked down three or four times. Amos was. I saw Amos down upon his hands and knees, creeping into the Green Man and Still; he was pulled back by George Green, by the waistband of his breeches, I believe. I saw a roll of paper fall. Amos cried out, I am robbed. I saw Delabertouche pick the roll of paper up; Kenyon told him it was his partner's. The boy made answer, it is not, it is the butcher's, and I will keep it for him. The umbrella was passed out of the prisoner's hand into Kenyon's hand, and Kenyon told Delabertouche he would poke his bloody eye out if he did not give it up to him. He said he would not. Kenyon twisted his hand open, and I saw him take the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner about then - A. The prisoner was standing on the right hand side of Delabertouche. I was watching Kenyon. I cannot say whether the prisoner touched Delabertouche or not; I am sure he was one of them. The moment Kenyon had got the papers he made a start off, out of the crowd. I thought it very odd for him to leave his partner in that confusion. I directly followed him. He made up Balsover-street very fast, turned up Castle-street, into Portland-road; he mended his pace.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other men - A. I never saw the prisoner until I was sent for to indentify him.</p>

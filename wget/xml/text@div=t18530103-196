                  </hi>. I am one of the foremen at the Eastern Counties Railway; on 6th Dec., I asked Pike if he had taken any sweepings from the "D" floor, he said, "No"—I then asked if he had taken from "M" or "N," which are the next to "D," and the floor from which these sacks were missed—he said, "No," he had not been in there since last Friday—I did not give him any authority on Friday to take any sack out—I then asked if he was certain he had not put a sack of grain on a hand cart—he said, "Certainly not"—I told him to be sure about it—he said he had no business to put anything on a truck without my sanction, and he had not done it—this conversation was between 10 and 11 o'clock, and when he went to his dinner I watched him to Robin Hood-lane, which is a quarter of a mile, or more, from the Company's premises; I saw him go into a yard there where the prisoner Samuel's premises are—I left him there—I cannot say how long he remained there, he came back to his work at the usual time—he was taken into custody on the same day, a short time afterwards.</p>

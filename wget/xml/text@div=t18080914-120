            . I am servant to Mr. Mead at the Red Lion public house. On Saturday the 3d of September, about one o'clock, the prosecutor came in; he had a bundle with him, he was not sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner being at your house at that time - A. Yes, he was in the same box with the prosecutor, he was drinking with the prisoner, and there were two or three girls about; the prosecutor fell asleep, he awoke about half past four; I missed the bundle belonging to the prosecutor when I wiped down the table; before he awoke I had a suspicion of the last man that went out, he being in the box. I ran to the door, I saw the prisoner walking up the lane, I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; he said d - n you, what is that to you; he said the bundle belonged to his brother. I brought him back to the house, the prosecutor was asleep, he was too drunk to give any account of himself; we could not find whether he was his brother or no; we let the prisoner go. When the prosecutor awoke he said he was robbed; I said you are not robbed, I have got the bundle; he said he had lost all his money; when I shewed him the things he knew them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up - A. On the Sunday morning. The prisoner would have choaked me provided there had not been people in the house to take me away from him. I have kept the things ever since.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in this gentleman's house on Saturday when this man came in, he got tossing with three idle women; he asked me to have a glass of liquor with him; he asked me to look after the bundle; I told him while I was in the way I would look to it; I wanted some tobacco, I went to the chandler's shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140062"></xptr>next door; this young man came up and said what have you got there; I said I would deliver the bundle to the man when he awoke; he took away the bundle from me and turned me out of the house: the next day I was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I came into the box I had three pounds eleven shillings; I had been at harvest work.</p>

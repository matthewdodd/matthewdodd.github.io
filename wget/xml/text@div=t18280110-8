I ran down stairs, and tried to shut the street door, but could not - I held the door with my hand, to keep him in, but he seized me by the throat, struck me on the breast, and with the blow and a kick, which he gave me on the legs, I fell out of the door into the yard; as soon as I could get my breath I called Stop thief! and Cundle, my next door neighbour, ran after him - I went with Cundle afterwards to the watch-house, saw the prisoner there, and knew him again - I swear he is the man; my gown is certainly worth 5s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with the gown in my possession? A. It was in his hand - I swore so at the office.</p>

            . I live next door to Taylor. On the 24th of December, about half-past one o'clock, I had returned from the Police-office, and had not been in my house long, before I was alarmed with the cry of Stop thief! and Murder! - I instantly ran out, without my hat, and pursued the prisoner down to Market-hill; he was running before me. I did not know him before; Walker and Scott endeavoured to stop him at the bottom of the hill; he slipped on one side. I pursued him the back way, through the Three Compasses public-house, and lost sight of him for two or three minutes - I got sight of him again, and sang out to some watermen to stop him, but they did not - I pursued him into Dean-street, cried Stop thief! and one of them stopped him - I came up and collared him; he then said, "Don't stop me, it is only a lark, a piece of fun;" he wished to get from me - I, with great difficulty, got him to the watch-house, and gave him in charge - Deverell, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100008"></xptr>night-beadle, came and searched him, and found on him the duplicate of a waistcoat; two skeleton-keys were produced - I got them off the bar of the Three Compasses - Mrs. Dean, the mistress of the house was there; nobody gave them to me - I went with Deverell to Mrs. Taylor's house; he applied one of the keys to her street door, which it opened very easily; he locked it, and unlocked it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You swore to the Magistrate, that you lost sight of me for twenty minutes, and the Magistrate said, "See what a long time one minute is?" A. I did not, nor did the Magistrate say so to me.</p>

            . On the 24th of December, between one and two o'clock, I was near Griffin-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! turned round, and saw the prisoner running towards me - Walker was with me, and as the prisoner advanced, he had something in his hand, which he seemed anxious to get rid of, and when he got within three yards of me, I observed the handles of two keys; he turned up a passage. I, being lame, desired Walker to pursue.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear you saw me drop the keys, and pick them up, for a lad at the office swore he saw me drop them, and picked them up? A.

            . I am beadle of Shadwell. The prosecutrix's house is in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, about two o'clock, by the three witnesses - Taylor charged him with entering her dwelling-house; he said, "How could you say it was me? you before said it was a man with a red handkerchief;" she said, "You are the person" - I searched him, and only found an old duplicate of a waistcoat on him - I asked where he lived; he said he did not choose to tell me, that his friends were respectable, and he did not wish it to come to their ears - Cundle delivered me two skeleton-keys, which I tried to Taylor's street door; one of them opened it very easy, and the other would not open it; it is a spring lock, and locks itself; if a person went into the house, they could fasten the door without using the key again; here is the gown which Taylor gave me - I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE TAYLOR. This gown is mine, and is the one I saw in the prisoner's hand - I know it by the make; the lock fastens inside, without a key, but requires a key to open it outside - I opened the door with a key.</p>

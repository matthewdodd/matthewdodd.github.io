                  </hi> I keep the Britannia public-house, Fulham-road. On 23rd Nov.. about half-past seven, I missed a leaden pump, which had been fixes to a wall, and inclosed in a wooden case—I know the prisoner—one of them lives close by, they were at work in an adjoining house, fixing a stove—I saw a boot taken off Cook's foot and fitted to a mark in the garden. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

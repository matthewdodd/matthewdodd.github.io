                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Free Hospital—on Sunday, 21st September, the deceased, William Smith, was brought there at 2 o'clock—I first saw him at 8 in the morning—he died at half-past 11 on Monday, the 22d—when I first saw him he was perfectly insensible, and suffering from symptoms of apoplexy—I visited him from time to time during the Sunday—he gradually got worse till he died—twenty-four hours after death I made a post-mortem examination of the body—externally I found a small bruise below the left ear, and a small abrasion over each eyelid—I opened the head, removing the top of the skull, and found an effusion of blood on the brain on the right side between the membranes on opening the brain, immediately underneath the effusion, I found a large, clot of blood, in the right ventricles of the brain—I examined the chest and all the other organs, and they were perfectly healthy—that clot of blood</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270128"></xptr>
               <p>was sufficient to account for death—the immediate cause of death was the extravasation of blood by the pressure on the brain—I think the bruise on the left side would produce the effusion on the opposite side—in my opinion, it was caused by a blow behind the left ear; I have seen the effusion on both sides, but more frequently on the opposite side—in my opinion, the effusion was the effect of a blow or fall, I could not say which—I found no injury beyond what I have stated—I could not connect the extravasation of blood at all with the marks on the eyelids; the skin was just rubbed off; such injuries as those could not produce effusion of the brain—a fall on the front of the head on a kerb-stone might have done it—I should think the abrasion on the eyelids had been done within a few hours before I saw him, and the injury behind the ear the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, is it possible that the extravasation of blood might have been caused by the abrasion on the eyelids? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not—I attribute it to a blow behind the ear, or a fall—the extra<lb></lb>vasation, and therefore the death, could have been caused by the abrasion of the eyelids; it depends upon what obstacle was in the way; if a person fell forward on a kerbstone it might cause the extravasation of blood on the brain; if an upright projecting object was in the way, and the face struck against it in falling—I think the injury by a fall at the side of the ear would also have produced the blow on the eyelid—effusion takes place very slowly—the man might have walked to the hospital before it took place—sometimes it takes place suddenly, but generally slowly—if it occurs from apoplexy it occurs very quickly, but if from a blow it occurs slowly—when I saw the deceased on Sunday morning he had all the symptoms of apoplexy—supposing there was a violent blow and a fall, and immediate insensibility, and a few hours afterwards the deceased was suffering from all the symptoms of apoplexy, it would be a difficult matter to decide between apoplexy and compression of the brain; when I said apoplexy, I meant com<lb></lb>pression of the brain; the blood is effused in both cases—if the man recovered, and fell down again, I should take it that that was effusion of the brain—in this case I should attribute the death to a fall; I should attribute it to violence, not to any constitutional cause—I do not think it is doubtful which.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In certain cases of injury, where the injury is very violent, is not the effusion of blood on the brain very sudden, as in apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends upon the vessel that is ruptured and the size of the vessel, and it also depends upon whether a man is intoxicated; blood would be circulating more freely if that was the case—Mr. Selwood left the deceased in my charge at 8 in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MONTAGUE WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any external injury on the opposite side to where the blow was? No; I have seen cases of apoplexy coming on suddenly from drink, and when a man has been quarrelling—I have seen such cases with older men than the deceased, but not in one so young; the effusion would be the same—in this case there was an effusion between the membranes of the brain—there is never an effusion between the membranes in apoplexy, as far as my observations carry me; in the case of a blow there is.</p>

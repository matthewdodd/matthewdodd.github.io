               <p>I am servant to Mr. Mattison: I fastened every part of my master's house on Monday night last; when I got up in the morning I found the chain down and the door on the single lock; I went into the compting-house and found the compting-house window shoved down; it opens from the top; there was a half shutter, which was no t taken down; there is a pane of glass broke in the window; I found the window broke and my master's desk open; I went and informed my master of it directly.</p>
               <p>Did you double lock the door and put the chain up over night? - Yes, my master saw me do it.</p>
               <p>Is it a spring lock that will shut with pulling to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What o'clock did you find it broke open?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220052"></xptr> - Between seven and eight; I was the first person up.</p>
               <p>Mr. MATTISON. My servant called me on the Tuesday morning, and told me the house was broke open; I went down and found the compting-house window broke; it was cut at the bottom; my desk, which had been wrenched open, was in great confusion, all the papers were moved; I looked into the drawer I keep my bills in, and every bill was gone, eight guineas, and several silver pocket pieces were likewise taken away; I referred to the bill book immediately that I might stop payment of the bills; I found many leaves had been torn out; this is the book (producing it) all the leaves were torn out that contained the bills that I had received last year.</p>
               <p>Here is a French bill of exchange, you speak particularly to that bill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the date of it? - No, it is here.</p>
               <p>From the JURY. Did you see your servant fasten up the doors that night? - I did.</p>
               <p>Were all the bills safe that night when you went to bed? - I went out at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was the bill book safe that night? - I believe so, I did not look at it; I cannot say that I had seen it that day.</p>

               <p>Was that one of your bills? - Yes, it has my own hand writing on it, marking the day it would become due.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect any one being concerned in this? - I imagined it must be somebody that had lived in the house, and knew I entered the bills in that book; one of the prisoners (the boy) had lived with me; he left me in November: there was some blood on the glass that was broke, as if somebody had cut their finger.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any of your bills again besides this? - Yes, all of them: I lost some black silk and black sattin (the silks and sattins produced): I have looked at them all and sealed them up; I am sure they are my own property; they have my own private mark upon them.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - I cannot say; I believe about eighteen or nineteen pounds; they were in a press by the desk; they are all stained with blood; I saw them not many days before.</p>

I went to the cook shop, and found him there, making a noise; he wanted the bundle - I told him it was mine, and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140007"></xptr>what he wanted with it; he made no answer but went away. I went to my breakfast. I saw him soon after - we went and got the bundle, and took it to the lodging house, where he slept; we agreed to sleep there together that night. He said,</p>
               <p>"Don't you deliver such a message as you did at the other house last night" - (I had told them not to part with the bundle, unless we both came together) I said,</p>
               <p>"Well, deliver a message yourself about it." We went and drank together, and about eleven o'clock I left him. I went to the lodging house about five on Sunday afternoon - the bundle was gone. I have found nothing, I saw him on the Monday evening - he said the bundle was gone, and I might go and look for it. I gave him in charge.</p>

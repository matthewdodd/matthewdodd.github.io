(<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter.</hi>) I am a shoemaker, living at 1, Cold Harbour, Black wall—on 9th January, a little after 9 at night, I was in a lane which the prisoner knows the name of, and two men met me—they did not speak, but they struck me in the face and detained me—I was frightened, and ran into a shop—they ran after me, and wanted to pull me out, but afterwards they went out, and a woman let me out of her shop by the back door—when I came out, they came after me and took hold of me again—I ran into another shop—they knocked me down—my coat was torn, and I lost my watch, which was attached to a chain round my neck—I never saw it again—the chain was not broken before—the prisoner is the one who struck me first—I was not drunk—my watch was worth 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On 9th January, at twenty minutes past 9 o'clock, I saw a crowd, and found Eutier lying on the pavement on his back, and the prisoner holding him by one hand on each shoulder and stooping over him—Eutier charged him with striking the first blow—the prisoner said that there were two men—the prisoner's knees were bent, because he was stooping down with his right hand on the prosecutors left, holding his left hand on the right shoulder—the moment he saw me he stood upright, and the prosecutor immediately got up from the ground—he did not pull the prosecutor up with him—the prisoner said that two men had struck him, but that he was taking the prosecutor's part—Eutier</p>

They took me to the station, and found nothing on me. I have never been charged in my life with such a thing. I was really taking the part of the prosecutor; and perhaps when you hear my three witnesses, you will believe it also.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter—I know the prisoner—on 9th January, I was in the Back-road, and saw a row on the opposite side of the way, opposite the Jolly Sailors public-house, and afterwards there was some fighting—three or four people were in company, and from a round they got to fighting, and fought till they got to the corner of Cross-street—I saw the prosecutor fighting one of two men, and when he got to the corner of Cross-street, he took refuge in the shop of a pawnbroker named Cohen, and stopped there some few minutes—when he came out, the same two men, attacked him again, and knocked him down—then he ran across into Mr. Pawsey's the grocers—he was cruelly beaten about, but not by the prisoner—I saw him come out of the grocer's, and he was knocked down again—I went to a policeman, and said, "Policeman, you are wanted; here is a man who will be murdered if you do not make haste"—I am sure neither of the men was the prisoner—when I came back with the policeman, the prosecutor got up from the pavement where he had been lying, and the prisoner was sitting on a flour-barrel outside Mr. Pawsey's door—there were plenty of people standing round, who said, "This is not the man who has been knocking him about; there goes the man"—I did not recognise them as the men, because as soon as I saw the man knocked down, I ran for a policeman—I can say that the prisoner was not one of them, because he never moved from Mr. Pawsey's door—he never was "standing stooping over the prosecutor, that I saw; but I did not see enough to say whether it is untrue that he was stooping, with his hands on the prosecutor's shoulders—he may have moved while I was away for a policeman—I have known him twelve or fourteen years—he is not a companion of mine; only passing the time of day going through the street.</p>

I am a baker—this row happened close to my door—I was passing from my door to the stable in Johnson-street, and the prosecutor came out at the side door of the pawn-shop—two men came from the Back-road; one was larger than he, with a shiny cap, who held the prosecutor while the other gave him four or five severe blows in his face—he escaped by the tearing of his coat, and ran into the shop of a person named Pawsey—the same two men followed him, and he fell backwards with his head on the pavement—the prisoner came up and stood over him with both his fists clenched, and said, "No one shall touch him till the policeman comes"—the smallest man was about to kick him on the head with the heel of his boot, but I pushed him away, and said "Whatever the man has done, you shall not do this"—I am sure the prisoner is not</p>

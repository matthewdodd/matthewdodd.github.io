And he was afraid I suppose the send way, and he jumped over a thorn hedge into a field; I got over the hedge after him directly; he struck at me, I was afraid he had a knife in his hand, and might have ruined me, and I halloo'd out, murder! and after a few strokes I caught him by the breast, and got him down two or three times, and no one came up yet, but the watchmen hearing me halloo murder! and robbery! came to my assistance, and I had him in my custody, and keeping.</p>

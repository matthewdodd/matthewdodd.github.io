               <p>- LOW sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Mr. Green's farm; and on the 11th of October, between Wednesday and Thursday, I was alarmed by a great dog that was chained by the hen-house; I looked a little while, and I saw a horse in our neighbour's garden and the door open, which I had never seen before at such an hour, then I saw out hen-house door open; it then became light, and I looked over our pails into his garden, I saw many feathers, and the print of a foot, a long shoe and narrow toe, a fresh print, there were no nail marks; then I came back to the hen-house, there were some fowls gone; I went to sow some wheat, and before I returned, which was about three in the afternoon, fourteen were missed; we had twenty-one in all, and there were seven left; the prisoner was taken soon after with the fowls; I knew them again; they were cold; one of the old hens had a piece scratched off; I never saw the prisoner but at Bow-street; he had narrow toe shoes on and a long foot, which seemed like the print; but I never compared it.</p>

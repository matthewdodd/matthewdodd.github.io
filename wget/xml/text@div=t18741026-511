                  </hi>. I live at 5, Colt Lane, Bethnal Green—I am an engine driver—on Saturday, the 3rd October, I was lodging at 52, Tiverton Street, Southwark—about midnight, on that Saturday, I was in the Borough, close by St. George's Church, going to my lodging—I was quite sober—I had had something to drink, but I was not drunk—it was about 12.5, as near as I can tell—Moulton struck me in the chest, the other put his foot to my heel—I was thrown on my back, and the back of my head was broken open—I was kicked by Cullen, and they both fell on me and rifled both my pockets—I could feel a hand in each pocket, but had not the power to stop them—they took what I had out of my trousers pocket, both sides, but two india-rubber rings, and the money I had in my fob pocket escaped their notice—I called out for police as well as I could—when the police assisted me up I saw a woman there and fancied she might have been with them—my head was cut open, and my landlord cut the hair off and strapped it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know how many public-houses I had been into that night; three or four—I can tell you the last one I was in—I had something to drink, but was not drunk—the last I had to drink was a pint of ale at the American Stores in Fenchurch Street—no spirits; I do not drink spirits; it is very seldom—I had been in public-houses in the day, from 12 o'clock, as well as the night—I went home and had a lie down, as I mostly do, when I go home early on the Saturday—you may take it, that between 12 o'clock in the day and 12 o'clock on Saturday night, I had been in public-houses.</p>

               <p>men, not till after I was assisted up, then I saw a female, and fancied she was in their company—I could not swear that—my money was all right until I got up to St. George's Church—I know it was all right the minute before you took it—I do not suppose you were more than a minute knocking me down and taking my money; it was done so suddenly and quick—when I sung out for help, 84 if, was the constable that came over to me—the prisoners were in custody from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour after it happened—I saw the constable directly after I was robbed—he helped me off the ground.</p>

On Saturday night, the 3rd of October, I was near the Blue Eyed Maid public-house—I saw the two prisoners come out together just before 12 o'clock—I went a little way and stopped at Chapel Place—I got in the dark and watched them—while I was watching them the prosecutor came along from London Bridge apparently the worse for drink—when he got to where Moulton was standing he struck him a blow in the chest, and the other fell on him—I went to the spot, and before I got there the prisoners ran away—I assisted the prosecutor to get up, and asked if he had been robbed—he said "Their hands were in my pocket"—I followed the prisoners through Red Cross Square, and went back to the prosecutor and asked him what money he had lost—he said "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—I told him to stop where he was till he saw me again—I then went into Mint Street and searched a lodging-house kept by Levy—then I saw Wright, and searched the lodging-house—they were not there, but just as we came out of the door, I saw them coming along from the direction of Red Cross Street, where they ran—I took Moulton into custody, and pointed the other out to Wright—I told Moulton the charge—he made no reply—I then handed him over to Police Constable 25 M R—the prosecutor was sober enough to take my advice to stop in the place I left him—I searched Cullen and found on him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I am positive these are the men that came out of the Blue Eyed Maid.</p>

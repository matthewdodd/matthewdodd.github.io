                  </hi>. I live in Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road, and deal in hardware. On 19th Oct., about 8 o'clock in the evening, a person came to my shop to buy a pair of spoons—while he was there the prisoner came and asked for a pennyworth of copper wire—I do not deal in that—he left the shop before the other person—he paid me with a crown-piece, which I after<lb></lb>wards found to be counterfeit, and placed it in a drawer in my desk by itself—the prisoner came again about 9, and asked for half a dozen teaspoons—they are 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen.—he paid me with a bad crown-piece—I then went round the counter, said that he could not go out, and asked him whether he did not know that that was not the first which had been tendered to us that night—he said he did not—he pulled a paper out of his pocket, and said that was where he had been all that day—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody, and gave the policeman the two crowns.</p>

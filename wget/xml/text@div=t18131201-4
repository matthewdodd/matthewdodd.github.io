               <p>Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Starey - A. Four years and about a month. The stable has been occupied with the horse ever since I have been with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing but the stable - A. The coach-house. I sleep over the coach-house. On the evening of the 20th of November I took the horse and chaise down to the stable at ten o'clock in the evening; after I had taken the horse out of the chaise. I put the chaise in the coach-house, and the horse in the stable, and after I had fastened the door up I went to bed. The reins and great coat were in the chaise in the coach-house. I locked the stable door myself. I went to bed about half past ten o'clock, as near as possible. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning precisely. It was light at seven o'clock. When I came down I came into the coach-house to get into the stable. I saw before I came down stairs the coach-house door had been broken open. It was Saturday evening that I went to bed; on Sunday morning I heard a noise; I am not certain to the time; it was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you, know it was not before twelve o'clock that you heard the noise - A. I am sure it was not; I had not much sleep before I heard the noise. On Sunday morning it was I heard the noise, it was like as if something had fallen; I got up in the room, suspecting the horse was loose, but not hearing any thing afterwards I went to bed again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you perceived the coach-house door was forced - A. Yes. When I went down stairs I found one of the doors were open, and the lock was broken off. I missed the great coat and the pair of reins of the chaise harness. I saw them again on the Monday morning.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Mary, Islington. On Sunday morning, the 21st of November last, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man, each of them had a bag on their shoulders; one man went down Elder-walk; the prisoner past me; I was going home down Lower-street, Islington; I stopped the prisoner; I asked him what he had got; he said, a few turnips. I asked him if that was all; he said, no, he had got some reins that he had found in a ditch. I told him I was not satisfied with that, he must go with me, and as we were walking together I met a brother officer that has the care of the watch-house. When I took him to this officer, he made his escape from me. I commanded the watchman to assist me. We pursued him beyond the Britannia fields; there the watchman got up to him first, and took him. He is here. I secured him, and brought him to the watchhouse. I left the bag in the care of the other officer, while I pursued him. These are the reins that were in the bag.</p>

            . I am constable of the night at Islington watchhouse. I met the prisoner and Cutler as I was going from the watchhouse, along Lower-street, Islington; the prisoner had a bag. The prisoner said, he had turnips; I said, you had better examine the bag. I saw a pair of reins in the bag; there were some turnips also in the bag. I said to the prisoner, this has a very suspicious look; where did you get these reins; he said, a man, a rat catcher, that he knew desired him at Stoke Newington to bring them to Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cutler. When you met the prisoner in Lower-street, which way did he appear to be making from - A. From Newington-green.</p>
               <p>Q. to Franklin. You were saying that a rat catcher desired him to bring them from Stoke Newington to Islington - A. Yes; he was to make a shilling or two of them if he could. I then said to Cutler that it had a very suspicious look. Cutler ordered the watchman to assist in taking him to the watch-house; the watchman's name is Shirley. Then Cutler stepped a little nearer to the prisoner; the prisoner started across the road; directly Shirley and Cutler ran after him. I took care of the bag and reins, and after they put the prisoner in the watch-house, I gave Cutler the bag again.</p>

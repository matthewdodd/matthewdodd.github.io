Bonnell, we both live in the house. On Wednesday morning, the 23d of May, about noon, the prisoner was standing at the door, looking at the things. I asked her to walk in, and she did, and enquired for some puse velvet - I found I had none; she then asked to see some silk shawls, I shewed her a variety - she stood at the counter; she made choice of three silk shawls - they were put on the shelf; she then asked to see some muslin, I shewed her some, she told me to cut off five yards, which I did. While I was looking for the muslin, I saw her put her handkerchief over a silk shawl, and put it into her arms, the handkerchief covering it. She then asked to see some stuff, which I shewed her; she desired me to cut nine yards, which I did; she then said she was going further, and would call as she returned, and my young man should carry the things for her to Fleet-street, and her aunt would pay for them. She was going out, I followed her to the door talking about different things; she went as far as the next house. I then told her I wanted to speak to her - I found the shawl in her handkerchief; an officer was sent for, who took a scarf from her pocket, which was on my counter when she came into the shop. I had shewn her a variety of scarfs; the shawl cost me 2 l. to sell again; the scarf cost me 1 l. - I have valued it at 10 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Which of you is lesse - A. My partner, the rent is paid by the firm. The handkerchief covered the shawl; she must have known she had it - it is a yard and a quarter square. It could not be a mistake, I saw her do it. The scarf is two yards long and half a yard wide.</p>

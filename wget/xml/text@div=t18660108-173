I am the son of John St Pier, of Barking-side, the deceased—I was with him in the Chequers public-house on 26th December, several people were in the room, and Mrs. Lucas, her son, and the prisoner—Lucas attempted to take his mother from the room, and in so doing knocked her down—he then hit me—my father came up to take my part, and Lucas hit him—the prisoner then got up, and said he would take Lucas's part, and attempted to strike my father, but I <hi rend="italic">cotched</hi> hold of his arm, and told him not to do it—he snatched his arm away, and tore his coat—he then hit me once or twice, knocked me down, then flew to my father, hit him on the nose, and knocked him on the settle—he fell—the prisoner pulled him up again from the settle, and hit him twice more, but I do not know where—my father fell on the ground—the prisoner struck him three times altogether—I do not know whether the two blows were violent ones, but my father never moved or spoke after—he died on the spot.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I live at Ilford—on 26th Decem<lb></lb>ber, I made a post<lb></lb>mortem examination of the deceased at the Chequers Inn—I found he bad suffered from slight bleeding from the nose, and there was a puffy swelling at the back part of the head, on the right side—on removing the scalp, I found, in the locality of that swelling, a quantity of effused blood under the scalp, and upon opening the scalp I found a large extravasation of blood at the base of the brain, which was the cause of death—looking at the external marks, I should say that whatever caused them, caused the extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—extravasation might arise from excitement—I cannot say whether it would be more likely to arise from a blow—in a man of his age, it would be quite as possible to arise from excitement and over fulness of the vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Judging from what you saw, what was the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The extravasation of blood at the base of the brain, caused by a blow or a fall—I say that under certain conditions, the extravasation would be as likely to arise from fulness of the vessels, but seeing marks of external violence inclines my opinion another way—there had not been much bleeding from the nose—his age was sixty-four—if I had not seen the marks of violence, I should, probably, have said that death arose from apoplexy, but seeing the external marks of violence, I am able to say that they make it in a high degree improbable that the extravasation arose from excitement and over-fulness—my opinion is that he died from the effects of extravasa<lb></lb>tion of blood at the base of the brain, produced by violence—that is much more likely than that he died from over-excitement and over-fulness of the vessels, but it is not totally inconsistent with the other state of facts—the marks of violence do not exclude the possibility of over-fulness of the vessels and excitement—I have heard the evidence before.</p>

               <p>the day, there is a possibility of its arising from excessive excitement—there was no fracture of the skull, and the puffy swelling was not over the seat of the injury—the extravasation was the result of the rupture either of several small vessels or one large one—I did not ascertain which—it is the occasional result of a blow that vessels are ruptured, as in the case of prize-fighters, and the case of over-fulness; that is the common form which it takes—drinking, dancing, quarrelling would undoubtedly have a tendency to increase the peril from over-fulness of blood.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose these books - A. In the morning of Saturday the 8th of April the prisoner came into the shop and asked if my master or mistress were at home; my mistress's little boy was in the shop, I sent him up to call his mother; he said my mistress would be down presently; I stood at the door; he said, oh, I cannot wait any longer; he went off; I saw no more of him. On the Thursday morning following I saw him walking backwards and forwards at the door, looking at me; I and my master's girl ran after him, and called stop thief; I told him my mistress wanted to speak to him; he said he was going up Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday, when you sent the little boy up for your mistress, what did he do - A. He staid in the shop; there was nobody else in the shop but him, I was outside of the door putting out the books; he said I cannot stay any longer; we missed the books the minute he was gone from the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many - A. About half a shelf full. I am positive he is the same man.</p>

            . I am a bookseller in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. On Saturday morning, the 8th instant, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought these books to sell, he asked fourteen shillings for them; I bid him half a guinea, as they were odd volumes; I told him they were not worth fourteen shillings. He would not take half a guinea at first; he went away and returned; he said I should have them for the half guinea; I took the books and gave him the money; about half an hour afterwards, the books were standing on my counter, Mr. Laycock came in and claimed them; I described the person that I bought them of, which turned out to be the same young man that the lad had described being in the shop. This is the man that I bought the books of; on Thursday morning, in the forepart of the day, the lad ran over to my shop, saying, we have catched the thief; I went over and saw him. These are the books; two volumes of Shakespeare, and two volumes of Biblical Researches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, at Acton. On 14th June, about 8 o'clock in the evening, a person, who I believe was the prisoner, came to my house for three half-penny-worth of oats—he gave me half-a-crown, and I gave him change—I put the half-crown into my pocket—I do not think I had any other there at that time, but I put in two other bad half-crowns—these were the only three I had in my pocket—I took a bad half-crown half-an-hour afterwards from another man, and that induced me to look at the three, and I found they were bad—on 18th June the prisoner came again for a quarter of a peck of peas—I recognised him—he gave my wife a bad half-crown—I told him I suspected he was the man who came on the Saturday before; he denied it—with respect to the half-crown Be brought on the 18th, be first said he had been working in the country, and had brought it up with him—he then said he brought it from Yorkshire with him; and then he said some men on the road gave it him to go and get some peas to make some soup; but who they were, or where they lived, he could not tell—while I was holding him till the policeman came, he said I might as well let the poor b—go, for I could only give him a week for it if I held him—I gave the other man in custody on the 14th, and he Was discharged, after being detained a fortnight, I believe.</p>

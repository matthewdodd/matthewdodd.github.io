I know it was on 10th October that the prisoner gave me this note, because as soon as I found out I had been deceived I made it my business to go to a friend of mine who I knew moved that very day—I went there and asked them the day they moved, and I found out through that the day—I knew it was the same day they moved—he had it down in his book—it was a little over a quarter of a mile from Scaines' where I met the prisoner—I did not think of Scaines before he mentioned him.</p>

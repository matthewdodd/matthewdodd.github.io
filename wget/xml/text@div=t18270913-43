               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you have since sold it? A. Yes - the fences of the field were in a bad condition; it is possible it might have strayed - the cow remained in the field.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Wednesday morning, the 11th of July, about five minutes past three o'clock, I was standing by the brick-field, in Maiden-lane, and saw the prisoners coming down the lane from Highgate, towards this field - I returned to the top of the lane, and was standing in the road - about ten minutes before four o'clock I saw them returning with a white calf; it had a small cord tied round the neck - they were driving it before them - they drove it up the hill into Highgate - and in about five minutes I saw the calf come running down the middle of the road, and the prisoners in the path way, running after it - I tried to stop it, but did not - it ran down the hill towards Holloway - I ran about three hundred yards down the hill, and called to another watchman to stop it, but he did not - I returned and saw the prisoners running after it - I told Lloyd, (who was foremost,) that I had done all I could to stop it - he said it would run by every thing - I suspected nothing then - I saw no more of them, and do not know what became of the calf - I swear they are the men; they were about a quarter of a mile from the field when I first saw them with it - I can only swear that the calf was white.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was no disgnise about them? A. No; they did not try to go away - I could not swear to the calf - there were some gaps in the fence of the field.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Wednesday, the 11th of August, a few minutes before four o'clock, I saw the calf running down Highgate-hill, which is not a quarter of a mile from Maiden-lane - May called to me to stop it - I saw both the prisoner's running down the hill after it; it was white - I did not observe any black spots on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe the prisoners are milkmen? A. I do not know; I had my watchman's dress on; they followed it up the hill and down again - I spoke to them; it was broad day light.</p>

            . I am toll-taker at Highgate-archway. About four o'clock on the morning in question the two prisoners brought the calf up to the gate - the prisoners went up to the calf, and it went back again; they had a hard matter to stop it - they drove it through, and Lloyed paid me 2d. as the toll for them both; it was white, and I believe, had a few black spots on the head - I saw them turn up by some houses. I told Raynes which way the calf had gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate you did not know whether there was any mark on it? A. I said I believed there were some black spots; and I believed the calf produced then was the same, but I did not notice it sufficient to swear to it.</p>

            . I am a milkman, and live with Mr. Raynes. I saw the calf in the field between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and missed it about six in the morning - we found it that morning in Mr. Coleman's field.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might it not have strayed? A. It might - there were five other calves in the field.</p>

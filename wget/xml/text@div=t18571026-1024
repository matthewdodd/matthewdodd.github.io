                  </hi>. I live with my father at Frogwell, near Hampstead; he is the heath keeper. On 13th Sept. I and John Roe were on the heath in the Spaniards Road, about half past 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoners there; Edwards struck a lucifer, and put it under the furze on the heath; he said to Sims, It will burn up, presently "—it blazed very much, and they went away when they found that the people were coming up—I was on the other side of the footpath, with merely the width of the road between—I knew them before, and went and told my father.</p>

               <p>Hampstead, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I was coming from the Spaniards—I saw Edwards passing by where the heath was burning, and another person with him, whom I could not see, as it was getting dark—Edwards was on the path, laughing, and I said to him that it was a pretty game; he never spoke to me, and I passed on with the <hi rend="italic">things</hi> which I was driving—I had seen him before—I did not see the fire lighted; it was alight.</p>

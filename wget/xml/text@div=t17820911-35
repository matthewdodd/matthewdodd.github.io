               <p>About a month before I was robbed, two of my countrymen came with the prisoner to my house; I never saw him after till I was robbed. On Sunday night, between twelve and one, the 29th of July, I was laid down to sleep, I thought I felt something under the bed: I made the house fast, I got up and felt about, and went to bed again; my husband is at sea, I thought it was the cat, a considerable time after I heard something fall and break, and I heard a foot twice, it frightened me, as I had buried my sister; I called my mother, she brought a candle, I found the prisoner under the bed, as he came out one of my silver buckles was in his hand, I snapped it out of his hand, and my mother took the other out of his hand: the watch was hanging at the head of the bed, over the drawers, I said you have taken my husband's watch, he denied it, my mother advised him to give the watch and go about his business, and he would not give it: I kept him till the watchman came, he said, if you say another word I will cut your bloody liver out, then he immediately flew to the window, broke a pain of glass, and threw the screw out, threw up the window and leaped out, it was a one pair of stairs room, they are small houses, I never saw him but once before.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to begin your story with telling us that you had never seen him but once before; why did you suppose it would be enquired into? - Because I told it all as it happened, I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Is your mother here? - No; my mother is ill, she is always ailing, especially since my sister was buried.</p>
               <p>Court. She was able enough to get up and fetch you a candle? - Yes; in a very great fright.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the man after he jumped out of the window? - I did not know his name, the men told me his name was Bob, I did not know his other name.</p>

               <p>I keep a shop in Church-lane, in St. George's in the east; the prisoner came to me with a watch wanting the out-side case, and told me he was recommended by a Mr. Hayes, and he wanted an outside case, he asked what it would come to, and he asked me to lend him a watch, I said I had none but customers watches, he said Mr. Hays was certain I would lend him an old watch, he left the other with me, and then he left my watch with a publican for half a guinea, they are both in the hands of the officers.</p>

               <p>Where did you get the watch you gave to the constable? - From the prisoner; his bed and chest were brought to my house, and he desired me to lend him half a guinea on the watch, but when I heard it was stolen. I delivered it to Mr. Forrester.</p>
               <p>(The other watch shewn to Stout, and deposed to by him.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I hope you will enquire into this woman's character, and see how she gets her bread, she is nothing but a common prostitute: I am a stranger in London, and when I first came to London I had a great deal of money, this woman picked me up, I used to work on board, and I was going to take a boat to go on board, and she called me in, I told her I had no money, and she gave me this watch, and told me to leave it for some money, or to take it with me; so I went to this watch makers, as I was in liquor I thought I had lost the case, and I gave it him to make another; I left that other watch with the man for half a guinea. This woman came to me in Newgate, and offered if I would leave her monthly money, and my will and power, she would make it up, and I would not agree to it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How came she to give you the watch without the case?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She gave me the case and all as I suppose, but there was another man began to quarrel with me, and in the quarrel I dropped the case, this man hit me over the head, this woman struck me twice and I jumped out of the window, I went on board and came on shore again, then I was taken up and sworn to.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never was in Newgate, I looked through the gate, a gentleman called me and said, do not go too near, I only went to the gate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She was in the ward indeed my Lord, and gave me 6 d. and the people would have killed her if it had not been for me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is that true? - I went withinside the gate.</p>
               <p>Court. You said just now you was not there? - I looked through the gate; he has been discharged from his ship, he has got a rupture.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it true that he hindered the other prisoners from hurting you? - No, my Lord, I only looked through the bars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord there was Beaty and some more saw her and spoke to her.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Akerman. Do you remember this woman coming into the prison? - My lord, it is impossible to remember, we let in two thousand people of a day, but Beaty can tell, he is not convicted of a felony, he is only for a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>- BEATY brought from Newgate and sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that woman in the red cloak ? - I know the woman's face very well, I saw her last Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110047"></xptr>Court. Where did you see her? - In the prison of Newgate, in the middle ward, the common side, she came there in company with another woman to see the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she up stairs or down? - She was up stairs, my lord, in the middle ward one pair of stairs, they all three came into the ward together as I was writing at the table.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear any conversation that passed between them? - The prisoner told me she was his prosecutrix, and I got up from where I was writing, I spoke to her, and she sent for a pot of beer, she said she came to settle with him, and that was what she wanted, that would satisfy her, that if he would pay her for some matter that had been committed, that she did not want to hurt him.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was she there? - The pot of beer could not come up, and the prisoners understanding her to be the prosecutrix, and knowing she had found a bill they went to use her ill, I begged of them not, as it would hurt the poor man.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is it true what this witness says? - I never went any further, but looked through the gates.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is not true that you went into the prison, and through the gates?</p>
               <p>Beaty. It is a certain fact that she was there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Curiosity led me in there, I did not understand the place.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. In the latter end of last year the prisoner was brought to our office - I went with the prosecutrix, and found the muff, which she claims; the prisoner was taken to the Magistrate, who thought there was not sufficient grounds against him; but he said she might go and get a bill, but the prisoner was out of the way till he was taken - the prisoner owned the things were left there, but said they were not paid for; he did not deny that it was her muff.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been reduced to the last stage of poverty by the prosecutrix: in 1829 I was arraigned on this same charge, for a large quantity of wearing-apparel and other things, and his Lordship directed the Jury to acquit me - the transaction on which this prosecution is founded, is as follows: - In the latter end of August, 1829, I was called on by King, who requested me to call in Leicester-street, not Leicester-square, to purchase some goods; I called there in the course of the afternoon, and it was stated that a quantity of goods had been seized under distress for rent, and they were worth more than they were distrained for - if I would purchase them, and pay so much more money, I should have them- I applied to the broker for the bill, which was given me; I requested to see the goods, but was told I could not, as they were blocked up with some other furniture - I told the prosecutrix I could not see the goods, but understanding they were worth the money, I would advance the rent, and give her as much more as I could; I then paid 3l. 3s. 3d., and took a receipt, which has been denied me, together with the inventory of the goods.</p>

            . I tendered him the 3l. 3s. 3d., and he refused it, unless I gave him the amount of the bill, which was 7l., and as I had made no agreement, I considered myself exempt from any other charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I applied to the gentleman who had moved the goods, for which 2l. 5s. 6d. was charged, which, with what I had paid before, was fully equal to the value of them, and when she called to pay the money, I presented her the bill - some demur arose; I said if she would give me that money she should have them - she said she could not at that time, but if I would keep them three or four days she would redeem them; understanding that I was to be paid for the advance of my money and trouble, I drew up an agreement to that effect on the back of the inventory, which she signed, and as she did not come for them, I made use of the goods; that muff I did send to be made into a tippet - I need not direct your attention to my having been tried before, with Mr. Scate, in August, 1829, when I was acquitted, and not satisfied with that, the prosecutrix, whose malice would drive her to any means to effect my ruin, one Sunday evening brought a Policeman just as I was going to bed, and I was taken to the watch-house; the Magistrate said there was nothing against me, and I was discharged - some time after my affairs became deranged, and I went to Liverpool; I returned to London six months ago, and had five hundred circulars issued, and all my friends knew where I lived- I went to Marlborough-street office on business repeatedly, and every one knew me about the neighbourhood; though I may be acquitted, I shall be ruined for ever.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had he the key of this trunk? A. It was in one of the drawers, and the next day I was sent for by Sir George Farrant - the prisoner was then there to lay a complaint against me; a pawnbroker's lad was there - the Magistrate said, "Is this the man that took the rings out of pawn?" he said Yes, and some time after I was told there was a warrant against me; I surrendered, was tried, and acquitted last September.</p>

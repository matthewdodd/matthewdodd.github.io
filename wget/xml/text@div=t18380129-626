                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Emmett, a watchmaker and jeweller, on Holborn-hill. On the 31st of January I was in the little back parlour adjoining the shop, and saw the prisoner in the shop, with his back to the counter—he asked our lad for something, and while he was gone to get it, and our other young man was engaged with a customer, the prisoner reached out his left hand, took something, and put it into hit poc<lb></lb>ket—I went into the shop—I knew there had been three watches in a parti<lb></lb>cular place, and I saw there were but two—I said to the young man, "He has taken a watch, I am sure"—the prisoner then pushed by me and the young man went to the counter, put down a watch, and mixed it with the other two.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has your husband any part<lb></lb>ner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—our back parlour is not more than three yards from the shop—I could not hear what the prisoner asked the boy for—the prisoner was standing with his back to the counter when he took the watch, to have his eye on our young man—I am quite sure there were only two watches when I looked—there had been three, and the others were removed by the prisoner taking one—there was a small scale drawer on the counter where they were placed.</p>

                  </hi>. I was serving in the shop—I called the attention of the boy to get the prisoner the article he asked for, which was a whist<lb></lb>marker—I saw the prisoner standing with his back to the glass-case—Mrs. Emmett came into the shop and looked where the scale-drawer was—she hastily went to the door and called my assistance to her—the pri<lb></lb>soner passed by me and Mrs. Emmett very quickly, went to where the scale-drawer was, and said, "Here is the watch"—his hand had been in his great coat pocket, and he placed his hand on the counter.</p>

Q.</hi> Might not one of these watches have been <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> out of the way by his attempt to get at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not—it was on a square of glass, and there was nothing on it but the small scale drawer, and these watches were behind it—I was not able to see them behind the scale-box till I came round—I did not see them at all till I was called.</p>

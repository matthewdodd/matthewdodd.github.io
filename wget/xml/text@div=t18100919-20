            's Defence. I bought that watch of a man in Deptford. I gave him three pounds for it. I put it in my pocket and wore it afterwards; the seal I gave to my brother. I asked the man if it was his watch, he told me it was. In buying the watch he called for a pint of rum; I drank one glass of it. I left the man in the house. I went home, and never saw the man afterwards. The man said he was in distress for money, he was along with a woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Charles Lawrence said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called two witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 132). I remember seeing the prisoner on the 13th of last month—I saw him on the canal bridge at St. Paul's-terrace, Camden-town—he had nine rabbits on a stick—I passed him and went in search of another constable—I came back—I asked him the price of the rabbits—he said, "One shilling"—while I remained in conversation with him another constable came up—I then saw the prisoner put his left hand into his trousers pocket—we were standing on the foot path over the canal bridge—he drew from his pocket two parcels, one brown, and the other black—this brown stuff (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the covering of one of the parcels—I then took the prisoner in custody—he threw one parcel into the canal; the other went on to the towing path—I kept him in custody for about 20 minutes on the spot, until I got another constable—I then went in search of what I saw fall into the water, but it sank before I could get it—I then went on the other side where this brown one fell, and the witness, Wingrove, took it up and opened it in my presence—he went with me to the station, and gave it to me there—these four bad shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were in the parcel—the covering is a sort of canvas bag—it is the same that I received from Wingrove, and the same which I had seen the prisoner throw away—I never lost sight of it from the time it left his hand till it fell on the towing path.</p>

                  </hi>. On Tuesday, 13th December, I saw the last witness holding the prisoner at the foot of the canal bridge, at St. Paul's-terrace—I looked over the bridge—I did not see the prisoner throw anything—I saw on the towing path a little bag; this looks very much like the one I saw—I got over the rails and dropped down and picked it up—the constable met me through the other side of the bridge—I showed it to him and what it contained—it contained four bad shillings—I went with him to the Rtation-house and there gave it to him—the shillings were wrapped up in a bit of paper which I lost.</p>

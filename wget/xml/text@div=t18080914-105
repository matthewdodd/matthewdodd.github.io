            . - Mr. Alley. You are a constable - A. Yes. On the 31st of August, I got a warrant from Justice Anderson, at Belfound; I found Jacobs at the Bell at Hounslow, he was in the street when I took him; I asked him if he had not got Mr. Warren's watch, he would not answer me for a long time; the prosecutor was by me at the time; he at last said, I should not have it, he would go before the magistrate and deliver it to him; I then said I must search him; he then took it out of his right hand breeches pocket and showed it to Mr. Warren; Mr. Warren said it was his watch; Jacobs then put it in his pocket and said he would deliver it up before the magistrate; he said he bought it of a soldier Wroasmain was brought down from the bar racks to me; Mr. Warren asked Jacobs if that was the man that he bought it of; he said no, that was not the man, but the servant girl could tell the man; the girl was called; she said the soldier was the man that was with him; Wroasmain denied it, and said that he never had a watch. On my taking them to magistrate, they were quarrelling all the way, the soldier still denied that he ever sold him the watch; I took them before the magistrate and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. I will ask you whether Jacobs ever denied from first to last that he had the possession of the watch - A. He never denied that he had the watch, but he refused to show me the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he alledge he thought he had no right to deliver it to you, the constable, but that he ought to deliver it up to the justice - A. Yes, and before the justice he said he should deliver it directly.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Wroasmain's Defence. I went into the Bell public house to ask for one of my comrades. I could not see him; I called for a pint of beer; I went to light my pipe in the kitchen, a man stood with a watch in his hand, I asked him what o'clock it was, he told me it wanted twenty minutes to nine o'clock. I lighted my pipe and went home to the barracks and was there at roll call.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say you went in accidentally and you asked Jacobs, who stood there, what o'clock it was - A. Yes; but I could not say it was Jacobs.</p>
               <p>Jacobs' Defence. I bought this watch for a pinchback watch; in the morning I found it was a gold watch.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. You keep this Bell public house at Hounslow - Do you know the Jew - A. I have seen him at my house several times, he was a lodger at times. On the 30th of August he slept at my house. On the 31st I came down stairs at six o'clock in the morning, he stood in the passage, he asked me if the servant maid Fanny was getting up; I asked him what he wanted with her; he said he had bought a watch the night before too cheap, he would not wish to keep it; the watch was worth thirty-six guineas. A quarter master, Mr. Charters, lodged opposite, that belonged to the regiment; I called him over the way and informed him what the Jew had told me, that he bought it of one of his men; Jacobs produced the watch to the quarter master, the quarter master asked him if he knew the man that he bought it of; he said he did not, but referred him to the servant girl Fanny. Fanny told the quarter master she knew the soldier by sight, she had seen him at our house along with a farrier of the regiment. The prisoner Wroasmain was sent for to the public house; Jacob, went away from my house that morning, he said he was going to Twickenham, he would return at five o'clock in the evening; he offered to leave the watch in my possession; I refused. I was fearful of taking charge of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You advised him not to deliver it up but before a magistrate - A. I did.</p>

            . Q. Are you quarter master of the regiment - A. I am. I was sent for by Mr. Gilbert to come over to his house; Jacobs produced the watch to me as Mr. Gilbert has described; I told him that I should go up to the barracks to make enquiries about it; he was very desirous I should; he said he was going in the country; he would be back by five o'clock in the 
evening.</p>


               <p>COURT. Did you hear him offer to leave the watch with Mr. Gilbert. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was it possible for a man to take that watch, chain, and seal into his hand and not to know it was gold - A. I should suppose he must know from the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire him not to go away till the fact was enquired into - A. I did; I desired him to go to the barracks; he did not go; he said he would return in the evening and deliver it up to a justice.</p>
               <p>Jacobs called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

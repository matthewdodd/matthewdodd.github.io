I am married—on the morning of 1st February, be<lb></lb>tween 12 and 1, I was at the house, No. 6, Surbiton-street, Plaistow-marsh, Victoria Dock-road—Ellen Gentry and the prisoner were in the room along with me—the prisoner asked me whether I would sleep with him—I declined—the other girl was in the room—he had slept with her on the Tuesday night—she was in bed—he did not get into bed—previous to this he gave me a shilling to get some gin—I got a shilling's-worth of gin, partook of some myself, and he drank all the rest—he was sitting on the sofa and his knife and sheath were lying on the sofa, and he said to me, "You have taken my money"—I said, "No, I have not taken it"—he said I had, with that he began slapping me about in the face, and pushing me—I said, "You will give me two black eyes if you do like that," and 1 began to cry—he struck me with his open hand—we had a scuffle, and he said, "You did take the money"—I said, "I did not," with that I went towards the door—and he went to the sofa and got the knife out of the sheath and made an attempt to stab me—Gentry screamed as loud as she could—I said, "You are not afraid of a knife, are you?"—she said, "Yes," she was—she jumped out of bed and screamed—I said, "Oh, I am stabbed," and I went down-stairs and sat in the landlord's room—I don't remember any more till I was in bed, and the doctor attending me—the prisoner attempted to stab me in the breast, and he stabbed me in the shoulder—this was a sheath knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in No. 6, Surbiton-street, between 12 and 1 o'clock on 1st February—the last witness and the prisoner were present—I had drank two glasses of port wine with the prisoner before I went home, no more—he was not drunk, but he had been drinking—I got into bed—I could not see what took place then because there were curtains all round—I heard Bridget Donovan crying, saying, "You have given me two black eyes"—I got out of bed—she said, "Are you afraid of a knife"—I said, "Yes"—he went and asked her for his money—she said she had not got it, and he asked me for histrousers—I gave them to him, and he took them in his hand, and his knife and sheath, and he went across and tried to stab her in the breast, and she turned round and caught it on her shoulder—the prisoner had given Bridget a shilling to get him some gin—I unlocked the door, went down stain and gave the alarm—the prisoner came down stairs after me and Bridget, he ran out at the front door with his trousers in one hand and his knife in the other—he had nothing on but his shirt—I went and gave the alarm, the policeman came, and I went out with him in search of the prisoner—I found the sheath down stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in the Victoria Dock-road—on the morning of 1st February, I went to No. 6, Surbiton-street—I found the prosecutrix there, sitting in a chair very faint, and bleeding from a wound on the shoulder—it was an incised wound about one inch in breadth, and I should imagine about an inch in depth—I should imagine that would be caused by a knife similar to that which sailors use, a sheath-knife—there were some bruises about the chest and face—she has been under my care since: within the last week she has recovered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read as follows</hi>:—"I was waiting for some of my shipmates to come ashore; they did not come that night; I got drinking with these two girls, and stopped with them till lock up time; we then went to another house, and were drinking there till it was time to lock up. We then went to their home. Gentry induced me to stop there, which I did; we had some gin, whilst drinking I got my knife and cut up some tobacco, at the same time talking with Gentry who was in bed—after I had cut up my tobacco, I looked for my money, and money and purse were gone. I asked Donovan where it was; she said she knew nothing about it. I said I would search her; she resisted, and we got into a struggle, and in the struggle she came in contact with my knife, which was in my hand all the time; we were all drunk—she said 'You have cut me.' Gentry gave an alarm, and I ran out; I was frightened."</p>

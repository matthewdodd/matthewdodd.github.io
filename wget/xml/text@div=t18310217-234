On the 24th of January, I was in his shop - the prisoner came, and said he had brought some bags which my brother had ordered, and he had left some paper with my brother, which he wanted; I said, "I don't know any thing about the paper, you must wait till my brother returns;" he said he must have the paper, and pointed to a bundle of whitey-brown paper, which was in view at the time - he did not say whether my brother had paid for that paper or not; he remained about half an hour, and said he must have the paper - I still said he must wait for my brother, but he said he must have it, and I at last said,"You must take it, if it is yours," and he took it away; I had seen him frequently before, and know he is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I had brought some bags your brother had ordered, and you gave me a quire of paper to make up into pound bags size? A. He took a quire of paper, and cut some out, which he left in the shop.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ELBOROUGH. I left my sister in care of the shop - on my return she stated this circumstance; I have bought bags of the prisoner, but he had never left any bundle of paper there, and I had not ordered any bags then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you order me to bring some bags, and tell me to cut out some bags for you? A. No, not at that time - I have ordered bags.</p>

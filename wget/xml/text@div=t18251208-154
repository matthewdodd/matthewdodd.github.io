            . I am twelve years of age - I know the nature of an oath. On the day my mother was oat, I saw this woman come at six o'clock, just before my mother came home; she went into the second room, coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080059"></xptr>down from the top room, with the pan and the other things under her arm. I went and alarmed my father, who was ill in bed; he could not get up: she said if I made a noise she would knock my brains out. I got over the balustrade, and shut the street door, to keep her in - I called to Mrs. Catlin - she got into the cupboard, and was pulled out.</p>

            . I live next door. I heard an alarm about a quarter before six o'clock - I knew the poor man was ill, and his wife was out. I ran out, and saw the little boy crying in the yard - he said there was a thief in the house; I waited till two young women came, and asked them to go in with me; I called for a light, looked about the room, and saw a hand holding the cupboard door to - I pulled it open, and saw the prisoner; she said she was looking for her husband; I said that was not the place to look for a husband, and pulled her out - she said the man up stairs was her brother; the poor man, upon hearing that, got out of his bed, and came to the top of the stairs; the things then stood on the top of the first floor - she was very resolute, and we could not do any thing with her. The little boy fetched an officer.</p>

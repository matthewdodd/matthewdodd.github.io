             re-examined. I had sold a horse for 9l. 10s. to a gentleman, and sent the prisoner with it - he was to bring back the money as soon as he got it; he did not return - when I found him he said he had spent and lost the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home - there were several showers; I went in for shelter, and got a glass or two - I left the money at a public-house, and in the morning I could not find the house, not being able to read; two persons told me it was at the Feathers, in Dean-street - I went there, and asked them to eat and drink: I fell asleep, being up all night, and they drew the five sovereigns from my pocket - I walked out to look for them; I sat down, fell asleep, and then lost all - the landlord has been to my master, and explained it to him.</p>

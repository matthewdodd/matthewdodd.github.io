                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, of Lewisham—I have a small stable 100 yards from my house, in which my horse is kept—I employed Slade to look after my horse—on Saturday morning, the 13th, about 4 o'clock, I went to the stable and found the prisoners both sleeping there—I said nothing to Luxford—I told Slade if I found him sleeping there again I should lock him up—he was not entitled to sleep there—he told me he lodged at a beer-shop—he brought me the padlock key the same evening at 10.30, and told me everything was safe—about 12 o'clock I went to the stable; the padlock was gone, which I had seen safe that morning, and the door was unlocked—the only way of looking the door was by that padlock—there was no one in the stable then, and I tied the door with a chain, and went home—the padlock was unlocked when I saw it on Saturday morning, and anybody might have taken it away—about 8.30 on Sunday morning, I was called by the police, and found the stable on fire, and the horse, which had to be killed afterwards, outside the shop door—I had had a tin can of varnish in the stable for six months—I saw—it last on the Friday morning, about ten yards from the stable, and after the stable was burnt down I found the can in the place where the horse had stood, right in the middle—about three-quarters of an hour after the fire was out, the constable brought the two prisoners to me—I asked them what business they had there—Slade said that they had been there sleeping, and ran away—I gave them in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 397). On Sunday night, the 14th, about 3.30, I was on duty in Lewisham, and saw flames issuing from the Grove—I went there, and found Wheatbread's horse running down the road, and the stable on fire—a can of oil was burning in the middle of the stable—in a minute or two Coxedge came up—the stable was quite burnt down.</p>

About 3.30 on Sunday morning I saw the stable on fire and the hone outside Wheatbread's house, burnt a good deal about the neck, legs, and head—I went on to the heath, which is about three-quarters of a mile from the stable, and met the prisoners on the road—Slade was without a cap—I asked them how they accounted for being there at that time of morning—Slade said that they were going home—I asked him where his cap was—he said he had lost it coming along the road—I told them I did not feel satisfied with their answers, and should take them on suspicion of setting fire to a stable at Lewisham—going along Slade said that they were sleeping there and were awakened by the fire and ran away.</p>

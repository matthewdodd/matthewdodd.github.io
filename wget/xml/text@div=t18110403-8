               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch on the 28th of February - A. Yes, at eleven o'clock in the morning, it was my husband's watch, it was taken from a brass hook, under the mantle, in the front dining room, on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day had you seen it before - A. About eleven o'clock in the morning. I came down for a pitcher of water, and on my return I saw the prisoner coming down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. No. He was dressed in a light coloured great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you particularly remark his person so as to be able to speak to him again - A. No; it is very much like him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak to him or not - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in your room was your watch there or gone - A. It was gone. On my seeing the strange man come down I had suspicion. I told my husband. I went down and told the people of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person pursued - A. No; I went out, he was gone; I did not see any body. On the week following I saw the watch at Worship-street. The watch is here, the pawnbroker has it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the prisoner is the person - A. I have no doubt.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker's shopman, 25, City-road. This watch was pawned with me on the 28th of February, about two o'clock. I believe the person that pawned it to be the prisoner, he was drest in a light coloured great coat. I lent him twelve shillings upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you issue a duplicate - A. Yes, this is the duplicate; I got the duplicate from a private in the militia; I have had the watch ever since in my possession.</p>

            . I am a private in the Royal East London Militia. On the first Friday in March I received a duplicate of the prisoner, he asked me if I wanted to buy a watch; I told him I did; he asked me thirteen shillings for the duplicate; he said he had pawned the watch for want of money; I agreed with him for it. I advanced no money untill I had seen the watch. I took the duplicate to the pay-serjeant, and asked him to redeem it for me. This is the same duplicate that I received of the prisoner. I afterwards saw the prisoner, and told him the duplicate was stopped. He told me he would redeem it for me if I would advance him the money; he was not afraid of being stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found this duplicate in Featherstone-street, I could not afford to get the watch out; I asked this man to purchase the ticket of me. I belong to the Royal West London Militia; he told me the watch was stopped two or three days after he got the duplicate. I told him I would get the watch out if he would get the money for me.</p>

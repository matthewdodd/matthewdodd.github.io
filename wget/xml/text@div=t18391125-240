                  </hi>. I am a salt merchant, and live in Lower Thames-street. The prisoner was a servant of Mr. Worthington, who contracted to do my work—on the 21st of November he was entrusted with several parcels of salt to take to different customers, and until the night before last I believed it was one of those parcels that was stolen—but I find that to be a mistake—the salt found upon him was not to be de<lb></lb>livered to any one—it was put into the cart without my knowledge—I only know this from his having it in my cart, and having no other property in the cart but what was mine—it is impossible to swear to salt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty between eight and nine o'clock on the 21st of November, and saw the prisoner with the cart standing at the end of Mill-lane, Deptford, in company with a man named Turner, who I knew—I placed myself by the side of a wall—I saw Turner go down Church-lane to Woolf's shop—he then returned and the prisoner took the horse and cart down to Woolf's—he delivered the salt there—I followed him, and asked him if he had been delivering salt—he said yes, he had, for his mother—I took him to the station-house—he then said he had been to Woolwich, for Mr. Palmer, of Thames-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I bought half a hundred weight of salt of the pri<lb></lb>soner for a shilling, which is the wholesale price—he represented that he was a hawker of salt—that he had been from London with a load that day, he had only half a hundred-weight left, and he should feel obliged if I would take it of him, as he did not want to drag it back to London—he brought it to my door with another person, and unloaded it on a form op-posite the door, where it remained till Lovell came up and said it was stolen.</p>

               <p>Q.Whereabouts was this silk in your shop? - It lay in the window for shew. When he was secured we carried him up the street, towards the office in Bow-street, in passing our own door I took the silk into our own house; I have kept the silk ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark at this time? - It was light enough to match colours for I had been matching some at the door just before.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his features? - His features I could; I did not see his face till I took him with the silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing after you had taken him and he had escaped out of your hands, was there so much light that you should have known him? - O! yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - I apprehended it was about half afterseven, as near as I can calculate.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at home in your house besides yourself? - Mrs. Noble and the shopman; I left the prisoner with Mr. Lany while I went into the house and I came out again and went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of this piece of silk? - Six or seven pounds; it is evident by the dirt it got in the street; it has my private shop mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pane of glass out? - It did not all fall out, it is a very large square, this silk laid directly behind that square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think from the situation in which it lay, it was taken out from that window which was broke? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it a private mark in figures or in characters? - It is in characters, the mark of the shop is Cumberland; it is in my own hand writing.</p>

               <p>Court. But suppose that little crack had been loose, would it have let out such a piece of silk of that size? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a perfumer in Tavistock-street, I was standing at my own door, the same side of the way as the prosecutor, at seven doors from him; I heard the noise of some glass breaking, and I turned my head down that way and immediately heard the cry of stop thief! I perceived that man running down the middle of the street towards me, the nearer he came towards me the further I advanced in the middle of the street, in order to seize him as he came by me, but before I laid hold of him a man ran from the opposite side against him and turned him about, which turned his face to my face, I immediately seized him by his collar, and the other person seized him by the hair, he had a piece of silk hanging over his shoulder some part before and some behind, and while I held him by the collar somebody cried out, saying, he is getting something out of his pocket, I looked at his pocket, and I see his hand at his left hand pocket, out of which he produced a knife and swore that he would stab any one, if we would not let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the knife in his hand, or did he take it out of his pocket? - The prisoner took it out of his pocket, it was partly open in his pocket, only having but one hand at liberty, he could not get it quite open; I secured his arm above his elbow, in order to prevent his stabbing any person that was before him; while I held him by the elbow, a neighbour that is here forced the knife from his hand, by this time there was a number of people collected, and I left him in the hands of Mr. Lany, and Mr. Noble that was robbed, and went into my own shop, having no person in it but myself. I am very certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

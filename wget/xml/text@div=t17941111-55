               <p>Q. Was he in your house at the time the boy lost the caps? - I think he was, but going out of town did it away from my mind, but I as much believe he was, as if he was now present.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Towers; I am certain that the man was in the house all the evening, he went of an errand for my master, and returned about six o'clock, and between the hours of seven and eight o'clock he brought the parcel in; and he says, master, I have found a prize, I believe they are watchmens caps, I do not know what they are; and he left them on the table, and my master came out of the little room and looked at them, and he put the cloth about them again, and told me to put them in the cupboard and they was there several days; afterwards the prisoner asked me for them; and I gave them to him out of the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner bring them in? - Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court to Urwin, junior. Do you know what time you sent these caps out? - It was about thirty five minutes after eight, I took particular notice because it was late.</p>
               <p>Court to Allen. Do you recollect the time you received the caps? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at that time about half past eight? - It was what I was told, and it was about nine o'clock, they weretaken from me.</p>

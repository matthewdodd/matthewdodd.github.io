               <p>John Cooper. On Whit-Monday, May 29. I dress'd myself and went abroad, and returning between 1 and 2 next Morning to my Lodging at Numb. 11 in Eagle-Court, in the Strand, I knock'd once, but finding no Body answer'd, I went to a Night-Cellar hard by, I call'd for a Pint of Beer, and sitting down on a Bench, the Prisoner came and sat by me; he ask'd me if I did not know Mr. Price, and some other Persons, and so we sell into Discourse; we drank 3 hot Pints together, I paid the Reckoning 9 1/3 d. and went up; I was got about 15 or 20 Yards off when the Prisoner came up to me, said it was a fine Morning, and ask'd me to take a Walk; I agreed, and we went into Chelsea Fields, and turning up to a private Place among some Trees, he clap'd his left Hand to the right Side of my Coat, and trip'd up my Heels, and holding a Knife to me, God damn ye says he, if ye offer to speak or stir I'll kill ye; give me your Ring. I gave it him, and he put it on his own Finger; then he made me pull of my Coat and Waistcoat, and Breeches; I begg'd that he would not kill me, nor leave me naked; No, says he, I'll only change wi'ye; came pull off your Shirt, and put on mine; so he stript, and drest himself in my Cloaths, and I put on his; there was 4 1/2 d. in my Breeches, and I found 3 ha' pence in his. He ask'd me where I liv'd, and I told him. I suppose, says he, you intend to charge me with a Robbery by and by, but if you do, I'll swear you're a Sodomite, and gave me the Cloaths to let you B - r me. While we were dressing, a Man pass'd by at a little Distance, if there had been 2 Men I should have ventur'd to have call'd to them for Help, but as there was but one I was afraid. Then the Prisoner bid me come along, and I follow'd him to Piccadilly, and so to Little Windmill-street, and there I call'd to 2 Men, who took him into an Alehouse; I told them he had robb'd me, and he said that I had given him the Cloaths to let me B - him. The Men said they expected to be paid for their Day's Work, if they lost their Time about my Business; I promis'd them they should be satisfied. When we came to Justice Mercer's, he was not up, so we went to the Coach and Horses by St. Giles's Church, and waited an Hour and an half; while we were there the Prisoner wrote a Letter; to his Mother (as he said) and directed it to Numb. 20. in Colston's-Court in Drury-Lane. We went before the Justice, who ask'd me if I had charg'd a Constable with the Prisoner, I told him no; Go and do it then, says the Justice, and swear to the Things, and I'll commit him. So we went toward Tyburn-Road, into Marybone-Fields, and there the Men let the Prisoner go; What do ye do? says I. Why what would you have us do, said they, he charges you with Sodomy, and says you gave him the Cloaths on that Account. Another Man coming by at the same time, I desir'd his Assistance; but they telling him that I was a Molly, he said I ought to be hang'd, and he'd have nothing to do with me; then the Prisoner began to run, and I after him; but one of the two Men, who expected to be paid for their Day's Work, kick'd up my Heels, and as I was rising, he struck me down again; I was very much hurt, and spit Blood, so that I could not follow them, and so they all got over a Ditch and escaped; I went to my Lodgings in Eagle-Court. They were surprised to see me come home in such a shabby Dress; I told 'em what had happen'd, and describ'd the Man, and said that he sent a Letter to his Mother in Calston's-Court; O, Says one, I know him, his Name is

He told the Justice that I put my Yard into his Hand twice; and says the Justice, You had a long Knife, it seems, why did you not cut it off? I would have done so. The Prisoner said that he was not willing to expose me so much. Here are certain Ladies that belong to Brogdon Poplet, who, I suppose, have abundance to say for the Prisoner.</p>

            , Taylor. On the 29th of May, in the Evening, I was drinking with Mr. Mead at the King's-Arms by Leicester-Fields when the Prosecutor came in, dress'd in a black Coat, a white Waistcoat, and black Breeches; he sat down and drank, and then paid his Reckoning, and went away. Next Morning I saw Mr. Mead again, he said he had met the Prosecutor in a dirty ragged Suit of Cloaths, and a speckled Shirt, and never set his Eyes on a Man so metamorphos'd. But how came he in that Condition? says I, Why it seems he has been robb'd this Morning, says he, by one Gordon, a Leather-breahes Maker. I pared with Mr. Mead as I was going by Turnstile in Holbourn, the Prisoner pull'd me by the Coat, and said, How d'ye do? what don't ye know me? and indeed I hardly did know him in that Dress. What is it you, Mr. Gordon? says I, why I heard you was dead. Dead! says he, who told you so? Why Cooper, says I, he drank with me last Night. Cooper is a great Rouge, says he; What has be done ? says I; He gave me these Cloaths this Morning, says he; And is he a Rouge for that? says I; No, says he, but he pretends to get 'em again by Force. Hark ye, Tom, says I, as you have a Soul to be sov'd, I fancy you'll come to be hang'd; for he has sworn a Robbery against you. Has he really done it? says he; for God's Sake help me to make it up, I'll go and get 3 Guineas of my Uncle in the Temple, and meet you at the Bell and Horse-shoe in Holborn. I told the Prosecutor of this, and he went with me, but we could find no such Sign as the Bell and Horse-shoe.</p>

            . Between 9 and 10 on Tuesday Night I was sent for to the Two Sugar-Loaves in Drury-Lane; the Prosecutor gave me a Warrant against the Prisoner; we went before Justice Newton ; the Justice having heard the Prosecutor's Charge, ask'd the Prisoner what he had to say for himself? Why, says the Prisoner, he laid his privy Rarts in my Hand, and offer'd to B - me. Then says Mr. Newton, You had better take him before Justice Giffard toMorrow, he knows more of the Matter, for I see it is his Warrant. So the Prisoner was sent to the Round-house.</p>

               <p>I was lock'd out, and went to Mrs. Holder's Night-Cellar; the Prosecutor came and sat by me, and ask'd me to drink, I thought I had seen him before; we fell into Discourse, and had 3 hot Pints of Gin and Ale between us; about 4 in the Morning he ask'd me to take a Walk; we went into Chelsea Fields, and coming among some Trees and Hedges, he kiss'd me, and put his privy Parts into my Hand; I ask'd him what he meant by that, and told him I would expose him; he begg'd me not to do it, and said he would make me amends. I ask'd him what amends? He said he would give me all his Cloaths, if I would accept of them, and so we agreed, and chang'd Cloaths. After this, I ask'd him to go into the White-Horse by Hyde-Park, but he said he would not, for he had Relations there, and did not care to expose himself in that Dress. We went farther, and I would have gone into another House, but he made the same Excuse: Then we came to Little Windmill-street, where we found a Man knocking at an Alehouse Door; we thought to have gone in there, but it being early the People would not get up, and so we went to the White-Hart in Knaves-Acre ; there he charg'd me with a Robbery, and I charg'd him with an Attempt to commit Sodomy. We went before Justice Mercer, who order'd us to get a Constable, and in going along, the Prosecutor raised a Mob, and squall'd as I had been murdering him, so that I was glad to get away. He afterwards met me again as I was talking with my Master in Drury-Lane, and carry'd me to Mr. Paplet's.</p>

Why in the way of Sodomity, whatever that is; so says the Princess, If you don't give me my Cloaths again, I'll swear a Robbery against you; but if you'll let me have them, I'll be easy. No, you Villain, you shan't, says the Prisoner. Next Day I went to Mr. Stringer the Pawn-broker's, facing Vinegar-yard in Drury-Lane; I wash for him, and there I saw the Princess a pawning her Shirt; O Princess! says I, are you there? You will be very fine by and by; you will have no Occasion to pawn your Linen, when you get the Rewa rd for hanging

            . I keep the Two Sugar-Loaves in Drury-Lane, the Prisoner and the Princess came into my House, and the Princess charg'd the Prisoner with taking her Cloaths, and the Prisoner call'd her Villain, and said she gave 'em to him. I have known her Highness a pretty while, she us'd to come to my House from Mr. Tull, to enquire after some Gentlemen of no very good Character; I have seen her several times in Women's Cloaths, she commonly us'd to wear a white Gown, and a scarlet Cloak, with her Hair frizzled and curl'd all round her Forehead; and then she would so flutter her Fan, and make such fine Curt ies, that you would not have known her from a Woman: She takes great Delight in Balls and Masquerades, and always chuses to appear at them in a Female Dress, that she may have the Satisfaction of dancing with fine Gentlemen. Her Highness lives with Mr. Tull in Eagle-Court in the Strand, and calls him her Master, because she was Nurse to him and his Wife when they were both in a Salivation; but the Princess is rather Mr. Tull's Friend, than his domestick Servant. I never heard that she had any other Name than the Princess Sraphina.</p>

            . I was standing at the End of our Court in Drury-Lane, and seeing the Prisoner coming along with a Crowd, Tom! says I, what's the Matter? Why, says he, pointing to the Princess, this Man gave me his Cloaths to let him B - r me, and now he charges me with a Robbery. I know the Princess very well, she goes a Nursing sometimes: She nurs'd his Master Tull and his Wife in their Salivation, and several others; and I was told that he was dress'd in Woman's Cloaths at the last Masquerade ( Ridotto

            . I was trying on a Suit of Red Damask at my Mantua-maker's in the Strand, when the Princess Seraphina came up, and told me the Suit look'd mighty pretty. I wish, says he, you would lend 'em me for a Night, to go to Mrs. Green's in Nottingham-Court, by the Seven Dials, for I am to meet some fine Gentlemen there. Why, says I, can't Mrs. Green furnish you? Yes, says he, she lends me a Velvet Scarf and a Gold Watch sometimes. He used to be but meanly dress'd, as to Men's Cloaths, but he came lately to my Mantua-maker's, in a handsome Black Suit, to invite a Gentlewoman to drink Tea with Mrs. Tull. I ask'd him how he came to be so well Rigg'd? And he told me his Mother had lately sold the Reversion of a House; And now, says he, I'll go and take a Walk in the Park, and shew my self. Soon after this, my Maid told me that her Highness was robb'd by a Man in a Sailor's Habit, who had changed Cloaths with him. And so next Morning I sent for him. Lord, Princess! says I, you are vastly alter'd. Ay, Madam, says he, I have been robb'd, but I shall get the Reward for hanging the Rogue. Another Time he comes to me, and says, Lord, Madam, I must ask your Pardon, I was at your Mantua-maker's Yesterday, and dress'd my Head in your Lac'd Pinners, and I would sain have borrow'd them to have gone to the Ridotto at Vauxhall last Night, but I cou'd not persuade her to lend 'em me; but however she sent me your Callimanco Gown and Madam Nuttal's Mob, and one of her Smocks, and so I went thither to pick up some Gentlemen to Dance. And did you make a good Hand of it, Princess? says I. No, Madam, says be, I pick'd up two Men, who had no Money, but however they proved to be my old Acquaintance, and very good Gentlewomen they were, One of them has been transported for counterfeiting Masquerade Tickets; and t'other went to the Masquerade in a Velvet Domine, and pick'd up an old Gentleman, and went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050022"></xptr> to Bed with him, but as soon as the old Fellow found that he had got a Man by his Side, he cry'd out, Murder.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Jones. I saw the Princess Seraphina standing at Mr. Pople's Door. What, have you been robb'd, Princess? says I, Has Tom Gordon stripp'd your Highness stark naked? An impudent Rogue! And yet, Ma'm, I think your Highness had better make it up with him, than expose yourself, for some say it was only an Exchange. Why, sysle, at first I would have made it up, and taken my Cloaths again, but now it's too late, and I must prosecute, for those that were concerned in taking him up, expect their Share in the Reward, and won't let me drop the Prosecution.</p>

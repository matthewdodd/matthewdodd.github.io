                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I am a sailor on board a vessel lying in St. Katharine's Docks. On Friday, 14th June, the prisoner came on board about two o'clock—he represented himself as a pilot, and went into the forecastle—a man came on board with razors; I bought some—I went up from the forecastle, leaving the prisoner there—I went down again in four or five minutes, and he was gone, and I missed a sovereign, two half-crowns, and three shillings, which had been in my chest on my clothes—my chest was open.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you seen the prisoner before that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know that he came by appointment about some cigars—when he went first down into the forecastle, all the crew were there—the razor-man went on shore, and the crew went to work—I did not go on shore with the prisoner—I did not drink with the prisoner in a public-house—I gave him into custody about six o'clock on Saturday; I did not see him before—I did not say that cigars were considered as money in my country—none of the crew are here—I did not send any person to the prisoner to get any money from him—when I came on deck and left the prisoner in the fore<lb></lb>castle, some of the crew were on the deck, and some aloft.</p>

                  </hi>. I went on board the ship on the Friday afternoon—I sold some razors to the prosecutor; he paid me a half-crown-piece for them, which he took out of the chest—he and his shipmates were there—the prisoner came down while I was there; he looked at the razors and asked if they were good—when I had got my money, he asked me if I had done, and he told me to go on deck—I went, leaving no one in the forecastle but the prisoner and the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames-policeman.,</hi> 73) I took the prisoner—I told him he was charged with stealing a sovereign and some foreign coins from a brig in St. Katharine's Docks—he said, "I know nothing about it, Frazer, but I will go with you"—I brought him out, and made motions to the pro<lb></lb>secutor "Is this the man?"—he said, "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon practising in London—I knew the deceased Mrs. Price—she came to the hospital on 16th November last year—I examined her on the 25th, and found she was suffering from cancer and fistula—she remained in the hospital for about a week, and eventually became an out patient for about three months—I described her disease to her as a disease of the rectum—on 22d March I visited her at the prisoner's request—he called on me—I prescribed for her then—about 16th July he called on me and I saw her again—she was then suffering very severely from seven different sinuses—she had become very much worse—through those sinuses feculent matter escaped; the cancer entirely prevented any escape through the natural passage, so that everything came through the sinuses, and also through the front part—she was very weak and suffering intensely—a nurse was attending her at the time—I prescribed for her tonics and sedatives, and from what passed between as (not in the prisoner's presence) I gave her money to buy medicine and wine—I said that she required rest and proper nourishing food—I did not give those directions to the prisoner—I never saw him after he called at my house till I saw him at his own house in the afternoon, and then he went down stairs directly, and I never saw him afterwards—he seemed to be half tipsy then—I continued to attend her till 5th August, when I went to the North—that was my last visit—she was then sinking, suffering intense pain—I suggested a surgical operation to her, and she said she did not wish to live another day—she gave no reason for that—she did not connect that wish with any cause that I remember—she was suffering intensely—I never saw a worse case of fistula and cancer combined—rest was most essential in her case—it could not have restored her; it was very necessary for her; it would be one of the means of prolonging life—nourishing food was highly necessary, and stimulants—the fact of her rest being frequently interrupted would have a tendency to cause her to die sooner than she otherwise might have done—I speak positively to that, in her condition—I say the same with regard to her being deprived of nourishing food and stimulants.</p>

               <p>not expect she would live—she was very low—she was not dying then, she was sinking—I could not, on 5th August, form a notion as to the length of time she would live—she had no symptoms of immediate dissolution; she was sinking; I mean getting weaker and weaker—there were no symptom of sinking rapidly—as far as I can remember, I should have expected she would live about a fortnight or three weeks from 5th August—she died on the 22d—that would be between a fortnight and three weeks—I think she would have died in a fortnight or three weeks if she bad been treated as well as she could have been—if I had heard nothing of any treatment I should not have been surprised to hear of her death on 20th August—the disease was quite sufficient to account for death at that time—if she had had proper treatment, rest, and nourishment after 5th August, she would have lived longer; I have no doubt about that; I mean a proper amount of nourishment—she ought to have had, possibly, six or eight glasses of wine a day—if she had been in the hospital I should have ordered that—she ought to have had nourishing food of every kind, anything she could have taken—I should have given her brandy also—I think then she would certainly have lived longer; I am not repaired to say how much longer; longer than a couple of days, I should think—I believe her life might have been prolonged for a week if she had bad nourishing food after 5th August, but if she had had it for some time before, it might have been prolonged for some months—she complained of very great pain—she described it as if a burning coal was under her flesh, that she could get no rest, she was in perfect agony—it must have been so, and there was no escape from it, except by a very severe operation, which I suggested—the cancer alone would not have caused that amount of pain; it was its combination with the other—the prisoner came to my house once in March and once in July—he appeared anxious about his wife, and requested me to come and see her—the second time he said she was much worse—he seemed to be very anxious about her—she might have remained in the hospital when I examined her in November, but she wished to go back to her children—if the prisoner had brought her back in July, she might have been taken in, and provided for there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If she had been treated in the way you directed in July, would you have expected to find her in so sinking a condition on 5th August? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can hardly answer that question—from the disease itself, I should not have expected her to be in that sinking state—nothing could have been worse than her state was—the disease was as bad as it could be—if my directions had been complied with, I should not have expected to find her in so sinking and exhausted a condition—if she had had nourishing food and stimulants from March, I should have expected her to live two or three months longer—if my directions had been fully carried out from March, I should have expected that, but not from July—wine would have been necessary—that had been necessary for some months.</p>

               <p>dying, and would have died under any circumstances, but her death was accelerated by the treatment—she would not have died so soon if she had been properly treated; that is my judgment.</p>

                  </hi>. I attended the prisoner's wife as nurse for six weeks, up to three weeks before her death—she was in a very sickly state during that time—she had not enough to eat at all times—Dr. Gowland called there once, and Mr. and Mrs. Turner—wine was left with her—she did not always get it; the prisoner would take it from her—I have seen him come in and drink it out of the bottle—I have spoken to him about it, and told him he ought not to drink it, as it was brought for his wife—I do not know that he made me any answer—I think he did that more than once—he was generally sober when he did so—there had been mutton chops left for Mrs. Price, and a little ham had been brought occasionally by Mrs. Turner, her brother's wife, and I think a little salmon was brought once—she ate the chops and ham—she always got the food that was left—there was not very much for her, but what was left for her she generally had—I have often asked the prisoner for money to get oysters, as Mrs. Price was obliged to take them, and very often when he has had it he has refused it to her—he used to say 'he wanted it for something else—he sometimes gave it me—she was ordered bitter ale, and I have repeatedly asked him for money for that, and he has not given it to me—he has often had beer and ale himself in her room—he has sent to the public-house for it, and drank it all himself—i have asked him for something for dinner, and he has said he had not got it—she had her dinner, if I provided it for her—it was provided by somebody, and he would pay me again—she has repeatedly been obliged to go without dinner;—there was none in the house, and no money to get it—I have asked him for money at these times—sometimes he might be in drink—she was very often obliged to go to bed without supper, and had nothing to eat—I have spoken to him about that, and I have many times told him she was sinking for want of something, and he has said she was always in want; it was more than he thought was necessary for her to take—one week he gave his wife 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to support us both for a week—I cannot say when that was—it was during the six weeks I was there—she was very often without dinner—that made her still more exhausted and sinking—in her weak state she wanted something every half-hour, and could not get it—on one occasion he took out a five shilling-piece, and asked her if she would like to have it—she said she would, and he said he would see her—first—that was during the six weeks, I could not say to the day—I believe she wanted the money to get some dinner—she was in bed at the time—she went without dinner that time—she did not sleep well at nights—sometimes she would go to sleep a little in the day—she was very much disturbed in her sleep—the prisoner would often come in and wake her up when she was taking a little rest, and I used to beg him to let her be quiet, and he would not—he would come in and talk to her and make a noise in the room that would disturb any one that was ill—he would talk about some</p>

I am a brother of the deceased—she died at the latter end of August—I was in the habit of seeing her several weeks before her decease; sometimes two or three times a week, up to within a few days of her death—the prisoner was generally in the room at the time—I generally went of an evening—she said he was killing her by inches; that he would not let her have sufficient food, nor would he allow her to have rest by night or by day—I told him he knew she was dying, and he ought to let her have a little rest, but he refused to leave the room—I can't recollect the answer that he did make, but it was a direct refusal to go away—he used to say it was his own house, and he might do as he liked in it—he used to go from one side of the bed to the other more like an insane man than a reasonable one—he was not sober then—he was not always drunk when I saw him in the room—he was violent, in this respect, that he refused to go away, although the inducement I held out to him was that it would give her a little rest—his wages were about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I believe he had no other resource than the wages he earned at the printing establishment—he did not pay the rent of the house; his mother generally paid it for him—she was exceedingly kind to him, and he never applied to her without receiving a mother's response—she sent him money—I paid the nurses; that is, they were generally paid by me—his mother wished to contribute towards the expense of the nurses; most likely it was sent up—I did not pay it in fall—I frequently paid them with my own hand; when I did not, I think they were paid by cheque from his mother—my wife frequently sent her articles of food and wine during her last illness—I spoke to the prisoner about it when I was told that he would not allow her to have them—I told him he was an inhuman monster for ill-using his wife in the way he did—that was when I have been told by her that he would not allow her to have it—she told me that in his presence—her principal complaint was begging me for God's sake to take him away; that he would not allow her to have rest night or day, and that he abused her in the most shocking manner—she said he was starving her to death—I can't say whether that was said in his presence; he was generally present, I could not get him out of the room, but I did not make any note, because it was not my intention to bring these things before the public—I said, "It is most inhuman of you to use your wife in the way you have"—I can't say that I said anything to him about her not having sufficient food, because I had myself supplied her with food sufficient—I don't think I said anything in his presence about her not having it—I complained to him generally of his treatment—he would turn aside and take no notice.</p>

I was called in on the 21st August—the deceased died about 24 hours afterwards—I found her in a dying state—I was made acquainted with the disease from what she was suffering—I pre<lb></lb>scribed some remedies for her—I made a post mortem examination on the morning of the 22d—in my judgment the cause of death was exhaustion caused by disease—I have heard the evidence that has been given—in my opinion she died from exhaustion arising from natural causes; but I believe from the evidence that her death was accelerated by the inhuman treatment she was subject to, the disturbing of her rest, and keeping away food and stimulants—I think if she had had rest and sufficient food, she would not have died so soon—I think the disturbance of her rest that she was subject to, would alone accelerate her death; even supposing she had sufficient food, the disturbance of her peace of mind from want of rest was calculated to accelerate death—whether it did so is a matter of theory.</p>

            . I am a constable for the West-India merchants. On the 16th of June a watchman told me, the prisoner had taken some sugar out of a cask; I searched him, and took from him above five pounds weight of sugar. I asked how he came by it; he said, the cooper that was making the cask fast gave it him. I called the cooper and asked him about it; he said he had not, but had ordered him to go away from the casks several times.</p>

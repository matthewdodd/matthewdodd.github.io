            , Jun. The prisoner came into the shop to inquire the price of a seal, about four o'clock. I told her 1s. 6d.; she said it was too much, and went away. She was brought into the shop, about eight o'clock, by Hatfield. I cannot say whether I sold the seal or not.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was going along Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner and several others looking at the seal; the prisoner said, she bought it at a shop in Brick-lane. I took her there; she went very willingly. The prosecutor said it was his property, and that he had not sold it. The prisoner then said, she had picked it up. She afterwards said, she had taken it, and was sorry for it.</p>

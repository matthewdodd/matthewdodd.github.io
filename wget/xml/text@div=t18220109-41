            . I am a compositor. On the 25th of December I saw the prisoner at the King's Head tap, Old Change. He enquired for Tommy, who was a carman. I said he had been there, and had left, but would return shortly. Previous to his coming there, he passed a base half-crown for a pint of porter. I took it without looking particularly at it. I was in care of the tap; it was quite a new half-crown. I put it in my pocket, supposing it good. Soon after Tommy came; they complained to each other for being kept in waiting; they went into the back parlour, and in consequence of information, I looked at the half-crown, and found it was bad. I had no others but quite old ones - I immediately went into the parlour with it in my hand, and said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Why do you come here smashing, you ought to have gone further, as you know I am an officer." Sadler, who is Tommy, declared his innocence. As soon as I entered the room, I saw a quantity of base silver on the table in a paper - I seized it. and dropped the half-crown; there was nothing in the room before they went in - on the table, I found a bag with 5 l. worth of shillings, six pences, and half-crowns, all counterfeit. I took Sadler to the Compter, and found a bad half-crown and a shilling on him in a bag; and on the prisoner, I found a paper of sixpences, with paper round every one, of the same die as those on the table; and the half-crown was the same die as them on the table. There were seventeen sixpences in the paper, and three loose in his pocket.</p>

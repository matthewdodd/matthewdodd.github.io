                  </persName>. I am fifteen years old, and live with my parents in Bird-street, Lambeth. On 27th April, I was in my master's shop in Union-street, Borough—the prisoner came in shout 9 o'clock, and asked to be directed to Leman-street—he was rather, tipsy—there were a number of boys outside the door; I had not seen them do anything to him before he came in, but as he went out of the shop tome of them pushed him and one of them laid down at hit feet to throw him down—he had a cloak on, which was folded round one arm—I saw him shift something from his right side, what it was I cannot say, but some fire-arm went off directly afterwards—I could not see where his right hand was then; I was at the side of him, but did not notice—there was a boy in front of him, who shifted his head on one side when the pistol went off—I saw a woman crossing the street, she came in a line with the prisoner and the boy, but the boy was nearest to the prisoner—the woman appeared to be hurt, and as if she was going to die—they brought her into our shop, and afterwards she was taken to the station—the boy had not been teasing the prisoner, for a minute before I saw him shift his hand, I saw one on one side of him, and one on the other, and one attempted to throw him down—that made him angry.</p>

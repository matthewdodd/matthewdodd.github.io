            . I live at No. 21, Old-buildings, Lincoln's Inn, on the same landing-place with Mr. Quin. On Sunday, the 11th of April, I had been in my chambers the greatest part of the day. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a noise at my door, or on the landing-place, like some one forcing or wrenching my outer door, which was shut; I thought it was some person coming in to see if anybody was there. In a few minutes I went to the door, looked through the letter-hole, and saw the prisoner at the door, dressed in a brown coat and nankeen pantaloons - he was within three feet of the door, and had a stick in his hand - I opened the door; he had then got about the third step going down - the door is close to the steps. I asked him what he wanted? he said he wanted Mr. Jordan (there is a gentleman of that name). I said,</p>
               <p>"What! who?" he then said Mr. Gardiner.</p>
               <p>"I said,</p>
               <p>"What, on a Sunday!" he made no further answer. As soon as he went down, I shut the door, and looked through a little window which commands a view of the court, and saw him go through the passage by the Hall. I examined my door, and observed marks of an instrument on it, as if it had been attempted to be broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this did you hear somebody on the stair-case again? In about a quarter of an hour I heard somebody on the staircase, which turned out to be Mr. Quin's laundress. I went out to her, and found Mr. Quin's door broken, and very much damaged. I asked her if any one had attempted the chambers? At that moment she heard a noise in the chambers, and cried out that she heard them, and they were getting out on the leads - she had opened Mr. Quin's outer door, and was going up to his inner door. She came down, and went for her husband; I remained on the staircase - nobody passed me down stairs before she returned, which was in about five minutes; I then went into the chambers, and found a stick at the side of the bottom door. Every thing was pulled out on the the floor in great confusion. It is a similar stick to that I saw the prisoner with. I am certain he is the man I saw at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I am not a lawyer. The noise ceased the moment I opened my inner door. My chambers are quite separate from Mr. Quin's.</p>

            . I am laundress to Mr. Quin, whose chambers are at No. 21, Old-square, Lincoln's Inn - they are the upper chambers, and have two doors. After opening the outer doors; there is a flight of stairs to go up to the inner door. Mr. Quin went out about eleven o'clock in the morning, I remained at the chambers till one, and then left. Everything was safe and in order - I locked them up, and locked the inner door. I returned a little after five o'clock, and saw Mr. Milbourne. I put the key into Mr. Quin's outer door, but found it already unlocked; the lock was not taken off, but the door was open. I found a stick inside the door, it did not belong to Mr. Quin, and was not there when I left at one o'clock. I went up the stairs, found the inner door ajar, all the drawers open, and the things laying on the floor. There were shirts, and sheets off the bed, a great-coat, and also a pair of clean sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing in the chambers - A. The moment I spoke to Mr. Milbourne, I heard footsteps up stairs in the chambers - I ran down directly to fetch my husband. The catch of the latch of the inner door was forced off. There is a window opens from the chambers on to the leads - I do not know whether I left it shut, but there was an iron bar over it; when I got there the window was open, and the iron bar taken down. Anybody could get out, and get on the leads of Lincoln's Inn. Mr. Quin sleeps in the chambers.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at No. 48, Southampton-buildings. On Sunday, the 11th of April, I met Mrs. Gough making an alarm in Chancery-lane. I immediately crossed into Lincoln's Inn, and looking up to the top of the chambers, I saw the prisoner on the cock-loft of No. 21 or 22, dressed in a dark snuff-coloured coat and nankeen trowsers. I watched him until he got over No. 24, then lost sight of him. I saw him soon afterwards in custody - he is the man.</p>

The window which leads to the leads was open, the bar taken down, and the padlock which fastened it, was forced off. I got out, and passing over the roofs of No. 22 and 23, I saw the prisoner behind the chimney of No. 24. I made up to the chimney - there is a round tower there; he was not there - he was gone. I went straight on as far as the Baptist chambers, kept there and sent for assistance, as I knew he must pass me - Oakes and Ackhurst came. I sent them down Chancery-lane into the Baptist chambers, and found the prisoner concealed in the cock-loft; I saw him coming down the steps of the cock-loft - he is the man that I saw.</p>

I called to Ackhurst for a light, which came; I opened the trap-door, and found the prisoner in the loft, at the further end, drawing himself up as close as he could to the tiles. We asked him to come out? he said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make any alarm, and I will go with you quietly enough" - nobody else was on the roof.</p>

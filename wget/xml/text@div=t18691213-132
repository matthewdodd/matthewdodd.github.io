                  </hi>. I am barmaid to Mr. Guyer, at the Edinboro Castle, Woolwich—previous to the 19th November a great many things had been missed from the house, and on that night I sat up—I law the house fastened up by Mr. Guyer at a little after 11 o'clock—I then went up to the club-room on the first floor in the front of the house—I remained there for sometime—about 2.20 I saw a man comtng from the dockyard towards the house—he came in front of the house, and I saw it was the prisoner—I knew him before—he was potman to Mr. Guyer about eight months ago—I watched him, and saw him go round towards the stable gate—I then went into a back bedroom and waited two or three seconds, and then I saw his body rising up on the dust bin, and from there he climbed on to the waterbutt—over the waterbutt there is a window, opening like a door; and after fumbling for a little while, his body disappeared through the window—I went down stairs and gave the alarm to Mr. Guyer, and the police were fetched in—we went outside, and found the prisoner crouched in a corner.</p>

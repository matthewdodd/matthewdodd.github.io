               <p>I live in a court in the Minories and sell saloop, which I have done many years: on the 15th of last month as I was going with my faloop between six and seven in the morning, I saw the prisoner take some clover-seed out of a bag upon the keys; I saw him fill his side-pockets with it and his hat; the seed was in bags, and one of the bags was cut; I did not see him cut the bag, but I saw him take it out; there were other people there, but no one was near him but myself; I have often seen him upon the keys; I am positive to his person.</p>

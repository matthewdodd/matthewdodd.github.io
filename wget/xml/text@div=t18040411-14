               <p>Q. Do you reside at Hackney? - A. I own a house at Hackney: On Sunday, the 19th of February, about half after twelve at noon, I was walking in the fields, over what they call <placeName id="t18040411-14-crimeloc81">the Hide, behind Clapton</placeName>

               <p>Q. Look at him? - A. I am very sure he is the man; he passed me upon what is called the Hide, and afterwards came back again; he passed me twice.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you had an opportunity of observing his person? - A. Certainly; when he passed me I was in what they call Love-lane; the prisoner went down Love-lane; I went very gently along down there; it is a long narrow walk, but about the middle of it there is a sort of elbow that you can neither see the top nor the bottom; when I got to that elbow he popped out upon me, and collared me; he got me fast hold, and asked me for my money.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he laid hold of you by the collar had he any thing in the other hand? - A. He pulled out a long knife, a long carving knife, which he held at my breast; he asked me for my money, and I gave it him in a little leather purse; there was only five shillings and sixpence, and an Indian piece; then he asked me for my watch; I pulled my watch out and gave it him; he then desired I would go: now, says he, you go that way; I did; I could not help looking back, and he said go on; I went on a little farther and looked back again; I found he was gone, and I run after him as fast as I could; I saw at a distance a person coming along, and I called out I am robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. When you see the watch again shall you be able to know it? - A. Yes; there is a seal with S. B. and another seal with three heads upon it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. In Cold-bath lane, Church-street, Hackney: I heard the prosecutor call out, either I am robbed, or he has robbed me, pointing with his stick, but I could not see to whom he was pointing it; I instantly turned round, and met the prisoner running.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he point his stick in a direction which led to the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. And in consequence of that you saw the prisoner running? - A. Yes, I ran after him, and he was out of my sight about a minute, or a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same man who got into your sight again afterwards? - A. Yes, I pursued him; the prisoner turned round and looked at me; I still kept running after him, and he was out of my sight again; when I got into Clapton I got information of the prisoner, and ran into Pound-lane; I saw him run across the field to the right, and I pursued him; he then wheeled to the left, and ran into Clapton again; then he took a tack to the left as if he was coming to Hackney; I called out stop thief, and he jumped over some low paling to the left.</p>

               <p>Q. Before he jumped over, did you observe him do any thing? - A. No, he then ran across the field to some high paling, and then I saw him stoop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him do any thing? - A. I cannot say I did; he stooped as if he was laying something upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stoop at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been running all the time you have been describing? - A. Yes; he then rose up again and got over the high paling; I got over the paling, and saw a young man of the name of Thurling had got hold of the prisoner; he heard me call out stop thief; he was then taken to Hackney-cage, and searched; there was none of the property found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afterwards present when any of the property was found? - A. Yes; I went up to the high paling where I saw the prisoner stoop, I looked down and saw the watch lying there; I took the watch up, and found a little leather bag underneath where the watch laid; I took the property to Mr. Brown, in Hackney-grove, and he identified it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. (To Brown). Was that watch and the leather bag which the witness brought to your house, the same that the prisoner had robbed you of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had shown it to Brown what did you do with it? - A. I carried it home; I took it to Worship-street the next day; it was sealed up and delivered to me. (Produces the property).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Brown). Is that your watch? - A. Yes, I am sure it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag? - A. This is what I gave him; the seals are my seals.</p>

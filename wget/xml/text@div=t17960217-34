               <p>Q.How came you to observe the sheep? - A. Because I used to look after them every day, and I think there were twenty in the first lot, before any was drafted off, that were marked, and nine in the other lot; those twenty were reddled almost all over more so than those nine were; Mr. Spair. and I, and his little boy, drawed ten of them away sometime before; I cannot say how long, it is sometime back; and then Mr. Spain sent for the remainder of that lot, and never let me know; and then there were two of these nine taken away; I sent Mr. Spain word, and he came and looked after them, but could not find them; and then, the 5th of this month, the seven were fetched away; I saw them in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there then? - A. Seven out of the nine.</p>

               <p>My father is a sheep salesman, in Smithfield-market; as I was going to market on Friday night, the 5th, about a quarter after six, I met a man with seven sheep of the Southdown kind, on Paddington-hill, just on this side the Red-lion, Westbourngreen, in the Harrow-road; he was a tall thin man, with a light coloured coat, very much of the appearance of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the sheep marked? - A. I don't know the mark, there was a reddle along the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any mark at all? - A. No; he was driving them up the hill very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I think he has very much the appearance of the man.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It was so dark you could not see the marks of the sheep, nor the countenance of the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p> - FLEMING sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labouring man, the prisoner came to my dwelling-house on the 5th, in the evening, in North-Cumberland-mews, Mary-le-bonne parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come to you? - A. I was in bed, it was about seven or eight o'clock, as near as I can tell; he asked my wife if I could go to market the next morning with some sheep; my wife said I was not satisfied with what I went with before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner? - A. At six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge that he came the over-night? - A. Yes; I heard him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you hear what he came about? - A. No; I cannot say I heard what he said; he left word he would come the next morning at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call the next morning at four o'clock? - A. No; at six.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed? - A. I opened the window and looked out, and he asked me if I could go to market for him; he said my wife seemed to signify I thought it was too little money to go for; he said, he would give me 6d. more; I came down and harnessed the horse, and put it to the cart, and went along with him; I went to St. George's-row, and there we put seven skins in first, some straw over them, and put in six carcases; we came to Newgate-market; the prisoner carried the sheep into the market, and I stood with the cart; the seven skins I took to the skin-market, the top of St. John's-street; some the prisoner pulled out, and some I threw out; he drew the skins into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170062"></xptr>the yard by the legs, four one time, and three the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Into whose yard? - A. Mr. Harwood's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Harwood there? - A. I did not see him, for I never got out of the cart at all, and then we both went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know exactly how many he had alive? - A. I cannot exactly say; he asked me if I would have any thing to drink for my trouble, which I refused; I came away, and left him in the place where he was at work.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they your property? - A. Yes; they had my mark on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these two skins were the skins of two of your sheep? - A. Yes; I am sure of it.</p>

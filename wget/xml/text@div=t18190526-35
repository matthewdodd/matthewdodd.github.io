On the 3d of May, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came into my shop, I went down to the bakehouse with him to look for half a crown, which he said he had dropped - we could not find it. In looking for it he put the candle out, I went up to get another light, leaving him in the bakehouse - my watch hung there then; before I returned with the light he came up stairs, saying he had not found it, but if I found it I could give it to him. I went down stairs, missed my watch, and ran up directly - he had then got out of the shop, and was running away, I pursued, calling Stop thief! a man attempted to stop him, he pushed by him, but was secured without my losing sight of him. I am certain he is the man. He was brought back, and the officer searched him in the back room. We found the watch on a sack of raspins close to where he stood.</p>

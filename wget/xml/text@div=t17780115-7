I have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150011"></xptr> drawer in the counter with four partitions, which I use as a till. On the 31st of December, between seven and eight in the evening I missed the till; I had seen it about an hour before; I was down in the kitchen; there was no one in the shop at the time. I bolted the lower part of the door (the door is divided), but I am not sure that I bolted the upper part; the door was shut; I had brought down three guineas, and put it in the till in a letter, just before. When I came up stairs the till was taken away: there had been a dozen pen-knives I had to dispose of in the drawer; I believe the children had had two out; there was likewise an old knife that was very remarkable, and which I can swear to; I have had it about six years. When I missed the drawer, two young men came in, and asked me if I had been robbed? I said I had lost my till. They said I must go directly with them to Justice Gretton's. My husband went that night; I went the next day and saw the things.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I took the prisoner up the last day of the old year at a puppet-show, between eight and nine at night. From the information of the master of the puppet-show to the Justice, that they had changed a guinea to see the show, and he thought they could not come honestly by it. I took them there; there were three of them; one was admitted an evidence, but we cannot find him now. This remarkable knife and four others, I found in Harvey's pocket; I found in his pocket a guinea and eighteen good and two bad shillings; when I charged them with it they denied it; the paper the knives were wrapped up in, and this letter (producing it), were found in the puppet-show room.</p>
               <p>[The knife was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.]</p>
